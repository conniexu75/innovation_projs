https://openalex.org/W2102884982,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate cell growth and differentiation by governing chromatin structure and repressing the activity of specific transcription factors. We showed previously that HDAC9 acts as a negative regulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and skeletal muscle differentiation. Here we report that HDAC4, which is expressed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, regulates chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral bone formation by interacting with and inhibiting the activity of Runx2, a transcription factor necessary for chondrocyte hypertrophy. HDAC4-null mice display premature ossification of developing bones due to ectopic and early onset chondrocyte hypertrophy, mimicking the phenotype that results from constitutive Runx2 expression in chondrocytes. Conversely, overexpression of HDAC4 in proliferating chondrocytes in vivo inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy and differentiation, mimicking a Runx2 loss-of-function phenotype. These results establish HDAC4 as a central regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy and skeletogenesis and suggest general roles for class II HDACs in the control of cellular hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2068006559,"During inflammation, NF-kappaB transcription factors antagonize apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha. This antiapoptotic activity of NF-kappaB involves suppressing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and controlling the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade. However, the mechanism(s) by which NF-kappaB inhibits ROS accumulation is unclear. We identify ferritin heavy chain (FHC)--the primary iron storage factor--as an essential mediator of the antioxidant and protective activities of NF-kappaB. FHC is induced downstream of NF-kappaB and is required to prevent sustained JNK activation and, thereby, apoptosis triggered by TNFalpha. FHC-mediated inhibition of JNK signaling depends on suppressing ROS accumulation and is achieved through iron sequestration. These findings establish a basis for the NF-kappaB-mediated control of ROS induction and identify a mechanism by which NF-kappaB suppresses proapoptotic JNK signaling. Our results suggest modulation of FHC or, more broadly, of iron metabolism as a potential approach for anti-inflammatory therapy."

The consequences of exposure of endothelial cells to hyperglycemia are well established. However, little is known about how adipocytes respond to both acute as well as chronic exposure to physiological levels of hyperglycemia. Here, we analyze adipocytes exposed to hyperglycemia both in vitro as well as in vivo. Comparing cells differentiated at 4 mm to cells differentiated at 25 mm glucose (the standard differentiation protocol) reveals severe insulin resistance in cells exposed to 25 mm glucose. A global assessment of transcriptional changes shows an up-regulation of a number of mitochondrial proteins. Exposure to hyperglycemia is associated with a significant induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), both in vitro as well as in vivo in adipocytes isolated from streptozotocin-treated hyperglycemic mice. Furthermore, hyperglycemia for a few hours in a clamped setting will trigger the induction of a pro-inflammatory response in adipose tissue from rats that can effectively be reduced by co-infusion of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). ROS levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes can be reduced significantly with pharmacological agents that lower the mitochondrial membrane potential, or by overexpression of uncoupling protein 1 or superoxide dismutase. In parallel with ROS, interleukin-6 secretion from adipocytes is significantly reduced. On the other hand, treatments that lead to a hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, such as overexpression of the mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier result in increased ROS formation and decreased insulin sensitivity, even under normoglycemic conditions. Combined, these results highlight the importance ROS production in adipocytes and the associated insulin resistance and inflammatory response.

Combined, these results highlight the importance ROS production in adipocytes and the associated insulin resistance and inflammatory response. Many genetic and environmental factors can lead to the development of insulin resistance. Once a degree of insulin resistance is established, decreased glucose tolerance arises and occasional bouts of hyperglycemia ensue. Hyperglycemia can in turn cause a further deterioration of insulin sensitivity in a number of tissues, such as the vascular endothelium, muscle, and adipocytes (1Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7128) Google Scholar). In the vascular endothelium, hyperglycemia has been shown to activate protein kinase C isoforms, give rise to increased levels of glucose-derived advanced glycation end products, and to cause an increased glucose flux through the aldose reductase pathway. Normalization of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species by a number of different approaches prevents these phenomena (2Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y.

Similarly, Talior and colleagues (6Talior I. Yarkoni M. Bashan N. Eldar-Finkelman H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E295-E302Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) used in an ex vivo model of adipocytes isolated from animals with high fat diet-induced diabetes and demonstrated that in vitro, these adipocytes displayed significantly elevated ROS levels that could be normalized upon incubation of cells in low glucose. These adipocytes also displayed increased basal glucose uptake and reduced insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Here, we extend these observations to an in vivo setting and demonstrate increased oxidative damage in primary adipocytes. We use the 3T3-L1 cell line to further define the close link of nutrient excess, ROS production, insulin resistance, and concomitant activation of the inflammatory response in adipocytes.

Cell Culture—3T3-L1 murine fibroblasts (a generous gift of Dr. Charles Rubin, Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) were propagated and differentiated according to the protocol described in Ref. 7Engelman J.A.

In brief, the cells were propagated in “FCS” (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml each)) and allowed to reach confluence (Day–2). After 2 days (Day 0), the medium was changed to “DM1” (containing FCS and 160 nm insulin, 250 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine). Two days later (day 2), the medium was switched to “DM2” (FCS containing 160 nm insulin). After another 2 days, the cells were switched backed to FCS. Cells used between days 8 and 12 post-induction of differentiation were propagated in 5 mm glucose and used only up to passage 12. Up to that passage number, no significant differences were observed with respect to the various read outs reported here. Measurement of [1-3H]2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—Assay of [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake was performed as described previously (8Pekala P. Kawakami M. Vine W. Lane M.D. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1360-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were glucose starved for 30 min. Insulin was then added at the indicated concentrations for 5 min, followed by addition of the labeled glucose in the continued presence of the indicated amount of insulin. Glucose transport assays were carried out in a volume of 1 ml (Krebs-Ringer/HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) in a 3.5-cm dish for 25 min at 37 °C. The concentration of 2-deoxyglucose was 50 μm with 0.33 μCi of [3H]2-deoxyglucose/ml. After terminating the transport assay with three washes of ice-cold assay buffer, each plate was solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH and quenched with 50 μl of concentrated HCl. A 0.9-ml aliquot was removed for determination of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting, and 50-μl aliquots were used for measurement of protein using a BCA assay. Glucose uptake remained linear within the first 30 min. Each measurement at the indicated insulin concentrations represents the average of 8 independent measurements, performed on two separate occasions with different cell preparations. Measurement of Intracellular ROS Generation—Cells were washed with minimal essential medium (lacking phenol red) and then incubated in the dark with the fluorescent probe CM-H2DCFDA (10 μm in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer) for 45 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence of CM-DCF was analyzed in an HTS 7000 Bio Assay Fluorescent Plate Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission at 530 nm by using the HTSoft program. ROS production was determined from an H2O2 standard curve (10–200 nmol/ml). Generation of Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses were generated as described previously (9Lingohr M.K. Dickson L.M.

Adenovirus Transduction—3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected by adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 500 as described in Ref. 12Orlicky D.J. Schaack J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 460-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Adenovirus was incubated with serum-free medium containing 0.5 μg/ml polylysine for 100 min prior to the addition to phosphate-buffered saline-washed 3T3-L1 adipocytes. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium and cells were cultured for an additional 2 days. Determination of 8-OH Deoxyguanidine (8-OHdG) in DNA—DNA from mouse adipose tissue was isolated as described in Ref. 13Haegele A.D. Wolfe P. Thompson H.J. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1319-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. High-purity distilled phenol was used to prevent artificial formation of 8-OHdG. After isopropyl alcohol precipitation, the DNA was reconstituted with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer containing 5 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl, which has been shown to inhibit free radical producing reactions. The samples were treated with nuclease P1 to digest DNA to nucleotides and then alkaline phosphatase. 100 μg of DNA was assayed for the levels of 8-OHdG using the 8-OHdG-EIA kit. Enzyme-linked Immunoadsorbent Assay for IL-6—IL-6 production in adipocytes was determined by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay with high-sensitivity ELISA kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The measurement was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Animals—Male FVB or C56Bl6 mice were bred in-house and used as indicated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were housed in individual cages and subjected to a standard light (6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.)-dark (6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) cycle. All rats were fed ad libitum using regular rat chow that consisted of 64% carbohydrate, 30% protein, and 6% fat with a physiological fuel value of 3.3 kcal/g chow. Rats were studied during young adulthood (∼300 g body weight, 3 months old, n = 12). One week before the in vivo studies, rats were anesthetized by inhalation of methoxyflurane, and indwelling catheters were inserted in the right internal jugular vein and in the left carotid artery. This method of anesthesia allows fast recovery and normal food consumption after 1 day. The venous catheter extended to the level of the right atrium, and the arterial catheter was advanced to the level of the aortic arch. Recovery was continued until body weight was within 3% of the pre-operative weight (∼4–6 days). These chronically catheterized rats were studied after ∼24 h of fasting while awake, and unstressed. Hyperglycemic Clamp Studies—Somatostatin (1.5 μg/kg/min) was infused to prevent endogenous insulin secretion and 25% glucose was infused intravenously to lean and obese rats to raise their plasma glucose concentration acutely to ∼18 mm. Plasma glucose concentration was maintained at that level throughout the 3 h of the study using a variable infusion of glucose, periodically adjusted according to plasma glucose levels. At the end of the clamp study, rats were sacrificed using 60 mg of sodium pentobarbital/kg intravenously. The abdomen was quickly opened, and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were freeze-clamped in situ with aluminum tongs pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Streptozotocin Treatment of Mice—Four-week-old male C57Bl6 mice were injected with a single intraperitoneal load of STZ at 100 mg × kg–1 body weight. Blood collection was performed through tail bleeds. Blood glucose levels were measured with a Precision Q-I-D glucose meter (Medisence, Abbott Laboratories Inc.) on a daily basis. Tissues were harvested 7 days after blood glucose levels reached 300–400 mg/dl. mRNA Isolation, Northern Blot Analysis, and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Isolation of mRNA from tissues and tissue culture cells was performed with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Agarose gel electrophoresis of mRNA and its transfer to nylon membranes was described in Ref. 14Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hybridizations were performed overnight at 42 °C in Ultrahybe (Ambion); the 32P-labeled DNA probes were used at concentrations of 2 × 106 cpm/ml. The filters were subsequently washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C before autoradiography. Samples from the TZD study were prepared as follows: total RNA was prepared from cells and tissue using the Ultraspec RNA isolation kit (Biotecx, Houston, TX), then DNase treated using DNA-free® according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA concentrations were quantitated with Ribogreen® by following the supplier's directions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).

Immunoblotting—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to BA83 nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline or Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline or Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Other Methods—Separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (17Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C.

Conventional Differentiation Protocols Cause Insulin Resistance in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—The conventional differentiation protocol in use for in vitro differentiation of adipocytes calls for 25 mm glucose to be present at all stages of differentiation. We wanted to test whether it is possible to differentiate cells at lower, more physiological glucose levels as well. We therefore tried to differentiate the cells in the presence of 4 mm glucose. Lowering the glucose levels required a daily change of medium instead of a medium change every 48 h. Cells differentiated under these conditions accumulated significantly fewer lipids as judged by the reduced level of oil red O staining (Fig. 1A). They did, however, induce differentiation to the same extent as control cells as judged by the induction of intracellular levels of a host of adipocyte-specific or adipocyte-enriched differentiation markers, such as adiponectin, the β chain of the insulin receptor, caveolin-1, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, Akt, and the lipid-binding protein S3/12. Interestingly, resistin levels were markedly higher if the cells were differentiated in high glucose (Fig. 1B). A closer examination by electron microscopy reveals an increased number of smaller lipid droplets upon differentiation in 4 mm glucose (Fig. 1C, top). Consistent with the reduced size of lipid droplets, perilipin levels were markedly reduced in the cells differentiated at 4 mm (Fig. 1C, bottom). Hyperglycemia Causes Insulin Resistance in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—To determine whether there are functional differences between the adipocytes obtained under euglycemic or hyperglycemic conditions, we determined the degree of insulin sensitivity in cells obtained with the two differentiation protocols. With both protocols, a similar degree of differentiation was routinely obtained as judged by the induction of several adipocyte-specific marker proteins as previously demonstrated. A dose response to insulin was performed, and the degree of insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, IRS-1, and Akt/PKB was assessed (Fig. 1D). Insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 were markedly enhanced in cells differentiated at 4 mm as judged by an anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot of cell extracts. Similarly, Akt phosphorylation was significantly enhanced in cells differentiated in 4 mm glucose. Total Akt levels were comparable in all instances, and equal loading was also controlled for by blotting for the constitutive marker GDI (18Lin Y. Lee H. Berg A.H. Lisanti M.P. Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24255-24263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In an independent experiment, the degree of phosphorylation of the insulin receptor as well as total levels of insulin receptor were assessed with similar results (Fig. 1E). To further expand these observations, we assessed the phosphorylation state of specific tyrosine and serine residues on IRS-1 with a battery of recently generated phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (Fig. 1F). Phosphorylation on tyrosine 608 was significantly elevated in cells differentiated in 4 mm glucose, even in the basal state, with an improved dose response to insulin. No significant differences were observed on residue Tyr-1172. With respect to phosphorylation on specific serine residues (events associated with a decrease in the affinity of IRS-1 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), striking differences were observed on residues serine 307 and serine 636. Serine 307 phosphorylation is significantly increased at 25 mm glucose in the basal state and further stimulated upon insulin treatment. Phosphorylation on residue serine 636 displays a very striking induction upon insulin treatment. In summary, differentiation of cells under normal versus hyperglycemic conditions results in highly significant differences in the phosphorylation state of key tyrosine and serine residues, with overall increases seen on tyrosine residues at 4 mm and strong trends toward increased serine phosphorylation at 25 mm glucose. Adipocytes Differentiated in High Glucose Fail to Down-regulate Basal Glucose Uptake and Have a Reduced Insulin-mediated Glucose Uptake—A hallmark of cells prone to hyperglycemic damage is the inability to down-regulate glucose uptake in response to hyperglycemic conditions (1Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7128) Google Scholar). Similar to endothelial cells, adipocytes fail to show a reduction in basal glucose uptake upon differentiation as judged by a significantly increased [1-3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake in the absence of insulin (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, the reduced responsiveness to the insulin-mediated activation of insulin signal transduction cascade translates into a functional read out as well, i.e. insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is significantly reduced in cells differentiated in 25 mm glucose (Fig. 1H). Hyperglycemia-induced Transcriptional Changes—To gain a global overview of the differences at the transcriptional level between cells differentiated in normoglycemic versus hyperglycemic conditions, we performed a series of microarray studies in the basal, unstimulated state. The most striking differences are summarized in Table I. Not surprisingly, a vast number of genes are affected by the differential glucose concentrations. Notably, protein kinase Cδ is markedly induced. This was also seen in the progressive insulin resistance induced by free fatty acid in liver, which was associated with a increase in hepatic protein kinase Cδ (19Lam T.K. Yoshii H. Haber C.A. Bogdanovic E. Lam L. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E682-E691Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been reported in the vascular endothelium (1Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7128) Google Scholar). Among the many other changes, there is a trend toward increased transcriptional activities of mitochondrial genes. We have confirmed and expanded these observations by Northern blot analysis of a subset of these genes. We can detect a significant induction of UCP2 and the mitochondrial matrix chaperone Hsp60, whereas other mitochondrial genes, such as the ADP/ATP translocator and the dicarboxylate transporter DIC are not affected (Fig. 2). Message levels of the adipocyte-specific secretory protein adiponectin/adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa are unaffected. Levels of Foxo1, which is a negative regulator of adipogenesis, are significantly up-regulated in the hyperglycemic state. Insulin suppresses Foxo1 activity, and it has been suggested that sustained activation of Foxo1 because of insulin resistance may inhibit the formation of newly differentiated, lean adipocytes (20Nakae J.

Very little is known about this phenomenon in mature adipocytes. We therefore tested whether differences in glucose levels can trigger differences in ROS levels within cells. Exposure to 30 mm glucose indeed triggered a 4-fold increase in ROS levels. This increase could be prevented with inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, such as the complex II inhibitor thenoyltrifluoroacetone or complex III inhibitor tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin. In addition, the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP also effectively prevented the build-up of ROS levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3A). Adenoviral gene delivery of superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) effectively lowered ROS levels. Similarly, overexpression of the mitochondrial UCP1 also prevented ROS build-up compared with cells infected with a control virus (Fig. 3B). These observations are true whether cells are differentiated under hyperglycemic conditions or under euglycemic conditions and then shifted to hyperglycemic conditions after completion of differentiation. The increases to ROS are not limited to tissue culture conditions, but can also be observed in vivo. Streptozotocin-treated mice offer a convenient model to assess the effects of hyperglycemia in a relatively acute setting. Mice were injected with streptozotocin, which promptly induced hyperglycemia at levels >400 mg/dl. Seven days post-conversion to hyperglycemia, adipose tissue was harvested. As an indicator of ROS-induced damage, we measured the levels of 8-OHdG normalized to total DNA levels. As shown in Fig. 3C, streptozotocin treatment resulted in a significant increase in 8-OHdG, suggesting that ROS build-up is a phenomenon also occurring in vivo. Exposure to hyperglycemia can result in the induction of pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-6. To test whether hyperglycemic conditions have an effect on 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well, we compared IL-6 production in adipocytes obtained with the two differentiation protocols. Cells differentiated at 25 mm indeed produced higher levels of IL-6 (Fig. 3D). To test whether ROS play a critical role in the translation of excess nutrients to an increased inflammatory response, we measured IL-6 secretion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated under hyperglycemic conditions. IL-6 levels were measured either upon exposure to a control adenovirus or upon adenoviral-mediated overexpression of UCP-1. A reduction of the ROS levels by overexpression of UCP1 indeed results in a reduction of IL-6 levels in the supernatant of these cells, suggesting that increased ROS levels are mediating, at least in part, the hyperglycemia-induced increase in the pro-inflammatory response in adipocytes (Fig. 3E).

https://openalex.org/W2124326407,"Skeletal muscle regeneration in adults is thought to occur through the action of myogenic satellite cells located in close association with mature muscle fibers; however, these precursor cells have not been prospectively isolated, and recent studies have suggested that additional muscle progenitors, including cells of bone marrow or hematopoietic origin, may exist. To clarify the origin(s) of adult myogenic cells, we used phenotypic, morphological, and functional criteria to identify and prospectively isolate a subset of myofiber-associated cells capable at the single cell level of generating myogenic colonies at high frequency. Importantly, although muscle-engrafted cells from marrow and/or circulation localized to the same anatomic compartment as myogenic satellite cells and expressed some though not all satellite cell markers, they displayed no intrinsic myogenicity. Together, these studies describe the clonal isolation of functional adult myogenic progenitors and demonstrate that these cells do not arise from hematopoietic or other bone marrow or circulating precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2092193387,"Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is a water channel expressed strongly at the ventricular-facing surface of choroid plexus epithelium. We developed novel methods to compare water permeability in isolated choroid plexus of wild-type vs. AQP1 null mice, as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and absorption. Osmotically induced water transport was rapid in choroid plexus from wild-type mice and reduced by fivefold by AQP1 deletion. AQP1 deletion did not affect choroid plexus size or structure. By stereotaxic puncture of the lateral ventricle with a microneedle, ICP was 9.5 +/- 1.4 cm H2O in wild-type mice and 4.2 +/- 0.4 cm H2O in AQP1 null mice. CSF production, an isosmolar fluid secretion process, was measured by a dye dilution method involving fluid collections using a second microneedle introduced into the cisterna magna. CSF production in wild-type mice was (in microl min(-1)) 0.37 +/- 0.04 (control), 0.16 +/- 0.03 (acetazolamide-treated), and 1.14 +/- 0.15 (forskolin-treated), and reduced by approximately 25% in AQP1 null mice. Pressure-dependent CSF outflow, measured from steady-state ICP at different ventricular infusion rates, was not affected by AQP1 deletion. In a model of focal brain injury, AQP1 null mice had remarkably reduced ICP and improved survival compared with wild-type mice. The reduced ICP and CSF production in AQP1 null mice provides direct functional evidence for the involvement of AQP1 in CSF dynamics, suggesting AQP1 inhibition as a novel option for therapy of elevated ICP."
https://openalex.org/W2145741346,"The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi naturally persists in a cycle that primarily involves ticks and mammals. We have now identified a tick receptor (TROSPA) that is required for spirochetal colonization of Ixodes scapularis. B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A, which is abundantly expressed on spirochetes within the arthropod and essential for pathogen adherence to the vector, specifically bound to TROSPA. TROSPA mRNA levels in ticks increased following spirochete infestation and decreased in response to engorgement, events that are temporally linked to B. burgdorferi entry into and egress from the vector. The blockade of TROSPA by TROSPA antisera or by the repression of TROSPA expression via RNA interference reduced B. burgdorferi adherence to the I. scapularis gut in vivo, thereby preventing efficient colonization of the vector and subsequently reducing pathogen transmission to the mammalian host. Identification of an I. scapularis receptor for B. burgdorferi is the first step toward elucidating arthropod ligands that are required for survival of spirochetes in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2152422855,"During asymmetric cell divisions, mitotic spindles align along the axis of polarization. In invertebrates, spindle positioning requires Pins or related proteins and a G protein alpha subunit. A mammalian Pins, called LGN, binds Galphai and also interacts through an N-terminal domain with the microtubule binding protein NuMA. During mitosis, LGN recruits NuMA to the cell cortex, while cortical association of LGN itself requires the C-terminal Galpha binding domain. Using a FRET biosensor, we find that LGN behaves as a conformational switch: in its closed state, the N and C termini interact, but NuMA or Galphai can disrupt this association, allowing LGN to interact simultaneously with both proteins, resulting in their cortical localization. Overexpression of Galphai or YFP-LGN causes a pronounced oscillation of metaphase spindles, and NuMA binding to LGN is required for these spindle movements. We propose that a related switch mechanism might operate in asymmetric cell divisions in the fly and nematode."
https://openalex.org/W2094021381,"The SCF ubiquitin ligase complex regulates diverse cellular functions by ubiquitinating numerous protein substrates. Cand1, a 120 kDa HEAT repeat protein, forms a tight complex with the Cul1-Roc1 SCF catalytic core, inhibiting the assembly of the multisubunit E3 complex. The crystal structure of the Cand1-Cul1-Roc1 complex shows that Cand1 adopts a highly sinuous superhelical structure, clamping around the elongated SCF scaffold protein Cul1. At one end, a Cand1 β hairpin protrusion partially occupies the adaptor binding site on Cul1, inhibiting its interactions with the Skp1 adaptor and the substrate-recruiting F box protein subunits. At the other end, two Cand1 HEAT repeats pack against a conserved Cul1 surface cleft and bury a Cul1 lysine residue, whose modification by the ubiquitin-like protein, Nedd8, is able to block Cand1-Cul1 association. Together with biochemical evidence, these structural results elucidate the mechanisms by which Cand1 and Nedd8 regulate the assembly-disassembly cycles of SCF and other cullin-dependent E3 complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2115659144,"Binding of a ribonucleoside triphosphate to an RNA polymerase II transcribing complex, with base pairing to the template DNA, was revealed by X-ray crystallography. Binding of a mismatched nucleoside triphosphate was also detected, but in an adjacent site, inverted with respect to the correctly paired nucleotide. The results are consistent with a two-step mechanism of nucleotide selection, with initial binding to an entry (E) site beneath the active center in an inverted orientation, followed by rotation into the nucleotide addition (A) site for pairing with the template DNA. This mechanism is unrelated to that of single subunit RNA polymerases and so defines a new paradigm for the large, multisubunit enzymes. Additional findings from these studies include a third nucleotide binding site that may define the length of backtracked RNA; DNA double helix unwinding in advance of the polymerase active center; and extension of the diffraction limit of RNA polymerase II crystals to 2.3 A."
https://openalex.org/W2154964144,"MazF is an Escherichia coli toxin that is highly conserved among the prokaryotes and plays an important role in growth regulation. When MazF is induced, protein synthesis is effectively inhibited. However, the mechanism of MazF action has been controversial. Here we unequivocally demonstrate that MazF is an endoribonuclease that specifically cleaves mRNAs at ACA sequences. We then demonstrate its enzymatic specificity using short RNA substrates. MazF cleaves RNA at the 5′-end of ACA sequences, yielding a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate at one side and a free 5′-OH group at the other. Using DNA-RNA chimeric substrates containing XACA, the 2′-OH group of residue X was found absolutely essential for MazF cleavage, whereas all the other residues may be deoxyriboses. Therefore, MazF exhibits exquisite site specificity and has utility as an RNA-restriction enzyme for RNA structural studies or as an mRNA interferase to regulate cell growth in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

It is intriguing that almost all bacteria contain a number of seemingly suicidal genes in their genomes or on plasmids (1Engelberg-Kulka H. Sat B. Reches M. Amitai S. Hazan R.

These toxin genes are co-expressed with their cognate antitoxin genes so that the devastating effects of these toxin genes are blocked under normal growth conditions. It has been debated whether expression of these toxins cause permanent damage to the cell that leads to programmed cell death (1Engelberg-Kulka H. Sat B. Reches M. Amitai S. Hazan R.

Microbiol. 2004; 53: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MazF is the most extensively characterized bacterial toxin (6Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 13Zhang J. Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32300-32306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the MazE-MazF (antitoxin-toxin) complex has been determined (14Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Both in vivo and in vitro experiments from our laboratory clearly demonstrate that MazF functions as a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves cellular mRNAs at ACA sequences (15Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). However, work by other researchers led them to conclude that 1) MazF functions as a factor that exerts its endoribonuclease (or ribosomal) activity only when it associates with the ribosome and 2) its mRNA cleavage activity occurs only at a unique site at specific codons in a manner similar to the RelE toxin (16Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hansen F.G. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). RelE has been implied as a factor that functions as a codon-dependent endoribonuclease only when it associates with ribosomes (17Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M.

Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Other E. coli toxins, ChpBK (16Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hansen F.G. Gerdes K. J. Mol.

Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1705-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), have also been proposed to function as factors that cleave cellular mRNAs in a ribosome- and codon-dependent manner like RelE. Another report challenges the published sequence specificity of MazF, instead concluding that MazF cleaves mRNAs at NAC (N is preferentially A and U) rather than at ACA (20Munoz-Gomez A.J. Santos-Sierra S. Berzal-Herranz A. Lemonnier M. Diaz-Orejas R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, PemK (Kid), a MazF homologue encoded by plasmid R100 (21Masuda Y. Miyakawa K. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6850-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to also function as a sequence-specific endoribonuclease involved in mRNA degradation (22Zhang J. Zhang Y. Zhu L. Suzuki M. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20678-20684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In fact, the prokaryotic kingdom contains a large family of MazF/PemK relatives. We collectively refer to this family of bacterial toxins as “mRNA interferases.” Interestingly, their utility extends beyond bacterial systems, because they are able to function in yeast and higher eukaryotes (23de la Cueva-Mendez G. Mills A.D. Clay-Farrace L. Diaz-Orejas R. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we definitively demonstrate that MazF functions as an ACA-specific endoribonuclease that functions independent of ribosomes and RNA codon context. Using short synthetic RNA or RNA-DNA chimeric substrates that contain an XACA MazF cleavage site, we show that the 2′-OH group in the X residue is absolutely essential for MazF cleavage. For cleavage, the ACA sequence may consist of deoxyriboses suggesting that MazF may use an enzymatic mechanism for the cleavage of phosphodiester linkages, which is similar to ribonuclease A (RNase A), although there is no apparent structural similarity between two enzymes. We propose that mRNA interferases are novel RNA restriction enzymes that play an important role in bacterial physiology by regulating cell growth in response to stress.

The mazG or era mRNA was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h before MazF induction. Total RNA was extracted at different time intervals as indicated in Fig. 3B. Primer extension was carried out as described previously (15Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). For in vitro primer extension analysis, the full-length mazG and era mRNAs were synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase from the DNA fragment containing a T7 promotor sequence and mazG or era open reading frames using RiboMAX™ T7 large scale RNA production system (Promega). A 110-base 16 S rRNA fragment (+1213 to +1322) was synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase from the DNA fragment containing a T7 promotor sequence and the 16 S rRNA fragment (+1213 to +1322) using RiboMAX™ T7 large-scale RNA production system. A 151-base mazG RNA fragment was synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase from the DNA fragment containing a T7 promotor sequence and the mazG DNA fragment using RiboMAX™ T7 large-scale RNA production system. The resulting RNA consisted of a 71-base sequence from pET-11a and the remaining 80-base sequence within the mazG open reading frame from Met-1 to Gln-27. MazF(His)6 (0.02 μg) was incubated with 1 pmol of mazG or era mRNAs in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8), 1.25 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 μl of RNase inhibitor, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 0.05 μm32P-labeled primer at 37 °C for 10 min, then reverse transcriptase (2 U) was added, and cDNA synthesis was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding the sequence loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol EF). The sample was incubated at 90 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The primers G1 (GCCCAGTTCACCGCGAAGATCGTC) and G2 (TGCTCTTTATCCCACGGGCAG) were used for primer extension analysis of the mazG RNA; the primers E1 (TCAACGACAAAAATCACCAGCTCA), E2(CACGTTGTCCACTTTGTTCACCAC), E3(ATGACCATCTTCTTCTGCCCTTCA), and E4 (GCGTTCGTCGTCGGCCCAACCGGA) were used for primer extension analysis of the era RNA. The primer S1 (GAGTTGCAGACTCCAATCCGGACT) was used for primer extension analysis of the 16 S rRNA fragment. The primers were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Cleavage of Synthetic RNA by MazF—Oligoribonucleotides were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The MazF endoribonuclease activity was assayed in 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8), 0.5 μl of ribonuclease inhibitor, 0.02 μg of MazF(His)6, and 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 or 30 min and stopped by adding 4 μl of RNA loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol EF, and 15% Ficoll) or the sequence loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol EF). The reaction mixtures were then subjected to 15% PAGE or 20% sequence gel followed by autoradiography. Analysis of Cleavage Products—4 pmol of RB-15-1 (see Table I) was incubated with 0.02 μg of MazF(His)6 at 37 °C for 15 min. The cleavage products were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 15 min. The 5′-end labeled 3′-end product from the MazF cleavage reaction was excised from a 20% sequencing polyacrylamide gel and further purified as described previously (24Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15071-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified 5′-end labeled 3′-end product was then digested with RNase T2 in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.3) and 1.5 units of the enzyme for 6 h at 37 °C. Products of the digestion were analyzed by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on micro-crystalline cellulose plates (Macherey-Nagel) containing a fluorescent indicator. The first dimension was performed in isobutyric acid/saturated NH4OH/H2O (577:38:385), and the second dimension was performed in saturated (NH4)2SO4, 1 m sodium acetate, isopropyl alcohol (80:18:2). The plate was washed once by methanol at room temperature for 15 min and dried before running the second dimension. 3′-monophosphate and pAp standards were visualized by ultraviolet light. Radiolabeled products and [32P]pCp were visualized by autoradiography (25Smith C.M. Potts W.B. II I Smith J.S. Roth M.J. Virology. 1997; 229: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation for MALDI-Mass Spectrometry—The saturated 3-hydroxypicolinic acid matrix solution was prepared by dissolving 5 mg of 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (Sigma) in 100 μl of 50 mm diammonium citrate (Sigma) containing 25% acetonitrile. 1 μl of an RNA (4 μm) sample with or without MazF(His)6 in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8) was spotted onto a stainless steel sample plate, and the sample was dried at room temperature. The saturated matrix solution (0.5 μl) was then spotted on the dried sample. After the sample was completely dried, mass measurements were carried out using a Voyager DE PRO MALDITOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Purification of MazF(His)6 Proteins—MazF(His)6 tagged at the C-terminal end was purified from strain BL21(DE3) carrying pET-21cc-MazEF. The complex of MazF(His)6 and MazE was first trapped on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). After dissociating MazE from MazF(His)6 in 6 m guanidine-HCl, MazF(His)6 was retrapped by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and refolded by step-step dialysis. In text, MazF(His)6 is referred to as MazF. Construction of Mutants Plasmids—Site-directed mutagenesis were performed with use of pET-11a-MazG, and all mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of RNA Ladder—Partial alkaline hydrolysis of 5′-end-labeled RNA was performed in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 100 pmol of RNA and 0.1 n NaOH at 75 °C for 2 min. The hydrolysis was stopped by adding 40 μl of sequence loading buffer (24Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15071-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic Specificity of MazF—Previously we showed that MazF was able to cleave a 30-base RNA having an ACA sequence in the center (15Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). We extended this initial observation by further shortening the RNA to 15 nucleotides with the ACA sequence in the center (Fig. 1A). On the basis of our previous findings (15Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), MazF was able to cleave this RNA (termed RB-15-1, Table I) at site 6, site 7, or at both sites. To examine the cleavage sites, RB-15-1 RNA was first digested with MazF, and the reaction product was then 5′-end labeled and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. A major product (Fig. 1B, lane 2) appeared at the position of the 9-base product of the RNA ladder prepared by partial alkaline hydrolysis of the 32P 5′-end-labeled RB-15-1 RNA (lane 1), suggesting that the product was a result of cleavage at site 6. An 8-base product was also detected, which corresponded to the cleavage product at site 7. Cleavage at both sites 6 and 7 was confirmed by the identification of the 5′-end base of each 5′-end-labeled fragment after digestion with RNase T2 (which cleaves every phosphodiester bond at the 5′-side; Fig. 1, C and D). Both the 9-base and the 8-base fragments yielded pAp and pCp, respectively, indicating that MazF was able to cleave RB-15-1 RNA at both sites 6 and 7 (Fig. 1A). Notably, the same sequence in the mazG mRNA was preferentially cleaved at site 7 (15Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), whereas RB-15-1 RNA was cleaved preferentially at site 6. It appears that the hydrolysis reaction can occur at either the 5′-side or the 3′-side phosphodiester linkage of the first A residue in the ACA sequence. The above results also indicated that MazF cleaves a phosphodiester bond at the 5′-end side yielding a free 5′-OH group on the 3′-end cleavage product and thus a 3′-phosphate (or a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate) on the 5′-end product. These data were further substantiated by MALDI-mass spectrometric analysis of MazF-digested RB-15-1 RNA. These results clearly demonstrated that MazF cleaves RB-15-1 RNA at site 6, yielding a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and a 5′-OH group (Fig. 1E). The cleavage product at site 7 was not detectable by MALDI-mass spectrometry because of its low yield. We synthesized three additional shorter RNA substrates, a 13-base RNA (RB-13-1), an 11-base RNA (RB-11-1), and a 7-base RNA (RB-7-1, Table I). MALDI-mass spectrometric analysis after MazF digestion of each RNA revealed that 1) each was cleaved at the 5′-side phosphodiester bond at the first A residue of the ACA sequence, and 2) all of the resulting 5′-end fragments had almost exclusively a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate at the 3′-end, and 3) all of the resulting 3′-end fragments contained a free 5′-OH group (not shown). These results clearly indicated that MazF is an endoribonuclease that cleaves a phosphodiester linkage at the 5′-side of a phosphodiester bond. In addition to RB-11-1, RB-11-2 was also synthesized. In both RB-11-2 and RB-7-1, the U residue immediately upstream of the ACA sequence was replaced with a G residue (Table I). Both substrates were effectively cleaved by MazF (not shown), indicating that the U residue upstream of the ACA sequence is not essential for hydrolysis by MazF. Requirement of the 2′-OH Group at Cleavage Site—Our data revealed that all of the 5′-end cleavage products contain a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, suggesting that the 2′-OH group at the cleavage site plays an essential role for the hydrolysis reaction as in the case of RNase A. To test the role of the 2′-OH group for cleavage, we first modified the 2′-OH groups with a methyl group at the first A residue of the ACA sequence (RB-13-2, Table I), at A and C residues (RB-13-3), at the U residue immediately upstream of the first A residue (RB-13-4), and at the both U and A residues (RB-13-5). As shown in Fig. 2A, both RB-13-2 (lane 6) and RB-13-3 (lane 4) were digested, whereas both RB-13-4 (lane 10) and RB-13-5 (lane 8) were not, indicating that the 2′-OH group of the cleavage site is indeed essential. Similar results were obtained using 2′-deoxy modified RB-13-1, RB-13-6 (UdACA), RB-13-7 (UdAdCA), RB-13-8 (dUACA), and RB-13-9 (dUdACA, Table I), underscoring the importance of the 2′-OH group of the U residue at the cleavage site (Fig. 2A, lanes 12, 14, 16, and 18, respectively). Note that there are two cleavage products in all cases where the substrates were hydrolyzed by MazF (Fig. 2A, products a and b). Product b contains a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, whereas product a has a 3′-phosphate at the 3′-end (see the section below). The ratio of a to b varied in different experiments. However, the a/b ratio increased when the reaction was carried out with higher concentrations of MazF (not shown), suggesting that a MazF cleavage reaction of a phosphodiester linkage may occur in a similar manner as RNase A. The hydrolysis reaction by RNase A occurs in two discrete steps; in the first step, the nucleophilicity of the ribose 2′-OH plays a key role to form a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, in the second step, the cyclic intermediate is opened to form a 3′-phosphate. Identification of a 2′,3′-Cyclic Phosphate as an Intermediate—To test whether the 2′-OH group at the cleavage site is the only requirement for MazF, we engineered two DNA-RNA chimeric substrates, RD-13-1 and RD-13-2, based on the RB-13-1 sequence (Table I). In RD-13-2, the rU residue in RD-13-1 was replaced with a rG residue. RD-13-1 was 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2B, lane 1). MazF digestion of this substrate yielded a major product at position b (Fig. 2B) and a minor product at position a. The b product (Fig. 2B, lane 2) is identical to the product from alkaline hydrolysis (lane 3), whereas the a product is identical to the product from RNase A digestion. When these products were analyzed by MALDI-mass spectrometry, the mass of the 5′-end RNase A product was only 18 Daltons larger than the mass of the 5′-end MazF product (Fig. 2D). The mass of the RNase A product agreed well with the 5′-end product containing a 3′-phosphate at the 3′-end, whereas the mass of the MazF product was consistent with the 5′-end product containing a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate. These results suggest that both RNase A and MazF cleave these substrates between rU and dA. Importantly, the 3′-end products from both RNase A and MazF digestions had identical masses. To further prove that the products cleaved by MazF contain a2′,3′-cyclic phosphate group and not a 3′-OH group, the MazF product of the 5′-end labeled RD-13-1 (Fig. 2C, lane 2) was treated either with T4 polynucleotide kinase at pH 6.0 (known to function as 3′-phosphatase under this condition (26Cameron V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5120-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)) (lane 3) or with RNase A (lane 4). By both treatments, product b in lane 2 was converted to product a in lanes 3 and 4. These results provided additional evidence that MazF cleavage of a phosphodiester linkage yields primarily a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate on one side and a 5′-OH group on the other side. When rU was replaced with rG (RD-13-2, Table I), MazF was still able to effectively cleave the substrate (Fig. 2E, lane 2). The products from MazF treatment migrated at the identical position to the alkaline hydrolytes (lane 3) and to RNase T1 digest. The formation of a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate at the rG residue and a 5′-OH group at the dA residue of the cleavage site was confirmed by MALDI-mass spectrometry (Fig. 2F). Cleavage Site Shifting—Curiously, the MazF cleavage site within an RNA sequence derived from the mazG mRNA was shifted by 1 base upstream when RNA was shorted to 15 bases (Fig. 1). A similar shift in cleavage site was observed in the ACA sequence derived from the era mRNA (bases 236–238) when the cleavage conditions were altered. In vivo primer extension experiments revealed that this ACA sequence was cleaved between the first A and C residue (Fig. 3B). This result was also confirmed by an in vitro primer extension experiment using the full-length (∼1 kb) era mRNA (Fig. 3C). However, when only a 98-base portion of the era mRNA was digested with MazF in an in vitro reaction, cleavage occurred at the phosphodiester linkage not only at the 3′-side bond but also at the 5′-side bond of the first A residue of the ACA sequence (Fig. 3D). The reason for this cleavage site shifting is unclear. However, we speculate that an amino acid residue at the active site of MazF involved in the nucleophilic attack of the 2′-OH group of the cleavage site residue is flexible. This flexibility may enable the RNA-MazF-dimer complex to attack either the upstream 2′-OH or the downstream 2′-OH group. Recognition Sequence of MazF—Recent in vitro studies conclude that MazF cleaves mRNAs between N and A residues of an NAC sequence (N is preferentially A and U) (20Munoz-Gomez A.J. Santos-Sierra S. Berzal-Herranz A. Lemonnier M. Diaz-Orejas R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our published assertion that MazF requires ACA for its endoribonuclease activity (15Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) was derived from primer extension experiments with mazG and era mRNAs both in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 3A, boxed). Of all of the AC-containing sequences (Fig. 3A, underlined), only those comprising ACA were cleaved. Notably, no cleavage was observed at UACX and AACX (X is U, C, and G). To test the requirement for an ACA recognition sequence associated with the MazF endoribonuclease function, the U1A2C3A4U5 sequence in the mazG mRNA was mutated to all possible bases at each position. These mutated RNAs were tested for MazF cleavage (Fig. 4). Any base changes of the ACA sequence (Fig. 4, A, B, and C, A2, C3, and A4, respectively) completely blocked cleavage of the RNA by MazF, whereas any base changes at U1 and U5 residues (Fig. 4, A and D) did not block the RNA cleavage. These results revealed that the ACA sequence plays an essential role for MazF recognition of RNA substrates in support of our earlier work (15Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Overall, our data conclusively establishes that MazF specifically cleaves at ACA sequences. Effects of Mg2+ on MazF Cleavage—Similar to RNase A, MazF does not require Mg2+ for its hydrolytic reaction. Using RB-15-1 RNA as a substrate, EDTA showed little effect on MazF activity, whereas Mg2+ was inhibitory (not shown). The effect of Mg2+ was tested using a 110-base 16 S rRNA fragment, which contains two ACA (Fig. 5A, b and c) and one ACACA (Fig. 5A, a; two overlapping ACA) sequence. The cleavage at these three sites a, b, and c, by MazF were found to be dependent of the concentration of Mg2+ (Fig. 5B). At 10 mm, a and b sites were cleaved equally, but cleavage at site c was less efficient. At 5 mm, an apparent preferential cleavage at site c over a was observed. At 1.25 mm Mg2+, cleavage at site c only was noted, precluding the ability to detect MazF cleavage at sites a and b. Therefore, the band intensity changes observed for site a and site b are not because of an inhibition of MazF cleavage at these sites. We suspect that cleavage at all sites was enhanced as Mg2+ concentrations decreased. Note that at site a (where two ACA sequences are overlapping) cleavage occurs only at the downstream ACA, perhaps because the cleavage site for the upstream ACA forms a stable secondary structure (Fig. 5A). MazF as an mRNA Interferase—Gerdes and co-workers (16Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hansen F.G. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) reported that MazF inhibits translation by a ribosome- and codon-dependent mechanism very similar to RelE. Our data do not support their conclusion. This study and our earlier work (15Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) showed that MazF cleaves mRNAs in a totally codon-independent manner, because MazF cleaves mRNAs at the same site both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, in this report we showed that small synthetic RNAs, even as short as 7 bases, are able to serve as MazF substrates. Interestingly, although not pointed out by Christensen et al. (16Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hansen F.G. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), distinct cleavage of the lpp mRNA by MazF very close to its 5′-end was evident. On the basis of the sequencing ladder provided, it clearly corresponded to the ACA sequence in the 5′-untranslated region (27Nakamura K. Inouye M. Cell. 1979; 18: 1109-1117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Taken together, their results and ours support the notion that MazF functions as a ribosome-independent endoribonuclease. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that MazF may be able to associate with ribosomes in the cell. We have now unequivocally demonstrated that MazF is an endoribonuclease that specifically cleaves mRNA at ACA sequences. Furthermore, MazF was found to enzymatically function in a manner similar to RNase A in the cleavage of RNA where the 2′-OH group at the cleavage site plays a key role in the reaction. One of histidine residues in the active site of RNase A enhances the nucleophilicity of the ribose 2′-OH group of the U residue at the cleavage site resulting in the formation of a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate. It will be useful to determine which residues in the structure of the MazF dimer (14Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) play a role in the reaction. Although MazF does not contain a conserved histidine residue, it contains highly conserved basic residues, which may perform nucleophilic attack on the 2′-OH group. With its well defined sequence specificity, MazF essentially behaves as an RNA restriction enzyme. This property makes MazF an attractive tool for manipulation of RNA and for structural analysis. For example, it would allow for fine mapping of a RNA secondary structure (because it only cuts single-stranded RNA). The distinctive properties of MazF can also be exploited for use in organisms other than bacteria. Ongoing studies in our laboratory revealed that MazF functions as an mRNA interferase in both lower (yeast) and higher (mouse and human cells) eukaryotes, providing a exacting tool to both manipulate cell death pathways and study cell proliferation.

Degradation of d-serine is achieved by d-amino acid oxidase, but this enzyme is not present in forebrain areas that are highly enriched in d-serine. We now report that serine racemase catalyzes the degradation of cellular d-serine itself, through the α,β-elimination of water.

To investigate further the role of α,β-elimination in regulating cellular d-serine, we generated a serine racemase mutant displaying selective impairment of α,β-elimination activity (Q155D). Levels of d-serine synthesized by the Q155D mutant are several-fold higher than the wild-type both in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that the α,β-elimination reaction limits the achievable d-serine concentration in vivo. Additional mutants in vicinal residues (H152S, P153S, and N154F) similarly altered the partition between the α,β-elimination and racemization reactions. α,β-Elimination also competes with the reverse serine racemase reaction in vivo. Although the formation of l- from d-serine is readily detected in Q155D mutant-expressing cells incubated with physiological d-serine concentrations, reversal with wild-type serine racemase-expressing cells required much higher d-serine concentration. We propose that α,β-elimination provides a novel mechanism for regulating intracellular d-serine levels, especially in brain areas that do not possess d-amino acid oxidase activity. Extracellular d-serine is more stable toward α,β-elimination, likely due to physical separation from serine racemase and its elimination activity.

NMDA receptors play key roles in excitatory synaptic transmission, plasticity, and learning and memory (5Danysz W. Parsons A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 597-664PubMed Google Scholar). Overactivation of the NMDA receptor and the resultant influx of calcium into cells is a major culprit in the cell death that occurs following stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Blockers of the “glycine site” of the receptor are neuroprotective in animal models of stroke (5Danysz W. Parsons A.C. Pharmacol.

In addition to converting l- to d-serine, serine racemase catalyzes the α,β-elimination of water from l-serine to form pyruvate and ammonia (12De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H.

PLP, bound to the enzyme through an internal aldimine with Lys56, reacts with l-serine to give an external aldimine intermediate. Subsequent α-proton abstraction forms a resonance stabilized carbanion. Reprotonation of this intermediate on the opposite face of the planar carbanion generates the d-serine external aldimine intermediate. d-Serine is released via transimination with Lys56, regenerating the free enzyme. The resonance stabilized carbanion is also an intermediate for the α,β-elimination reaction. Elimination of the β-hydroxyl group from the carbanionic intermediate leads to the formation of the aminoacrylate-PLP intermediate. Subsequent transimination releases the initial aminoacrylate product and regenerates free enzyme. The aminoacrylate released undergoes rapid non-enzymatic hydrolysis to give pyruvate and ammonia.Table IKinetic parameters of α,β-eliminationkcatKmkcat/Km-ATP+ATP-ATP+ATP-ATP+ATPWTQ155DWTQ155DWTQ155DWTQ155DWTQ155DWTQ155Dmin-1mmmm-1·min-1l-Serine2.0 (0.25)<0.110.0 (1.2)2.0 (0.4)9 (1)—aSpecific activity was too low to allow accurate determination of kinetic parameters.10 (1.2)11 (1.5)0.221.000.18d-Serine0.2 (0.02)<0.12.5 (0.4)0.70 (0.1)8.5 (1)—aSpecific activity was too low to allow accurate determination of kinetic parameters.9 (0.9)12 (1.4)0.0210.280.06l-ThreonineNDbND, activity was not detectable.ND18 (1.2)1.7 (0.14)NDND55 (7)60 (8)0.330.03a Specific activity was too low to allow accurate determination of kinetic parameters.b ND, activity was not detectable. Open table in a new tab The termination of signaling by a neurotransmitter in the brain normally requires its re-uptake and metabolism. d-Serine signaling is thought to involve its release from cells to stimulate NMDA receptors in neurons, but its re-uptake and degradation are not well understood. d-Amino acid oxidase is the only mammalian enzyme known to degrade d-serine. It is restricted to the cerebellum and brainstem, with negligible activity in the cerebral cortex and other forebrain areas where serine racemase is present (2Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Thus, the pathways for d-serine removal and degradation are still unknown and are very important to delineate to have a full understanding of d-serine signaling.A relationship between the serine racemase α,β-elimination reaction and the synthesis of d-serine has not been previously addressed. Moreover, α,β-elimination was proposed to be specific for l-serine. d-serine was thought not to be a physiological α,β-elimination substrate (17Strisovsky K. Jiraskova J. Barinka C. Majer P. Rojas C. Slusher B.S. Konvalinka J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because α,β-elimination is a degradative process, we considered the possibility that α,β-elimination may be a mechanism for down-regulation of d-serine levels. Thus, we have now explored further the physiological role and specificity of the serine racemase α,β-elimination activity.It was found that, in addition to l-serine, serine racemase catalyzes the α,β-elimination of water from l-threonine and d-serine in an ATP-modulated manner. α,β-Elimination of d-serine occurs through an apparent futile reaction in which part of d-serine synthesized by serine racemase is converted to pyruvate both in vitro and in vivo. This suggests a novel mechanism to limit intracellular d-serine concentrations: serine racemase may degrade excess d-serine in areas lacking d-amino acid oxidase. Additionally, we propose that the export of d-serine to the extracellular milieu increases its stability by preventing α,β-elimination by serine racemase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—ATP, catalase, glutathione-agarose, NADH, PLP, and Tris were obtained from Sigma. l-Threonine, l-serine, and d-serine were purchased from Bachem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), basal medium Eagle (BME), minimum essential medium, fetal bovine serum, horse serum, glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and trypsin solutions were obtained from Biological Industries (Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel). d-Amino acid oxidase from pig kidney (EC 1.4.3.3) and lactate dehydrogenase were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Other reagents were of analytical grade.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For transfection, cells were split into 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) at 70–90% confluence. On the next day, cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of mouse full-length serine racemase gene, a catalytically inactive mutant constructed by replacing Lys56 with glycine (9Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) cloned into pRK5-KS using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen). Cells were used 24–48 h after transfection.Assay of Serine and Threonine in Cells—HEK 293-transfected cells were incubated in 6-well plates with 1 ml of DMEM medium. To measure l-and d-amino acid levels, a 0.1-ml aliquot of culture medium was removed, and the samples were processed for HPLC as described previously (18Hashimoto A. Nishikawa T. Oka T. Takahashi K. Hayashi T. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 582: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were first deproteinized by addition of trichloroacetic acid at 5% final concentration. The suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC after removal of trichloroacetic acid by four extractions with water-saturated diethyl ether. To calculate specific synthesis of d-serine, the values of contaminating d-serine in DMEM (about 6 μm contaminating d-serine) were subtracted from the values obtained after addition of 10 mm l-serine. For intracellular amino acid determination, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, followed by addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid to extract free amino acids. The suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was analyzed after removal of trichloroacetic acid by three extractions with water-saturated diethyl ether.Assay of Keto Acids—To monitor pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate, generated from l-serine and l-threonine α,β-elimination, respectively, a 0.1-ml aliquot of culture medium was removed and boiled for 5 min to inactivate endogenous lactate dehydrogenase activity. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to remove precipitated protein, and the supernatant was analyzed by monitoring the decrease in NADH (0.2 mm) absorbance at 340 nm, because the keto acids are reduced by added lactate dehydrogenase (1 μg/ml) (19John R.A.

Expression of serine racemase was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) for 12 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in medium containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 15 μm PLP, 10 mm imidazole, and 400 mm NaCl. After addition of 1% Triton X-100, the suspension was cleared by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 15 min), and serine racemase was purified from the supernatant by binding to Talon resin (Clontech) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. About 1–2 mg of protein was obtained for every liter of bacterial culture. The activity could be easily checked by adding 20 μl of enzyme bound to the resin to the assay medium. The enzyme bound to beads was active, and it displayed the same kinetic characteristics of the purified enzyme when eluted with imidazole and subjected to dialysis. In some experiments, recombinant serine racemase was purified from mammalian cells as described before (20Panizzutti R. De Miranda J. Ribeiro C.S. Engelender S. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with identical results. Recombinant enzyme was of high purity as revealed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutants of serine racemase were obtained by PCR with Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene) using complementary primers containing the desired base changes. After 22 cycles, the PCR product was digested with DPN I and transformed into XL1-Blue Escherichia coli. The mutants were verified by double-strand DNA sequence.In Vitro Activity Assays—Reaction media contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 15 μm PLP, and the different test substrates in a final reaction volume of 50–70 μl. The reaction was started by addition of recombinant SR (0.02–0.05 mg/ml final concentration) and stopped after 1–2 h at 37 °C by boiling for 5 min. Blanks were carried out with heat-inactivated enzyme. When indicated, the free Mg2+ concentration was varied by using a Mg-EDTA buffer. The concentration of EDTA was fixed at 2 mm, and the amounts of MgCl2 needed to obtain the desired free Mg2+ concentrations were calculated using Mg-EDTA and Mg·ATP association constants previously determined (21Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 1186-1194Google Scholar). Both l- and d-serine were monitored by HPLC analysis. Formation of keto acids was monitored with lactate dehydrogenase as described above. In some experiments, keto acids formed from l-serine, d-serine, or l-threonine were monitored by detection of hydrazone derivatives of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as described (22Katsuki H. Yoshida T. Tanegashima C. Tanaka S. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ammonia was monitored by the oxidation of NADPH in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate dehydrogenase (ammonia kit, Sigma).Immunocytochemistry for d-Serine—Intracellular d-serine levels were revealed with an antibody against glutaraldehyde-conjugated d-serine (Mobitec, Germany). Briefly, cells were fixed for 20 min with 4.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.2% sodium metabisulfite dissolved in PBS. After reduction of the free aldehyde groups with 0.5% sodium borohydride, cells were blocked and permeabilized with 5% normal goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 min. Overnight incubation with primary antibody (1:500 dilution) was carried out at 4 °C in PBS, 5% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm of l-serine glutaraldehyde conjugate to block immunoreactivity against l-serine. Antirabbit secondary antibody was used at 1:200 in 2% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The staining was revealed by ABC Elite kit (Vector laboratories) using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as peroxidase substrate.Primary Astrocyte and Slice Cultures—Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from cerebral cortex of P0–P2 Sprague-Dawley rats as described (23Ribeiro C.S. Reis M. Panizzutti R. de Miranda J. Wolosker H. Brain Res. 2002; 929: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates in BME plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 weeks before use. Synthesis of d-serine from the cultures was monitored by HPLC as described (12De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14542-14547Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cortico-striatal organotypic slices were cut using a McIlwain tissue chopper and cultured in Millicel inserts (Millipore), as described (24Stoppini L. Buchs P.A. Muller D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). The slices were cultured in minimum essential medium-Hepes medium supplemented with 20% horse serum for 7–12 days prior to determination of d-serine.Lentivirus Production—Mouse full-length serine racemase gene was sub-cloned into pTK208 lentiviral vector (a gift from Dr. T. Kafri, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) containing CMV promoter. The virus was produced by calcium-mediated co-transfection of the lentiviral vector (5 μg), packing vector pCMV-dR8.74 (3 μg), and vesicular stomatitis virus coat envelope pMD2G (2 μg) (a gift from Prof. D. Trono, University of Geneva) in HEK 293 cells grown in 10-mm culture dishes (25Zufferey R. Nagy D. Mandel R.J. Naldini L. Trono D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Control virus consisted of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of CMV promoter. Viral stocks were produced by concentrating the viral particles present in the culture medium by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 2 h. The pellet was suspended in a small volume of BME culture medium and stored at –70 °C until use. To infect primary astrocyte cultures, viral stocks were added to cultured cells grown in 24-well plates, and the transfection efficiency was determined after 4 days with fluorescent microscopy (for GFP) or immunocytochemistry (for serine racemase). Preparations exhibiting virtually 100% transfection efficiency were employed for experiments of d-serine metabolism.RESULTSSerine racemase has been shown previously to possess two distinct catalytic activities: (i) the synthesis of d-serine and (ii) the α,β-elimination of water from l-serine to give pyruvate and ammonia (12De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14542-14547Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26Neidle A. Dunlop D.S. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1719-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). We now demonstrate that serine racemase utilizes other substrates for the α,β-elimination activity.We examined cells transfected with serine racemase for utilization of l-threonine added to the culture medium. Transfection of serine racemase is associated with a large decrease in medium l-threonine when compared with control cells transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or with a catalytically inactive mutant of the enzyme (K56G) (Fig. 1). The decrease in l-threonine levels is comparable to that observed with l-serine (Fig. 1, A and B). l-Threonine disappearance is accompanied by increases in keto acid concentration in the culture medium (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast to the production of d-serine by racemization of l-serine, d-threonine synthesis from l-threonine is not detectable, either in intact cells or with recombinant enzyme (Fig. 1, E and F, and data not shown).Fig. 1α,β-Elimination of l-threonine and l-serine in intact cells. HEK 293 cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP), an inactive mutant of SR (K56G), or mouse serine racemase (WT). A and B, levels of l-threonine (A) or l-serine (B) in media of SR-WT transfected cultures. Amino acid levels were determined 24 h after addition of 7 mm l-threonine (A) or l-serine (B) to media. C and D, keto acid produced in culture media was analyzed 24 h after addition of either 7 mm l-threonine (C) or l-serine (D). E and F, synthesis of d-amino acids in SR-transfected cells. No d-threonine synthesis was detected when media contained 7 mm l-threonine (E). Supplementation of 7 mm l-serine in culture media elicited d-serine synthesis (F). G, depletion of intracellular levels of l-threonine in SR-WT transfected cells but not in K56G mutant-transfected cells. Media contained 0.6 mm l-threonine, 7 mm l-threonine, or 7 mm l-serine. The results represent the average ± S.E. of three independent transfection experiments. *, different from control at p < 0.050 (Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of intracellular levels of l-threonine confirmed that the amino acid is a serine racemase substrate. A specific decrease in l-threonine is observed both at low (0.6 mm) and high (7 mm) concentrations of l-threonine in the medium (Fig. 1G). Even in the presence of a 10-fold higher l-serine concentration in the medium (7 mm l-serine), a decrease in cellular l-threonine is observed (Fig. 1G).To verify the characteristics of l-threonine α,β-elimination, we checked its properties in vitro. Unlike other PLP-dependent enzymes, serine racemase activity displays a unique dependence on ATP, which acts as an activator (12De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14542-14547Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, no l-threonine α,β-elimination was observed (Fig. 2A). By contrast, partial activation of l-serine α,β-elimination was achieved by increasing free magnesium concentration alone (Fig. 2A). Mg·ATP greatly stimulated l-threonine α,β-elimination with generation of 2-oxobutyrate (Fig. 2B). The concentration of Mg·ATP required for half-maximal stimulation of l-threonine utilization was somewhat higher than that required for l-serine (Fig. 2B). Hydrolysis of ATP was not required for enzyme activation and non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP stimulated threonine α,β-elimination as well (data not shown). l-Threonine utilization was optimal at alkaline pH (Fig. 2C). The Michaelis constant for l-threonine was in the millimolar range (Km = 55 mm), higher than for l-serine (Km = 10 mm), which suggests a lower affinity for the former (Table I). The efficiency of l-threonine α,β-elimination calculated by the kcat/Km ratio was 3.3 lower than that with l-serine as substrate (Table I). Ammonia generated from the aminoacrylate intermediate, formed by the α,β-elimination of water from l-threonine, was also detected (data not shown). d-Threonine (up to 100 mm) was not used as substrate by serine racemase, indicating a higher specificity for the l-form.Fig. 2Kinetic characteristics of l-threonine and l-serine α,β-elimination. Reaction medium contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 15 μm PLP, and 10 mm of either l-serine or l-threonine and different concentrations of cofactors. A, free Mg2+ stimulated l-serine, but not l-threonine α,β-elimination. B, Mg·ATP dependence for l-serine and l-threonine α,β-elimination. Free Mg2+ concentration was fixed at 100 μm by using a Mg-EDTA buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, pH dependence of l-threonine α,β-elimination. The results of A and B represent the average ± S.E. of three to four replicate experiments, and C is a representative result of three experiments done with three different enzyme preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The utilization of l-threonine by serine racemase indicates that the α,β-elimination activity displays a broader specificity than previously assumed. This prompted us to investigate α,β-elimination of additional substrates. Although considered a reaction product, we found that d-serine was strongly eliminated by serine racemase in an ATP-dependent manner, generating pyruvate and ammonia (Table I). The kcat for d-serine α,β-elimination was about one-fourth of that observed with l-serine in the presence of ATP, compared with one-tenth of l-serine α,β-elimination in the absence of ATP. The Km for d-serine in the α,β-elimination reaction was similar to that of l-serine, and the relative efficiency of d-serine α,β-elimination in the presence of ATP was 3.6 lower than that of l-serine α,β-elimination as estimated by the kcat/Km ratio (Table I).The α,β-elimination of d-serine by serine racemase is in apparent contradiction with its role in d-serine biosynthesis. Therefore, we sought to investigate in more detail the kinetic characteristics of d-serine α,β-elimination both with recombinant enzyme and in intact cells.Previous measurements of the initial rate of d-serine synthesis in vitro were carried out using a large excess of l-serine (10 mm (8Wolosker H. Sheth K.N. Takahashi M. Mothet J.P. Brady Jr., R.O. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 12De Miranda J. Panizzutti R.

Commun. 1997; 235: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). This may have masked d-serine α,β-elimination. When present at physiological-like concentration (1 mm), l-serine was rapidly consumed by the combined racemization and α,β-elimination activities of serine racemase (Fig. 3A). Under this condition, d-serine was unstable; its levels fell as the concentration of l-serine decreased, reflecting its α,β-elimination (Fig. 3B). Because EDTA impairs α,β-elimination (12De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad."
https://openalex.org/W2020670611,"A key step in the initiation of apoptosis is the release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic proteins such as Smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and endonuclease G (EndoG). Discrepancies have arisen, however, as to whether all these proteins are released in different systems. Our results suggest that failure to observe cytochrome c release may be due to the use of different buffers because after permeabilization by caspase-8 cleaved human Bid (tBid), cytochrome c dissociation from mitochondria was highly dependent on ionic strength and required 50-80 mm KCl, NaCl, or LiCl. In addition, mitochondria isolated from apoptotic cells using low ionic strength buffer bound a greater proportion of endogenous cytochrome c. In contrast to cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 were released independent of ionic strength, and AIF and EndoG behaved as if they are exposed to the intermembrane space but tethered to or within the inner membrane. AIF and EndoG were also not released by active caspases, which suggests their involvement in apoptosis may be limited. In summary, whereas tBid permeabilizes the outer membrane to cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and Omi/HtrA2, the release of cytochrome c during apoptosis will be underestimated unless sufficient ionic strength is maintained to overcome the electrostatic association of cytochrome c with membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2032093227,"PEX genes encode proteins (peroxins) that are required for the biogenesis of peroxisomes. One of these peroxins, Pex5p, is the receptor for matrix proteins with a type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1), which shuttles newly synthesized proteins from the cytosol into the peroxisome matrix. We observed that in various Saccharomyces cerevisiae pex mutants disturbed in the early stages of PTS1 import, the steady-state levels of Pex5p are enhanced relative to wild type controls. Furthermore, we identified ubiquitinated forms of Pex5p in deletion mutants of those PEX genes that have been implicated in recycling of Pex5p from the peroxisomal membrane into the cytosol. Pex5p ubiquitination required the presence of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4p and the peroxins that are required during early stages of PTS1 protein import. Finally, we provide evidence that the proteasome is involved in the turnover of Pex5p in wild type yeast cells, a process that requires Ubc4p and occurs at the peroxisomal membrane. Our data suggest that during receptor recycling a portion of Pex5p becomes ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. We propose that this process represents a conserved quality control mechanism in peroxisome biogenesis. PEX genes encode proteins (peroxins) that are required for the biogenesis of peroxisomes.

Our data suggest that during receptor recycling a portion of Pex5p becomes ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. We propose that this process represents a conserved quality control mechanism in peroxisome biogenesis. Peroxisomes are vital cell organelles and may contain highly variable sets of enzymes that control many important cellular processes. Their importance is demonstrated by the discovery of a number of inherited human metabolic disorders, with the prototype being Zellweger Syndrome, that have been associated with peroxisomal defects, varying from the non-functioning of a single peroxisomal enzyme to complete absence of the organelle (reviewed in Ref. 1Weller S. Gould S.J. Valle D. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2003; 4: 165-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal enzymes are synthesized in the cytosol and delivered post-translationally to their target organelle. To enable this sorting, these enzymes contain specific peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS), 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; protA, protein A; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; protA, protein A; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. most of which fall into two categories (reviewed in Ref. 2Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The vast majority of proteins contains a signal (PTS1) that is located at the carboxyl terminus and has a consensus sequence related to the canonical -S-K-L-COOH sequence observed in firefly luciferase (3Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). So far, only a few proteins have been discovered that utilize a PTS2 to enter peroxisomes. This signal, first described for rat 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (4Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Bodnar A.G. Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), is located at the amino terminus of proteins and has the consensus sequence (R/K)(L/V/I)X5(H/Q)(L/A). Additionally, certain proteins contain neither a PTS1 nor a PTS2, but are sorted via still unidentified signals. Finally, because folded and multimeric proteins are also imported into peroxisomes, an alternative strategy that is used by certain proteins is to hitch-hike into the organelle by binding to a protein containing a PTS (see e.g. Refs. 5Yang X. Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 6Titorenko V.I. Nicaud J.M. Wang H. Chan H. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For both peroxisomal targeting signals, separate cytosolic receptor molecules have been discovered, Pex5p for the PTS1, and Pex7p for the PTS2 (reviewed in Ref. 2Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), which appear to have a shuttling function. During the receptor cycle, Pex5p binds cargo proteins in the cytosol, sorts these to the surface of the organelle, and, subsequently, assists in transporting them across the membrane in a hitherto unknown fashion. Recent evidence suggests that the PTS1 receptor may actually accompany the cargo protein into the peroxisome, prior to its release into the lumen of the organelle (7Dammai V. Subramani S. Cell. 2001; 105: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Finally, the receptor is brought back to the cytosol for a new import cycle, a step that has been demonstrated to require ATP hydrolysis (8Oliveira M.E. Gouveia A.M. Pinto R.A. Sa-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39483-39488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Previous investigations have identified a variety of other proteins directly involved in the biogenesis of peroxisomes (termed peroxins; see Ref. 9Distel B. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Blobel G. Crane D.I. Cregg J.M. Dodt G. Fujiki Y. Goodman J.M. Just W.W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Kunau W.H. Lazarow P.B. Mannaerts G.P. Moser H.W. Osumi T. Rachubinski R.A. Roscher A. Subramani S. Tabak H.F.

Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Based on these data, specific peroxins have been suggested to function at distinct steps during peroxisome biogenesis (cf. 10Collins C.S. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. McCaffery J.M. Gould S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7516-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Peroxins that are required for the formation/maintenance of the peroxisomal membrane are Pex3p and Pex19p (11Hettema E.H. van den Girzalsky W. Berg M. Erdmann R. Distel B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a docking/translocation complex at the peroxisomal membrane has been proposed that initiates binding of cargo-loaded Pex5p molecules and, subsequently, facilitates translocation of the cargo into the peroxisomal matrix (1Weller S. Gould S.J. Valle D. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2003; 4: 165-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 2Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This large complex has been shown to consist of two subcomplexes: a docking complex, comprising Pex13p, Pex14p, and Pex17p, and a putative translocation complex consisting of Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p. These complexes are presumed to be held together by protein-protein interactions via the peroxins Pex3p or Pex8p (12Hazra P.P. Suriapranata I. Snyder W.B. Subramani S. Traffic. 2002; 3: 560-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Agne B. Meindl N.M. Niederhoff K. Einwachter H. Rehling P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Girzalsky W. Kunau W.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The intraperoxisomal peroxin Pex8p, which has so far only been discovered in yeast species, appears also to have a more direct role in matrix protein import by releasing PTS1-carrying cargo from Pex5p molecules (14Rehling P. Skaletz-Rorowski A. Girzalsky W. Voorn-Brouwer T. Franse M.M. Distel B. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 43340-43345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, a number of interacting proteins have been suggested to play a role in recycling of the empty receptor to the cytosol. These include two interacting ATPases of the AAA family, Pex1p and Pex6p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these ATPases are bound to the peroxisomal membrane by a physical interaction between Pex6p and the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex15p (see Refs. 16Birschmann I. van den Stroobants A.K. Berg M. Schäfer A. Rosenkranz K. Kunau W.H. Tabak H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2226-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and references therein). In humans, a protein only structurally related to Pex15p, which was designated Pex26p, appears to perform a similar function (17Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Additionally, two physically interacting peroxins that have so far only been found in yeast species, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Pex4p/Ubc10p and the integral membrane protein Pex22p (18Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are thought to play a role in Pex5p recycling (10Collins C.S. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. McCaffery J.M. Gould S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7516-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Kiel J.A.K.W. Rasmussen S.W. Cregg J.M. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3608-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, so far the target protein to which Pex4p actually conjugates ubiquitin has remained elusive. Despite a wealth of knowledge about which factors are involved in PTS1 matrix protein import, little is actually known what happens to the receptor Pex5p during this process. Recently, it was observed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, in human cell lines, and in plant cells that the loss of one of the peroxins proposed to function in receptor recycling, Pex1p, Pex4p, Pex6p, or Pex22p, leads to strongly reduced steady-state levels of Pex5p (18Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dodt G. Gould S.J. J.

This phenomenon has actually been used to determine the order in which a number of peroxins supposedly act in matrix protein import (10Collins C.S. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. McCaffery J.M. Gould S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7516-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this process also occurs in S. cerevisiae, we determined the steady-state levels of Pex5p in various pex mutant strains of this yeast species. Surprisingly, we observed that in mutants of those PEX genes that are directly implicated in PTS1 import, steady-state Pex5p levels are enhanced as compared with wild type cells. Furthermore, we found that the PTS1 receptor is ubiquitinated when one of the peroxins proposed to be required for Pex5p recycling was absent. Our data suggest the presence of a possible quality control mechanism at the Pex5p export site that determines whether the receptor will be recycled to the cytosol to perform another round of import or will be turned over by the proteasome.

In galactose minimal medium, 2% galactose replaced the glucose in SD medium. Oleate induction medium contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.1% glucose, 0.1% oleic acid, 0.05% Tween 40, and 0.1% yeast extract, adjusted to pH 6.0.

Open table in a new tab Biochemical Methods—Cell extracts were prepared as follows: Cells were grown to the end of the logarithmic growth phase on glucose minimal medium, galactose minimal medium, or oleate induction medium. Subsequently, the OD660 was determined and 3 OD660 units of cells were precipitated with 12.5% trichloroacetic acid, a treatment that completely destroys all proteolytic activity. After at least 30-min incubation at –80 °C, cells were precipitated and the cell pellet was washed twice with 80% acetone of –20 °C. Subsequently, the pellets were dried at room temperature and suspended in 80 μl of 1% SDS/0.1 m NaOH. Finally, after 30 min, 20 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 25% β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min at 100 °C. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out using established procedures. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein were loaded per lane, which was controlled by Ponceau S staining of total protein on blots. Western blots were decorated with specific polyclonal antibodies against Pex5p, or monoclonal antibodies against ubiquitin (clone P4D1; a gift of T. Sommer, Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany). Detection of proteins on Western blots was performed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Relative Pex5p levels were determined by laser densitometric scanning of Western blots decorated with specific antibodies against Pex5p. Immunoprecipitation of Denatured Pex5p—Immunoprecipitation was carried out using acetone-washed and dried pellets of 3 OD660 units of trichloroacetic acid precipitated yeast cells for each reaction. The pellet was suspended vigorously in 100 μl of urea cracking buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 6 m urea, 1% SDS) and incubated for 10 min at 65 °C. Subsequently, 1 ml of Tween 20-IP buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.1 mm EDTA) and 10 μl of 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were added. After pelletting undissolved material, α-Pex5p antiserum was added, and the mixture was incubated under continuous swirling for 4 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 75 μl of pre-swollen Protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C.The immunoprecipitated material was subsequently pelleted, washed two times with Tween 20-IP buffer, once with Tween 20-urea buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 m urea, 0.5% Tween 20), and once with Tris-buffered saline buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Finally, the beads were boiled in 50 μl of IP-sample buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and prepared for Western blotting. Differential Centrifugation—Spheroplasting of yeast cells, homogenization, and differential centrifugation at 100,000 × g of homogenates to separate organelles and other membranous structures from cytosolic proteins was performed essentially according to Erdmann et al. (25Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Purification of Pex5p-protA from S. cerevisiae pex4 PEX5-protA—1 liter of yeast cells, cultivated to the end of the exponential growth phase on glucose minimal medium, was used for each experiment. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with MilliQ water, and suspended in 20 ml of 12.5% trichloroacetic acid. After overnight precipitation at –80 °C, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 80% acetone of –20 °C. After thorough drying, the pellet was solubilized in 4 ml of solubilization buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaOH) by vigorous mixing with the aid of glass beads. Subsequently, the mixture was neutralized by the addition of 1 ml of 5× boiling buffer (250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10% SDS) and incubated for 5 min at 99 °C. After cooling to room temperature, 25 ml of the Tween 20-IP buffer was added. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 6,000 × g to remove undissolved material. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of Tween 20-IP buffer and, after thorough mixing, again centrifuged. Subsequently, both supernatants were combined, and the volume was brought up to 50 ml with Tween 20-IP buffer. The resulting extract contains fully denatured proteins and can if necessary be stored overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the extract was loaded on a 0.25-ml column of IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast flow (Amersham Biosciences; pre-washed in wash buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20)). After loading, the column was washed with 40 column volumes of wash buffer 1, followed by washing with 12 column volumes of wash buffer 2 (5 mm NH4Ac, pH 5.0). Finally, the bound protA-containing proteins were eluted from the column using elution buffer (0.5 m acetic acid, pH 3.4). Eluate fractions of 0.5 ml were lyophilized and analyzed by SDS/PAGE and Western blotting. Mass Spectroscopy—For mass spectroscopy, fractions with protA-containing proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250, and the protein bands were excised from the gel. Excised bands were digested with trypsin at 37 °C overnight. The tryptic peptides were extracted and spotted on a target for MALDI mass fingerprint analysis. Measurements were done on a Bruker Reflex IV instrument. Fingerprint mass analysis was performed using the ProFound algorithm. For tandem mass spectrometry analysis the same instrument was employed acquiring the post-source delay spectrum from the desired parent ion. Pex5p Is Modified in a Specific Set of S. cerevisiae pex Mutants—To investigate the steady-state levels of Pex5p in S. cerevisiae, we grew cells to the end of the logarithmic growth phase on glucose medium and determined Pex5p levels in wild type and pex mutant cells by quantification of immunoblots (Fig. 1A). The results indicate that in mutant cells affected in either the formation of the peroxisomal membrane (pex3 and pex19), or in peroxisomal matrix protein import (pex2, pex8, pex10, pex12, pex13, and pex14), Pex5p levels were much increased compared with wild type control cells. In contrast, in mutant cells that display no PTS1 import defect (e.g. pex11, pex18, and pex21), Pex5p levels remained rather similar to those observed in wild type cells. Also in pex mutants proposed to be disturbed in receptor recycling (pex1, pex4, pex6, pex15, and pex22), Pex5p levels were rather close to wild type levels. Therefore, the strong reductions in Pex5p levels observed in certain P. pastoris, human, and plants pex mutants (18Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dodt G. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 21Zolman B.K. Bartel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1786-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) are apparently not observed in S. cerevisiae pex mutants. Essentially identical results were observed when the cells were grown on oleate (data not shown). Notably, in five pex mutants (pex1, pex4, pex6, pex15, and pex22), we observed, in addition to the normal Pex5p protein band, α-Pex5p immunoreactive bands of higher Mr (Fig. 1B). These bands were most prominent in pex4 and pex22 cells and less abundant in pex1, pex6, and pex15 cells, but were never seen in pex5 cells, strongly suggesting that they indeed represent modified Pex5p molecules. Similar modification bands were also seen with oleate-induced cells (data not shown). Notably, the modification pattern of these α-Pex5p immunoreactive bands appeared to fall into two classes (Fig. 1B), which correlated well with the two interaction groups to which the corresponding peroxins belong (Pex4p/Pex22p and Pex1p/Pex6p/Pex15p (16Birschmann I. van den Stroobants A.K.

Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Currently, we can not explain this difference in modification pattern. Pex5p Is Ubiquitinated in pex1 and pex4 Mutants—We set out to identify the nature of the modifications of Pex5p observed in these specific pex mutants. First, we analyzed the possibility that the additional bands represent phosphorylated forms of Pex5p. However, dephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated Pex5p did not affect the presence of the bands (data not shown). Also, a drastic change in conformation of the PTS1 receptor Pex5p may influence its behavior on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. However, iodoacetamide treatment of samples, which should result in a more efficient unfolding of proteins, had no effect on the presence of the modifications (data not shown). To investigate whether Pex5p was modified by ubiquitination, we transformed cells of selected pex mutants with a plasmid that enables synthesis of an N-terminally Myc epitope-tagged form of ubiquitin. When a Myc-tagged ubiquitin moiety (calculated molecular mass of 10 kDa) instead of wild type ubiquitin (8.5 kDa) becomes conjugated to a target protein, a shift toward a higher molecular weight is observed. Analysis of the transformants indicated that this indeed occurred with the modified Pex5p bands (shown for pex1 and pex4 in Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 4 with lanes 2 and 5). Synthesis of Myc-tagged ubiquitin did not result in any detectable modification of Pex5p in wild type cells. Furthermore, overproduction of untagged ubiquitin did not affect Pex5p levels nor its modification. These data are indicative of Pex5p ubiquitination in this specific set of pex mutants. Additional proof for this hypothesis was obtained by immunoprecipitation of Pex5p from the relevant pex mutants followed by analysis of the precipitates by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies raised against bovine ubiquitin. α-Pex5p-specific antibodies were used as control. The results (Fig. 3, right panel) show that in α-Pex5p precipitates from pex1, pex6, and pex15 cells an identical pattern of proteins was detected with the ubiquitin antibodies, indicating the presence of ubiquitinated Pex5p species in these mutants. Similarly, in α-Pex5p precipitates from pex4 and pex22 cells a set of ubiquitinated proteins was observed, albeit with a different protein pattern than observed for pex1, pex6, and pex15 cells. These patterns were reminiscent of the Pex5p modification patterns seen in the immunoblotting experiments (cf. Fig. 1B). However, the most abundant modified Pex5p species in pex4 and pex22 cells observed in those experiments (see Fig. 1B) was hardly detectable in the α-Pex5p precipitates. To confirm that all modification bands in the pex4 mutant"
https://openalex.org/W1976616514,"Pathfinding of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at the midline optic chiasm determines whether RGCs project to ipsilateral or contralateral brain visual centers, critical for binocular vision. Using Isl2tau-lacZ knockin mice, we show that the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor Isl2 marks only contralaterally projecting RGCs. The transcription factor Zic2 and guidance receptor EphB1, required by RGCs to project ipsilaterally, colocalize in RGCs distinct from Isl2 RGCs in the ventral-temporal crescent (VTC), the source of ipsilateral projections. Isl2 knockout mice have an increased ipsilateral projection originating from significantly more RGCs limited to the VTC. Isl2 knockouts also have increased Zic2 and EphB1 expression and significantly more Zic2 RGCs in the VTC. We conclude that Isl2 specifies RGC laterality by repressing an ipsilateral pathfinding program unique to VTC RGCs and involving Zic2 and EphB1. This genetic hierarchy controls binocular vision by regulating the magnitude and source of ipsilateral projections and reveals unique retinal domains."
https://openalex.org/W1992437153,"The mechanisms that regulate the transition between the initial priming phase and DNA replication in liver regeneration are poorly understood. To study this transition, we compared events occurring after standard two-thirds partial hepatectomy, which elicits full regeneration, with response to a reduced hepatectomy, one-third partial hepatectomy (1/3PH), which leads to little DNA replication. Although the initial response to partial hepatectomy at the priming phase appeared to be similar between the two procedures, cell cycle progression was significantly blunted in 1/3PH mice. Among the main defects observed in 1/3PH mice were an almost complete deficiency in retinoblastoma phosphorylation and the lack of increase in kinase activity associated with cyclin E. We report that, in two-thirds partial hepatectomy mice, the expression of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) preceded the start of DNA replication and was not detectable in 1/3PH animals. Injection of HB-EGF into 1/3PH mice resulted in a >15-fold increase in DNA replication. Moreover, we show that hepatocyte DNA replication was delayed in HB-EGF knock-out mice. In summary, we show that HB-EGF is a key factor for hepatocyte progression through G1/S transition during liver regeneration.

This procedure induces a synchronized growth response involving almost all hepatocytes, leading to the restoration of liver mass in 7–10 days in rodents (1Grisham J.W. Cancer Res. 1962; 22: 842-849PubMed Google Scholar).Liver regeneration is a complex process involving the activation of multiple pathways. The entry of quiescent hepatocytes into the cell cycle, corresponding to the G0/G1 transition, is largely regulated by cytokines. This phase, often referred to as priming, is characterized by the increase in cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 and the activation of immediate early genes that include c-jun, c-fos, and c-myc (2Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this phase is essential for the hepatocyte response to growth factors, the priming stage is reversible. Without the involvement of growth factors, hepatocytes do not progress through cell cycle and they return to quiescence (3Webber E.M. Bruix J. Pierce R.H. Fausto N. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1226-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) are two of the most studied growth factors in liver regeneration. It has been demonstrated that the mRNA levels of both growth factors are elevated after 2/3PH (4Zarnegar R. DeFrances M.C. Kost D.P. Lindroos P. Michalopoulos G.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

By contrast, TGF-α is an autocrine factor whose effects are primarily proliferative (5Mead J.E. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1558-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). However, TGF-α knock-out mice have no defects in liver regeneration, an observation that might be explained by the redundancy of ligands of the EGF family (10Russell W.E. Kaufmann W.K. Sitaric S. Luetteke N.C. Lee D.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) has been reported to participate in liver regeneration (11Kiso S. Kawata S. Tamura S. Higashiyama S. Ito N. Tsushima H. Taniguchi N. Matsuzawa Y. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 1584-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its role has not been well characterized. Nevertheless, transgenic mice expressing HB-EGF appear to have an accelerated liver growth response after partial hepatectomy (12Kiso S. Kawata S. Tamura S. Inui Y. Yoshida Y. Sawai Y. Umeki S. Ito N. Yamada A. Miyagawa J. Higashiyama S. Iwawaki T. Saito M. Taniguchi N. Matsuzawa Y. Kohno K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 701-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).The interaction between the early events of liver regeneration and growth factor availability is crucial for the regenerative process. However, the events linking these two phases have not been characterized. Bucher and Swaffield (13Bucher N.L. Swaffield M.N. Cancer Res. 1964; 24: 1611-1625PubMed Google Scholar) show that the extent of hepatocyte replication in the regenerating liver of adult rats is proportional to the amount of tissue resected for resections involving 40–70% of the liver (13Bucher N.L. Swaffield M.N. Cancer Res. 1964; 24: 1611-1625PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of 30% of the liver lies below this threshold and does not elicit a clear wave of DNA replication. Moreover, we have previously demonstrated that continuous infusion of TGF-α or HGF for 24 h into the portal vein of rats with 30% hepatectomies or one-third partial hepatectomy (1/3PH) produced a vigorous replicative response to the growth factors (14Webber E.M. Godowski P.J. Fausto N. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicated that 1/3PH, in contrast to the standard 2/3PH, may induce hepatocyte priming that does not progress to DNA replication. We reasoned that the analysis of events occurring after 1/3PH may uncover linkages between priming and cell cycle progression that are decisive for liver regeneration. Here we show that HB-EGF is a key factor for the progression of hepatocytes through the G1/S phases.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and Surgical Procedures—8–10-week-old male wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. HB-EGF-null male mice were from a hybrid C57BL/6 × 129/Sv background (15Jackson L.F. Qiu T.H. Sunnarborg S.W. Chang A. Zhang C. Patterson C. Lee D.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2704-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In experiments using HB-EGF–/– mice, the wild-type controls were from the same hybrid background. Partial hepatectomies were performed under general anesthesia with inhaled isofluorane. One-third hepatectomy consisted of ligating the pedicle of the left lateral lobe before excising it. Two-thirds hepatectomy was performed as described by Higgins and Anderson (16Higgins G. Anderson R. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-212Google Scholar). Sham surgery consisted of a midline laparotomy with gentle manipulation of the liver. Surgeries were performed between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., and mice were killed at different time points after surgery as described in the legends of the figures. All of the animal work was done in accordance with the animal care committees of the University of Washington and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Growth Factor Injections—For the growth factor experiment, male wild-type C57BL/6 mice received a bolus injection of 0.1 mg/kg HB-EGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; dissolved in 0.9% NaCl), HGF (a gift from Genentech, San Francisco, CA; dissolved in 0.5 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6), or TGF-α (R&D Systems; dissolved in 0.9% NaCl) through the tail vein 24 h after a one-third partial hepatectomy. Mice were killed 36 h after hepatectomy and 12 h after growth factor injection.BrdUrd Immunohistochemistry—Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of BrdUrd (50 mg/kg) (Roche Applied Science) 2 h before killing. Livers were fixed in methacarn (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, and 10% acetic acid) overnight at room temperature and then embedded in paraffin. BrdUrd incorporation was measured using a mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and the Elite Vectastain ABC kit (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described previously (17Vail M.E. Chaisson M.L. Thompson J. Fausto N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1548-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For each liver sample, ∼3,000 hepatocytes were counted.Western Blot Analyses—Total liver protein was isolated from snap-frozen tissue by homogenization in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer described previously and briefly sonicated (17Vail M.E. Chaisson M.L. Thompson J. Fausto N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1548-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (18Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Proteins (30 μg for total liver protein and 10 μg for nuclear extracts) were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE (29:1 (v/v) acrylamide:Bis) gels with the exception of phospho-retinoblastoma (Rb) blots in which 10% (30:0.4 (v/v) acrylamide:Bis) SDS-PAGE gels were used and TGF-α blot in which Tris-Tricine 10–20% gels (Bio-Rad) were used. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and blocked in 5% milk TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) prior to incubation with primary antibody. The following antibodies were used: cyclin A (sc-596, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); p21 (556431, BD Biosciences); phospho-Rb (Ser-807/811, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); cyclin D1 (AHF 082, BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA); cyclin E (06–459, UBI, Lake Placid, NY); p107 (sc-318, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); TGF-α (clone MF9, LabVision, Fremont, CA); and β-actin (A5316, Sigma). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Lightning Chemiluminescence reagent, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for detection.Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—For cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (Cdk-4) immunoprecipitation, total protein lysates (500 μg) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Cdk-4 antibody (sc-260, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) (30 μl of 1:1 (v/v) in lysis buffer) was added for 90 min, and the bound complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subsequently resuspended in 2× sample buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Blotting was performed as described above with cyclin D1 antibody.For cyclin E/Cdk-2 kinase assay (cyclin E-associated kinase assay), 500 μg of liver lysate were incubated with 1 μg of anti-cyclin E antibody 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (30 μl of 1:1 (v/v) in lysis buffer) was added for 2 h, and the bound complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in 1× kinase buffer (3× kinase buffer: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were resuspended in 10 μl of 3× kinase buffer to which 1.2 μg of histone H1, 10 mm ATP, and 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added. The samples were subsequently incubated at 30 °C for 25 min, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, and 32P-labeled proteins were quantified by scintillation counting of excised bands.Ribonuclease Protection Assays (RPA)—Total RNA was extracted from frozen liver tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Total RNA (10 μg) was then subjected to the RiboQuant Multi-Probe ribonuclease protection assay system (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The following sets of Multi-Probe templates (BD Biosciences) were used: c-myc (number 556193) and two custom probe sets, A and B. The custom probe set A included the following mouse DNA templates: c-jun; HGF; p53; c-fos, HB-EGF; TGF-β1; fatty-acid synthase; L32; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The custom probe set B included the following templates: tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1; SOCS-3; KC (a cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant); ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule); SOCS-1; IL-6; interferon-γ; IL-12; L32; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Samples were loaded on a 6% Tris borate-EDTA/urea gel (Invitrogen) at 150 V for 1.5 h. Gels were subsequently dried, and signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager. To control for equal loading between samples, the level of each mRNA species was normalized against the level of the housekeeping gene transcript, L32.Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—One microgram of total RNA from livers was used for the Reverse Transcriptase reaction using Applied Biosystems TaqMan reverse transcription kit, and then one-tenth of the reaction was employed for the real-time PCR analysis. Assay kits for mouse TGF-α and amphiregulin from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) were used for the quantification of the expression of these genes in an Applied Biosystems 7900HT SDS instrument. The housekeeping gene mouse β-glucuronidase (Applied Biosystems) was used to normalize the measurements using the Δ-Δ Ct method. The PCR conditions were the standard when using TaqMan hydrolysis probes.Statistical Analysis—Statistical calculations were performed using the software Statview 4.5 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The Mann-Whitney test and the ANOVA Student's t test were used. p values lower than 0.05 were accepted as significant. Error bars indicate the mean ± S.E.RESULTSA Lack of Synchronized DNA Replication after 1/3PH in Mice—In rats, the removal of 30% of the liver results in little DNA replication (13Bucher N.L. Swaffield M.N. Cancer Res. 1964; 24: 1611-1625PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yusuf A. Laconi E. Rao P.M. Rajalakshmi S. Sarma D.S. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To determine whether 1/3PH also fails to elicit a wave of hepatocyte replication in mice, we analyzed DNA replication of hepatocytes after 1/3PH at different times after surgery and compared with DNA replication after 2/3PH. We observed a striking difference in the proportion of hepatocytes that incorporated BrdUrd from 30 to 72 h after partial hepatectomy between these procedures (Fig. 1A). At 36 h, which corresponds to the peak of DNA replication after 2/3PH, the livers of mice with 2/3PH had almost 10-fold higher levels of DNA replication compared with animals with 1/3PH. The mitotic index determined 48 h after hepatectomy was ∼5 times higher in 2/3PH mice compared with 1/3PH animals (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrated that, after a 1/3PH, there is lack of a robust synchronous wave of DNA replication and that this procedure can serve as a model for the analysis of incomplete regeneration.Priming Phase Present after 1/3PH—To identify factors that may be responsible for the incomplete regenerative response after 1/3PH, we first examined the expression of a few representative genes that are known to be highly expressed during the priming phase that occurs during the first few hours after partial hepatectomy. It is well established that c-jun, c-fos, and c-myc are transiently expressed between 1 and 4 h after 2/3PH as part of the immediate early gene response (20Morello D. Fitzgerald M.J. Babinet C. Fausto N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3185-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Alcorn J.A. Feitelberg S.P. Brenner D.A.

RPA analysis revealed that these three genes were similarly expressed in 1/3PH and 2/3PH from 30 min to 8 h post-surgery (Fig. 2A and data not shown). We also found that the expression of genes that participate in the acute phase response, such as IL-6 and SOCS-3, are similarly expressed after 1/3PH and 2/3PH (Fig. 2, B and C). These findings are in agreement with and greatly extend a previous report that suggested that 1/3PH can trigger a priming response (14Webber E.M. Godowski P.J. Fausto N. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and it is consistent with data from DNA microarray gene expression analyses in progress in the laboratory. 2J. Li, C.

Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar). It is well established that Cdk-2 complexed with either cyclin E or A cooperates with cyclin D-Cdk-4/6 to phosphorylate the Rb and related p107 and p130 proteins. The phosphorylated proteins release bound E2F transcription factor, which stimulates the expression of genes required for S-phase (24Costa R.H. Kalinichenko V.V. Holterman A.X. Wang X. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 1331-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the expression and activity of key regulators of the G1/S transition from 24 to 48 h after 1/3PH compared with 2/3PH mice. First, we analyzed the expression of the Rb and of p107, another member of the Rb family. In 2/3PH livers, the phosphorylation of Rb was detected at 30 h after hepatectomy and remained throughout the period of time studied (Fig. 3A). In marked contrast, we could not detect phosphorylated Rb after 1/3PH during the same period of time. The expression of p107 was detectable but greatly diminished in 1/3PH (Fig. 3A). We also analyzed the expression of p21, cyclin A, and cyclin D1 and cyclin E complexes, proteins associated with the G1/S transition. In 2/3PH, we detected cyclin A and p21 expression from 24/30 to 48 h (the last time point sampled in Fig. 3A). However, in 1/3PH mice, the expression of these proteins was delayed, diminished, and of shorter duration (Fig. 3A). The expression of the Cdk-4/cyclin D1 complex was more robust and longer lasting in 2/3PH than in 1/3PH, even though the total levels of cyclin D1 did not vary after either procedure (Fig. 3B). Finally, the kinase activity associated with cyclin E increased only in 2/3PH mice (Fig. 3C). Altogether, these results showed that there are well defined differences between 1/3PH and 2/3PH regarding the expression of various cell cycle proteins. Whereas 2/3PH hepatocytes are clearly committed to proliferation between 24 and 48 h after the operation, at identical time points, 1/3PH hepatocytes do not exhibit protein expression patterns characteristic of the G1/S transition.Fig. 3Analysis of cell cycle proteins.

Rickheim D.G. Timchenko N.A. Stanley M.W. Albrecht J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8564-8568PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the expression of growth factors from 12 to 36 h after 1/3PH and 2/3PH. The 12–24-h time period corresponds to a phase that precedes the G1/S transition (see Fig. 1). We first examined, by RPA and real-time PCR, the liver mRNA levels of the two main growth factors implicated in liver regeneration, TGF-α and HGF. TGF-α mRNA levels increased at 36 h only in 2/3PH mice (Fig. 4A), but there were no obvious differences in HGF mRNA levels between 1/3PH and 2/3PH at the time points examined (Fig. 4B). Given that the expression of HGF and TGF-α mRNA at 12–24 h after hepatectomy (a period of time that precedes the G1/S transition) was similar in 1/3PH and 2/3PH, we determined whether HB-EGF might be differentially expressed in these two procedures. In 2/3PH, HB-EGF mRNA expression approximately doubled between 12 and 24 h after 2/3PH and returned to basal levels at 30 h (Fig. 4C). In marked contrast, there was no increase in HB-EGF after 1/3PH. At 24 h after partial hepatectomy, HB-EGF levels were ∼10-fold higher in 2/3PH compared with 1/3PH. Thus, the elevated HB-EGF levels are correlated with liver regeneration and precede the activation of cell cycle proteins. We conclude from these experiments that HB-EGF might be a key factor in determining cell cycle progression in regenerating liver and that its deficiency could be associated with incomplete regeneration.Fig. 4Growth factors expression levels after hepatectomy. The mRNA levels of TGF-α (A), HGF (B), and HB-EGF (C) were analyzed at different time points post-surgery. The HB-EGF and HGF levels were assessed by RPA, and the levels of TGF-α were assessed by real-time PCR as described under “Material and Methods.” The relative mRNA levels were obtained by normalizing each sample against sham-operated mice (n = 3 animals/group). *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HB-EGF at a Low Dosage Stimulates DNA Replication in 1/3PH Mice—We compared the effects of small dosages of HB-EGF, TGF-α, and HGF in stimulating DNA synthesis in animals subjected to 30% hepatectomies. We gave a single injection of 0.1 mg/kg of each of these growth factors to 1/3PH mice 24 h after the surgery, and the animals were killed 12 h after growth factor treatment. HB-EGF injection increased DNA replication by >15-fold in 1/3PH mice but had little or no effect in sham-operated animals (Fig. 5A). Moreover, DNA replication in 1/3PH mice injected with HB-EGF was >8-fold higher than that of 1/3PH animals injected with either HGF or TGF-α (Fig. 5, A–D). These data demonstrate that HB-EGF triggers DNA replication in 1/3PH mice at a dose in which HGF and TGF-α are without significant effects. Injections of any of the growth factors into sham-operated mice had little effect on hepatocyte DNA replication.Fig. 5Effect of growth factor (GF) injection in DNA replication. Mice were either submitted to 1/3PH or to sham operation. 24 h later, they received a bolus injection of 0.1 mg/kg HB-EGF, TGF-α, or HGF.

These knock-out mice are viable and do not present abnormalities during liver development or in non-injured livers. We performed 2/3PH in HB-EGF knock-out mice and found that hepatocyte DNA replication in these animals was delayed and significantly lower at 30 and 36 h after partial hepatectomy compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 6A). Despite its delayed onset, the levels of DNA hepatocyte DNA replication in HB-EGF knock-out mice at 42 and 48 h after partial hepatectomy did not differ from the levels in wild-type mice. To investigate whether other ligands of the EGF family may compensate in part for the lack of HB-EGF in the knock-out animals, we analyzed the expression of TGF-α and amphiregulin mRNAs in these animals. TGF-α mRNA was significantly increased at 24 h after 2/3PH in the knock-out mice compared with wild-type animals (Fig. 6B), but there was no difference in the expression of amphiregulin between wild-type and knock-out animals after 2/3PH (data not shown). In agreement with these findings, we detected a higher TGF-α protein expression at 36 h post-hepatectomy in the HB-EGF knockouts compared with the wild-type mice (Fig. 6C). These data indicate that the lack of HB-EGF does affect the kinetics of liver regeneration and that increases in TGF-α expression may compensate for the absence of HB-EGF.Fig. 6Liver regeneration after 2/3PH in HB-EGF knock-out mice.

Therefore, we asked whether αIIbβ3 might also interact with PKC. Of the several PKC isoforms expressed in platelets, only PKCβ co-immunoprecipitated with αIIbβ3 in response to the interaction of platelets with soluble or immobilized fibrinogen. PKCβ recruitment to αIIbβ3 was accompanied by a 9-fold increase in PKC activity in αIIbβ3 immunoprecipitates. RACK1, an intracellular adapter for activated PKCβ, also co-immunoprecipitated with αIIbβ3, but in this case, the interaction was constitutive. Broad spectrum PKC inhibitors blocked both PKCβ recruitment to αIIbβ3 and the spread of platelets on fibrinogen. Similarly, mouse platelets that are genetically deficient in PKCβ spread poorly on fibrinogen, despite normal agonist-induced fibrinogen binding. In a Chinese hamster ovary cell model system, adhesion to fibrinogen caused green fluorescent protein-PKCβI to associate with αIIbβ3 and to co-localize with it at lamellipodial edges. These responses, as well as Chinese hamster ovary cell migration on fibrinogen, were blocked by the deletion of the β3 cytoplasmic tail or by co-expression of a RACK1 mutant incapable of binding to β3. These studies demonstrate that the interaction of αIIbβ3 with activated PKCβ is regulated by integrin occupancy and can be mediated by RACK1 and that the interaction is required for platelet spreading triggered through αIIbβ3. Furthermore, the studies extend the concept of αIIbβ3 as a scaffold for multiple protein kinases that regulate the platelet actin cytoskeleton.

Furthermore, the studies extend the concept of αIIbβ3 as a scaffold for multiple protein kinases that regulate the platelet actin cytoskeleton. In addition to their roles in cell adhesion, integrins transmit signals in both directions across the plasma membrane to regulate cytoskeletal organization, motility, and other anchorage-dependent cellular responses (1Hynes R. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6687) Google Scholar). In platelets, for example, αIIbβ3 responds to “inside-out” signals with an increase in affinity for cognate ligands such as fibrinogen that bridge platelets to each other and mediate platelet adhesion to sites of vascular damage. In turn, ligand binding to αIIbβ3 triggers outside-in signals that promote cytoskeletal changes necessary for full platelet aggregation and spreading (2Hartwig J.H. Barkalow K. Azim A. Italiano J.

Bidirectional αIIbβ3 signaling is controlled, in part, by specific intracellular proteins that interact with the relatively short cytoplasmic tails of αIIb or β3.

Several other intracellular proteins, for example, CIB and β3-endonexin, can also bind to αIIb or β3 tails, respectively, and may influence αIIbβ3 functions (7Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J.

However, the full complement of intracellular proteins that are capable of interacting directly or indirectly with αIIbβ3 is unknown. The protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; RACK, receptor for activated PKC; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; RACK, receptor for activated PKC; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. subfamily of AGC serine/threonine kinases has been implicated in integrin function or dynamics in many cell types (10Ivaska J. Kermorgant S. Whelan R. Parsons M. Ng T. Parker P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 90-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In platelets, PKC is thought to regulate αIIbβ3 affinity, based on the stimulatory effects of phorbol esters, which bind to PKC C1 domains, and the blocking effects of broad spectrum PKC inhibitors (3Shattil S.J. Newman P.J. Blood. 2004; 104: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, the lack of specificity of these compounds limits data interpretation and does not permit conclusions about the roles of specific PKC isoforms (11Brose N. Rosenmund C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4399-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). PKCs have been categorized as classical (diacylglycerol- and Ca2+-regulated through C1 and C2 domains, respectively), novel (Ca2+-independent but diacylglycerol-regulated), or atypical (Ca2+- and diacylglycerol-independent) (12Newton A.C.

Blood. 2003; 101: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, experimental tools have become available to study specific PKC isoforms in cells, including overexpression, gene targeting and gene knock-down strategies, and molecular imaging (23Irie N. Sakai N. Ueyama T. Kajimoto T. Shirai Y. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Toker A. Newton A.C. Protein Kinase C Protocols. 233.

Some of these tools are potentially relevant to platelets. PKC function depends on the maturation of catalytic activity of the enzyme through phosphorylation and PKC binding to membranes or specific proteins. The latter interactions place PKC in proximity to substrates and relieve autoinhibitory restraints imposed by the binding of a pseudosubstrate sequence to the active site (12Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 26Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). One group of PKC targeting proteins has been termed RACK, which binds selectively to activated PKCs (27Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The best characterized protein of this group is RACK1, a 36-kDa protein composed of seven WD40 repeats. RACK1 was originally identified based on its interaction with activated PKCβ and subsequently shown to interact with certain other PKC isoforms and with several other proteins, most notably integrin β cytoplasmic tails and c-Src (see Fig. 1A) (28Liliental J. Chang D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 29Chang B.Y. Chiang M.L. Cartwright C.A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Given the potential for the cytoplasmic tails of αIIbβ3 to serve as binding sites for signaling molecules and the apparent functional relationships between PKC and αIIbβ3, the present studies were carried out to determine whether specific PKCs associate with αIIbβ3 and if so to determine what the functional relevance of the association is. By using human and mouse platelets and a CHO cell model system, the results show that one particular PKC isoform, PKCβ, inducibly associates with αIIbβ3 in response to fibrinogen binding to cells. The PKCβ/αIIbβ3 interaction appears to be mediated by RACK1 and is required for cytoskeletal reorganization and platelet spreading on fibrinogen, but it is dispensable for the affinity modulation of αIIbβ3. Reagents—Monoclonal antibodies to PKCα, -β, -δ, -τ, -ϵ, -λ, and -ι were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and antibodies specific for PKCβI, PKCβII, or cortactin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The phospho-specific antibody to c-Src, tyrosine 418, was from BIOSOURCE, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies 4G10 and PY20 were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Monoclonal antibody 327 to c-Src was from Dr. Joan Brugge (Harvard Medical School), and monoclonal antibody D57 (specific for αIIbβ3) and polyclonal antibody Rb8053 (specific for integrin β3) were from Dr. Mark H. Ginsberg (University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad, and Cy-5- and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Rhodamine-phalloidin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), purified human fibrinogen was from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN), and protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences. Cell-permeable PKC antagonist peptide p99 was purchased from Stanford University (31Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Src kinase inhibitor SU6656 was from SUGEN, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Platelet agonists were from Sigma, except for convulxin, which was a gift from Dr. Steve Watson (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK). Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Transfections—A5 CHO cells stably expressing αIIbβ3 were maintained in culture as described previously (32O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed at 70-80% confluency using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours later, the concentration of fetal calf serum was decreased from 10 to 0.5%, and cells were cultured for another 24 h before being used in functional assays. Mammalian expression plasmids included pEGFP-PKCβI (a chimera containing GFP fused to the N terminus of full-length PKCβI (a gift from Dr. Stephen S. G. Ferguson, Robarts Research Institute, Ontario, Canada)), pRC-CMV/Src (encoding wild-type non-neuronal murine c-Src), and pcDNA/RACK1/WD6/7/HA (a hemagglutinin-tagged chimera containing RACK1 WD repeats 6 and 7). To construct the latter, pTarget/WD6/7 (a gift from Dr. Arnaud Besson, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) was subjected to PCR using Platinum Pfx polymerase to introduce a5′-KpnI site and a hemagglutinin tag-3′-XhoI site. After digestion and ligation into pcDNA3.1, transformed colonies were screened by colony PCR, and coding sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were amplified and purified before use (QIAfilter plasmid Maxi kit, Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Interaction of Cells with Fibrinogen—Human platelets or mouse platelets from PKCβ-/-, PKCβ+/-, and PKCβ+/+ littermates (33Leitges M. Schmedt C. Guinamard R. Davoust J. Schaal S. Stabel S. Tarakhovsky A. Science. 1996; 273: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) were obtained from fresh, anticoagulated whole blood and were washed and resuspended to 3 × 108 cells/ml in a platelet incubation buffer (34Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X-D. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Ministri K. Hughes P. Forsyth J. Turner M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Tybulewicz V. Phillips D.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PKCβ status of mouse platelets was established by genotyping the animals and by Western blotting of platelet lysates. CHO cells were harvested using 0.5 mm EDTA, washed once in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, resuspended to 3 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated for 45 min in the presence 20 μm cycloheximide. Binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-fibrinogen to mouse platelets was quantified by flow cytometry (35Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Ministri K. Hughes P. Forsyth J. Turner M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Tybulewicz V. Phillips D.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effects of soluble fibrinogen binding on the interaction of intracellular proteins with αIIbβ3, platelets or CHO cells were incubated for 20 or 30 min, respectively, with 250 μg/ml fibrinogen in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm MnCl2 (to activate αIIbβ3) (36Litvinov R.I. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Blood. 2004; (10.1182/blood-2004-04-1411, in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and in some cases with 2 mm RGDS (to block fibrinogen binding). Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized for 10 min on ice in a lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and inhibitors (1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were clarified at 4 °C by sedimentation at 10,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. To test the effects of cell adhesion to fibrinogen, 100-mm bacterial culture dishes were precoated with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 100 μg/ml fibrinogen. After blocking with heat-denatured BSA, 4.5 × 108 platelets in 1.5 ml or 3 × 106 CHO cells in 2 ml were added to each dish, and incubations were carried out in a CO2 incubator for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells from the BSA plates were sedimented and lysed immediately. Cells adherent to fibrinogen were gently washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed on the plates, and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Five hundred-microliter aliquots of lysate containing equal amounts of protein (ranging from 500 to 800 μg, depending on the experiment) were incubated with relevant antibodies for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Then, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% v/v) were added for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and samples were electrophoresed in 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrotransfer to nitrocellulose, Western blotting was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence for detection (Supersignal West Pico substrate, Pierce). PKC Activity Measurements—αIIbβ3 was immunoprecipitated from platelet lysates with antibody Rb8053 and protein A-Sepharose. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and resuspended in kinase buffer and [32P]ATP, and PKC activity was measured using a substrate peptide (QKRPSQRSKYL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (PKC assay kit, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Cell Spreading and Migration Assays—Glass coverslips were coated with 100 μg/ml fibrinogen, washed cells were allowed to adhere for 45 min at room temperature, and cell morphology and spreading were assessed by confocal microscopy (6Obergfell A. Eto K. Mocsai A. Buensuceso C. Moores S.L. Brugge J.S. Lowell C.A. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 34Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X-D. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study CHO cell migration on fibrinogen, cells were serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and 1-ml aliquots were seeded at 30,000 cells/ml onto fibrinogen-coated coverslips. After 1 h, cells were microinjected with a 50 μg/ml solution of RACK1 WD6/7 and/or GFP-PKCβI or GFP. Microinjected cells were monitored in real time in a temperature-controlled environment chamber using a Nikon TE2000U microscope. Images were acquired every 10 min for a 6-h period with a CoolSnap HQ charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) running on a Linux work station using ISee software (ISee Imaging Systems, Raleigh, NC). At the end of the filming period, cells were stained with an antibody to hemagglutinin tag to detect those cells expressing RACK1 WD6/7. Interactions between αIIbβ3and RACK1 in Platelets—The RACK1 adapter molecule contains binding sites for c-Src, certain isoforms of activated PKC, and integrin β cytoplasmic tails (Fig. 1A) (27Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 29Chang B.Y. Chiang M.L. Cartwright C.A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In platelets, αIIbβ3 is constitutively associated with c-Src, and fibrinogen binding leads to c-Src activation (5Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarker S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered whether RACK1 might also be associated with αIIbβ3. Washed human platelets were allowed to adhere for 30 min to immobilized fibrinogen or incubated in suspension over BSA. During this time, adherent platelets reorganize their actin cytoskeletons and spread to varying degrees (34Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X-D. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing and cell lysis in buffer containing Nonidet P-40 detergent, αIIbβ3 immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of RACK1 by Western blotting. αIIbβ3 associated with RACK1 whether platelets were in suspension or adherent to fibrinogen (Fig. 1B). Therefore, potential relationships among αIIbβ3, RACK1, and PKC were assessed. Interactions between αIIbβ3and PKC in Platelets—As reported previously (14Baldassare J.J. Henderson P.A. Burns D.

Of the PKC isoforms detected, only PCKβ was inducibly associated with αIIbβ3 in response to platelet adhesion to fibrinogen (Fig. 2B). In addition, when platelets were incubated in suspension for 10 min with 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to activate PKC, PKCβ became associated with αIIbβ3 (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained if platelets were stimulated instead with 50 μm PAR1 thrombin receptor-activating peptide (SSFLRN) or if murine platelets were used instead of human platelets (data not shown). There are two splice variants of PKCβ, PCKβI and PKCβII, in which the sequences differ in the C-terminal V5 region (37Kawakami T. Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Human platelets are reported to contain both variants (16Khan W.A. Blobe G. Halpern A. Taylor W. Wetsel W.C. Burns D. Loomis C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5063-5068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we could detect both in human and mouse platelets with variant-specific antibodies (data not shown). The platelet studies described below used an antibody that recognizes both variants of PKCβ. The inducible association of PKCβ with αIIbβ3 could be a direct consequence of fibrinogen binding and αIIbβ3 clustering (38Buensuceso C. de Virgilio M. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15217-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or the result of additional signaling events stimulated during platelet spreading caused by co-stimulation with endogenous ADP (3Shattil S.J. Newman P.J. Blood. 2004; 104: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, the association of PKCβ with αIIbβ3 that was induced by platelet adhesion to fibrinogen was not affected by the presence of 2 μm apyrase, an amount of enzyme sufficient to remove any ADP that might be released from the platelets (Fig. 2B). In addition, soluble fibrinogen binding to platelets in suspension was induced with 0.5 mm MnCl2, which activates αIIbβ3 directly. Under these conditions, PKCβ became associated with αIIbβ3 as early as 30 s after fibrinogen binding, the earliest time point tested, and the association was stable for up to 20 min (Fig. 2C). This association was maintained even if platelets were pretreated with 10 μm latrunculin A to block actin polymerization (data not shown). However, the interaction was blocked by 2 mm RGDS, a competitive inhibitor peptide of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 (Fig. 2C), and it was not observed whether fibrinogen was omitted from the incubation mixture. Thus, the recruitment of PKCβ to αIIbβ3 is caused by fibrinogen binding and is not the result of additional signaling events induced by ADP co-stimulation. Factors Regulating PKCβ Association with αIIbβ3—Recruitment of PKC to plasma membranes often coincides with PKC activation (12Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). To test PKC activity associated with αIIbβ3, platelets were incubated with MnCl2 with or without fibrinogen for up to 20 min, and PKC activity was quantified in αIIbβ3 immunoprecipitates. Immunoprecipitates from control platelets incubated with MnCl2 or fibrinogen alone displayed relatively low PKC activity. However, αIIbβ3 immunoprecipitates from platelets incubated with MnCl2 and fibrinogen displayed a significant increase in PKC activity, even at 30 s (p ≤ 0.001). At 20 min, this increase was 9-fold over baseline, which was 25-30% of the response observed with maximal PKC activation by PMA, and it could be blocked by RGDS (Fig. 3A). In addition, the fibrinogen-dependent increase in the association of PKCβ with αIIbβ3 was blocked partially by p99, a cell-permeable pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor of classical and novel PKCs (31Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and by bisindolylmaleimide I, a general PKC inhibitor (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that fibrinogen binding stimulates an increase in PKC activity associated with αIIbβ3 and suggest that the association of PKCβ with αIIbβ3 requires catalytically active PKCβ. The activity and subcellular localization of classical PKCs are influenced by phosphorylation and products of phospholipid hydrolysis, e.g. Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (12Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Because fibrinogen binding to platelets leads to both the activation of integrin-associated c-Src (5Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarker S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and the association of active PKCβ with αIIbβ3, functional relationships between PKC and c-Src were examined. In fibrinogen-adherent platelets, 2 μm SU6656, a selective inhibitor of Src family kinases, failed to block the interaction of PKCβ with αIIbβ3 (Fig. 4A), despite the fact that it adequately blocked c-Src activation, as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src activation loop Tyr-418 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the inhibition of PKC by 12 μm bisindolylmaleimide I failed to block the activation of integrin-associated c-Src (data not shown). Platelet and αIIbβ3Responses Dependent on PKCβ—Prominent responses following platelet adhesion to fibrinogen include reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and spreading (34Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X-D. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forty-five minutes after plating on fibrinogen, normal human platelets were generally well spread and exhibited prominent F-actin cables and a peripheral distribution of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (Fig. 5B). In contrast, platelets incubated with the cell-permeable p99 peptide to inhibit classical and novel PKCs attached to fibrinogen and displayed filopodia but largely failed to reorganize their cytoskeletons, develop a peripheral distributi"

In this study, we sought to determine whether PPARα activation increases MTP expression and activity. Treatment with Wy increased hepatic MTP expression and activity in rats and mice and increased MTP expression in primary cultures of rat and mouse hepatocytes. Addition of actinomycin D blocked this increase and the MTP promoter (–136 to +67) containing a conserved DR1 element was activated by Wy, showing that PPARα activates transcription of the gene. Wy did not affect MTP expression in the intestine or in cultured hepatocytes from PPARα-null mice. A retinoid X receptor agonist (9-cis-retinoic acid), but not a PPARγ agonist (rosiglitazone), increased MTP mRNA expression in cultured hepatocytes from both wild type and PPARα-null mice. In rat hepatocytes incubated with Wy, MTP mRNA levels increased between 6 and 24 h, and MTP protein expression and apoB-100 secretion increased between 24 and 72 h. In conclusion, PPARα activation stimulates hepatic MTP expression via increased transcription of the <i>Mtp</i> gene. This effect is paralleled by a change in apoB-100 secretion, indicating that the effect of Wy on apoB-100 secretion is mediated by increased expression of MTP."

We present evidence that intactness of the gene is required for maintenance of the normal life span of the fruit flies. In contrast, overexpression of dDnmt2 could extend Drosophila life span. The study links the Drosophila DNA methylation program with the small heatshock proteins and longevity/aging and has interesting implication on the eukaryotic DNA methylation programs in general. DNA methylation at cytosines of the vertebrate genomes participates in the control of several interlinked biological processes, e.g. gene expression, cell growth, genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and embryogenesis, which in turn are mediated through chromatin remodeling (1Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5447) Google Scholar, 2Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). The vertebrate DNA methyltransferases, including Dnmt1, Dnmt2, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3L, are a family of proteins with highly conserved motifs in their carboxyl regions. Of these, Dnmt1 is the maintenance enzyme. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b carry out the de novo methylation reaction. Unlike the above three enzymes, Dnmt2 lacks the N-terminal regulatory region (2Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have demonstrated residual DNA methylation activities of the mammalian Dnmt2 proteins and the Drosophila ortholog dDnmt2 (3Reddy M. Tang L.Y. Lee T.L. Shen C-K.J.

We present evidence below that dDnmt2 is a regulator of the life span of Drosophila. Drosophila Strains and Culture Conditions—dDnmt2GS12412 stock was a kind gift from Dr. T. Aigaki at Tokyo Metropolitan University. yw strain, the recipient stock of Gene Search (GS) insertion, was used as an internal control in the longevity experiment. UAS-dDnmt2 transgene was inserted in pUAST vector as described (10Tang L.Y. Reddy M.N. Rasheva V. Lee T.L. Lin M.J. Hung M.S. Shen C-K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33613-33616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reference background for transgenic lines was w1118. UAS-dDnmt2 females were crossed with the da-GAL4 males or w1118 males, and the life span of progeny was assessed. Flies were reared at 25 °C and maintained in vials containing standard cornmeal agar medium. To monitor the life span, flies eclosed within 24 h were collected in single-sex groups of 20. They were then transferred to fresh medium and scored for survivorship once every 3 days until all of the flies died. Stress Resistance—For thermal stress test, 4-day-old flies were transferred to new vials, maintained, and scored for survivorship at 36 °C. To examine the effect of starvation, flies were transferred to vials containing two 2.4-cm glass-fiber filter circles (Whatman) moisturized with 350 μl of distilled water. The survivals were followed at 25 °C. Distilled water was added to keep the filters moist during the test. Paraquat resistance was performed as follows. Whatman glass-fiber filter circles soaked with 350 μl of 20 mm paraquat (Sigma) in 5% sucrose solution were placed in clean empty vials. To minimize the variation generated by differential rates of paraquat intake, 3-day-old flies were first starved for 6 h and then transferred to vials containing the parauqat-wetted filters. The survival was scored at 25 °C in the dark. RT 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; GS, Gene Search; SOD, the superoxide dismutase gene.-PCR Analysis—The expression levels of different genes were assayed by semiquantitative PCR. For this, total RNAs were isolated from adult flies of the four different genotypes UAS-dDnmt2〈1〉/+, UAS-dDnmt2〈1〉/+;da-Ga14/+, yw, and dDnmt2GS12412, respectively, and reverse transcribed for subscequent PCR reactions using DNA primers specific for different Drosophila genes. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Sequences of the primers are available upon request. Ubiquitous Expression of UAS-dDnmt2 transgene driven by daughterless(da)-GAL4 resulted in 2–4-fold higher amounts of dDnmt2 in three independent UAS-dDnmt2/+;da-GAL4/+ lines. RT-PCR data of one of the lines, UAS-dDnmt2〈1〉/+;da-GAL4/+, is shown in lanes 2 and 4 of Fig. 1A in comparison with the controls (lanes 1 and 3, Fig. 1A). The UAS-dDnmt2-〈1〉/+;da-GAL4/+ flies had a great increase of their mean life span (58%) in comparison with the da-GAL4/+ flies (Fig. 1A). Their mean life span was also significantly extended, by 16%, when compared with the UAS-dDnmt2〈1〉/+ flies (Fig. 1A). The other two dDnmt2-overexpressing lines had a longer life span as well (data not shown). In contrast to the above is a P element line dDnmt2GS12412, in which a Gene Search vector (11Seong K.H. Ogashiwa T. Matsuo T. Fuyama Y. Aigaki T. Biogerontology. 2001; 2: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was inserted in exon 1 of the dDnmt2 gene. dDnmt2GS12412 is homozygous viable and the level of its dDnmt2 RNA is at least 50% lower than the control yw line, which is the recipient stock of the GS insertion (compare lanes 1 and 2, Fig. 1B; see also Fig. 2A). While no obvious phenotypes could be seen during development, homozygous dDnmt2GS12412 flies died more quickly than the heterozygotes with balancer. We followed up on this observation by examining the possible relationship between dDnmt2 gene expression and fly aging. As exemplified in Fig. 1B, life span measurements in comparison with yw showed that homozygous dDnmt2GS12412 line lived, on the average, 27% shorter than yw flies, with the average life spans being 54 days and 75 days, respectively. Longevity genes in the Drosopila also mediate increased resistance to various stresses (12Lin Y.J. Seroude L. Benzer S. Science. 1998; 282: 943-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). We have first carried out the thermotolerance measurement but found no difference of the average survival at 36 °C, either between yw and homozygous dDnmt2GS12412 or between UAS-dDnmt2/+ and UAS-dDnmt2/+;da-GAL4/+. We then compared the different dDnmt2 lines described above with their respective controls for the resistance to starvation. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the mutant daf-2 has extensive fat accumulation and exhibits marked increase in longevity, suggesting the link between metabolism and longevity (13Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, some long life flies like the mth and chico mutants also showed higher resistance to starvation (12Lin Y.J. Seroude L. Benzer S. Science. 1998; 282: 943-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 14Clancy D.J. Gems D. Harshman L.G. Oldham S. Stocker H. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2001; 292: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). A 20% decrease of survival of the homozygous dDnmt2GS12412 females relative to the yw females was found. Also, the dDnmt2-overexpressing transgenic flies, when compared with the UAS control lines, showed an increase of 20% in the females and 15% in the males (data not shown). Oxidative damage to DNA and proteins has also been implicated in a variety of degenerative diseases. Accumulations of oxidative damages are associated with aging too. To test the resistance to oxidative stress, we fed flies with the free radical generator, paraquat. At 36 h after being fed with diet containing the paraquat, the dDnmt2-overexpressing flies exhibited higher resistance to oxidative stress than the controls (Fig. 1C), but no obvious difference was observed between dDnmt2GS12412 and yw. Transgenic flies carrying extra copies of SOD and catalase genes, which function to eliminate reactive oxygen species, had an increased life span (see Ref. 15Helfand S.L. Rogina B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and references therein). A null mutation in chico was homozygous viable, and the flies exhibited an increased life span as well as a higher level of the superoxide dismutase activity (14Clancy D.J. Gems D. Harshman L.G. Oldham S. Stocker H. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2001; 292: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Although our dDnmt2 overexpression flies showed more resistance to oxidative stress, the level of SOD gene expression in these flies was not altered (data not shown). dDnmt2 could regulate the Drosophila life span by modulating the expression of a set of genes, which may or may not consist of genes previously demonstrated to affect the life spans of yeast, C. elegans, mice, and Drosophila (15Helfand S.L. Rogina B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Kaeberlein M. McVeu M. Guarente L.

Biol. 2004; 14: 885-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). We have tested by RT-PCR the levels of expression of several of these “longevity” genes including InR, an insulin-like receptor; chico, an insulin-like receptor substrate protein; mth, a G-protein-coupled receptor; and SOD, the CuZn superoxide dismutase, as mentioned above. No significant differences of expression of these genes were found among the Drosophila lines analyzed in Fig. 1 (data not shown). Interestingly, however, we found that the expression levels of several small heat shock proteins (sHsp)-encoding genes (Hsp22, Hsp23, and Hsp26) were coordinately changed in flies with altered amounts dDnmt2 (Fig. 2). The levels were up-regulated, all by ∼3-fold, in flies overexpressing dDnmt2 (compare lanes 2 with lanes 1 in D–F of Fig. 2), and they were down-regulated, by 3-, 2-, and 3-fold, respectively, in flies with decreased amount of dDnmt2 (compare lanes 4 with lanes 3 in D–F of Fig. 2). It should be noted here that life span analysis of a precise excision line of dDnmt2GS12412 would conclusively demonstrate that the shortened life span of dDnmt2GS12412 is not due to sporadic mutation(s) generated during construction of the original P element library. However, the parallel effects on the Drosophila by dDnmt2 (this study) and by Hsp22 (22Morrow G. Samson M. Michaud S. Tanguay R.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 23Morrow G. Battistini S. Zhang P. Tanguay R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43382-43385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and our finding that the Hsp22 gene is regulated by dDnmt2 (Fig. 2) strongly suggest that the lengthening-shortening effects on the fly life span observed by us more likely resulted from the up-and-down-regulation of the dDnmt2 gene instead of sporadic mutation(s). Small Hsps, like other Hsps, are molecular chaperones that are coordinately regulated by thermal stress and, more relevantly, they are involved in the aging processes (reviewed in Ref. 18Morrow G. Tanguay R.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The levels of Hsp22, which is a mitochondrial protein, and the cytosolic Hsp26 are both higher in aged flies (20King V. Tower J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Zou S. Meadows S. Sharp L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). More importantly, overexpression of Hsp22 and the two cytosolic small Hsps, Hsp23 and Hsp26, all increased the life span of Drosophila (11Seong K.H. Ogashiwa T. Matsuo T. Fuyama Y. Aigaki T. Biogerontology. 2001; 2: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Morrow G. Tanguay R.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Morrow G. Samson M. Michaud S. Tanguay R.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Decrease of Hsp22 expression due to P element insertion led to shortened Drosophila life span (23Morrow G. Battistini S. Zhang P. Tanguay R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43382-43385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of Hsp22 and Hsp26 increase the resistance to oxidative and heat stress (22Morrow G. Samson M. Michaud S. Tanguay R.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 24Wang H.D. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These studies all point to the beneficial effects of the small Hsps on longevity, presumably by preventing the aggregation of damaged and/or oxidized proteins (25Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Our RT-PCR data in Fig. 2 suggest that one of the mechanisms for dDnmt2 to regulate the Drosophila life span is by acting upstream of the expression of the small Hsp genes, at least those encoding Hsp22, Hsp23, and Hsp26. Thus, the dDnmt2 gene has emerged as a newly discovered player in the regulation of Drosophila life span. The regulation of the animal life span is modulated by multiple, and likely interconnected, cellular signaling pathways (see Refs. 12Lin Y.J. Seroude L. Benzer S.

While the details of the molecular and cellular basis of dDnmt2 being a longevity gene awaits further investigation, our finding has uncovered a new function of the eukaryotic DNA methyltransferase gene family. Namely, a threshold level of expression of dDnmt2, a gene conserved among the flies, mammals, and yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (2Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 5Hung M.S. Karthikeyan N. Huang B. Koo H.C. Kiger J. Shen C-K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While overexpression of exogenous mammalian DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a in Drosophila caused fly lethality (26Lyko F. Ramsahoye B.H. Kashevsky H. Tudor M. Mastrangelo M.A. Orr-Weaver T.L. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), elevation of the endogenous dDnmt2 level actually increased the life span of the flies, as shown in this study. Whether the same function is carried out by the mammalian Dnmt2 genes remains an intriguing question. We thank Dr. T. Aigaki for fly line dDnmt2GS12412. We also appreciate help from and discussions with our laboratory colleagues."

The transcription factor E2F6 differs structurally and functionally from the other E2F family members (E2Fs 1–5), in that it lacks both the retinoblastoma protein binding and transcriptional activation domains, and is an active repressor of transcription (1Cartwright P.

Overexpression in U2OS cells leads to an accumulation of cells in S phase, either by inhibition of progression through, or inhibition of exit from, S phase (1Cartwright P. Müller H. Wagener C.

In Drosophila, binding is mediated by DNA fragments termed polycomb response elements (PREs). However, PREs are several hundred base pairs in length, and thus far only one specific DNA binding sequence has been identified within a PRE (that of the Drosophila protein Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a homologue of the mammalian transcription factor YY1) so the precise mechanism of targeting remains uncertain (16Brown J.L. Mucci D. Whitely M. Dirksen M-L. Kassis J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, PcGs are assumed to associate with promoters through binding to sequence specific transcription factors, such as YY1 and E2F6 (17Ogawa H. Ishiguro K-I. Gaubatz S.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PRC2 complex contains the PcG proteins EZH2 and EED (21Jones C.A. Ng J. Peterson A.J. Morgan K. Simon J.

Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This complex (E2F6-PRC1) contains some PRC-complex PcG proteins (Ring1, MEL-18 and mph1) as well as the Ring1- and YY1-binding protein (RYBP). Recently, another E2F6-PcG complex (E2F6-G0) was described, containing several novel PcG proteins (17Ogawa H. Ishiguro K-I. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). From this complex, E2F6, Max, and HP1γ were found associated with E2F target promoters in G0, but not following re-entry into the cell cycle, suggesting an involvement of this complex in gene repression in quiescent cells. However E2F6 is expressed in all stages of the cell cycle, implying a functional role beyond that in G0.Enhancer of polycomb (EPC) is an unusual member of the PcG family. While EPC mutations in Drosophila are homozygous embryonic lethal, heterozygous mutations do not by themselves result in a zygotic homeotic phenotype. Rather, mutations in EPC enhance mutations in the polycomb (Pc) gene (25Sato T. Russell M.A. Denell R.E. Genetics. 1983; 105: 357-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sato T. Hayes P.H. Denell R.E. Dev. Genet. 1984; 4: 185-198Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To date, there are no reports of EPC in PcG complexes, although it has been identified as a component of the p400/NuA4 and Tip60 complexes, which possess histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (27Fuchs M. Gerber J. Drapkin R. Sif S. Ikura T. Ogryzko V. Lane W. Nakatani Y. Livingston D. Cell. 2001; 106: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 28Galarneau L.

Within these complexes, EPC1 is thought to be required for global acetylation (29Boudreault A. Cronier D. Selleck W. Lacoste N. Utley R. Allard S. Savard J. Lane W. Tan S. Cote J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and while it does not have enzymatic activity, EPC1 has been reported to possess both activating and repressive activities. Consistent with this, human EPC1 is also known to interact with the transcriptional repressor RET finger protein, RFP (similar to RING1) (30Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Here we describe the identification of a novel E2F6 complex. We show that E2F6, DP1, and EPC1 form a complex that can associate with EZH2 via binding to EPC1, and that this occurs only in proliferating cells. This is consistent with the role of EZH2 in cellular proliferation and thus suggests a potential role for E2F6 within the cell cycle. Furthermore, we show that E2F6 and EPC1 repress activity from a reporter containing 4 E2F sites, and that a mutant of E2F6 that is unable to bind EPC1 loses this repressive activity. This study therefore shows that E2F6 can associate with members of both the PRC1 and PRC2 complexes, and suggests a role for E2F6 in regulating cell cycle progression via transcriptional repression.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid ScreenYeast strains, methods, and plasmids pPC97 (DNA binding domain) and pPC86 (activation domain) are described elsewhere (31Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length human E2F6 (1Cartwright P. Müller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was cloned into pPC97 and used as bait, and a mouse fibroblast library, cloned into pPC86, was used as prey. Approximately 1 × 106 clones were screened using two-step selections as previously described (32Vidal M. Braun P. Chen E. Boeke J.D. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1996; 93 (issn: 10027–18424): 10321-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). From the resulting clones, plasmid DNA was prepared and sequenced.Directed Yeast Two-hybrid (Y2H) AssayFor the directed Y2H assay, cDNAs coding for the open reading frames (ORFs), or deletion mutants thereof, of E2F6 and EPC1 were cloned into the pPC97 yeast expression vector (bait constructs), and the full-length ORFs of EED, EZH2, and EPC1 were cloned into the pPC86 vector (Prey). For EED, we used the shorter cDNA, giving rise to the two faster migrating forms, which are incorporated into both the PRC2 and PRC3 complexes (33Pasini D. Bracken A. Helin K. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 34Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To test for interaction, constructs were co-transformed into the yeast two-hybrid reporter strain Mav203 and selected using two-step selection (32Vidal M. Braun P. Chen E. Boeke J.D. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1996; 93 (issn: 10027–18424): 10321-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Generation of AntibodiesMouse monoclonal antibodies against E2F6, DP1, EPC1, EZH2, and EED, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against E2F6, EPC1, and EZH2 were generated by standard procedures and are available on request.Tissue Culture, Transient Transfections, and CAT AssaysCell lines were grown according to standard procedures. U2OS cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described (35Müller H. Moroni M.C. Vigo E. Petersen B.O. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5508-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in PBS and harvested into E1A lysis buffer (ELB: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin).To assay for activity of the E2F-driven CAT reporter construct, cells were transfected with the reporter construct and combinations of pCMV-E2F6 (or mutants thereof), pCMV-mycEPC1 and pCMV-HAEZH2. Cells were also co-transfected with pCMV-βGal to normalize the reporter activity. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated in TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 13,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and subjected to 3 rapid freeze/thaw cycles, vortexing vigorously after each thaw cycle. After the final thaw cycle, lysates were split into two, and assayed either for CAT or β-galactosidase activity. For CAT assays, lysates were incubated with [14C]chloramphenicol, N-butyryl coenzyme A and 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 for 1 h, the reaction terminated by the addition of mixed xylenes, and the upper phase extracted by phase separation with 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. A fixed volume of the extracted phase was counted in a scintillation counter using an appropriate scintillation fluid. For β-galactosidase assays, lysate was incubated in Z buffer, pH 7.0 (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg2SO4, 4 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol) with ONPG buffer (4 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in 100 mm PO4 buffer, pH 7.0) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m Na2CO3 and the absorbance measured at 420 nm. Each CAT reporter assay reaction was normalized against the corresponding β-galactosidase assay to give the relative activity from each sample. Transfections were repeated in triplicate and the average of each is shown with standard deviations.In Vitro Binding ExperimentsIn vitro translation was carried out using pBSK-EPC1 and the Promega TnT® quick-coupled transcription/translation systems according to the manufacturer's instructions. For in vitro binding assays, 10 μgof GST alone, GST-E2F6, or GST-E2F6 mutants were incubated with 50 μl of IVT EPC1 in ELB buffer. GST proteins were immunoprecipitated, washed six times in ELB buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained, destained, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to autoradiographic film.In Vivo LabelingFor labeling with 35S, U2OS cells transfected with combinations of pCMV-HAE2F6, pCMV-DP1, and pCMV-mycEPC1 were incubated in 4 ml of methionine/cysteine-free media, containing 0.5mCi of 35S-ProMix per 10-cm plate, at 37 °C for 3 h prior to harvesting. Cells were washed in PBS, harvested, and lysed in ELB for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described below, washed three times in ELB buffer and loaded onto SDS gels for electrophoresis. Gels were fixed, incubated in Amplify and dried on a gel drier. Dried gels were exposed to autoradiographic film overnight, or as required, at -80 °C.Immunoprecipitation and ImmunoblottingFor U2OS and WI38, cells were resuspended in ELB and sonicated briefly prior to centrifugation. Lysates were quantified and used for immunprecipitation or Western blotting. For exogenous protein, 250 μg of whole cell lysate was used per immunoprecipitation. For endogenous proteins, 1 mg of lysate was used.For 293T and TIG3 cells, 1 mg of nuclear extract was resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm AEBSF, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). Monoclonal antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were: 9E10 (α-Myc), 12CA5 (α-HA), TFE61 (α-E2F6), D19 (α-EPC), TFD10 (α-DP1), AC22 (α-EZH2), and AA19 (α-EED), and C2 (α-Actin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Polyclonal antisera used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were: M27/SI243 (α-E2F6), SI26 (α-EPC1), and SI246 (α-EZH2) plus AK12 (α-Sin3B); C20 (α-YY1); C17 (α-Max), and C19 (α-cyclin A) all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and K320 (α-ring1) a kind gift from A. Otte.FractionationSuperose 6 Chromatography—Isolated nuclei were lysed in Buffer A. Up to 1 mg of nuclear protein was fractionated on a Superose 6 HR 3.2 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A. Fractions of 100 μl were collected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Fractions were precipitated with acetone (for Western blotting) or were immunoprecipitated with M27 (E2F6) antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Size of nuclear complexes was determined by comparison to known gel-filtration grade molecular mass markers. Because of the lack of a suitable large size marker, the void volume and mass were estimated from the manufacturer's specifications.Mono S Chromatography—250 μg of nuclear protein was loaded onto a 0.1-ml Mono S PC 1.6/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with Buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a 20 column-volume linear gradient from Buffer A to Buffer B (50 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm AEBSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin). 100-μl fractions were collected, precipitated with acetone, and analyzed by Western blotting using the antibodies indicated.Sequential Fractionation—5 mg of 293 nuclear extract were loaded onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), and 1-ml fractions were collected at 0.40 ml/min flow in Buffer A. High molecular mass fractions (2–4 MDa) were pooled together and diluted to 10 ml with Buffer C (50 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 40 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm AEBSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin). After 2 h of dialysis against Buffer C, sample was loaded onto a Buffer C-equilibrated Mono S PC 1.6/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) and fractionated in 50-μl fractions with a 20 CV linear gradient from Buffer C to Buffer B at 100 μl/min flow. 25 μl from each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies.RESULTSIdentification of E2F6-interacting Proteins—E2Fs 1–5 are able to function as repressors of transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases via their pocket protein binding partners. E2F6 is unable to bind pocket proteins, yet functions as an active repressor of transcription possibly through the formation of large multimeric PcG-containing complexes (1Cartwright P. Müller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Gaubatz S. Wood J.G. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We carried out a Y2H screen to identify novel E2F6-interacting proteins that may cooperate with E2F6 for its repressive activity. We screened a mouse fibroblast cDNA library using a full-length human E2F6 clone (1Cartwright P. Müller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) as bait. From this screen we identified 6 clones, one of which contained a partial sequence homologous to the PcG protein EPC1. We, therefore, cloned and sequenced the full-length mouse EPC1 cDNA according to GenBank™ (AF079765), to confirm this interaction.E2F6 Interacts with the PcG Protein EPC1 in Vitro and in Vivo—We incubated in vitro translated EPC1 with full-length human GST-E2F6, and precipitated the GST fusion protein using glutathione beads. In vitro translated EPC1 associated with GST-E2F6 but not with GST alone (Fig. 1A). To delineate the E2F6 domain required for this interaction, we generated E2F6 mutants and incubated as before with in vitro translated EPC1 or with DP1 as a control for binding. As shown in Fig. 1B, the interaction domain for E2F6-EPC1 is similar to but distinct from that of E2F6-DP1. EPC1 requires amino acids 160–195 of E2F6 for binding, whereas DP1 binds residues 153–181. We also confirmed these interaction domains using a directed Y2H assay, which showed that the leucine zipper domain of E2F6 is required for EPC1 binding (Fig. 1C).To confirm the interaction between E2F6 and EPC1 in vivo, we co-expressed Myc-tagged human E2F6 with HA-tagged mouse EPC1 in U2OS cells and showed that the two proteins associate (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation of EPC1 by E2F6 frequently resulted in the presence of two bands for EPC1. These may represent different isoforms of EPC1, or modifications of the protein; however, we have not investigated this in further detail.Fig. 2E2F6 binds DP1 and EPC1 in vivo. A, E2F6 and EPC1 co-immunoprecipitate when overexpressed in U2OS cells. B, EPC1 and DP1 can bind to E2F6 simultaneously, stabilizing the proteins. Proteins were overexpressed, labeled with 35S-ProMix, and immunoprecipitated using α-HA, α-DP1, or α-Myc antibodies. Labeled proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Asterisk indicates specific bands; • indicates a background band arising from a specific run-on product from the pCMV-HA-E2F6 construct. C, endogenous EPC1 co-immunoprecipitates with α-E2F6 (M27) antibody in U2OS and WI38 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)E2F6 Associates with Both DP1 and EPC1 in Vivo—Because of the similarity in binding domains of EPC1 and DP1 we wanted to establish whether binding of these proteins to E2F6 was mutually exclusive. Thus we carried out 35S-labeled immunoprecipitations on combinations of exogenously expressed proteins. We found that E2F6, DP1, and EPC1 can all interact independently with each other (Fig. 2B, right panel, lanes 1–9). However, the interaction between DP1 and EPC1 is stronger in the presence of exogenous E2F6 (Fig. 2B, right panel, lanes 7–9) and in a directed Y2H assay, no interaction was seen between DP1 and EPC1 (see Fig. 3A). This suggests the DP1-EPC1 interaction seen may be caused by the presence of endogenous E2F6 in the lysate. Importantly, when co-expressed, E2F6, DP1, and EPC1 associate more abundantly, indicating an increased stability of the proteins. (Fig. 2B, right panel, lanes 10–12). These data therefore suggest that E2F6, DP1, and EPC1 form a stable tripartite complex in vivo.Fig. 3E2F6 binds to EZH2 via EPC1.A, summary of directed Y2H assay. EPC1 interacts directly with EZH2 but not EED, while E2F6 does not interact with either PcG protein. DP1 interacts E2F6 but not EPC1. B, overexpressed EZH2 but not EED binds to EPC1. When expressed together, EPC1 associates with both EZH2 and EED. C, overexpressed EZH2 and EED co-immunoprecipitate. D, overexpressed EZH2 but not EED associates with E2F6, probably via endogenous EPC1. When expressed together, E2F6 can immunoprecipitate both EZH2 and EED. E, wild-type E2F6 associates with EPC1 and EZH2 while a mutant lacking the EPC1-binding domain does not. A DP1 binding mutant is also severely compromised in its ability to associate with EPC1 and EZH2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that E2F6 and EPC1 interact at the endogenous level, we immunoprecipitated E2F6 from both human tumor (U2OS) and normal diploid (WI38) cells, and found an association of EPC1 with E2F6 in both cell types (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that EPC1 and E2F6 associate in vivo.We also immunoprecipitated EPC1 from U2OS cells and were able to detect E2F6, albeit weakly (data not shown). We were not able to confirm the co-immunoprecipitation of DP1 at the endogenous level caused by masking of the specific DP1 band by the IgG heavy chain. However, considering the in vivo labeled co-immunoprecipitations we believe that E2F6, DP1, and EPC1 are part of the same complex in vivo.Since the binding site for EPC1 in E2F6 is partially conserved among the E2F proteins, we tested whether EPC1 is able to interact with the other E2F family members. We found that endogenous E2F3, but not the other E2Fs, is able to bind to EPC1 (data not shown). Though the binding is significantly reduced compared with E2F6, this raises the possibility that EPC1 may also form a complex with E2F3.E2F6 and EPC1 Interact with Other PcG Proteins—In this study, we identified an endogenous in vivo interaction between the transcription factor E2F6 and the PcG protein, EPC1. Although Drosophila E(Pc) was originally identified as a PcG gene, to date, EPC1 has not been found associated with any other PcG proteins. To test whether EPC1 and E2F6 could associate with other PcG proteins, we carried out a directed Y2H assay. The directed Y2H assay indicated that EPC1 associates directly with EZH2 but not EED (Fig. 3A), and that E2F6 is unable to associate directly with either protein, binding only to EPC1 directly. We confirmed this in vivo showing that overexpressed EPC1 is able to immunoprecipitate EZH2 but not EED (Fig. 3B, top and middle panels), whereas EZH2 immunoprecipitates EED as expected (Fig. 3C). However, when expressed together all three proteins (EPC1, EZH2, and EED) can co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). These data are consistent with EZH2 and EED being binding partners (21Jones C.A. Ng J. Peterson A.J. Morgan K. Simon J. Jones R.S. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2088702923,"After engagement of the B cell receptor for antigen, the Syk protein-tyrosine kinase becomes phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines, some of which serve as docking sites for downstream effectors with SH2 or other phosphotyrosine binding domains. The most frequently identified binding partner for catalytically active Syk identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen was the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. The C-terminal SH2 domain of p85 was sufficient for mediating an interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated Syk. Interestingly, this domain interacted with Syk at phosphotyrosine 317, a site phosphorylated in trans by the Src family kinase, Lyn, and identified previously as a binding site for c-Cbl. This site interacted preferentially with the p85 C-terminal SH2 domain compared with the c-Cbl tyrosine kinase binding domain. Molecular modeling studies showed a good fit between the p85 SH2 domain and a peptide containing phosphotyrosine 317. Tyr-317 was found to be essential for Syk to support phagocytosis mediated by FcγRIIA receptors expressed in a heterologous system. These studies establish a new type of p85 binding site that can exist on proteins that serve as substrates for Src family kinases and provide a molecular explanation for observations on direct interactions between Syk and phosphoinositide 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1988521127,"Genetic studies have shown that Eph receptor tyrosine kinases have both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions through incompletely understood mechanisms. We report here that ephrin-B1 stimulation of endogenous EphB kinases in LS174T colorectal epithelial cells inhibited integrin-mediated adhesion and HGF/SF-induced directional cell migration. Using 293 cells stably transfected with wild type (WT)- or kinase-deficient (KD-EphB3), we found that inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and induction of cell rounding was kinase-dependent. Unexpectedly, in two independent assays, both KD- and WT-EphB3 significantly inhibited directional cell migration. Upon ephrin-B1 stimulation, the activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 were reduced in both WT- and KD-EphB3-expressing cells that were induced to migrate. Pharmacological evidence demonstrates that a relative increase in RhoA signaling as a result of decreased Rac1/Cdc42 activities contributes to the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, EphB3-mediated inhibitory effect on cell adhesion but not migration was abolished by the integrin activating antibodies, suggesting that the inhibition of cell migration is not because of down-regulation of integrin function. These results uncover a differential requirement for EphB3 catalytic activity in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, and suggest that while catalytic activity of EphB3 is required for inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, a distinct signaling pathway to Rho GTPases shared by WT- and KD-EphB3 receptor mediates inhibition of directional cell migration. Genetic studies have shown that Eph receptor tyrosine kinases have both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions through incompletely understood mechanisms. We report here that ephrin-B1 stimulation of endogenous EphB kinases in LS174T colorectal epithelial cells inhibited integrin-mediated adhesion and HGF/SF-induced directional cell migration. Using 293 cells stably transfected with wild type (WT)- or kinase-deficient (KD-EphB3), we found that inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and induction of cell rounding was kinase-dependent. Unexpectedly, in two independent assays, both KD- and WT-EphB3 significantly inhibited directional cell migration. Upon ephrin-B1 stimulation, the activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 were reduced in both WT- and KD-EphB3-expressing cells that were induced to migrate. Pharmacological evidence demonstrates that a relative increase in RhoA signaling as a result of decreased Rac1/Cdc42 activities contributes to the inhibitory effects. Furthermore, EphB3-mediated inhibitory effect on cell adhesion but not migration was abolished by the integrin activating antibodies, suggesting that the inhibition of cell migration is not because of down-regulation of integrin function. These results uncover a differential requirement for EphB3 catalytic activity in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, and suggest that while catalytic activity of EphB3 is required for inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, a distinct signaling pathway to Rho GTPases shared by WT- and KD-EphB3 receptor mediates inhibition of directional cell migration. Cell migration is critical for many physiological and developmental processes including wound healing, immune response, and embryonic morphogenesis. Abnormal cell migration contributes to disease processes such as tumor invasion and metastasis. Microscopically, cell migration in vitro can be divided into four distinct steps: 1) cell polarization and membrane protrusion mediated by cytoskeleton reorganization; 2) integrin-mediated adhesion at the tip of the membrane protrusion; 3) contraction forces pulling cell content forward; and 4) de-adhesion at the trailing end involving integrin inactivation and membrane ripping (1Ridley A.J.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the directional cell motility in vitro have come under extensive investigation, which has led to the identification of numerous cytoskeletal, signaling, and adaptor proteins involved in various steps of cell migration. Similar mechanisms are likely to be involved in vivo, where the migratory movements of cells and axonal growth cones are subject to more complex regulation by both attractive and repulsive cues (3Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2706) Google Scholar). The combined effects of these cues determine the timing and direction of cell locomotion. By regulating membrane protrusions and actomyosin-mediated contraction, the Rho family of small GTPases are a key converging point for the mechanisms regulating cell migration (4Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 5Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane-anchored ligands, called ephrins, have recently emerged as important regulators of cell motility (6Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Nakamoto M. Cheng H.J. Friedman G.C. McLaughlin T. Hansen M.J. Yoon C.H. O'Leary D.D. Flanagan J.G.

The 16 known vertebrate Eph receptors are divided into EphA and EphB subfamilies based on sequence similarities of the extracellular domains and the specificity of ligand binding (eph-nomenclature.med.harvard.edu/table_1.html) (11Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar). In general, the EphA subfamily binds to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ligands (ephrin-A), whereas EphB receptors bind ligands containing transmembrane domains (ephrin-B). An exception is EphA4, which binds to both ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands (12Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Pawson T. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1996; 17: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). More recently, ephrin-A5 has been shown to activate EphB2 in addition to EphA receptors (13Himanen J.P. Chumley M.J. Lackmann M. Li C. Barton W.A. Jeffrey P.D. Vearing C. Geleick D. Feldheim D.A. Boyd A.W. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Because ligands for Eph kinases are also membrane-anchored, Eph/ephrin interactions take place upon contacts between Eph- and ephrin-presenting cells. Previous studies have shown that in addition to signaling by Eph kinases (forward signaling), ephrins on opposing cells can also transmit signals to the cell interior when they are engaged with Eph kinases (14Bruckner K. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. Science. 1997; 275: 1640-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghoffer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The signaling by ephrins has been referred to as reverse signaling. One well characterized function of Eph receptors is to mediate cell contact-induced repulsive guidance of axons and neural crest cells during development, although cell adhesion and attraction mediated by Eph receptors and ephrins have also been described (9Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 17Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the extensively studied nervous system, Eph receptors and ephrins are widely expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells. We found that activation of endogenous EphA2 in PC-3 prostate epithelial cells inhibits integrin-mediated cell adhesion and suppresses haptotactic migration of PC-3 cells toward fibronectin and laminin (18Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Recently, Batlle et al. (19Batlle E. Henderson J.T. van den Beghtel H. Born M.M.

Cell. 2002; 111: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) demonstrated that EphB kinases and ephrin-B ligands are expressed in opposing gradient in the crypts of the intestine. Genetic studies using EphB2 and EphB3 knock-out mice revealed that the compartmentalized expression contributes to crypt morphogenesis and the positioning of epithelial cells along the crypt. In vitro, stimulation of endogenous EphB kinases in the LS174T colorectal epithelial cell line induces retraction of lamellipodia and filopodia followed by cell de-adhesion and rounding. Biochemical analysis revealed rapid tyrosine dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin as well as Rac1 inactivation following EphB kinase activation (19Batlle E. Henderson J.T. van den Beghtel H. Born M.M. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. van de Robertson J. Wetering M. Pawson T. Clevers H.

The cellular and biochemical changes were similar to those described in PC-3 cells following EphA2 activation (18Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Multiple previous studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse model systems have revealed that Eph receptors possess both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions (20Chin-Sang I.D.

Thus, kinase-independent activities of EphB2 mediate commissural and retinal axon pathfinding (26Henkemeyer M. Orioli D. Henderson J.T. Saxton T.M. Roder J. Pawson T. Klein R.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 1027-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EphA4 mediates the formation of major axon tracts in both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent manners (24Kullander K. Mather N.K. Diella F. Dottori M. Boyd A.W. Klein R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The mutations in C. elegans Eph receptor, VAB-1, cause embryonic arrest and swollen bursa of male tail at least in part through kinase-independent mechanisms (20Chin-Sang I.D. George S.E. Ding M. Moseley S.L. Lynch A.S. Chisholm A.D. Cell. 1999; 99: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21George S.E. Simokat K. Hardin J. Chisholm A.D.

Cell. 1999; 4: 903-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Whereas some of the kinase-independent functions can be attributed to the reverse signaling through ephrins, it has been suggested that kinase-deficient Eph receptors may also regulate cellular processes by receptor ligation-induced signaling. To test this possibility, here we transfected wild type (WT) 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; HGF/SF, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor; FN, fibronectin; ROCK, Rho-associated kinase; KD, kinase-deficient; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and kinase-deficient (KD) EphB3 into 293 cells that express little endogenous EphB kinases. Ligation of WT-EphB3, but not KD-EphB3, inhibited integrin-mediated cell adhesion. In contrast, both KD- and WT-EphB3 can suppress directional cell motility, suggesting that the repulsive guidance of cell motility by EphB3 is kinase-independent. Moreover, Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were reduced upon ephrin-B1 stimulation of KD-EphB3 during wound-induced migration, suggesting that inhibition of Rac1 and Cdc42 mediate kinase-independent regulation of cell motility. Two of the known vertebrate Eph kinases, EphB6 and EphA10, contain kinase domains that are predicted to be catalytically inactive (11Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar, 29Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some of the naturally occurring splice variants of Eph kinases lack the kinase domain. Indeed analyses of human or mouse kinomes revealed that about 10% of mammalian “kinases” are catalytically inactive because of the lack of one of three conserved catalytic residues (11Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar, 30Caenepeel S. Charydczak G. Sudarsanam S. Hunter T. Manning G. Proc. Natl.

The novel signaling mechanisms by the kinase-dead EphB3 receptor characterized here may have important physiological implications. Reagents—Ephrin-B1-Fc was produced as described (18Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The Fc fragment of human IgG and goat anti-human Fc were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine PY99, rabbit polyclonal anti-RhoA, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against EphB3 was raised against the last 100 amino acids fused to GST. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-EphA/B was obtained from Cell Signaling. Mouse monoclonal anti-Rac1 and anti-Cdc42 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Y27632 was purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Transfection—LS174T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% streptomycin/penicillin and l-glutamine. The mammalian expression vectors for WT- and KD-EphB3 with a single mutation in the kinase domain (K665R) have been described previously (32Bohme B. VandenBos T. Cerretti D.P. Park L.S. Holtrich U. Rubsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24747-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). They were transfected into 293 cells using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Clonal G418-resistant cells were isolated and expanded. Expression of WT- or KD-EphB3 was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-EphB3 antibody. GFP-Rac1 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Philips, and transiently transfected into WT-, KD-EphB3-, or vector-expressing cells by using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cell Adhesion Assay—Standard cell adhesion assays were carried out as described previously (18Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with laminin or fibronection (FN) at a series of concentrations starting at 10 μg/ml at 4 °C overnight. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA/phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1–2 h. Cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA and washed with adhesion medium (serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA). 1 × 105 cells were plated in each well in adhesion medium containing 1 μg/ml ephrin-B1-Fc or Fc as control and allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 30 min. In some experiments, ephrin-B1-Fc or Fc was further clustered with goat anti-human Fc at a 1:5 ratio on ice for 30 min before adding cell adhesion medium. Adherent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. A550 was measured from the extracted dye using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Cell Migration Assay—Haptotactic and chemotactic cell migration assays using modified Boyden chambers were performed essentially as described (18Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 33Miao H. Nickel C.H. Cantley L.G. Bruggeman L.A. Bennardo L.N. Wang B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To test the migration of LS174T cells, the underside of filter inserts (6.5 mm diameter, 8 μm porous membrane, Costar) was coated with 1 μg of laminin in 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to air dry. Both sides of the filter were coated with 10 μg/ml collagen I at 4 °C overnight. 2 × 105 cells in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA were plated in the top of the insert and allowed to migrate through the filter at 37 °C overnight. 1 μg/ml Ephrin-B1-Fc or Fc pre-clustered with goat anti-human Fc was added to the lower chamber containing 20 ng/ml HGF. To test migration of transfected 293 cells, the underside of filter inserts was coated with 200 ng of FN in 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA/phosphate-buffered saline. 1 × 105 cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA were plated in the top of the insert and allowed to migrate through the filter at 37 °C overnight. Ephrin-B1-Fc or Fc at 1 μg/ml was added to the lower chamber. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Cells that went through the filter and stayed on the undersides of inserts were counted. Scratch Wound Assay—Cells were cultured in 12-well plates until confluence. The monolayer of cells was scratched using a fine pipette tip. Pictures were taken before and 20 h after the addition of 1 μg/ml ephrin-B1-Fc or Fc using an inverted Leica DM-IRE2 microscope equipped with a Ruper CoolSnap-cf digital camera. For biochemical analysis, 1.2 × 107 cells were plated on FN-coated 10-cm dishes and cultured overnight to reach fresh confluency. Cells were induced to migrate by repeated scratch wounding using a multichannel pipette as described previously (34Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Four hours after scratch wounding, cells were stimulated with ephrin-B1-Fc or Fc for 15 min and subjected to Rho GTPase pull-down assays. To visualize the cellular localization of Rac1 during cell migration, cells transiently transfected with a GFP-Rac1 expression plasmid were wounded and stimulated on coverslips. Time-lapse Imaging—Cells were plated on 6-well dishes. After overnight culture in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2, they were placed in temperature/CO2 control chambers attached to a Leica DM-IRE2 inverted microscope. After 2 h acclimation, time-lapse images were collected for 1 h with 20-s intervals using a Ruper CoolSnap-cf camera operated by the Multidimensional Acquisition Package of Meta-Morph 6.1r4 software. Ephrin-B1-Fc or Fc control were added to 1 μg/ml, and recording was continued for another hour. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4,2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using antibodies at 1–2 μg/mg of total protein at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected using γ-Bind beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with immunoprecipitation washing buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm Na3VO4. The samples were boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer and separated on 4–20% Tris glycine gradient gel. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P filter membranes (Millipore) and probed with the indicated antibodies. Rho GTPases Activity Assay—RhoA and Rac/Cdc42 activities were determined as described previously (35Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 36Sander E.E. ten van Delft S. Klooster J.P. van der Reid T. Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Monolayers of cells with multiple wounds were stimulated with 1 μg/ml ephrin-B1-Fc or Fc for 15 min and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, phosphatase inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin on ice for 5 min. Cell lysates were immediately incubated with GST-Rhotekin RBD or GST-PAK-CD coupled on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed and re-suspended in SDS sample buffer. The GTP-bound RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-RhoA, anti-Rac1, or anti-Cdc42 antibodies, respectively. Band densities were quantified using ScionImage software. Activation of EphB Kinases on LS174T Colorectal Epithelial Cells Inhibits Integrin-mediated Cell Adhesion and Suppresses HGF/SF-induced Cell Migration—Recent in vivo studies using EphB3 knock-out mice have established the critical role of EphB3 kinase in restricting Paneth cells to the bottom of the intestinal crypt, suggesting it may negatively regulate cell motility (19Batlle E. Henderson J.T. van den Beghtel H. Born M.M. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. van de Robertson J. Wetering M. Pawson T. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). In vitro, ephrin-B1-Fc stimulation of endogenous EphB kinases in LS174T cells induced cell rounding. However, it remains to be determined how EphB kinase activation in these cells may impact directional cell migration and regulate integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Whereas LS174T cells exhibit little basal cell migration toward laminin, they could be induced to migrate by presenting HGF/SF in the lower chamber in the modified Boyden chamber cell migration system. We found that ephrin-B1-Fc potently suppressed HGF/SF-induced migration of LS174T cells (Fig. 1A). Moreover, in a conventional cell adhesion assay, integrin-mediated cell adhesion to laminin was attenuated by ephrin-B1-Fc but not Fc control (Fig. 1B). Consistent with induction of rounding of the already spread cells reported by Batlle et al. (19Batlle E. Henderson J.T. van den Beghtel H. Born M.M. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. van de Robertson J. Wetering M. Pawson T. Clevers H.

Both sides of the inserts were coated with 10 μg/ml collagen I.

Unlike LS174T cells that express several members of EphB kinase including high levels of EphB2, EphB3, and low levels of EphB1, 293 cells have undetectable or very low level expression of these kinases (not shown), allowing direct comparison between exogenous WT- and KD-EphB3. Immunoblot of total cell lysates showed that both WT-EphB3 and KD-EphB3 were stably expressed in 293 cells (Fig. 2A), and clones expressing similar levels of EphB3 were selected for further analyses. Ephrin-B1 stimulation resulted in increased activation of WT-EphB3, as shown by the elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of the precipitated receptor (Fig. 2B). A basal level of EphB3 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected as have been observed with cells transfected with other EphB receptors (37Zou J.X. Wang B. Kalo M.S. Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13813-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 38Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane regions of most Eph kinases contain two highly conserved tyrosine residues that become phosphorylated upon ligand stimulation, and play a key role in Eph kinase signaling (38Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Using antibodies against phosphorylated peptide in this region, we found that these sites were preferentially phosphorylated upon ligand stimulation compared with global changes in tyrosine phosphorylation (e.g. compare lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 2B with lanes 6 and 7 in Fig. 2C). As expected, little tyrosine phosphorylation was observed for KD-EphB3 with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 2, B and C). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed equal cell surface presentation of WT- and KD-EphB3 (Fig. 2D). To further confirm that the WT- and KD-EphB3 were functional, we performed cell adhesion to immobilized ligand. Both WT- and KD-EphB3-transfected cells but not vector control, could mediate adhesion to immobilized ephrin-B1-Fc (Fig. 2E), again suggesting they were properly presented on the cell surface and were capable of binding to ligand with similar affinity. All three cell types adhered to poly-l-lysine and FN equally well (Fig. 2E). The results also demonstrate that the EphB3-ephrin-B1 interaction is sufficient to cause mechanical tethering of cells. This observation prompted us to use soluble rather than immobilized ephrin-B1 to study how EphB3 activation modulates integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. A conventional cell adhesion assay was carried out to investigate the role of EphB3 kinase activity in regulating integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Similar to endogenous EphB kinases in LS174T cells (Fig. 1), the exogenous WT-EphB3 also inhibited cell adhesion to fibronectin upon stimulation with ephrin-B1-Fc but not Fc control (Fig. 3A). The effect required EphB3 catalytic activity, as adhesion of cells transfected with KD-EphB3 was not affected. No significant change was observed in the adhesion of vector-transfected control cells. Clustering of ephrin-B1-Fc with anti-Fc antibodies is known to enhance the biological effects of EphB receptors, presumably by increasing aggregation of the receptors by the multimeric ligands (39Davis S.

https://openalex.org/W2160789731,"Mating-type switching in Schizosaccharomyces pombe involves replacing genetic information at the expressed mat1 locus with sequences copied from one of two silent donor loci, mat2-P or mat3-M, located within a 20-kb heterochromatic domain. Donor selection is dictated by cell type: mat2 is the preferred donor in M cells, and mat3 is the preferred donor in P cells. Here we show that a recombination-promoting complex (RPC) containing Swi2 and Swi5 proteins exhibits cell type-specific localization pattern at the silent mating-type region and this differential localization modulates donor preference during mating-type switching. In P cells, RPC localization is restricted to a recombination enhancer located adjacent to mat3, but in M cells, RPC spreads in cis across the entire silent mating-type interval in a heterochromatin-dependent manner. Our analyses implicate heterochromatin in long-range regulatory interactions and suggest that heterochromatin imposes at the mating-type region structural organization that is important for the donor-choice mechanism."

We examined the effects of cAMP on AQP5 distribution and abundance. When AQP5-expressing mouse lung epithelial cells were treated with cAMP or the β-adrenergic agonist terbutaline, a biphasic AQP5 response was observed. Short term (minutes) exposure to cAMP produced internalization of AQP5 off of the membrane and a decrease in protein abundance. Both of these responses were blocked by inhibition of protein kinase A and the decrease in abundance was blocked by chloroquine, indicating lysosome-mediated degradation. Sustained cAMP exposure (hours) produced an increase in membrane localization and increased abundance; these effects were also blocked by protein kinase A inhibition. The β-adrenergic agonist terbutaline produced changes in AQP5 abundance in mouse trachea and lung, consistent with our findings in cultured epithelial cells. Purified AQP5 protein was phosphorylated by protein kinase A but not protein kinase C or casein kinase II, and aquaporin-5 was phosphorylated in cultured cells after long term (but not short term) exposure to cAMP. These studies indicate that cAMP and β-adrenergic agonists produce distinct short and long term effects on AQP5 distribution and abundance that may contribute to regulation of lung water homeostasis.

Leitch V. Agre P. King L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9070-9077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Pilocarpine-stimulated recruitment of AQP5 to the plasma membrane of salivary gland epithelial cells has been proposed (16Ishikawa Y. Skowronski M.T. Inoue N. Ishida H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however, no redistribution has been observed by direct visualization (17Ishikawa Y. Eguchi T. Skowronski M.T. Ishida H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and little is known about regulation of AQP5 membrane targeting. The aquaporin to which AQP5 is most closely related genetically is AQP2, located in the collecting duct of the kidney (1King L.S. Kozono D. Agre P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). In response to cAMP, either directly or downstream of vasopressin receptor activation, AQP2 is rapidly translocated from an intracellular vesicular pool to the apical plasma membrane, and AQP2 expression is increased (18Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate cAMP in regulation of physiologic processes in the lung. In the alveolus, β-adrenergic agonists increase intracellular cAMP and accelerate alveolar fluid reabsorption, an effect believed to be mediated principally by increased sodium transport (19Matthay M.A. Clerici C. Saumon G. J Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the airways, the effects of β-adrenergic agonists and cAMP on smooth muscle relaxation and on the inflammatory mediators in mucosal secretions in asthmatics are well described (20Salathe M. J.

However, little is known about the overall effect of cAMP on transport proteins that may contribute to generation or modulation of the airway surface layer (20Salathe M. J. Allergy Clin.

We examined the effects of cAMP on AQP5 regulation in a similar manner, but we observed a more complex response. In this study, we describe biphasic effects of cAMP and β-adrenergic agonists on AQP5 protein trafficking and abundance. Short term exposure to cAMP produces internalization of AQP5 off of the plasma membrane and lysosomal degradation of the protein, whereas sustained exposure to cAMP results in AQP5 induction and membrane targeting. These findings indicate that dynamic regulation of AQP5 distribution and abundance by cAMP may contribute to water homeostasis in both the proximal and distal respiratory tracts.

BEAS-2b human lung epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown on untreated culture dishes (Falcon; BD Biosciences) at 37 °C with 5%CO2 in equal volumes of Ham's F12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose, sodium pyruvate and pyridoxine) (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 units/ml penicillin, 2 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). When specified, medium was made hypertonic by addition of 200 mosm sorbitol. pCPT-cAMP, terbutaline, or forskolin was added for the specified times. Cell harvest was performed as described previously (15Hoffert J.D. Leitch V. Agre P. King L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9070-9077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Transfection—BEAS-2B cells were grown in chamber slides to 50 to 60% confluence and transiently transfected (1 μg/well) with an hemagglutinin-tagged human AQP5 cDNA using FuGENE 6 (1.5 μl; Roche) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Human AQP5 was inserted into the EcoRI site in the carboxyl-terminal multicloning site of the EGFP-C3 plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech). The N-terminal green fluorescent protein was replaced by hemagglutinin using HindIII and AgeI restriction sites. Immunoblotting—Total protein concentrations of the samples were determined by the BCA assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Depending on the experiment, 10–50 μg of total protein in 1.5% (w/v) SDS was loaded per lane and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels before transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting and blot visualization were performed as described previously (29Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13550-13559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalence of samples was confirmed either by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of parallel SDS-PAGE gels or Ponceau Red staining (Bio-Rad) of nitrocellulose membranes. Relative band intensities were determined by densitometry using ImageQuant 5.2 densitometry analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Confocal Immunofluorescence—Confocal laser microscopy (Ultraview; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) was performed on cells grown in uncoated chamber slides (Falcon) using antibodies against AQP5 or Na,K-ATPase and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Alexa 488 or Texas Red; Molecular Probes). Merged images for analysis of double labeling or z-planes were reconstructed by differential interference contrast images. Surface Biotinylation—Cells were incubated in control medium or medium supplemented with pCPT-cAMP (100 μm, 30 min or 8 h), in the presence or absence of the PKA inhibitor H89. Cell monolayers were washed and a cell impermeable biotin derivative (0.5 mg/ml EZ Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin; Pierce) was added for 30 min in serum-free control medium or medium supplemented with pCPT-cAMP (100 μm) to biotinylate cell surface proteins. Unreacted biotinylation was quenched by the addition of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Cells were lysed by solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture tablet), and immunoprecipitations were performed using streptavidin to precipitate biotinylated proteins. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in solubilization buffer as described above and eluted in 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.5 M dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. Changes in the amount of biotinylated AQP5 were assayed by immunoblotting. Metabolic Labeling of Cells—MLE-12 cells were metabolically labeled with 0.4 mCi/ml 32P in the presence of orthovanadate, in serumfree media using standard conditions (30Moore D B.S. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3. John Wiley & Sons, New York2004: 18.2.1-18.2.8Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at stated time, and AQP5 was immunoprecipitated as described previously (31Leitch V. Agre P. King L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2894-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Anti-AQP5 immunoprecipitations were resolved by SDS-PAGE for visualization with autoradiography. Cells were tested in basal conditions and after incubation with pCPT-cAMP (100 μm) to test for inducible phosphorylation. Animal Protocols—Animal studies were undertaken with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice (20–30 gm) were given subcutaneous injections of either sterile water (control) or terbutaline (7 or 10 mg/kg). All mice were allowed free access to water and food. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and right ventricles were perfused with chilled phosphate buffered saline until free of blood. Tissue samples were removed, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80 °C for subsequent isolation of membranes as described previously (15Hoffert J.D. Leitch V. Agre P. King L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9070-9077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27King L.S. Nielsen S. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1541-C1548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, tissues were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer on ice in homogenization buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, and protease inhibitors (Complete protease mixture tablets; Roche Biochemicals). Serial centrifugations were performed to obtain a membrane fraction and crude pellets were solubilized in 1.5% (w/v) SDS, and total protein concentration was measured. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as above. Expression and Purification of AQP5—Human AQP5 was purified from protease-deficient (pep4Δ) Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing pYES2 (Invitrogen) containing human AQP5 in the multicloning site. Membranes were solubilized in 200 ml of buffer A (100 mm K2HPO4, 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 3% octyl glucoside (N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; Calbiochem) with protease inhibitors (EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Biochemicals)), loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Qiagen), washed in 100 volumes of buffer A with 50 mm imidazole, and eluted with buffer A containing 1 m imidazole. In Vitro Phosphorylation of AQP5—Purified AQP5 protein was reconstituted with Escherichia coli polar lipid extract (Avanti, Alabaster, AL) into proteoliposomes by dialysis at a lipid to protein ratio of ∼100:1 overnight at 4 °C against 100 volumes of reconstitution buffer (50 mm MOPS, 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (Calbiochem), 1 mm NaN3 (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (EDTA-free), pH 7.5). AQP5 proteoliposomes were incubated in the presence of catalytic subunits of PKA (1 unit; bovine heart), protein kinase C (PKC, 1 unit; rat brain) and recombinant human casein kinase II (CKII, 1 unit; Calbiochem) with 1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and Buffer A (5 mm NaH2PO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) or CKII buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). Samples were resolved by gel electrophoresis and exposed to film to assess phosphorylation of AQP5. AQP5 Proteoliposome Transport Studies—AQP5 proteoliposomes and protein-free control liposomes were analyzed by light scattering using a stopped-flow apparatus (SF-2001; Kin Tek Instruments, University Park, PA) with a dead time of ≤ 1 ms. Osmotic water permeability of proteoliposomes was measured at 4 °C as described previously (32Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Second-order rate constants were calculated using the equation L Pf = k/(S/V0) × Vw × Δosm, where Pf is the osmotic water permeability, S/V0 is the vesicle surface area to initial volume ratio, Vw is the partial molar volume of water, and Δosm is the difference in osmolarity between the intravesicular and extravesicular aqueous solutions (usually 300 mosm). Stopped-flow was performed on wild-type and phosphorylated AQP5 to measure water-transport. cAMP Stimulates AQP5 Redistribution in Lung Epithelial Cells—MLE-12 cells spontaneously express AQP5, and the protein is present on the apical membrane as observed in vivo (Fig. 1). To examine the effects of cAMP on AQP5 distribution, MLE-12 cells were incubated with a stable, membrane-permeable cAMP analog, pCPT-cAMP (100 μm). In untreated cells, AQP5 labeling is evident on the apical membrane (Fig. 1A). Labeling along the lateral border in the XY plane is at the superior margin, because we have never observed labeling extending down the lateral membrane in the XZ plane reconstructions. Within 2 min of cAMP stimulation, AQP5 labeling on the membrane was markedly reduced, and increased intracellular labeling was evident (Fig. 1A). After 8 h of stimulation by cAMP, AQP5 labeling of the apical membrane seemed to be greater than that seen at baseline. Incubation of cells with the β-adrenergic agonist terbutaline, which is known to increase intracellular cAMP (33Scott M.G. Swan C. Jobson T.M. Rees S. Hall I.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), produced an identical pattern of AQP5 redistribution, with loss of membrane labeling and internalization after short term cAMP exposure, and increased labeling compared with baseline after long term stimulation (Fig. 1B). Forskolin, which activates adenyl cyclase to produce cAMP, produced similar results (data not shown). To examine the effect of cAMP on a different membrane transport protein, we examined the distribution of the α-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase. Short term stimulation with cAMP caused a redistribution of the Na,K-ATPase from its position in the basal membrane in unstimulated cells to an intracellular compartment after cAMP stimulation (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Effects of cAMP on Na,K-ATPase distribution. A, MLE-12 cells were incubated in control media or with pCPT-cAMP (100 μm) for 30 min, then fixed and permeabilized for labeling with antibodies to the α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase. Immunofluorescence was performed using confocal microscopy and the images of xy (top) and xz (bottom) planes are displayed. B, after incubation with pCPT-cAMP (100 μm; 30 min) cells co-labeled with both anti-AQP5 antibodies (green) and anti-(α1)Na,K-ATPase antibodies (red). cAMP stimulated internalization of both proteins off of their respective membranes. The xz plane is displayed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Incubation of cells with the PKA inhibitor H89 blocked the internalization of AQP5 off of the plasma membrane after short term exposure to cAMP (Fig. 1C). In addition, H89 also blocked the apparent increase in plasma membrane AQP5 after stimulation with cAMP for 8 h, suggesting that PKA activation is required for both components of this biphasic response (Fig. 3). The cAMP-mediated redistribution of AQP5 observed with immunofluorescence was confirmed using surface biotinylation. Consistent with the results of immunofluorescence, the amount of AQP5 available at the plasma membrane for binding to biotin was greatly reduced after 30 min of stimulation with pCPT-cAMP (Fig. 3). After 8 h of cAMP exposure, biotinylated AQP5 was increased, indicating an increase in AQP5 at the plasma membrane. PKA inhibition with H89 blocked both the short and long term effects of cAMP on AQP5 distribution (Fig. 3). To determine whether cAMP-mediated AQP5 redistribution in mouse lung epithelial cells was conserved in human cells, we transfected Beas-2B cells, a commonly used human lung epithelial cell line, with human AQP5. These cells have no detectable AQP5 protein. 2L. King and V. Sidhaye, unpublished observations. After transfection, unstimulated Beas-2b cells exhibit apical AQP5 (Fig. 4). After stimulation with cAMP for 30 min, confocal microscopy revealed that AQP5 had been internalized off of the plasma membrane. This effect was blocked by pretreatment with H89. cAMP Regulates AQP5 Protein Abundance in Lung Epithelial Cells—To examine the effects of cAMP on AQP5 protein abundance, MLE-12 cells were stimulated with pCPT-cAMP (100 μm), and cell lysates were probed for AQP5. Similar to its effects on distribution, cAMP stimulation produced biphasic effects on AQP5 protein abundance. Short term exposure to cAMP (30 min) produced a short term decrease in AQP5 protein abundance (Fig. 5A). Exposure to cAMP for 8 h led to a marked increase in protein abundance, which had returned to baseline levels at 24 h (Fig. 5A). In contrast, although it was internalized in response to cAMP (Fig. 2), Na,K-ATPase (α subunit) abundance was not affected by cAMP stimulation (Fig. 5A). A similar pattern of early reduction followed by a later increase in AQP5 was observed after incubation of cells with terbutaline (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Effects of cAMP stimulation on AQP5 abundance. MLE-12 cells were incubated with control media, pCPT-cAMP (100 μm) (A), or terbutaline (100 μm) (B) and harvested at the specified times. Immunoblots of cell lysates were probed with anti-AQP5 antibodies. cAMP and terbutaline had biphasic effects on AQP5 abundance in cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The decrease in AQP5 abundance after short term cAMP stimulation indicated that active protein degradation was probably occurring. We observed previously that a different water channel protein, AQP1, is degraded in proteasomes (31Leitch V. Agre P. King L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2894-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast to our findings for AQP1, pretreatment of MLE-12 cells with proteasome inhibitors (MG132 or lactacystin) did not block short term AQP5 degradation (data not shown). However, pretreatment with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine blocked the cAMP-induced decrease in AQP5 protein abundance and produced an overall increase in AQP5 abundance at later times (Fig. 6). In addition, pretreatment of the cells with H89 inhibited both the short term decrease and long term increase in AQP5 protein abundance (Fig. 7), indicating that both responses are PKA-mediated.Fig. 7PKA inhibition blocks cAMP-induced changes in AQP5 abundance. Cells were incubated with control media or media containing pCPT-cAMP (100 μm) in the presence or absence of H89 (30 μm), and harvested after 30 min or 8 h. Immunoblots of cell lysates were examined for AQP5 abundance. PKA inhibition blocked both the short term decrease and long term increase in AQP5 abundance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Terbutaline Regulates AQP5 Abundance in Vivo—To determine whether terbutaline might alter AQP5 abundance in vivo, mice were injected subcutaneously with sterile water or terbutaline, followed by harvest of the trachea and lungs at intervals. A single injection of terbutaline (7 mg/kg) produced a decrease in AQP5 abundance in the trachea within 1 h that was sustained at 3 h (Fig. 9, A and B). Eight hours after terbutaline injection, there was a non-significant trend toward increased AQP5 expression in the trachea. 7 mg/kg of terbutaline did not alter AQP5 abundance in the peripheral lung (Fig. 8C); however, a single injection of 10 mg/kg produced a 40% reduction in AQP5 in peripheral lung after 30 min, followed by a trend toward an increase in AQP5 at 24 h, consistent with potential regulation of AQP5 by β-adrenergic receptor activation in vivo.Fig. 8Terbutaline alters AQP5 abundance in mouse trachea and lung. A, mice were injected with terbutaline (7 mg/kg; subcutaneous) or sterile water (100 μl) and tracheas were harvested for analysis of AQP5 expression by immunoblot.

We show, using surface plasmon resonance, that in the absence of Mg2+, DAF binds C3b, factor B, and the Bb subunit with low affinity (KD, 14 ± 0.1, 44 ± 10, and 20 ± 7 μm, respectively). In the presence of Mg2+, DAF bound Bb or the von Willebrand factor type A subunit of Bb with higher affinities (KD, 1.3 ± 0.5 and 2.2 ± 0.1 μm, respectively). Interaction with the proenzyme C3bB was investigated by flowing factor B across a C3b-coated surface in the absence of factor D. The dissociation rate was dependent on the time of incubation, suggesting that a time-dependent conformational transition stabilized the C3b-factor B interaction. Activation by factor D (forming C3bBb) increased the complex half-life; however, the enzyme became susceptible to rapid decay by DAF, unlike the proenzyme, which was unaffected. A convertase assembled with cobra venom factor and Bb was decayed by DAF, albeit far less efficiently than C3bBb. DAF did not bind cobra venom factor, implying that Bb decay is accelerated, at least in part, through DAF binding of this subunit. It is likely that DAF binds the complex with higher affinity/avidity, promoting a conformational change in either or both subunits accelerating decay. Such analysis of component and regulator interactions will inform our understanding of inhibitory mechanisms and the ways in which regulatory proteins cooperate to control the complement cascade.

Complement (C) 1The abbreviations used are: C, complement; AP, alternative pathway; fB, factor B; Bb, larger cleavage subunit of factor B; Ba, smaller cleavage subunit of factor B; fD, factor D; vWFA, von Willebrand factor type A domain; SP, serine protease; CReg, C regulatory protein; DAF, decay accelerating factor; SCR, short consensus repeat; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; CVF, cobra venom factor; sDAF, soluble decay accelerating factor comprising four short consensus repeats; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline. plays a central role in innate immune defense with the ability to rapidly opsonize or destroy microorganisms or infected cells. The alternative pathway (AP) provides an immediate, antibody-independent means to activate the C cascade, whereas the classic pathway relies in most cases on antibody to initiate activation of the first component, C1. A third pathway, the lectin pathway, is initiated by binding of mannan-binding lectin to sugar residues on bacterial cell walls. Other than the initiating factor (mannan-binding lectin and associated proteases), this pathway is identical to the classic pathway. The AP provides an immediate line of defense to potential infection, it “ticks over” continuously in plasma through low level activation of the central component, C3, probably via hydrolysis of the internal thioester bond (1Pangburn M.K. Schreiber R.D. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 856-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Tight regulation of this tick-over ensures that C is not activated to excess in plasma but provides enough active C3b to bind foreign surfaces and amplify the cascade swiftly when appropriate (2Nicol P.A. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 1973; 24: 259-275PubMed Google Scholar). The AP also amplifies the classic pathway by formation of further active convertases on C3b deposited during early amplification steps by the classic pathway convertase. The initiating stimulus of the AP is nucleophilic attack on the internal thioester bond in nascent C3b by an amine or hydroxy group present on a foreign or “activating” surface (3Law S.K. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2701-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This results in covalent binding of C3b and forms the nidus for C amplification. The C3 convertase is formed by binding of factor B (fB) to C3b in an interaction that requires a Mg2+ ion. The fB changes conformation such that the C3bB complex is capable of activating the zymogen factor D (fD), a serine protease present in plasma at about 2 μg/ml (4Volanakis J.E. Narayana S.V. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). FD cleaves fB into Ba (amino-terminal fragment) and Bb, the latter comprising an amino-terminal von Willebrand factor type A domain (vWFA) and a carboxyl-terminal serine protease (SP) domain. After release of Ba, Bb binds with higher affinity to C3b. It is likely that conformational changes in the vWFA domain transmit an allosteric signal to the SP domain, resulting in its activation and conferring it with the ability to cleave multiple molecules of C3 to nascent C3b, thereby amplifying the cascade (5Hinshelwood J. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1267-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 6Hinshelwood J. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The background tick-over of the AP and the potential for rapid amplification of all pathways on self cells means that strict control in both biological fluids and on the membranes is essential. Numerous C regulatory proteins (CReg) have evolved to meet the need to protect “self” from the potentially destructive effects of C (7Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Complement Regulatory Proteins. Academic Press, London1999Google Scholar). These proteins police the body, collaborating to control all pathways. The different CReg belong to various gene families, those encoded in the Regulators of Complement Activation (RCA) gene cluster on chromosome 1 comprise factor H, C4b binding protein, decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55), membrane cofactor protein (CD46), and complement receptor 1 (CD35) (8Holers V.M. Cole J.L. Lublin D.M. Seya T. Atkinson J.P. Immunol. Today. 1985; 6: 188-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All contain a structural module termed the short consensus repeat (SCR), a domain comprising ∼60 amino acids that confers C3b/C4b binding affinity to the proteins and contains the regulatory function of the molecule (9Reid K.B. Day A.J. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 177-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal fragment of fB, Ba, also comprises three SCRs. The number of domains in CReg varies from four (in membrane cofactor protein and DAF) to 37 (complement receptor 1, “B” isoform). DAF is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CReg that acts to accelerate decay of the naturally labile enzymes of the AP and CP, C3bBb and C4b2a (10Nicholson-Weller A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. 1992; 178: 7-30PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kuttner-Kondo L. Medof M.E. Brodbeck W. Shoham M. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other than the SCRs, it comprises an elongated, heavily glycosylated “stalk” proximal to the membrane that projects the active site the correct distance from the membrane, allowing it to function efficiently (12Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Anstee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2906-2913PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lukacik P. Roversi P. White J. Esser D. Smith G.P.

A. 2004; 101: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The C components, from C1 through C9, comprise a fascinating group of proteins whose activities are characterized by differing conformations and presentation of continuously changing faces or binding sites to other C components, receptors, or regulators. C3 and fB are no exception. C3 transformation starts after cleavage and release of C3a, continues after destruction of the internal thioester bond, and moves on by presentation of binding sites for components such as fB, Bb, and eventually C5 (14Isenman D.E. Cooper N.R. Mol. Immunol. 1981; 18: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Isenman D.E. Kells D.I. Cooper N.R. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Pangburn M.K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4458-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Along the way, binding sites for a multitude of regulators are formed; their sites may be distinct or overlapping and are often transient as the cascade progresses or C3b becomes inactivated (16Lambris J.D. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 1237-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cleavage and inactivation of C3b by fI results in the production of iC3b, C3c, and C3dg; these inactivation products no longer bind components such as fB, and all differ in their ability to bind various C receptors (17Harrison R.A. Lachmann P.J. Mol. Immunol. 1980; 17: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). FB also undergoes a multitude of conformational changes. Within the intact protein, all three domains interact with each other; possibly, Ba holds the vWFA and SP domains in a way that prevents autoactivation (5Hinshelwood J. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1267-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 6Hinshelwood J. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). FB changes conformation after binding to C3b, once more after release of Ba, and presumably again after release to the fluid phase (18Fishelson Z. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1425-1429PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tuckwell D.S. Xu Y. Newham P. Humphries M.J. Volanakis J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6605-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms of AP convertase assembly and regulation are still being determined 50 years after discovery of this pathway (20Pillemer L. Blum L. Lepow I.H. Ross O.A. Todd E.W. Wardlaw A.C. Science. 1954; 120: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Interaction of DAF with the AP convertase has largely been examined by mutagenesis studies. These have sought to define entire domains in DAF or individual amino acids that are crucial to decay of the convertase and protection of indicator cells (usually erythrocytes) from lysis by C (21Brodbeck W.G. Kuttner-Kondo L. Mold C. Medof M.E. Immunology. 2000; 101: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Kuttner-Kondo L.A. Mitchell L. Hourcade D.E. Medof M.E. J.

Further information has been gained after resolution of the structure of DAF, both in solution and in crystals (13Lukacik P. Roversi P. White J. Esser D. Smith G.P. Billington J. Williams P.A.

A. 2003; 100: 4718-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Various sites that extend through SCRs 2, 3, and 4 have been proposed to be important for convertase regulation. It is not yet clear whether DAF undergoes a conformational transition after binding to its ligands; most probably, it acts purely to induce changes in other proteins to which it binds. It is interesting to note that DAF not only binds the convertase enzymes but also a multitude of pathogens, both bacteria and viruses, and also the leukocyte activation antigen CD97 (25Lea S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A potential site of interaction for DAF on fB has also been identified by mutagenesis studies and is located distal to the C3b interaction site in vWFA domain (26Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L. Kuttner-Kondo L.A. Atkinson J.P. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (Epub 2001 Nov 1102): 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Various studies have addressed the binding site on C3b for the regulators of complement activation proteins factor H, membrane cofactor protein, complement receptor 1, and also for fB, but no definitive sites of interaction have been determined and that for DAF has not been examined (27Farries T.C. Seya T. Harrison R.A. Atkinson J.P. Complement Inflamm. 1990; 7: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Lambris J.D. Lao Z. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Hack C.E. Becherer J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4821-4832PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the interactions between DAF and the AP convertase components by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We defined the affinity of these associations and examined in real time the assembly and decay of the active AP convertase and its proenzyme and their interaction with DAF. This results of this study provide new insight into these associations and further guide our understanding of the complex mechanisms and protein interactions intrinsic to the C cascade. Preparation of Complement Components and Regulators—C3, cobra venom factor (CVF), and factor B were prepared by classic column chromatography using established methods (29Harrison R.A. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology, Volume II. Cell Surface and Messenger Molecules of the Immune System. Blackwell Science, Cambridge, MA1996: 75.50-75.71Google Scholar). Factor D was purchased from Quidel Corporation (San Diego, MA). C3b was prepared from C3 using either of two methods. In the first, CVF was coupled to Sepharose CL-4B using the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). A solid-phase convertase was formed by incubating CVF-Sepharose in normal human serum to form CVFBb. The Sepharose was washed and incubated at 37 °C with C3. C3b generated by cleavage was separated from C3a and other minor contaminants by anion exchange on a Source Q column (Amersham Biosciences). In the second method, C3, factor B, and factor D were incubated in complement fixation diluent (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) until total C3 cleavage had occurred. C3b, Bb, and Ba were purified by anion exchange chromatography. The C3b-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated, and monomeric C3b was separated from dimeric C3b by size exclusion on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant human DAF comprising the four SCRs (soluble DAF (sDAF)) was isolated and refolded from Escherichia coli as described previously (30White J. Lukacik P. Esser D. Steward M. Giddings N. Bright J. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. Smith G.P. Smith R.A.G. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The structure and function of sDAF has been studied previously, and the purified, refolded protein is known to consist of four correctly folded SCR domains and demonstrates the full range of complement-regulating and pathogen-binding activities associated with DAF purified from erythrocytes (13Lukacik P.

Human DAF-Ig fusion protein comprising four SCR domains fused to human IgG1 Fc (DAF-Ig) was prepared as described previously (32Harris C.L. Lublin D.M. Morgan B.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recombinant vWF-A domain of human factor B was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase using published methods (33Williams S.C. Hinshelwood J. Perkins S.J. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with the addition of a final gel filtration on a S75 column (Amersham Biosciences) to yield protein at a purify of >98%, as assessed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (data not shown). Biosensor Analysis—All analyses were carried out on a Biacore 3000 machine (Biacore International SA, Stevenage, UK), except for that shown in Fig. 4c, which was carried out on a Biacore 2000. Proteins were coupled to the sensor chip surface using an amine coupling chemistry as instructed by the manufacturers (N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride coupling kit). For all kinetic analyses, a CM5 chip (carboxymethylated dextran surface) was used, data were collected at 25 °C, the flow rate was maintained at 30 μl/min, and data from a reference cell were subtracted to control for bulk refractive index changes. The Rmax was kept low and the flow rate high to eliminate mass transfer. However, this was controlled for where appropriate by varying flow rate and ensuring observed association rates did not vary. Samples were injected using the KINJECT command to ensure accurate association kinetics. Interactions were analyzed in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl), 0.005% surfactant P20, and either 1 mm MgCl2 or 3 mm EDTA as stated in the text. Data were evaluated using Biaevaluation software (Biacore International). Concentration of analytes was assessed using absorbance at A280, molarities were calculated using the after extinction coefficients (molecular masses and coefficients obtained using Protean software, DNAStar): sDAF (1.3), C3b (1.03), factor B (1.43), Bb (1.29), and Ba (1.74). Interaction of DAF with C3b—To study the interaction of DAF with the individual AP convertase components, C3 was incubated with factors B and D until formation of C3b, Bb, and Ba was complete. Individual components were separated by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1a). This also removed C3i from the C3b preparation. We routinely found that ∼50% of the C3b formed by AP activation was in a dimeric form. To eliminate avidity effects from SPR analysis, C3b was further separated into monomeric and dimeric forms by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1b). Initial SPR studies indicated that the interaction between DAF and C3b was of low affinity (submicromolar) with very fast on and off rates typical of DAF-ligand interactions (31Anderson K.L. Billington J. Pettigrew D. Cola E. Roversi P. Simpson P. Chen H.A. du Urvil P. Merle L. Barlow P. Medof E. Smith R.A.G. Le Bouguenec Nowicki B. Lea S.M. Matthews S. Mol.

The affinity of the interaction was studied under steady-state conditions by immobilizing either DAF or C3b to the sensor chip surface and flowing monomeric C3b or DAF, respectively, over the surface. The most accurate determination as judged by smallest S.E. values for KA and Rmax was obtained by immobilizing C3b and studying the interaction with soluble DAF, because this analyte was available at concentrations of the same order of magnitude as the KD values determined (>10 μm). C3b was coupled to the chip surface either by amine coupling or through the thioester group. The latter method has the advantage of capturing C3b on the surface in a physiologically relevant orientation. A typical analysis is illustrated in Fig. 2; reference cells were used to correct for any bulk shift effects. Mean KD values are given in Table I.Fig. 2Interaction between C3b and DAF. a, C3b (monomeric) was immobilized on the chip surface via amine coupling. Interaction with sDAF was analyzed in HBS-EDTA at the indicated concentrations and sensorgram traces were obtained (gray/black lines are duplicates and are virtually superimposed on each other).

Mitchell L. Kuttner-Kondo L.A. Atkinson J.P. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (Epub 2001 Nov 1102): 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is likely, however, that there is a direct interaction of DAF with the Bb portion of the convertase. We immobilized DAF on the chip surface and flowed intact fB, Bb, or Ba over the surface at high concentrations. A direct interaction was seen with intact fB and the Bb subunit but not with Ba (Fig. 3a). The affinity of the interaction between DAF and intact fB was determined by immobilizing either fB or DAF to the surface via amine groups. As with the DAF/C3b interaction, the affinity was low and was analyzed at steady state. The binding profile and affinity data obtained were similar irrespective of the protein partner immobilized (mean KD, 44 ± 10 μm in EDTA; Fig. 3) and the presence or absence of Mg2+ (data not shown; mean KD, 74 ± 30 μm in 1 mm Mg2+). The interaction of DAF with intact fB was of lower affinity than that with C3b (Table I). Although the interaction of fB was relatively unaffected by the presence of Mg2+, we noticed that this cation had a marked effect on the interaction of DAF with the Bb subunit (Fig. 4a). In the absence of Mg2+, the affinity of the Bb subunit for DAF and the binding profile was similar to that of fB (data not shown; average KD, 20 ± 7 μm). However, in the presence of Mg2+, the affinity of the interaction between Bb and DAF was higher. The kinetic profile was different to that of fB, on and off rates were slower, and the affinity was calculated as 1.3 μm (using a 1:1 Langmuir interaction model; Fig. 4b, Table I). Further analysis using the isolated vWFA domain demonstrated a similar binding profile (Fig. 4c) and affinity of 2.2 ± 0.1 μm for this subunit (Table I). Interaction of fB with C3b—We sought to assemble the convertase on the sensor chip surface itself, the aim being to assess the affinity of DAF for the intact enzyme in addition to individual components. Low levels of C3b were immobilized to the chip surface and fB was flowed across in the presence of Mg2+ (1 mm). It was immediately apparent that the interaction did not fit a simple 1:1 association model (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, interaction of identical concentrations of fB with C3b for different lengths of time (1, 3, or 20 min) demonstrated that the dissociation became slower the longer the components interacted (Fig. 5b). This can be indicative of a conformational change that results in a tighter binding between components. Indeed, fitting the data from Fig. 5a to a conformational change model (BIAcore software) gave a good fit, although some heterogeneity was evident at high concentrations of fB (Fig. 5c). Kinetic analysis after a 4-min association phase gave the following information: ka1, 1.36 × 104 m–1 s–1; kd1, 0.115 s–1; ka2, 5.53 × 10–3 m–1 s–1; kd2, 1.78 × 10–3 s–1 (χ2, 4.2). In this model, the off rate after the conformational change (kd2) is much lower. Formation of the AP Convertase and Interaction with DAF— Either the active or inactive convertase was assembled on the chip surface by flowing fB over C3b in the presence or absence of fD. Either fB (46 μg/ml) or a mixture of fB (46 μg/ml) and fD (8 μg/ml) was flowed across the surface as indicated in Fig. 6a. Several differences in the two complexes were noted. First, cleavage of fB by fD altered the rate of decay of the active enzyme, prolonging its half-life. Second, the Mg2+ ion in the active enzyme was “locked” in place, flowing 10 mm EDTA over C3bB(Mg2+) dissociated fB from C3b, whereas it had no effect on decay of C3bBb(Mg2+). C3b was also bound to the surface using the AP, which resulted in coupling of nascent C3b via its thioester to hydroxy groups present on the dextran-coated surface. We used a modification of a described previously technique in which repetitive cycles of fB/fD with C3 resulted in AP amplification on the chip surface (36Jokiranta T.S. Westin J. Nilsson U.R. Nilsson B. Hellwage J. Lofas S. Gordon D.L. Ekdahl K.N. Meri S. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To increase efficiency of activation we deposited the first nidus of C3b on the chip surface using a fluid phase convertase, CVFBb (Fig. 6b). Each subsequent “cycle” illustrated in Fig. 6b comprised incubation with fB and fD to form active convertase followed by incubation with native C3. After C3b deposition, buffer was flowed across the surface for 16 h to allow dissociation of noncovalently bound C3b and of any active convertase. To study the interaction of DAF with the convertase, factors B and D were flowed over the surface. The amount of active/inactive convertase on the chip surface was varied by titrating the amount of fD in the incubation (Fig. 6c). In the presence of fD, the surface reached an equilibrium (Fig. 6c, E), unlike the proenzyme, which displayed complex kinetics during formation (Figs. 5 and 6c, A). When soluble DAF was flowed across the active convertase, decay of the Bb subunit was virtually instantaneous (Fig. 6c, B–E). Decay of the enzyme was so efficient that it was impossible to measure binding and an affinity of DAF for the intact convertase. This contrasted with flow of DAF across the inactive enzyme in which rapid and total decay was not apparent (Fig. 6b, A). Uncleaved fB was dissociated from the surface at the end of the incubation using EDTA as shown in Fig. 6. Alignment of individual sensorgrams at either the fB/fD injection or the DAF injection demonstrates the variation in decay and identical binding of DAF to C3b on the chip surface (Fig. 6d). Formation of CVFBb and Interaction with DAF—We have demonstrated that DAF interacts with both subunits of the active enzyme and that decay is rapid and efficient. The convertase enzymes formed from CVF (C3b-like molecule found in cobra venom) and fB are very stable and are assumed to be resistant to decay by human regulators. To analyze the interaction with DAF, CVF was immobilized on the sensor chip surface and DAF was flowed across; no interaction between CVF and DAF was evident even at high concentrations (47 μm) (Fig. 7a). To assess whether DAF could decay the CVF-containing convertas"

Whereas the importance of the α1S, β1a, and γ Ca2+ channel subunits in skeletal muscle has been determined by using null-mutant mice, the role of the α2δ-1 subunit in skeletal muscle is still elusive. We addressed this question by small interfering RNA silencing of α2δ-1 in reconstituted dysgenic (α1S-null) myotubes and in BC3H1 skeletal muscle cells. Immunofluorescence labeling of the α1S and α2δ-1 subunits and whole cell patch clamp recordings demonstrated that triad targeting and functional expression of the skeletal muscle Ca2+ channel were not compromised by the depletion of the α2δ-1 subunit. The amplitudes and voltage dependences of L-type Ca2+ currents and of the depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients were identical in control and in α2δ-1-depleted muscle cells. However, α2δ-1 depletion significantly accelerated the current kinetics, most likely by the conversion of slowly activating into fast activating Ca2+ channels. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that α2δ-1 is the exclusive isoform expressed in differentiated BC3H1 cells and that depletion of α2δ-1 was not compensated by the up-regulation of any other α2δ isoform. Thus, in skeletal muscle the Ca2+ channel α2δ-1 subunit functions as a major determinant of the characteristic slow L-type Ca2+ current kinetics. However, this subunit is not essential for targeting of Ca2+ channels or for their primary physiological role in activating skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling.

However, this subunit is not essential for targeting of Ca2+ channels or for their primary physiological role in activating skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels are important signaling proteins in many cellular processes including muscle contraction, secretion, synaptic function, and transcriptional regulation. Ca2+ channels are composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit and the auxiliary α2δ, β, and γ subunits (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Whereas the α1 subunits are responsible for voltage sensing and ion conduction, the auxiliary subunits have been implicated in functions of membrane targeting and modulation of channel properties (for review see Ref. 2Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Much of our current knowledge about the specific properties of Ca2+ channel subunits has been obtained from heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and in mammalian expression systems. Moreover, null-mutant mice have provided important information about the roles of Ca2+ channel subunits in native tissues. In skeletal muscle the voltage-activated Ca2+ channel functions as a voltage sensor in excitation-contraction (EC) 1The abbreviations used are: EC, excitation-contraction; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced GFP; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; RyR1, ryanodine receptor type 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; T-tubule, transverse tubule; RT, reverse transcription; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; nt, nucleotide. coupling. The role of the slowly activating L-type Ca2+ current, which is not necessary for the activation of skeletal muscle contraction, is not clear. A null-mutant of the skeletal muscle α1S subunit, the dysgenic mouse, lacks EC coupling and L-type Ca2+ currents and dies at birth from respiratory failure (3Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). A knock-out mouse of the skeletal β1a Ca2+ channel subunit results in a very similar lethal muscle phenotype (4Gregg R.G. Messing A. Strube C. Beurg M. Moss R. Behan M. Sukhareva M. Haynes S. Powell J.A. Coronado R. Powers P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13961-13966Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In contrast, γ subunit knock-out mice are viable and show only mild effects on current properties (5Freise D. Held B. Wissenbach U. Pfeifer A. Trost C. Himmerkus N. Schweig U. Freichel M. Biel M. Hofmann F. Hoth M. Flockerzi V. J. Biol.

Koch W.J. Hui A. Schwartz A. Harpold M.M. Science. 1988; 241: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) is the major α2δ subunit in skeletal muscle (2Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Because homozygous α2δ-1 knock-out mice die during early embryonic development, 2J. Offord, personal communication. the role of this subunit in skeletal muscle or in any other native tissue is still elusive. A mutation of the α2δ-2 gene results in a severe reduction of P-type Ca2+ currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells, and homozygous α2δ-2 mutant mice develop ataxia and die within a few weeks after birth (7Barclay J. Balaguero N. Mione M. Ackerman S.L. Letts V.A. Brodbeck J. Canti C. Meir A. Page K.M. Kusumi K. Perez-Reyes E. Lander E.S. Frankel W.N. Gardiner R.M. Dolphin A.C. Rees M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α2δ subunit is a product of a single gene that is post-translationally cleaved into α2 and δ peptides, which remain associated via disulfide bonds. The δ subunit is a single-pass membrane protein, and the α2 subunit is a highly glycosylated extracellular protein (8Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1996; 16: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A total of four genes code for α2δ subunits (α2δ-1 to α2δ-4), which display distinct tissue distributions (2Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The α2δ-1 subunit is expressed at high levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle, in vascular smooth muscle, and in brain (9Angelotti T. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and may associate with several different α1 subunit isoforms. Coexpression of α2δ subunits with various α1 subunits in heterologous expression systems demonstrated that α2δ enhances the membrane expression of functional Ca2+ channels, increases ligand-binding sites, and alters the voltage dependence and kinetics of the Ca2+ currents (2Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the extracellular α2 specifically interacts with the α1 subunit and conveys the effects of increased membrane expression. However, the δ peptide is sufficient for the modulation of current properties (10Felix R. Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6884-6891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The manifestation and the magnitude of these multiple effects vary with the combination of α1 and α2δ isoforms expressed in heterologous systems. Finally, α2δ-1 is the target for the anticonvulsant drugs gabapentin and pregabalin, two highly effective agents to medicate neuropathic pain (11Luo Z.D. Calcutt N.A. Higuera E.S. Valder C.R. Song Y.H. Svensson C.I. Myers R.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 12Dworkin R.H. Corbin A.E. Young Jr., J.P. Sharma U. LaMoreaux L. Bockbrader H. Garofalo E.A. Poole R.M. Neurology. 2003; 60: 1274-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Undoubtedly, the α2δ-1 subunit is an important component of Ca2+ channel complexes in many tissues and of great interest as a drug target. Nevertheless, its exact role in specific cell functions is still unknown. This is particularly critical in the case of skeletal muscle where the Ca2+ channel plays a vital role in the activation of muscle contraction. Therefore, we studied the role of the α2δ-1 subunit in skeletal muscle using siRNA knock-down of α2δ-1. This first loss-of-function analysis of α2δ-1 in a differentiated cell type indicated that in skeletal muscle cells α2δ-1 is required neither for the targeting of the channel into the triads nor for normal EC coupling. However, α2δ-1 is a critical determinant of the characteristic slow kinetics of skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ currents. Design of siRNA Plasmids—siRNA target sequences corresponding to the α2δ-1 coding region (Cacna2d1, GenBank™ accession number NM_009784) were selected as recommended (13Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), and siRNAs targeting all known α2δ-1 splice variants (9Angelotti T. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were expressed as hairpins from the pSilencer1.0-U6 siRNA expression vector (Ambion Ltd., Huntington, Cambridgeshire, UK). Specificity was confirmed by BLAST searches (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Hairpin siRNA templates were designed as two complementary DNA strands of 70 bp consisting of a 5′ 4-nt overhang followed by an ApaI restriction site, a 19-nt siRNA sense sequence, a hairpin loop sequence TTCAAGAGA, a 19-nt siRNA antisense sequence, (T)6 and a DraI restriction site with a 3′ 4-nt overhang. The two complementary DNA strands were annealed in 30 mm HEPES, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm magnesium acetate, pH 7.4, by incubation for 2 min at 95 °C and subsequently slow cooling to room temperature. Double strands were digested with ApaI and DraI and ligated into the corresponding polylinker sites of the pSilencer1.0-U6 vector. The following gene-specific sequences were selected and tested (nucleotide numbers in the α2δ-1 coding sequence): 264–282, 945–963, 1099–1117, 1326–1344, 2332–2350, and a random control sequence 5′-GCCTAGGCGAACTGATACA-3′. Cell Cultures and Transfections—Myotubes of the homozygous dysgenic (mdg/mdg) mouse cell line GLT were cultured as described previously (14Powell J.A. Petherbridge L. Flucher B.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At the onset of myoblast fusion (2 days after addition of differentiation medium) GLT cultures were transfected by using Fu-GENE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). A total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA was used per 35-mm culture dish; siRNA plasmids were used at a 12–24-fold molar excess in combination with GFP-α1S. Three to 5 days later transfected cultures were fixed for immunofluorescence labeling or were analyzed in combined patch clamp and Ca2+ release measurements. BC3H1 nonfusing skeletal muscle cells were cultured as described previously (15Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Flucher B.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Before plating the cells were transfected by electroporation with the AMAXA nucleofection system (AMAXA Biosystems, Köln, Germany). A total of 5 μg of plasmid DNA was used for 106 cells; the siRNA plasmids were transfected at a 12–24-fold molar excess with a plasmid coding for eGFP as a marker for transfected cells. Differentiated myoblasts were analyzed 6 days after addition of differentiation medium. Expression plasmids used were GFP-α1S (16Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and pβA-eGFP (17Obermair G.J. Szabo Z. Bourinet E. Flucher B.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 2109-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Differentiated cultures were simultaneously immunostained as described by Flucher et al. (18Flucher B.E. Andrews S.B. Daniels M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with the monoclonal α2δ-1 antibody mAb 20A (19Morton M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11904-11907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:1,000 or the monoclonal α1S antibody mAb 1A (20Morton M.E. Caffrey J.M. Brown A.M. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 613-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:2,000, together with a rabbit affinity-purified anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:5,000 or the affinity-purified antibody162 against the RyR1 (21Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:5,000. An Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used with anti-GFP so that the antibody label and the intrinsic GFP signal were both recorded in the green channel. Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to detect anti-α2δ-1 or anti-α1S. Controls, for example the omission of primary antibodies and incubation with inappropriate antibodies, were routinely performed. Images were recorded on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera and METAVIEW image-processing software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Quantitative analysis of α2δ-1 expression and clustering was performed by systematically screening of cover glasses for well differentiated transfected (GFP-positive) myotubes (GLT) or myoblasts (BC3H1) and classifying their clustered α2δ-1 expression (in the red channel) as strong (+++), medium (++), weak (+), or absent (-), whereby strong labeling was defined as the staining intensity and density of clusters observed in the majority of the control myotubes. Representative examples of these labeling patterns are shown in Fig. 2. For the analysis of GFP-α1S expression and clustering, well differentiated GLT myotubes were identified based on the RyR1 expression (red channel), and GFP-α1S expression was classified as normal (clustered in triads), not targeted (ER/SR distribution; see Ref. 22Flucher B.E. Kasielke N. Grabner M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or absent (nontransfected myotubes). In BC3H1 cells, α1S expression was analyzed in eGFP-positive myocytes. All counts were performed in duplicate cover glasses from at least four independent experiments. Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test. Patch Clamp Analysis and Ca2+ Release Measurements—Ca2+ currents were recorded with the whole cell patch clamp technique. Patch pipettes had resistances of 1.5–3 megohms when filled with (mm): 145 cesium aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.1 Cs-EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP (pH 7.4 with CsOH). Fluorescent signals of intracellular Ca2+ transients were collected microphotometrically (Photon Technology International, S. Brunswick, NJ) during whole cell recordings by including 0.2 mm pentapotassium Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the pipette solution. The bath solution contained (mm): 10 CaCl2, 145 tetraethyl-ammonium chloride, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). Currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Data acquisition and command potentials were controlled by pClamp software (version 7.0, Axon Instruments). Test pulses were preceded by a 1-s prepulse to -50 mV to inactivate endogenous T-type Ca2+ channels (23Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Currents were determined with 200-ms depolarizing steps from a holding potential of -80 mV to test potentials between -50 and +80 mV in 10-mV increments. Leak currents were digitally subtracted by a P/3 prepulse protocol. Recordings were low-pass Bessel filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. Recordings were performed at room temperature (≈23 °C). Only currents with a voltage error ≤5 mV attributable to series resistance were further analyzed with Clampfit® 8.0 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and SigmaPlot® 8.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago) software. For the selection of recordings for the kinetic analysis additional constraints (noise and stability) applied. The activation phase of currents (0 to current level to 98% of peak) was fitted with both a single and a double-exponential function using Clampfit® 8.0 software. The more accurate fit for each current was determined based on the χ2 values (see also Supplement 2). Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test. Fluorescent Cell Sorting and Protein Biochemistry—Cells were harvested by trypsin treatment, pelleted, and resuspended at a density of 1–2 million cells/ml in serum-free medium. EGFP-positive cells were sorted using a FACSVantage SE flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). Collected cells were pelleted and lysed for 15 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 2 mm iodoacetamide, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and homogenized by 15–20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 300 × g (20 min; 4 °C); the supernatant was collected, and homogenization and centrifugation steps were repeated with the pellet. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 200,000 × g (60 min; 4°), and pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer at a concentration equivalent to 2,500 cells/μl, quickly frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. The equivalent to 50,000 cells per lane was separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot using the monoclonal α2δ-1 antibody mAb 20A (19Morton M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11904-11907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:2,000. Loading and transfer was routinely examined with Coomassie Blue staining of the blots. RT-PCR and Quantitative TaqMan PCR—Total RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted transfected BC3H1 cells, from nontransfected differentiated BC3H1 cells, and from embryonic mouse brain (E16.5) using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). RNA samples (2–5 μg) were reverse-transcribed by using the Ready-To-Go T-primed first-strand kit (Amersham Biosciences). The expression of α2δ isoforms 1–4 in differentiated BC3H1 myoblasts was investigated by conventional RT-PCR (40 cycles; 55 °C annealing) and TaqMan quantitative PCR (50 cycles). mRNA from embryonic mouse brain was used as a positive control for the α2δ isoforms 1–4. The relative abundance of α2δ-1 mRNA was assessed by TaqMan quantitative PCR using the standard curve method (User Bulletin 2: ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. P/N 4303859B, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the β-actin transcript as reference. Between 5 and 37.5 ng of total RNA equivalents, 200 nm of each primer, and 120 nm TaqMan probe were used for each 25-μl reaction in Brilliant QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Analysis was performed using the Mx4000® Multiplex Quantitative PCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each TaqMan probe was modified with a 5′ reporter dye (6-carboxylfluorescein) and a 3′ quencher dye (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). Sets of primers were designed in a way that either the probe itself or the product was spanning an exon-exon boundary. Primers and probes specifically designed for β-actin (Actb, GenBank™ NM_007393), α2δ-1 (Cacna2d1, GenBank™ NM_009784), α2δ-2 (Cacna2d2, GenBank™ NM_020263), α2δ-3 (Cacna2d3, GenBank™ NM_009785), and the putative α2δ-4 (Cacna2d4, GenBank™ BK005394) were purchased from Metabion (Metabion, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany). Primer sequences are listed in Supplement 4. Exon-intron structures of the genes Actb (β-actin) and Cacna2d1–3 (α2δ-1–3) were derived from the Ensembl Genome Browser (www.ensembl.org). BLAST searches (www.ensemble.org; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) using the human α2δ-4 cDNA sequence (GenBank™ AF516695) as screening template revealed the putative cDNA sequence of a mouse α2δ-4 subunit. The translated protein sequence shares 84% identity (MULTALIN; see Ref. 24Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) with the human α2δ-4 subunit (Supplement 3). The nucleotide sequence data of the putative mouse α2δ-4 subunit were submitted to GenBank™ and are available in the Third Party Annotation Section of the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data bases under the accession number TPA BK005394. α2δ-1 Requires the α1 Subunit for Normal Targeting into Skeletal Muscle Triads—Previously, we observed that in skeletal myotubes lacking the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) α1S subunit, the α2δ-1 subunit is mistargeted (25Flucher B.E. Phillips J.L. Powell J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 1b shows the typical expression pattern of α2δ-1 in myotubes from the dysgenic cell line GLT. The α2δ-1 subunit is expressed diffusely throughout the plasma membrane and is partially retained in cytoplasmic membrane compartments. When dysgenic myotubes were reconstituted by transfection with GFP-α1S, the distribution pattern of α2δ-1 changed dramatically. Both the α1S subunit and the α2δ-1 subunit were coexpressed in clusters (Fig. 1, c and d), and these DHPR clusters were also colocalized with the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) (Fig. 1, e and f). This distribution pattern is characteristic for triad proteins in skeletal myotubes, and the colocalization of the DHPR subunits with the RyR1 is indicative of the location of these proteins in junctions of the plasma membrane or the T-tubules with the SR (18Flucher B.E. Andrews S.B. Daniels M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which will collectively be referred to as triads. Thus, the restoration of normal distribution of α2δ-1 in dysgenic myotubes transfected with GFP-α1S confirms that the α2δ-1 needs the α1S subunit for its own incorporation into the EC coupling apparatus located in the triad. But is the reverse also the case and does the α1S subunit need α2δ-1 for its targeting into skeletal muscle triads? Depletion of α2δ-1 with siRNA Does Not Affect Expression and Targeting of the α1S Subunit—To address this question, we used siRNA depletion of α2δ-1 in dysgenic myotubes. This system allows us to simultaneously express the GFP-α1S fusion protein, which facilitates the analysis of targeting properties and serves as marker for transfected myotubes, and plasmids coding for siRNAs. Expression of siRNAs from plasmids was chosen to ensure a continuous synthesis of siRNA for the duration of myotube differentiation. Five specific siRNA probes for unique mouse α2δ-1 sequences were designed, and their efficacy to reduce α2δ-1 expression was determined by immunofluorescence labeling. The probe resulting in the strongest reduction of α2δ-1 immunoreactivity (nucleotides 1099–1117) was used for all subsequent experiments, and its effects were compared with those of a control siRNA probe consisting of a nonspecific nucleotide sequence. Fig. 2 shows the effects of α2δ-1 siRNA on the expression and distribution of the α2δ-1 and GFP-α1S subunits in dysgenic myotubes. In the majority of myotubes transfected with GFP-α1S and α2δ-1 siRNA, the α2δ-1 immunoreactivity was reduced to below detectability (Fig. 2A, b), and others showed strongly reduced α2δ-1 expression compared with untransfected myotubes (Fig. 2A, d). The overall percentage of transfected myotubes showing any α2δ-1 immunoreactivity at all was reduced from 88 ± 5% (mean ± S.E., n = 181) in control siRNA-treated cultures to 44 ± 6% (n = 171) in α2δ-1 siRNA-treated cultures (Fig. 2C). However, only 7 ± 3% of the α2δ-1 siRNA-transfected myotubes showed α2δ-1 expression levels similar to the +++ levels in 57 ± 4% of the controls (Fig. 2, A, f, and C). The fact that our cultures, obviously, also contain many nontransfected muscle cells, which express normal levels of α2δ-1 (see Fig. 2A, b and d), precluded a meaningful Western blot analysis of α2δ-1 depletion by siRNA. Nevertheless, the immunofluorescence analysis clearly demonstrated the reduction of α2δ-1 by the specific α2δ-1 siRNA qualitatively and quantitatively and further allowed us to study the effects of α2δ-1 depletion on α1S targeting in exactly those myotubes where α2δ-1 reduction was most robust. Fig. 2A, a and b, demonstrate that in myotubes in which α2δ-1 was no longer detectable, the GFP-α1S subunit was expressed at normal levels and in the characteristic subcellular distribution pattern. Quantitative analysis of GFP-α1S expression revealed no significant difference (p = 0.39) in the degree of GFP-α1S clustering in myotubes cotransfected with either control or α2δ-1 siRNA (96 ± 2%, n = 83, versus 93 ± 4%, n = 76; Fig. 2B). Thus, the depletion of α2δ-1 expression did not show an effect on the expression and distribution of GFP-α1S, suggesting that normal targeting and incorporation of the α1S subunit into the triad complex does not depend on the presence of substantial amounts of the α2δ-1 subunit. siRNA Depletion of α2δ-1 Does Not Affect Amplitudes and Voltage Dependence of EC Coupling and L-type Ca2+ Currents—Because immunocytochemistry revealed that despite the lack of the α2δ-1 subunit GFP-α1S was still incorporated into triads, we could address the question as to how the depletion of α2δ-1 affects the normal function of the DHPR as Ca2+ channel and as the voltage sensor in EC coupling. To this end, combined whole cell patch clamp and intracellular fluorescence Ca2+ measurements were performed in transfected myotubes loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 (Fig. 3 and Table I). Fig. 3A shows representative examples of recordings from GLT myotubes transfected with GFP-α1S in combination with either control (left) or α2δ-1 siRNA (right). Most importantly, the α2δ-1-depleted myotubes responded to depolarization with intracellular Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ currents (Fig. 3A). The averaged amplitudes and voltage dependence of the transients and currents are displayed in Fig. 3B and show no difference between control and α2δ-1 siRNA transfected myotubes. Peak current densities were similar also to recordings from myotubes transfected with GFP-α1S but without any siRNA (not shown). Thus, the physiological role of the DHPR in skeletal muscle EC coupling is not compromised by the depletion of the α2δ-1 subunit.Table IProperties of intracellular Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ currents Properties of depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ currents from control and α2δ-1 siRNA-transfected dysgenic myotubes and BC3H1 muscle cells were determined from combined whole cell patch clamp and intracellular Fluos-4 Ca2+ recordings as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the Supplemental Material.ParametersGLT GFP-α1S + siRNABC3H1 eGFP + siRNAControl siRNAα2δ siRNAControl siRNAα2δ siRNACa2+ transients(ΔF/F)max1.46 ± 0.14aAll data are presented as mean ± S.E1.44 ± 0.28VF1/2 (mV)8.6 ± 1.65.2 ± 1.8NDbND indicates not determinedNDkF (mV)10.5 ± 0.79.4 ± 0.7n2214Ca2+ currentsIpeak (pA/pF)–2.7 ± 0.3–2.9 ± 0.3–6.0 ± 0.4–5.7 ± 0.4Gmax (nS/nF)100 ± 7101 ± 9161 ± 7151 ± 10VG1/2 (mV)35.2 ± 1.033.7 ± 1.123.3 ± 1.221.6 ± 1.0kG (mV)8.1 ± 0.37.7 ± 0.36.7 ± 1.26.7 ± 0.2Vrev (mV)78.9 ± 1.480.6 ± 1.479.4 ± 1.378.0 ± 0.9n24171919ActivationTime to peak (ms)98 ± 9cStatistical significance is p < 0.00137 ± 5cStatistical significance is p < 0.001115 ± 7cStatistical significance is p < 0.00157 ± 11cStatistical significance is p < 0.001n24171919τmono (ms)8.5 ± 1.16.0 ± 03Amono (pA/pF)2.9 ± 0.36.2 ± 06τfast (ms)5.0 ± 0.51.8 ± 02τslow (ms)30.0 ± 4.532.4 ± 2.3Afast (pA/pF)1.1 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.1Aslow (pA/pF)1.8 ± 0.25.3 ± 0.3Relative Afast/Aslow38/6215/85(%)n17141710InactivationR2002.0 ± 1.1cStatistical significance is p < 0.00113.9 ± 1.7cStatistical significance is p < 0.0017.6 ± 1.4dStatistical significance is p < 0.0117.8 ± 3.3dStatistical significance is p < 0.01Incidence (%)22938994n23141816a All data are presented as mean ± S.Eb ND indicates not determinedc Statistical significance is p < 0.001d Statistical significance is p < 0.01 Open table in a new tab siRNA Depletion of α2δ-1 Accelerates Activation and Inactivation Kinetics of Skel"

Actin-dependent transport of ASH1 mRNA in yeast represents one of the best-characterized examples of mRNP translocation. Formation of the ASH1 mRNP requires recognition of zip code elements by the RNA binding protein She2p. We determined the X-ray structure of She2p at 1.95 A resolution. She2p is a member of a previously unknown class of nucleic acid binding proteins, composed of a single globular domain with a five alpha helix bundle that forms a symmetric homodimer. After demonstrating potent, dimer-dependent RNA binding in vitro, we mapped the RNA binding surface of She2p to a basic helical hairpin in vitro and in vivo and present a mechanism for mRNA-dependent initiation of ASH1 mRNP complex assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2053999299,"Extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy was combined with thermodynamic and kinetic approaches to investigate zinc binding to a zinc finger (C2H2) and a tetrathiolate (C4) peptide.

In competition with EDTA the transfer of peptide-bound zinc ions proved to be 6 orders of magnitude faster than predicted for a dissociation-association mechanism thus requiring ligand exchange mechanisms via peptide-zinc-EDTA complexes.

A rapid equilibrium of bound and unbound states of individual ligands might explain the kinetic instability of zinc-peptide complexes, which enables fast ligand exchange during the encounter of occupied and unoccupied acceptor sites.

Within the last decade the generally accepted roles of protein-bound zinc in catalysis and structure stabilization were complemented by regulatory functions. Protein binding sites have been classified as “catalytic,” “co-catalytic,” and “structural” zinc sites (1Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. EXS. 1995; 73: 259-277PubMed Google Scholar). A fourth type, namely “interface” was added recently (2Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The possible role of a variable zinc occupancy of protein sites as a modification that provides a pathway for intracellular information transfer has been discussed (3O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1993; 261: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), and the steadily growing number of known zinc proteins involved in gene regulation led to the suggestion that some classes of proteins might transduce changes in available zinc levels into changes in patterns of gene expression (4Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). An update of recent findings in zinc biology (5Maret W. Maret W. Zinc Biochemistry, Physiology, and Homeostasis—Recent Insights and Current Trends. Kluwer, Dordrecht2002Google Scholar) now supports the view of zinc as a key element in cellular regulation. An important question with respect to a regulatory function, however, concerns the controversially discussed concentration of free zinc ions in different physiological environments. Cells react on a changed zinc supply by e.g. an activated transcription of metallothionein (Ref. 6Vasak M. Hasler D.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar and references therein) or changes in the activity of zinc-sensing transcription activators like Zap1 (7Bird A.J. Zhao H. Luo H. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Evans-Galea M. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and MTF-1 (8Andrews G.K. Biometals. 2001; 14: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In the latter cases zinc binding to individual zinc finger motifs is supposed to induce structural changes, which in turn modify the functionality of the proteins. If the transduction of a zinc signal is mediated by binding of zinc ions to zinc-sensing proteins it is evident that free binding sites for zinc ions are a prerequisite for such a regulation process. Because zinc binding to e.g. zinc fingers and metallothioneins is very strong, equilibrium thermodynamics immediately predicts very low concentrations of “free” zinc ions. This view is strongly supported by the finding that the metallothionein/thionein pair controls the concentration of free zinc ions in eukaryotic cells (9Yang Y. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5556-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The presence of free thionein in different cell types (9Yang Y. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5556-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), combined with the picomolar dissociation constant of metallothionein (10Otvos J.D. Petering D.H. Shaw C.F. Comm. Inorg. Chem. 1989; 9: 1-35Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), implicates a free zinc ion concentration in the picomolar range. The zinc binding characteristics of metalloregulatory proteins in bacteria led to the estimation of even lower, namely femtomolar concentrations of free cytosolic zinc (11Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Besides metallothionein, reduced glutathione, one of the most abundant and ubiquitous molecules in living systems (intracellular concentrations between 1 and 20 mm), has been discussed as a possible regulator of zinc homeostasis (12Krezel A. Wojcik J. Maciejczyk M. Bal W. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2003; : 704-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The thionein/metallothionein system together with glutathione and other zinc binding molecules thus necessarily maintains extremely low concentration of free zinc. A very low concentration of free zinc, however, has important consequences for the kinetics of zinc binding to proteins as demonstrated by the following example. For a protein with a comparatively fast association of zinc ions like metallo-β-lactamase from Bacillus cereus with kon = 1.4 μm–1 s–1 (13de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the calculated half-life time (t½) for reconstitution from the metal-free enzyme (according to t½ = ln 2/(kon[Zn]free)) results in almost 14 h at a free zinc ion concentration of 1 pm. If the free zinc ion concentration is as low as predicted by Outten and O'Halloran (11Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar), namely femtomolar, reconstitution half-life times in the range of days to months result. These are obviously inappropriate estimates, because the cellular response to modified conditions proceeds on a time scale of milliseconds to minutes. These kinetic considerations make it obvious that e.g. newly synthesized zinc proteins cannot depend on the pool of free zinc but compete with other zinc-loaded molecules. Ligand exchange mechanisms for zinc transfer from occupied to unoccupied binding sites are necessary to circumvent the kinetic limitations of dissociation/association mechanisms, which are caused by the virtual absence of free zinc ions. Recently we observed that a direct transfer of zinc from Zn-EDTA complexes to metal-free metallo-β-lactamases was required to explain the fast reactivation of the enzymes observed at picomolar free zinc ion concentrations (14Wommer S. Rival S. Heinz U. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Franceschini N. Amicosante G. Rasmussen B. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24142-24147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this case Zn-EDTA served as a kinetically labile zinc buffer. The kinetic lability of Zn-EDTA, however, can only be explained from ligand exchange in a previously formed EDTA-Zn-protein complex. The literature provides some evidence for the existence of similar mechanisms in native competition situations. A possibly direct interaction between the metallothionein/thionein couple and structural zinc binding domains in other proteins has been discussed for the two-zinc finger protein Tamtrack (15Roesijadi G. Bogumil R. Vasak M. Kagi J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17425-17432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and a direct transfer of zinc via discrete (ternary) intermediates has been postulated from theoretical considerations (16Cox E.H. McLendon G.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interprotein metal ion exchange between cadmium-substituted carbonic anhydrase and apo- or zinc-metallothionein on a time scale of seconds to minutes has been demonstrated (17Ejnik J. Munoz A. Gan T. Shaw C.F. II I Petering D.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A direct transfer of zinc ions requires formation of intermediary ternary complexes with a sufficient lifetime to allow the subsequent ligand exchange reaction to occur. The inevitable formation of zinc-bridged complexes might be a mere result of the underlying competition situation but could also be of functional importance in cellular regulation. Several examples have been described where zinc ions are involved in formation of protein-protein complexes via “interface sites” (2Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). A full understanding of regulatory zinc ion transfer presupposes a better knowledge of the dynamics of zinc-protein interactions. The apparent contradiction between the high thermodynamic stability of structural zinc sites and their simultaneously required kinetic instability, demands for mechanisms by which zinc ion transfer can rapidly proceed via zinc-bridged complexes. It has been shown earlier that zinc binding sites might have a highly dynamic nature, e.g. in metallothioneins (see Ref. 18Maret W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar and references therein). If zinc-bridged protein-protein complexes are transiently required for the biological distribution of zinc, they must form spontaneously whenever the concentration of potential zinc binding sites is in excess of zinc in cellular environments. With model peptides we tried to address this issue experimentally. The formation of zinc-bridged complexes is demonstrated in this work and explains how zinc ion transfer might be accomplished. It is additionally shown how two zinc binding sites of proteins might interact via a shared zinc ion. We chose two functionally completely unrelated peptides, both representing structural zinc sites: (i) a zinc finger consensus sequence peptide (C2H2-peptide) 1The abbreviations used are: C2H2-peptide, 25-mer consensus sequence zinc finger peptide; C4-peptide, residues 93–116 of LADH; EXAFS, extended X-ray absorption fine structure; EMBL, European Molecular Biology Laboratory; FT, Fourier transform; LADH, horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase; LMCT, ligand to metal charge transfer; PDB, Protein Data Bank; RP, reverse phase; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. (19Shi Y. Beger R.D. Berg J.M. Biophys.J. 1993; 64: 749-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and (ii) a peptide comprising the structural zinc site of alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver (LADH) (C4-peptide), which might be involved in protein folding (20Gerschitz J.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For both peptides metal ion binding induces structural changes. Zinc binding of both peptides was studied by a combination of EXAFS spectroscopy, equilibrium thermodynamics, UV-spectroscopy, CD-spectroscopy, and stopped-flow kinetics. Preparation and Characterization of Peptides—The 25-mer C2H2-peptide (sequence: PYKCPECKSFSQKSDLVKHQRTHTG) was synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology on an ABI 433 automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). After dithiothreitol treatment, the peptide was purified by preparative reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, Kromasil C18, 5 μm, 100 Å). The 24-mer C4-peptide (sequence: FTPQCGKCRVCKHPEGNFCLKNDL) was a gift from Stefan Rawer, Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany. Both peptides were freeze-dried from acidic solution and stored at –20 °C. MALDI mass spectrometry of both peptides resulted in the [M + H]+-peaks exactly corresponding to the theoretical masses. Free cysteine in the peptides was determined by the Ellman assay (24Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). In comparison to the titration-derived concentrations of peptides (see below), the experimentally obtained cysteine content gave no indication for partial oxidation of thiol sulfur or formation of disulfide-bridged peptides. UV-vis spectra were recorded with the UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer Lambda 9 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Überlingen, Germany) under argon atmosphere and processed with the software UV-WinLab. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a Jasco J-715, using 1-mm cells. The CD scans were measured from 240 to 185 nm by collecting data with a resolution of 0.1 nm at a speed of 10 nm/min. For each condition, 5 scans were accumulated and averaged. All experiments were carried out in 5 mm TES, pH 7.0 at 25 °C. The low buffer concentration was necessary to improve the signal/noise ratio of measurements in the far UV region whereas control experiments gave no evidence for a modified metal ion binding characteristics because of the low ionic strength. Oxygen-free solutions of peptides and metal ions were prepared under argon atmosphere. Metal-free conditions were guaranteed by treating all solutions with CHELEX chelating resin (Sigma). Dissociation constants were determined from competition titrations with the chromophoric zinc chelator Quin-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The indicator was titrated with zinc in the absence and presence of metal-free peptides (peptide/indicator ratios around 1:1) monitoring changes in absorbance at 266 nm. The dissociation constant of the Zn-Quin-2 complex is 1.06 pm (25Jefferson J.R. Hunt J.B. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The program Chemsim was used for numerical data analysis. The program allows the numerical analysis of binding experiments involving arbitrary combinations of coupled equilibria (13de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol.

From simultaneous fittings of dissociation constants, absorption coefficients and apoenzyme concentrations the latter values could be obtained with high precision. A detailed description of the numerical approach can be found in (14Wommer S. Rival S. Heinz U. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Franceschini N. Amicosante G. Rasmussen B. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24142-24147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The titration of Quin-2 (Q2) alone resulted in the finding that the batch used contained 15% of an impurity (Q2I) with different spectroscopic behavior and a modified dissociation constant for zinc. The latter values could be determined from a titration of Quin-2 with zinc using the following equilibria in Reactions and Equations 1,1 and 2,2. Zn−Q2↔K(P−Q2)Zn+Q2(Eq. 1) K(Zn−Q2)=[Zn][Q2][Zn−Q2](Eq. 2) Zn−Q2I↔K(P−Q2I)Zn+Q2I(Eq. 3) K(Zn−Q2I)=[Zn][Q2I][Zn−Q2I](Eq. 4) Data evaluation resulted in ϵ266 nm(Q2) = 37,500 m–1 cm–1, ϵ266 nm-(Zn-Q2) = 6600 m–1 cm–1, ϵ266 nm(Q2I) = 29,350 m–1 cm–1, ϵ266 nm-(Zn-(Q2I) = 27,400 m–1 cm–1, and a dissociation constant of 94 (± 5) pm for Zn-Q2I. K(Zn-Q-2) was constrained to 1.06 pm (25Jefferson J.R. Hunt J.B. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In competition experiments with peptides (P) the latter values were fixed, and only the concentration, absorption coefficient, and dissociation constant of the peptides where subject to optimization by additionally including Reaction and Equation 3,3 in the binding model. Zn−P↔K(Zn−P)Zn−P(Eq. 5) K(Zn−P)=[Zn][P][Zn−P](Eq. 6) Kinetics of Zinc Binding and Transfer—Zinc binding kinetics was studied under anaerobic conditions with the stopped-flow spectrofluorometer SX.17MV (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) detecting the appearance of sulfur-to-zinc LMCT bands at 220 nm. For the C2H2-peptide it was additionally possible to monitor changes of tyrosine fluorescence by excitation at 275 nm and monitoring emission at > 320 nm using a cut-off filter. Reactions were started by rapidly mixing 50–75 μl of 9.5–20 μm peptide solutions with the same volume of zinc solutions (1.6–660 μm). For each concentration 4–10 traces were averaged. Rate constants of single and multistep mechanisms and absorbance coefficients were fitted simultaneously to sets of concentration-dependent stopped-flow data using the numeric program Dynafit (27Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). EDTA was used to remove zinc from the peptides. Solutions of 20 μm Zn1-peptide were mixed with EDTA (0.2–6.4 mm). Zinc release from the peptides was monitored at 220 nm and evaluated by fitting bi-exponential equations to the recorded data. Alternatively Quin-2 was used as a competitor by monitoring changes of Quin-2 fluorescence emission upon zinc ion binding (excitation at 333 nm and monitoring emission > 360 nm with a 360 nm cut-off filter). Non-linear regression analysis of concentration-dependent data was performed with the program Sigma Plot (SPSS, Richmond, Canada). EXAFS Spectroscopy—Peptide samples were prepared in 10 mm Bis-Tris and pH was adjusted to 6.8–7.0 after addition of zinc or cadmium acetate. C4 samples contained 4.9 mm zinc and 4.9 mm peptide (Zn1-C4) and 4.6 mm zinc and 11.1 mm peptide (Zn0.5-C4). The very high resolution Zn1-C4 sample contained 2.25 mm zinc and 2.25 mm peptide. C2H2 samples contained 1.89 mm zinc and 1.90 mm peptide (Zn1-C2H2) and 2.05 mm zinc and 4.24 mm peptide (Zn0.5-C2H2). The Zn-K-edge and the Cd-K-edge spectra were monitored at the EMBL bending magnet beam-line D2 at DESY/Hamburg running at 4.5 GeV and 70–125 mA current in fluorescence mode at 25 K. The energy axis of each scan was calibrated using the Bragg reflections of a static Si(220) crystal in back reflection geometry (28Pettifer R.F. Hermes C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1985; 18: 404-414Crossref Google Scholar). In the experiments with cadmium-substituted peptide an internal Cd-foil sample was used for calibration. Standard EXAFS analysis was performed using the EXPROG software package (developed by C. Hermes and H. F. Nolting at the EMBL-Outstation/Hamburg) to process the raw data and EXCURV98 (developed by N. Binsted, S. W. Cambell, S. J. Gurman, and P. Stepherson at SERC Daresbury) using exact curve wave scattering theory (29Lee P.A. Pendry J.B. Phys. Rev. B. 1975; 11: 2795-2811Crossref Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 30Gurman S.J. Binsted N. Ross I. J. Phys. Chem. 1984; 17: 143-151Google Scholar) to analyze the spectra. Phases were calculated ab initio using Hedin-Lundqvist potentials and von Barth ground states (31Hedin L. Lundqvist S. Solid State Phys. 1969; 23: 1-181Google Scholar). The energy range was set to 30–650 eV above the edge for the C4 samples and to 30–995 eV above the edge for the C2H2 samples and the high resolution C4 sample. The quality of alternative fits might be compared on the basis of the residual R-factor (32Joyner R.W. Martin K.J. Meehan P. J. Phys. C Solid State Phys. 1987; 20: 4005-4012Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Effects of Zinc Binding to Peptides and Determination of Dissociation Constants—Titration of the metal-free peptides with Zn(II) results in appearance of sulfur-to-zinc LMCT (33Kaegi J.H. Vallee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vasak M. Kagi J.H. Hill H.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2852-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) bands at 216 nm (C4-peptide) and 220 nm (C2H2-peptide). From titrations we derived that the maximum absorbance is reached at equimolar zinc concentrations in both cases. Corresponding to the involvement of 4 and 2 Cys residues, Δϵ is 13,500 m–1 cm–1 and 6300 m–1 cm–1 for the C4- and the C2H2-peptide, respectively (Fig. 1). For the C2H2-peptide metal ion-induced folding was shown before (19Shi Y. Beger R.D. Berg J.M. Biophys.J. 1993; 64: 749-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In order to probe whether zinc ion binding induced a structural change of the C4-peptide we used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig. 1). The metal-free peptide shows a CD-spectrum with characteristic features of a random structure. Zinc binding results in drastic changes of the spectrum. To verify that the spectral changes induced by zinc ion binding did not reflect the optical activity of the LMCT bands, Cd(II) binding was monitored in a control experiment (data not shown). The metal ion-induced spectral changes upon formation of the 1:1 complexes (positions of bands and shoulders in the difference spectra) were almost identical for the Zn- and the Cd-peptide. The difference spectra between metal-loaded and metal-free peptides resemble the spectrum of a protein with high α-helix content. The most striking observation; however, is that the zinc-induced changes of the secondary structure are almost completed with only 0.5 equivalents of zinc added (compare Fig. 1). By competition experiments with Quin-2 we determined KD values of 9.3 (±0.5) pm and 27.2 (±5) pm for the Zn-C4- and the Zn-C2H2-peptide, respectively. Kinetics of Zinc Ion Binding to the Peptides and Zinc Ion Transfer to EDTA—The kinetics of zinc binding to the C2H2-peptide can be described by a simple reversible second order binding mechanism since the full absorbance change is reached in a single kinetic step (Fig. 2A). Zinc binding is accompanied by an increase of tyrosine fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B), which shows the same kinetics as the absorbance signal (Fig. 2A), indicating that the same process is monitored with both methods. Although zinc binding could be fitted as an irreversible reaction without resulting in a modified association rate constant (k1), we preferred to show the data obtained from the numerical fits with the reversible mechanism. The statistical error in the dissociation rate constant k–1 is very high, but its numerical value demonstrates that k–1 is extremely low. Zinc binding to the C4-peptide appears multi-phasic and requires a multistep mechanism for simultaneous fitting of the concentration-dependent curves. The simulation of relaxation traces with a one-step binding model as described for the C2H2 peptide generally failed to match the observed curve shapes (data not shown). For [Zn2+]total > [C4]total a two-step binding mechanism (first two equations in Fig. 2C) proved to be sufficient, but when including measurements with [Zn2+]total < [C4]total the slow transitions in the end phase of the reactions (lower reaction traces in Fig. 2C) failed to be properly described. The minimal model mechanism which fits the experimental data over the full concentration range consists of three reaction steps and is presented in Fig. 2C: (i) in a bimolecular association the free peptide (P with e220,fitted = 32,700 ± 100 m–1 cm–1) forms a first peptide-zinc complex (PZn* with e220, fitted = 42790 ± 160 m–1 cm–1). (ii) The following unimolecular step results in PZn (ϵ220, fitted = 45,510 (±46) m–1 cm–1). (iii) Conditions with [Zn2+]total < [C4]total required to include an additional reaction step. We modeled this step as the formation of a metal-(peptide)2 complex (PZnP, e220, fitted = 77,600 (±310) m–1 cm–1). Zinc can be removed from the peptide complexes by EDTA. The transfer of zinc to EDTA is accompanied by the disappearance of the charge transfer bands (Fig. 3A) and in the case of the C2H2-peptide additionally by a decrease of the fluorescence signal to the level of the metal-free peptide (data not shown) with the same time dependence. The kinetics of zinc transfer from Zn1-C4 and Zn1-C2H2 to EDTA (Fig. 3) is bi-phasic. The first phase of the reactions is completed within 100 ms and virtually independent of the EDTA concentration (Fig. 3B). Rate constants of 65 (±14) s–1 and 70 (±40) s–1 resulted for the C2H2- and the C4-peptide, respectively. The apparent rate constants for the second process are by 1–2 orders of magnitude lower and show hyperbolic saturation with increasing EDTA concentration for both peptides (Fig. 3C). Maximum transfer rate constants of kmax = 8.4 (±0.5) s–1 and 5.8 (±0.1) s–1 result for Zn1-C4, and Zn1-C2H2, respectively. Quin-2 was alternatively used to remove zinc from the Zn1-C4-peptide (data not shown) resulting in kmax = 10.5 (±1.6) s–1. EXAFS Spectroscopy of Zn-C4-, Cd-C4-, and Zn-C2H2-peptide Complexes—Two experiments at peptide-to-zinc stoichiometries of 2:1 and 1:1 were recorded for both peptides. Independent of the peptide/zinc stoichiometry virtually identical spectra resulted for C4-samples (see Fig. 4, A and B and Table I). Alternative structural models were used for fitting. To judge the quality of the fits the coordination number of shells (Ni), distances (Ri), Debye-Waller factors (σ2), and Fermi energy (Ef) offset were refined simultaneously. Thus the correlation matrix obtained revealed statistical dependences of individual parameters (compare Table I).Table IResults of the theoretical EXAFS data analysis for the Zn-C4-peptide complexAtomNiRσ2 × 103EfFIREXAFSÅModel A (4S, 1 shell of 4 identical scatterers) S42.345 ± 0.0028.8 ± 0.2-10.8 ± 0.40.08918.7Model B (3S + S, 1 shell with 3 identical sulfur atoms, second shell with 1 sulfur) S32.33 ± 0.0112 ± 1-10.4 ± 0.60.08618.5 S12.34 ± 0.012 ± 1Model C (3S + 1 O, 1 shell with 3 identical sulfur atoms, second shell with 1 oxygen) S32.340 ± 0.0035.5 ± 0.3-12.1 ± 0.10.08818.6 O12.34 ± 0.0114 ± 4Model D ((4-×)S + ×S, 2 shells with sulfur atoms, Ni refined) S3.672.33 ± 0.0446.7 ± 6.3-10.0 ± 0.20.08518.3 S0.33 ± 2.622.20 ± 0.446 ± 44Model E ((4-×)S + ×O = 4, 1 shell with identical sulfur atoms, second shell with oxygen, Ni refined) S3.762.333 ± 0.0047.75 ± 1.31-10.4 ± 0.20.08318.1 O0.24 ± 0.381.99 ± 0.073.86 ± 3.86 Open table in a new tab Models A–E (Table I) are solely composed of zinc-coordinating atoms.

Cholecystokinin (CCK)-stimulated signaling is abnormal in some forms of hyperlipidemia, suggesting the possibility of unique sensitivity to its lipid environment. Here we examined the influence of cholesterol and sphingolipids on CCK receptors in model Chinese hamster ovary cell systems having lipid levels modified. Cholesterol was modulated chemically or metabolically, and sphingolipids were modulated using a temperature-sensitive cell line (SPB-1). Receptor conformation was probed with a fluorescent full agonist ligand, Alexa 488-conjugated Gly-[Nle28,31]CCK-(26–33), shown previously to decrease in anisotropy and lifetime when occupying a receptor in the active conformation (Harikumar, K. G., Pinon, D. L., Wessels, W. S., Prendergast, F. G., and Miller, L. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 18552–18560). Anisotropy and lifetime of this probe were increased and prolonged with cholesterol enrichment, and decreased and shortened with depletion of cholesterol or sphingolipids. The increase in these parameters with cholesterol enrichment may reflect change in CCK receptor conformation toward its inactive, uncoupled state. Indeed, cholesterol enrichment resulted in nonproductive agonist ligand binding, with affinity of binding higher than normal and calcium signaling in response to this reduced. In cholesterol- and sphingolipid-depleted states, the receptor moved into conformations that were less than optimal. With cholesterol depletion, both ligand binding and signaling were decreased, yet internalization and trafficking were unperturbed. With sphingolipid depletion, ligand binding and signaling were normal, but internalization and trafficking were markedly inhibited. Of note, normal transferrin receptor trafficking through the same clathrin-dependent pathway was maintained under these conditions. Thus, lipid microenvironment of the CCK receptor is particularly important, with different lipids having distinct effects."
https://openalex.org/W2131597939,"Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is characterized by extracellular deposition of transthyretin (TTR) aggregates and amyloid fibrils, particularly in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and is accompanied with changes in connective tissue. Given the invasiveness of nerve biopsy, FAP salivary glands (SGs) were used in microarray analysis; biglycan and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), two genes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling were overexpressed in FAP. Results were validated by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry both in SG and in nerve biopsies of different stages of disease progression. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which exists as a complex with NGAL, was also increased in FAP and in vitro degraded TTR aggregates and fibrils; however in the presence of serum amyloid P, a universal amyloid component, TTR fibrils became resistant to MMP-9 proteolysis. Biglycan, NGAL, and MMP-9 are transcriptionally up-regulated by NF-kappaB, a transcription factor that is activated in FAP nerves and SG. Given the relationship between inflammation and ECM remodeling, and the increase of proinflammatory cytokines in FAP, IL-10 expression in FAP nerves was investigated; IL-10 increased after fibril deposition, suggesting a balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Changes in ECM-related proteins and inflammatory events may be relevant for therapy in FAP and other neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2020239066,"Accumulating evidence indicates that calpains can reside in or translocate to the cell nucleus, but their functions in this compartment remain poorly understood. Dissociated cultures of cerebellar granule cells (GCs) demonstrate improved long-term survival when their growth medium is supplemented with depolarizing agents that stimulate Ca2+ influx and activate calmodulin-dependent signaling cascades, notably 20 mm KCl. We previously observed Ca2+-dependent down-regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) type IV, which was attenuated by calpain inhibitors, in GCs supplemented with 20 mm KCl (Tremper-Wells, B., Mathur, A., Beaman-Hall, C. M., and Vallano, M. L. (2002) J. Neurochem. 81, 314–324). CaMKIV is highly enriched in the nucleus and thought to be critical for improved survival. Here, we demonstrate by immunolocalization/confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation that the regulatory and catalytic subunits of m-calpain are enriched in GC nuclei, including GCs grown in medium containing 5 mm KCl. Calpain-mediated proteolysis of CaMKIV is selective, as several other nuclear and non-nuclear calpain substrates were not degraded under chronic depolarizing culture conditions. Depolarization and Ca2+-dependent down-regulation of CaMKIV were associated with significant alterations in other components of the Ca2+-CaMKIV signaling cascade: the ratio of phosphorylated to total cAMP response element-binding protein (a downstream CaMKIV substrate) was reduced by ∼10-fold, and the amount of CaMK kinase (an upstream activator of CaMKIV) protein and mRNA was significantly reduced. We hypothesize that calpain-mediated CaMKIV proteolysis is an autoregulatory feedback response to sustained activation of a Ca2+-CaMKIV signaling pathway, resulting from growth of cultures in medium containing 25 mm KCl.

Over 4 decades ago, a neutral Ca2+-activated protease was extracted from the soluble fraction of rat brain (2Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 149-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterized by its calcium dependence and sequence homology to the protease domain of the papain family of cysteine proteases, it was designated calpain. Presently, calpains are recognized as ubiquitous Ca2+-dependent endopeptidases, and more than 1 dozen mammalian gene products have been identified, with expression of some isoforms in all cell types examined (3Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 4Tremper-Wells B. Vallano M.L. Recent Res. Dev. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1-15Google Scholar). Homologs have also been studied in nematodes, insects, yeast, and fungi (3Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The calpain family includes ubiquitous and tissue-specific isoforms, the most common being μ (calpain I) and m (calpain II), consisting of identical regulatory and distinct catalytic subunits that confer different sensitivities to Ca2+. In vitro, m-calpain binds Ca2+ with relatively low affinity (millimolar), and μ-calpain binds with higher affinity (micromolar); but their Ca2+ requirements in cells and tissues are influenced by several factors that may lower these requirements (5Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Taylor R.G. Zalewska T. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Calpains catalyze the proteolysis of numerous and diverse cytosolic, cytoskeletal, and membrane-associated substrates in response to cell injury in vivo and in vitro (6Shields D.C. Banik N.L. J.

Other studies using cell culture models have provided valuable mechanistic information about activation of calpains, relevant substrates, and their roles in the injury process (11Gil-Parrado S.

Consistent with these studies, dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, as occurs in many models of neuronal injury, is poorly tolerated by neurons. Although best known for their roles in neuropathologies, calpains also catalyze a variety of structural and enzymatic responses to physiological alterations in Ca2+ (12Chan S.L. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci.

Taken together, these data indicate that calpains may have important roles in the nuclear compartment, yet we understand little about relevant substrates and functional consequences of nuclear calpain activity. Previously, we observed Ca2+-dependent proteolysis of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) type IV in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells (GCs) when the culture medium was supplemented with 20 mm KCl (1Tremper-Wells B. Mathur A. Beaman-Hall C.M. Vallano M.L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Investigators who study GCs routinely supplement the growth medium with elevated KCl (25 mm final concentration), which stimulates Ca2+ entry through voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs), thereby improving long-term survival (24Hack N. Hidaka H. Wakefield M.J. Balazs R. Neuroscience. 1993; 57: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, referred to as “activity dependence,” is acquired at 2–3 days in vitro (DIV), and subsequent withdrawal of KCl at any time thereafter triggers apoptosis within hours (25D'Mello S.

Based on in vitro reconstitution studies using purified calpain, caspase, and CaMKIV, it was determined that CaMKIV is a substrate for both caspase and calpain (31McGinnis K.M. Whitton M.M.

Mathur A. Beaman-Hall C.M. Vallano M.L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that a nuclear calpain that selectively cleaves CaMKIV is activated in response to sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+ resulting from growth of cultures in medium containing elevated KCl. Herein, we provide direct evidence for m-calpain localization in the nuclei of GCs and demonstrate that proteolysis of CaMKIV is associated with profound alterations in associated upstream and downstream signaling molecules.

SuperSignal® West Pico and West Dura and Micro BCA™ reagents were purchased from Pierce. Vectashield fluorescence mounting medium was purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Other reagents for cell culture were tissue culture-grade and were obtained from commercial sources. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of GCs were prepared and grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 as described (33Vallano M.L. Lambolez B. Audinat E. Rossier J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 631-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after plating, serum-containing medium was replaced with a chemically defined medium (1Tremper-Wells B. Mathur A. Beaman-Hall C.M. Vallano M.L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) containing 10 μm cytosine arabinoside to prevent glial overgrowth and, where indicated, supplemented with 20 mm KCl. In a series of experiments involving the activation of cytosolic calpains in response to cell stress, the procedures described previously (34Nath R. Probert A. McGinnis K.M. Wang K.K.W. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were used. Briefly, granule cells were cultured in DMEM containing 30 mm KCl (final concentration) or 5 mm KCl, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mg/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 24 h, half of the medium was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM containing cytosine arabinoside. At 7 DIV, experimental cultures were washed twice with serum-free DMEM containing 30 mm KCl and incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 5 mm KCl for 16 h, and protein was harvested. Rat hippocampal cells were thawed and plated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were resuspended in Neurobasal medium with 2% B27, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Neurons were seeded at 1 ml/well in 24-well dishes containing coverslips and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air for 4 h. The medium was removed from the cells, and fresh medium was added. Cells were returned to the incubator until 7 DIV. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were collected in 0.32 m sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples were either homogenized by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with 1% saponin or sonicated at the lowest setting for 20 s (VibraCell, Sonics & Materials, Inc., Newton, CT) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The pellet (crude nuclear fraction) was resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose buffer. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged a second time at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (crude cytoplasmic fraction) was collected. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were equalized for protein based on the Micro BCA™ assay. Immunocytochemistry/Western Immunoblotting—For immunocytochemistry, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBA (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), and blocked with PBA containing 2% donkey serum. (Note that bovine serum albumin was not included for CaMKIIδ analysis.) Cultures were incubated with anti-CaMKIV antibody (diluted 1:50 in PBA) for 2 h. Cultures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-CaMKIIδ antibody (diluted 1:100 in PBS with 2% donkey serum); anti-calpain antibodies against the regulatory and catalytic subunits (diluted 1:100 in PBA with 1% donkey serum); anti-activated caspase-3 antibody (diluted 1:100 in PBA); and anti-CREB antibody (diluted 1:500 in PBA with 1% donkey serum). Cultures were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in 2% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature in the dark as follows. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody for calpain (regulatory and catalytic subunits; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or for CaMKIIδ was diluted 1:200; Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit CREB antibody was diluted 1:400; and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse CaMKIV antibody was diluted 1:200. Coverslips were mounted onto slides using Vectashield Antifade and digitally photographed using a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES confocal microscopy system with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (×40 or oil immersion ×60 objective). Identical parameters (e.g. gain, iris, laser %, etc.) were set when comparing images within each cell preparation. For Western immunoblotting, whole tissue homogenate or whole cell lysates were harvested in 1 mm NaVO4, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, and 10% glycerol and sonicated. Samples were equalized for protein content based on the Micro BCA™ assay. Proteins were resolved using 4–20% gradient (spectrin), 5% (IP3R), 6% (NF-H), and 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels; transferred to nitrocellulose membrane; and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM) and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) (CaMKIIδ, spectrin, p35, protein phosphatase 2A, NF-H, IP3R, cleaved caspase-3, and c-Jun), in 5% NFDM and PBS (CaMKIV and calpain), or in 3% NFDM and PBS (CREB and phosphorylated CREB). Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the following diluted primary antibodies: anti-CaMKIV (diluted 1:2000 in 5% NFDM and PBS), anti-calpain (diluted 1:200 in 5% NFDM and PBS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-calpain (diluted 1:5000 in 5% NFDM and TTBS; Triple Point Biologics Inc.), anti-c-Jun (diluted 1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin and TTBS), anti-CaMKIIδ (diluted 1:1000 in 5% NFDM and TTBS), anti-spectrin or anti-NF-H (diluted 1:1000 in 5% NFDM and TTBS), anti-p35 (diluted 1:400 in 5% NFDM and TTBS), anti-protein phosphatase 2A (diluted 1:500 in 5% NFDM and TTBS), anti-IP3R (diluted 1:100 in 5% NFDM and TTBS), anti-CREB (diluted 1:800 in 3% NFDM and TTBS), anti-phosphorylated CREB (diluted 1:500 in 3% NFDM and TTBS), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (diluted 1:1000 in 5% NFDM and TTBS). Blots were incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in 5% NFDM as follows: mouse anti-CaMKIV, anti-NF-H, and anti-spectrin (diluted 1:750); anti-calpain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); goat anti-protein phosphatase 2A and anti-CaMKIIδ (diluted 1:4000); anti-p35, anti-c-Jun, and anti-calpain (Triple Point Biologics Inc.); rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 and anti-CREB (diluted 1:1000); and rabbit anti-IP3R (diluted 1:500). SuperSignal® West Pico or West Dura and x-ray films were used to visualize immunoreactivity. To ensure linearity of the assays, multiple protein concentrations were routinely analyzed. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Whole cell RNA was isolated from cultures using a QIAGEN RNeasy® mini kit. The concentration and purity of RNA were assessed with a spectrophotometer using nucleotide absorption at 260 nm and a ratio of 260/280 nm. Harvested RNA was used in a reverse transcription reaction to produce cDNA for use as template in PCR. RNA (0.1–0.2 μg) in 4 μl of sterile water was heated to 94 °C for 5 min and then immediately cooled on ice. Six microliters of a mixture containing (final concentrations) 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, reverse transcription buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol), the four dNTPs (0.5 mm each), 20 units of RNasin® ribonuclease inhibitor, and 5 μm hexamer random primers was added to each RNA sample (final volume of 10 μl). The reverse transcription reaction was initiated by incubating the total mixture at 37 °C for 60 min to promote cDNA synthesis and terminated by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and then placing the tubes on ice and diluting to 0.1–5.0 ng/μl using sterile water. Following reverse transcription, PCR was performed in a final volume of 100 μl containing Taq buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and 50 mm KCl), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.17 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold® (CaMKIV) or Taq (actin and CaMK kinase (CaMKK))), the four dNTPs (0.05 mm each), and oligonucleotide primers (25 pmol each) as follows: CaMKIVβ, 5′-TGCAAGGTAGAAGGGACTCG-3′ (upstream sense) and 5′-GTACTGGAGGTGACCGAGGA-3′ (downstream antisense); actin, 5′-TCATGAAGTGTGACGTTGAC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGC-3′ (downstream) (35Kudo H. Doi Y. Nishino T. Nara S. Hamasaki K. Fujimoto S. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); and CaMKKβ, 5′-GAATCAGTACACGCTGAAG-3′ (upstream) and 5′-GACCTCCTCTTCGGTC-3′ (downstream). Prior to PCR, samples were incubated at 95 °C for 7 min (CaMKIV), 5 min (actin), or 2 min (CaMKK). The CaMKIV PCR protocol consisted of 36 cycles in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model 480 Tempcycler as follows: denaturing for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 56 °C, and extension for 45 s at 72 °C, ending with a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C. The actin PCR protocol consisted of 26 cycles of denaturing for 60 s at 94 °C, annealing for 60 s at 60 °C, and extension for 2 min at 72 °C, ending with a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The CaMKK protocol consisted of 45 cycles of denaturing for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 50 °C, and extension for 60 s at 72 °C, ending with a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified products were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide or a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV illumination. Statistical Analysis—The means ± S.E. are presented; the data were analyzed by Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered to be significant. Depolarization and Calcium-dependent Down-regulation of CaMKIV Are Selective Processes—Fig. 1A is a series of Western immunoblots demonstrating that supplementation of the GC culture medium with 20 mm KCl (25 mm final concentration) resulted in down-regulation of CaMKIV compared with other calpain substrates. In 22 different cell preparations harvested at 5 DIV, densitometric scanning of the immunoblots indicated that the amount of immunoreactive CaMKIV/mg of total homogenate protein in 25 mm KCl-containing cultures was significantly decreased (by at least 90%) compared with CaMKIV in5mm KCl-containing cultures. In contrast, two other calpain substrates that are localized in the nuclear compartment, CREB and protein phosphatase 2A, were not down-regulated in GCs grown in 25 mm versus 5 mm KCl. In fact, an apparent increase in the amount of immunoreactive CREB was observed. Also, growth of GCs in medium containing 25 mm versus 5 mm KCl did not lead to down-regulation of several non-nuclear calpain substrates. As exemplified, substantial increases in IP3R and NF-H and no change in CaMKIIδ were observed. Similarly, no change and a moderate increase in immunoreactive spectrin and p35, respectively, were observed in GCs grown for 8 DIV in medium containing 30 mm versus 5 mm KCl (see Fig. 4). These data, together with our prior demonstration of increases or no changes in the amounts of microtubule-associated protein-2, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR1 subunit, and a distinct isoform of CaMKII (1Tremper-Wells B. Mathur A. Beaman-Hall C.M. Vallano M.L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), indicate that the observed KCl-associated reduction in immunoreactive CaMKIV is a selective effect.Fig. 4Non-nuclear calpain is activated in granule neurons after KCl withdrawal. Shown are Western immunoblots comparing intact spectrin and its breakdown products (upper panel), CaMKIV (middle panel), and p35 (lower panel) in granule neurons grown in 5 mm KCl, 30 mm KCl, or 30 mm KCl followed by KCl withdrawal at 7 DIV (30→5mM) as indicated. Whole cell homogenates were harvested at 8 DIV and processed for immunoblot analysis (30 μg/lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in the Western immunoblots in Fig. 1B (first and second panels), CaMKIV down-regulation required prolonged exposure to elevated KCl since it was not observed after overnight exposure of cultures to 20 mm NaCl or 40 mm mannitol or after exposure to 20 mm KCl for only 1 h. As reported previously (1Tremper-Wells B. Mathur A. Beaman-Hall C.M. Vallano M.L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), down-regulation of CaMKIV also required activation of L-type VSCCs and CaMKII or CaMKIV since it was not observed after overnight exposure of cultures to 20 mm KCl plus the VSCC antagonist nifedipine or to 20 mm KCl plus the cell-permeable CaMKII/IV antagonist KN-62 (Fig. 1B, third and fourth panels). These data indicate that down-regulation of immunoreactive CaMKIV is a depolarization- and Ca2+-dependent process and requires prior activation of a CaMK, perhaps CaMKIV itself. The Regulatory and Catalytic Subunits of m-calpain Are Enriched in the Nuclei of Granule Neurons—In Fig. 2A, the KCl-mediated down-regulation of immunoreactive CaMKIV is contrasted with its lack of effect on CaMKIIδ, assessed usin"

CEACAM1-overexpressing versus CEACAM1-silenced human microvascular endothelial cells were used in migration and tube formation assays.

Western blot analyses confirm these results for VEGF and endostatin at the protein level. These results suggest that constitutive expression of CEACAM1 in microvascular endothelial cells switches them to an angiogenic phenotype, whereas CEACAM1 silencing apparently abrogates the VEGF-induced morphogenetic effects during capillary formation.

Angiogenesis is defined as sprouting of new blood vessels from preexisting blood vessels and is a prerequisite for tumor growth and metastasis. It is regulated by angiogenic activators and inhibitors (1Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5991) Google Scholar, 2Carmeliet P. Nat.

The human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule-1 (CEACAM1), formerly known as biliary glycoprotein or CD66a in humans and C-CAM in rats, is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (28Obrink B. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and is a major carrier of SiLeX residues (29Stocks S.C. Ruchaud-Sparagano M.H. Kerr M.A. Grunert F. Haslett C. Dransfield I.

It mediates cell adhesion via homophilic as well as heterophilic binding to other members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family (30Rojas M. Fuks A. Stanners C.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 527-533PubMed Google Scholar). CEACAM1 is expressed in epithelia and leukocytes in addition to angiogenicly activated endothelia. It has been shown that mRNA levels of CEACAM1 are down-regulated in some tumors such as colorectal and prostate carcinomas (31Nollau P. Prall F. Helmchen U. Wagener C. Neumaier M. Am. J.

It has been reported that the tumor-inhibitory function of CEACAM1 depends on the cis-determinants in its cytoplasmic domain (33Izzi L. Turbide C. Houde C. Kunath T. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5563-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Singer et al. (34Singer B.B. Scheffrahn I. Obrink B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1236-1244PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that CEACAM1 is expressed differently in proliferating and quiescent epithelial cells and that this influenced the proliferation activity of these cells. Furthermore, it was shown that CEACAM1 is involved in the regulation of insulin clearance in the liver (35Poy M.N. Yang Y. Rezaei K. Fernstrom M.A. Lee A.D. Kido Y. Erickson S.K. Najjar S.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and that CEACAM1 isoforms are expressed on the surface of T cells on activation and involved in the regulation of Th1-mediated inflammation (36Iijima H. Neurath M.F. Nagaishi T. Glickman J.N. Nieuwenhuis E.E. Nakajima A. Chen D. Fuss I.J. Utku N. Lewicki D.N. Becker C. Gallagher T.M. Holmes K.V. Blumberg R.S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, we could demonstrate that CEACAM1 expression is increased during vascularization of stenotic aortic valves (37Chalajour F. Treede H. Ebrahimnejad A. Lauke H. Reichenspurner H. Ergun S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that CEACAM1 exhibits angiogenic properties and functions as a major morphogenic effector for VEGF. We also demonstrated that VEGF is able to up-regulate CEACAM1 in endothelial cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly, CEACAM1 is expressed in the newly formed immature blood vessels of different tumors as well as in new vessels of physiological angiogenesis such as in wound healing and endometrial proliferation (38Ergun S. Kilic N. Ziegeler G. Hansen A. Nollau P. Gotze J. Wurmbach J.H. Horst A. Weil J. Fernando M. Wagener C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Wagener C. Ergun S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most data showing the effects of membrane-bound CEACAM1 have been derived from epithelial or tumor cells. Until now, no data demonstrating the role of membrane-bound CEACAM1 on vascular endothelial cells with regard vascular morphogenesis and the expression of known angiogenic activators and inhibitors have been available. The aim of the present work was to study the role of membrane-bound CEACAM1 in endothelial cells via CEACAM1 overexpression versus gene silencing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that endothelial overexpression of CEACAM1 results in up-regulation of potent angiogenic factors, whereas CEACAM1 silencing leads to an inhibition of VEGF-induced morphogenic events during vascular formation. These results implicate that targeted silencing of the CEACAM1 gene in endothelial cells might be promising for antiangiogenic tumor therapy. Growth Factors and Antibodies—VEGF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Polyclonal VEGF antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Affinity-purified monoclonal antibody to CEACAM1, 4D1/C2, was produced as described previously (40Drzeniek Z. Lamerz R. Fenger U. Wagener C. Haubeck H.D. Cancer Lett. 1991; 56: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The antibody was kindly provided by the group of Prof. C. Wagener (Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf). Monoclonal and polyclonal endostatin antibodies and blocking peptide were kindly provided by J. Folkman (Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Cells and Tissues—Tumor tissue pieces of human glomus caroticum were surgically taken from patients who underwent therapeutical operation and were kindly provided by Prof. W. Kummer (Department of Anatomy, University Hospital Giessen, Giessen, Germany). Tissue pieces were frozen immediately in hydrogen and kept at -80 °C until they were used for immunohistochemistry. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) supplied from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany) were grown in MV medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air. Endothelial Survival Assay—To test the effect of CEACAM1 on the survival of endothelial cells under hunger conditions, we performed a survival assay. HDMECs were cultured in normal endothelial growth medium including the supplement from the supplier (PromoCell) until they reached confluence. After 2-3 days of culture at confluence, the full medium was replaced by hunger medium containing 2% FCS without supplements, and cells were subsequently transfected for CEACAM1 or for LacZ as control using adenoviral transfection. Every 4 days of culture, the medium was renewed. During the culture time, viability was observed by phase-contrast microscopy, and the criteria for viability were the state of confluence and the adherence of endothelial cells. This was documented by photographing the cells daily. After 14-15 days of total culture time, the experiment was stopped, and the results were assessed morphologically. Because adenoviral transfection causes a high amount of CEACAM1, which probably does not reflect the real situation, we also performed a survival assay using non-viral transfection. To this end, HDMECs were transfected with expression vector pcDNA3.1 containing the full-length cDNA of CEACAM1. The efficiency of transfection was controlled by parallel transfection for green fluorescent protein and estimated as ∼60%. CEACAM1-overexpressing HDMECs and wild type HDMECs were cultured in full medium overnight in a 48-well culture plate. In each well, 40,000 cells were seeded so that they formed a confluent monolayer. After 24 h, the full medium was replaced by hunger medium containing only 2% FCS without any supplement. In some wells containing CEACAM1-overexpressing versus wild type HDMECs, a polyclonal VEGF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added at a concentration of 600 ng/ml. The cells were controlled daily and photographed via a phase-contrast microscope equipped with a digital camera (Zeiss). The areas of cell detachment were measured using the morphometric program Optimas™ (Optimas, Seattle, WA). Endothelial Tube Formation Assay—To study the effect of membrane-bound CEACAM1 in capillary morphogenesis, we used CEACAM1-overexpressing versus CEACAM1-silenced HDMECs. Because we observed significant changes on endothelial cell morphology (swollen and enlarged cells) under LacZ or empty virus transfection, we used the expression vector pcDNA3.1/CEACAM1 for tube assay as described below. For the cellular knockdown of CEACAM1, we used the small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique. After transfection of HDMECs, the cells were cultured for 24-48 h and then transferred to three-dimensional type I collagen gel (Vitrogen 100; Collagen Corp.) without further splitting. The three-dimensional collagen gels were prepared in 48-well cluster tissue culture dishes as described previously (41Pepper M.S. Belin D. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 42Ergun S. Kilic N. Wurmbach J-H. Ebrahimnejad A. Fernando M. Sevinc S. Kilic E. Chalajour F. Lauke H. Lamszus K. Hammerer P. Weil J. Herbst H. Folkman J. Angiogenesis. 2001; 4: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CEACAM1-transfected, LacZ-transfected, and wild type HDMECs were seeded onto solidified gels at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/well in 300 μl of MV medium containing 5% FCS. At confluence, the medium was replaced by basal medium containing 2% FCS without further supplements. After 24 h, VEGF (50 ng/ml) alone, VEGF + the CEACAM1-specific antibody 4D1/C2, and 4D1/C2 alone were added to the cells. Endothelial cells were exposed to the basal medium as control. The endothelial tubes were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a digital camera (Zeiss). The morphometric quantification of tubular length was performed using the software program Optimas™ (Optimas). After 3-6 days, gels were taken from the wells, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry studies. Adenoviral Vector Construction and HDMEC Transfection—To overexpress membrane-bound CEACAM1 in human vascular endothelial cells in a glycosylated form comparable with native CEACAM1, we used the homologous recombination technique of adenoviral vectors (43He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar), as we also reported previously for CEACAM1 expression (38Ergun S. Kilic N. Ziegeler G. Hansen A. Nollau P. Gotze J. Wurmbach J.H. Horst A. Weil J. Fernando M. Wagener C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were plated on Petri dishes 24 h before transfection, by which time they had reached 70% confluence. CEACAM1 adenoviral vector DNA was digested with PacI, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Cells were washed once with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without antibiotics), and a transfection mix containing 10 μg of linearized plasmid DNA, 20 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and 500 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. Transfected cells were monitored for green fluorescent protein expression and collected 7-10 days after transfection. The viral lysate was used to infect HEK293 cells to generate a high titer of viral stocks that was purified and then used to transfect HDMECs. After 2-3 days, cells were harvested and used for RNA isolation. As control, wild type and LacZ virus-transfected endothelial cells were employed. Construction of CEACAM1 Expression Vector and Transient Transfection—A 1.7-kb full-length cDNA of CEACAM1 was cloned into the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites of expression vector pcDNA3.1/Hygro(-) (Invitrogen) and designated as pcDNA3.1/CEACAM1. Transient transfection of HDMECs was performed using 3.0 μg of DNA and the HMVEC-L Amaxa Nucleofection Kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) along with program S-05 on the Nucleofector device. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription—Total cellular RNA from wild type, adenoviral LacZ-transfected, and CEACAM1-transfected HDMECs was extracted 48-72 h after transfection using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. 3 μg of total RNA each were reverse-transcribed using the You-Prime First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). RNA was used for the generation of cDNA, which was subsequently analyzed by gene array (SuperArray Inc., Bethesda, MD) and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics) to study the expression of angiogenic factors. Gene Array—To determine pathway-specific gene expression profiling, the nonradioactive GEArray™ assay (SuperArray Inc.) was performed. Briefly, total RNA from CEACAM1- and LacZ-transfected and wild type HDMECs was used as a template for biotinylated cDNA synthesis according to the procedure of the supplier. cDNA probes were then hybridized to gene-specific cDNA fragments spotted on the membranes and exposed to x-ray film. The spotted and hybridized areas were then determined by means of comparable densitometric analyses (Optimas™; Optimas). Real-time RT-PCR using the LightCycler System—Real-Time RT-PCR analyses for VEGF, KDR, Ang1, Ang2, Tie-2, and collagen XVIII were carried out on the LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics) as described originally by Wittwer et al. (44Wittwer C.T. Ririe K.M. Andrew R.V. David D.A. Gundry R.A. Balis U.J. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Primers and standard plasmids for relative quantification of the measured genes were generously provided by the Department of Hematology/Oncology (University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Primer sequences were as follows: (a) VEGF, 5′-CCTCCGAAACCATGAACTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCTTTGGTCTGCATTCACTT-3′ (antisense); (b) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTTCTTACTCCTTGGAGGCC-3′ (antisense); (c) collagen 18, 5′-GGCACGCATCTTCTCCTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACGATGTAGGCGTGATGG-3′ (antisense); (d) Ang1, 5′-TTCCTTTCCTTTGCTTTCCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGCAGAGCGTTTGTGTTGT-3′ (antisense); (e) Ang2, 5′-AACATCCCAGTCCACCTGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTCTTGCTTTGGTCCGTTA-3′ (antisense); (f) VEGFR-2 (KDR), 5′-TGCCTACCTCACCTGTTTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCACTGTCCGTCTGGTTGTT-3′ (antisense); and (g) Tie-2, 5′-GTGACCCCTCCCAGAATCTCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACTGCACAGCTGGTTCTTCCT-3′ (antisense). The calculated amount was normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. SDS-PAGE and Western Blots—Protein extracts (15-30 μg of total protein) prepared with lysis buffer solution containing 100 mm Tris and 500 mm sucrose were boiled in SDS sample buffer before being applied into an 8% non-reducing SDS-PAGE for CEACAM1, a 10% non-reducing SDS-PAGE for the detection of VEGF, and a 12% non-reducing SDS-PAGE for the detection of endostatin. After electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) and blocking in Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 5% nonfat milk overnight, blots were incubated with the monoclonal CEACAM1 antibodies (4D1/C2 or T84.1). The subsequent incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was followed by detection using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical staining for CEACAM1 was performed using frozen sections obtained from glomus caroticum tumors and paraffin-embedded sections obtained from gels of the endothelial tube assay. Paraffin-embedded tissues and collagen gels were cut into 4-μm-thick sections and mounted onto glass slides. Every section was de-paraffinized, rehydrated, and then subjected to immunohistochemistry. The nickel-glucose oxidase technique was used for staining of the sections as described previously (45Davidoff M. Schulze W. Histochemistry. 1990; 93: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 46Kilic N. Ergun S. Brooks S.A. Schumacher U. Methods in Molecular Medicine: Metastasis Research Protocols, Cell Behavior In Vitro and In Vivo. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 125-148Google Scholar). Immunolocalization of CEACAM1 was performed using the monoclonal antibody 4D1/C2 (final dilution, 2.5 μg/ml). Controls were performed as described previously (38Ergun S. Kilic N. Ziegeler G. Hansen A. Nollau P. Gotze J. Wurmbach J.H. Horst A. Weil J. Fernando M. Wagener C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The tissue sections as well as sections obtained from the collagen gels were counterstained with Calcium Red for 1-2 min. CEACAM1 Is Expressed in Sprouting but Not in Mother Blood Vessels of Tumors—To determine the expression of CEACAM1 in endothelial cells during vascular formation, we performed immunohistochemistry on paraffin and frozen sections of different human tumors. As shown here in exemplary fashion in sections from highly vascularized glomus caroticum tumors (Fig. 1, A-D), CEACAM1 immunostaining was visible in numerous small blood vessels, but not in large blood vessels (Fig. 1A). Higher magnification of Fig. 1A revealed that endothelial cells of sprouting capillaries exhibit a strong staining for CEACAM1, whereas endothelial cells lining a blood vessel with a larger diameter, presumably a mother blood vessel, remained negative (Fig. 1B). There is no immunostaining in the corresponding control section (Fig. 1, C and D). These data implicate that CEACAM1 is up-regulated in endothelial cells during morphogenesis of new blood vessels.Fig. 1CEACAM1 expression in angiogenic sprouts. Expression of CEACAM1 in sprouting small blood vessels (arrows; A, which is shown at higher magnification in B) but not in endothelial cells of a large mother vessel (BV). No specific staining is visible in the control section (C, which is shown at higher magnification in D). All sections were counterstained with Calcium Red. A and C, ×250; B and D, ×450.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Corresponding to the expression pattern of CEACAM1 in the tumor vasculature, we found in an in vitro tube formation assay that HDMECs penetrating the type I collagen gel and forming endothelial tubes stained strongly positive with the monoclonal CEACAM1 antibody 4D1/C2, whereas endothelial cells remaining at the top of the gel were negative or stained only very weakly (Fig. 2A). Higher light microscopic magnification from tube formation areas revealed that CEACAM1 immunostaining is present at the luminal side as well as the basal side of endothelial cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, endothelial cells, which were not involved into tube formation and remained at the top of collagen gel, revealed no specific immunostaining for CEACAM1 (Fig. 2, D and E). CEACAM1 Overexpression in HDMECs Induces an Up-regulation of Angiogenic Factors—Next, we wanted to determine whether CEACAM1 overexpression in HDMECs has any influence on the expression of known potent angiogenic factors. To this end, we transfected HDMECs with CEACAM1 using an adenoviral system to reach high amounts of membrane-bound CEACAM1 in HDMECs and to mimic the up-regulated expression of CEACAM1 in angiogenicly activated endothelial cells as shown above for tumor vasculature and tube-forming endothelial cells. LacZ-transfected and/or nontransfected endothelial cells were used as control. The up-regulation of CEACAM1 in HDMECs at the protein level was confirmed by Western blot analyses (Fig. 3A). The overview of the gene array membranes demonstrated clear differences between CEACAM1-transfected (Fig. 3B) and LacZ-transfected (Fig. 3C) HDMECs with regard to the expression of factors from which the cDNA was immobilized in these membranes. The densitometric analyses of these nonradioactive gene array studies as well as real-time RT-PCR studies using the LightCycler System revealed a significant up-regulation of angiogenic activators such as VEGF (Fig. 3D), angiopoietin-1 (Fig. 3E), angiopoietin-2 (Fig. 3F), and Tie-2 (Fig. 3G). Whereas VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) expression showed a nonsignificant tendency to increase (data not shown), VEGFR-2 (KDR) expression was enhanced in CEACAM1-overexpressing HDMECs, particularly in LightCycler analyses, but the difference was not significant in gene array studies (Fig. 3H). Furthermore, in gene array analyses, we found a significant up-regulation of angiogenin (Fig. 3I) and interleukin (IL)-8 (Fig. 3J). CEACAM1 Overexpression in HDMECs Down-regulates Collagen XVIII, the Maternal Substance of the Angiogenesis Inhibitor Endostatin, and the Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Tie-1—Gene array as well as real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed a down-regulation of collagen XVIII, the maternal substance of the angiogenic inhibitor endostatin (Fig. 3K), in CEACAM1-overexpressing HDMECs. Remarkably, the expression of Tie-1, a receptor belonging to the tyrosine kinase receptor family with unknown ligand, also was significantly down-regulated in HDMECs overexpressing CEACAM1 (Fig. 3L).

APH-1 and NCT stabilize the PS1 holoprotein, whereas PEN-2 is critical for endoproteolysis of PS1. To define the structural domains of PEN-2 that are necessary for mediating PS1 endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity, we coexpressed APH-1, NCT, and PS1 together with a series of PEN-2 mutants, which harbored deletions in hydrophilic segments, or chimeric PEN-2 molecules that contained heterologous transmembrane domains (TMDs). We now report that with the exception of the PEN-2 variants with deletions proximal to the TMDs, the vast majority of the deletion variants were functional. Mutants that were nonfunctional were also unstable but were rescued by transposition of a heterologous sequence containing conservative amino acid substitutions into the deleted region. Notably, the carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain of PEN-2 was dispensable for promoting PS1 endoproteolysis but was critical for stabilizing the resulting PS1 derivatives. More importantly, we demonstrated that a chimeric PEN-2 with a replacement of the TMD2 with the TMD1 from sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) is fully functional but that a chimeric PEN-2 with a replacement of the TMD1 with the TMD2 from SREBP-1 is not. The function of this latter chimera was rescued by the replacement of the proximal two-thirds of the SREBP-1 TMD2 with the proximal two-thirds of the authentic TMD1 from PEN-2. These results suggest that the proximal two-thirds of the PEN-2 TMD1 is functionally important for endoproteolysis of PS1 holoproteins and the generation of PS1 fragments, essential components of the γ-secretase complex.

The components of the γ-secretase complex are presenilins (PS1 and PS2), nicastrin (NCT), APH-1, and PEN-2, and the demonstration that coexpression of these four molecules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is sufficient to reconstitute γ-secretase activity (2Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) has confirmed that these four proteins are the essential core components for the catalytic activity. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that the steady-state accumulation of each of the components of the complex is coordinately regulated, and in large part dependent, on the expression of other members of the complex (for review see Ref. 3Periz G.

At present, little information is available pertaining to the mechanism(s) by which PEN-2 promotes the endoproteolysis of PS1. Identification of the molecular interactions between the individual components of the γ-secretase complex has offered insights into the assembly of the γ-secretase complex and its function. For example, mutational analyses of NCT and APH-1 reveal that the proximal one-third of the lone transmembrane domain (TMD) of NCT and the GXXXG motif of the TMD4 of APH-1 are critical for formation of the γ-secretase complex (12Capell A.

In the present study, we systemically introduced mutations in various regions of PEN-2 to determine the molecular domains of PEN-2 required for its function in promoting endoproteolysis of PS1 holoproteins. We previously demonstrated that coexpression of PS1, APH-1, and NCT increases the level of stabilized full-length PS1, but the proteolytic conversion of the stabilized PS1 holoprotein into NTF and CTF only occurs by additional expression of PEN-2 (6Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The γ-secretase-mediated production of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) is correspondingly elevated in these cells (6Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we tested the function of a series of PEN-2 variants that either have deletions in hydrophilic domains or contain a heterologous TMD by coexpressing these molecules with APH-1, NCT, and PS1 and examining their effects on (1Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) the endoproteolysis of PS1 and (2Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) the γ-secretase-mediated generation of the AICD. We now provide evidence that with the exception of two mutants that were intrinsically unstable, expression of a variety of PEN-2 mutants that harbored small deletions (7-9 amino acids) promoted PS1 endoproteolysis, commensurate with an elevation in steady-state levels of the γ-secretase-generated AICD derivative. The function of the unstable mutants was rescued by replacing the authentic segment with a heterologous sequence containing conservative amino acid substitutions at each residue. Furthermore, PEN-2 mutants harboring truncations of small segments of the carboxyl-terminal domain or the entire carboxyl terminus were fully functional with respect to the conversion of the PS1 holoprotein to endoproteolytic derivatives, but the resulting PS1 fragments exhibited short half-lives. Finally, and most importantly, we demonstrate that a PEN-2 chimera, in which the TMD2 is replaced with the TMD1 from sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), still retains activity. However, a PEN-2 chimera, in which the TMD1 is replaced with a heterologous TMD segment from SREBP-1, is inactive and does not associate with PS1. Finally, a PEN-2 chimera that contains the proximal two-thirds of the PEN-2 TMD1 and the distal one-third of the SREBP-1 TMD2, was functional in promoting PS1 endoproteolysis and, in parallel, enhanced production of the AICD. Thus, we conclude that the proximal two-thirds of the PEN-2 TMD1 is functionally important for endoproteolysis of PS1 holoproteins and the generation of PS1-NTF and -CTF, essential components of the γ-secretase complex. Constructs—The cDNAs encoding human PS1, NCT, CT11-tagged PEN-2, Myc epitope-tagged APH-1αL, and Myc epitope-tagged Swedish variant APP695 (APPswe) were described previously (6Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T.

All of the PEN-2 cDNAs contain a sequence encoding the last 7 amino acids (RFLEERP) of APLP1 at the carboxyl-terminal end, which is recognized by the CT11 antibody (6Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C.

PS1NT and αPS1Loop antibodies are polyclonal antibodies that recognize residues 1–65 and 320–375 of PS1, respectively; CT15 was generated against a peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acids of APP; and the CT11 antibody specifically recognizes the last 7 amino acids of APLP1. The PNT-2 antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal 26 amino acids of PEN-2 (a kind gift from Dr. Gopal Thinakaran (7Luo W.J. Wang H. Li H. Kim B.S. Shah S. Lee H.J.

CTM2 is a polyclonal antibody that was generated against a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal end of APP fused with a Myc epitope tag (a kind gift from Dr. Gopal Thinakaran). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and transformed fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos with homozygous deletions of PS1 (PS1–/–) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells were maintained in 50% Dulbecco' s modified Eagle's medium and 50% of Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Where indicated, cycloheximide (30 μg/ml) was added for 0–6 h. To generate stable cell lines expressing either wild-type or various PEN-2 mutants, N2a cells stably expressing Swedish APP695 and wild-type PS1 (N2aWT.11) (17Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K.

Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Cells were selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin-B (Invitrogen) and screened for the expression of transgenes. Western Blot—Detergent lysates of cells were prepared using immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (a mixture of 4-(2-aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, bestain, leupeptin and aprotinin, Sigma) (19Kim S.H.

Lysates were subjected to Tris/glycine or 16.5% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE, and the fractionated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) prior to incubation with selected antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and quantified by densitometry. Protease Protection Assay—Membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (20Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat.

After incubation at room temperature for 40 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet fraction was resuspended in Laemmli SDS sample buffer and fractionated by 16.5% Tris/Tricine SDS/PAGE. Coimmunoprecipitation—Subconfluent dishes of stable N2a lines were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer (1% CHAPS (Calbiochem), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Lysates were subject to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant fraction containing detergent-solubilized proteins was used for coimmunoprecipitation studies. Functional Effects of PEN-2 Deletion Variants on PS1 Endoproteolysis and AICD Production—We previously demonstrated that stable coexpression of PS1, APH-1, and NCT leads to increased steady-state levels of full-length PS1 and that the endoproteolytic conversion of the stabilized PS1 holoprotein into NTF and CTF is dependent upon added expression of PEN-2 (6Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In these settings, the elevated levels of PS1 derivatives are paralleled by an increase in γ-secretase-mediated production of the AICD (6Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine the functional domains of PEN-2 necessary for promoting PS1 endoproteolysis and γ-secretase-mediated generation of the AICD, we generated cDNAs encoding various PEN-2 deletion mutants (Fig. 1A) and transiently expressed these constructs in HEK293 cells along with cDNAs encoding PS1, APH-1α, NCT, and APPswe. We chose to assay six deletion variants of PEN-2 that lack hydrophilic segments that are highly conserved from human to Caenorhabditis elegans: two in the NH2-terminal region (Δ3–9 and Δ10–16), two in the hydrophilic loop between the TMD1 and the TMD2 (Δ40–46 and Δ52–60), and two in the carboxyl-terminal region (Δ85–92 and Δ93–100) (Fig. 1A). Wild-type (WT) PEN-2 and the deletion variants harbor a carboxyl-terminal CT11 epitope tag; the CT11-tagged WT PEN-2 promotes endoproteolysis of the PS1 holoprotein and results in “replacement” of endogenous PEN-2 (6Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). With the exception of the Δ52–60 variant (Fig. 1B, lane 6), and to a lesser degree, the Δ10–16 variant (Fig. 1B, lane 4), all other PEN-2 deletion variants accumulated to comparable levels in HEK293 cells that transiently coexpressed PS1, APH-1, and NCT (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 8). Consistent with our previous results (6Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Yu C. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33992-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), coexpression of PS1, APH-1, and NCT led to elevated levels of the PS1 holoprotein (Fig. 1C, lane 1), and additional expression of WT PEN-2 promoted the conversion of the PS1 holoprotein into PS1 fragments (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Among the six mutant PEN-2 constructs tested, coexpression of cDNA encoding Δ3–9, Δ40–46, Δ85–92, or Δ93–100 PEN-2 variants together with APH-1, NCT, and PS1 led to elevated levels of PS1 derivatives that are comparable with the levels achieved in cells expressing WT PEN-2 (Fig. 1C, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 8 versus lane 2). Densitometric quantification failed to reveal any subtle effects of each PEN-2 mutant on PS1 derivatives (data not shown). In contrast, coexpression of Δ10–16 or Δ52–60 PEN-2 variants together with APH-1, NCT, and PS1 failed to increase the levels of PS1 derivatives (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 6), and the PS1 holoprotein accumulated in these cells at levels comparable with cells expressing APH-1, NCT, and PS1 alone (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 4 and 6 with lane 1). To examine the effects of WT PEN-2 or PEN-2 variants on the levels of APP-CTFs and γ-secretase-mediated production of the AICD, we analyzed the same lysates by immunoblotting with the CT15 antibody, specific for epitopes in the APP carboxyl terminus. We observed that in all settings wherein PS1 derivatives were elevated, the steady-state levels of the AICD were also elevated and mirrored by a marked reduction in levels of APP-CTFβ and APP-CTFα (Fig. 1E, lanes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8). On the other hand, in cells that expressed Δ10–16 or Δ52–60 PEN-2 variants along with APH-1, NCT, and PS1, wherein the overexpressed PS1 holoproteins failed to undergo endoproteolysis, the levels of APP-CTFs and the AICD were no different from those observed in cells that express APH-1, NCT, and PS1 (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 4 and 6 with lane 1). Rescued Function of Unstable PEN-2 Deletion Mutants—The results presented in Fig. 1 could be interpreted to suggest that the hydrophilic segments between amino acids 3–9, 40–46, 85–92, and 93–100 are dispensable for PEN-2-mediated endoproteolysis of PS1 and that the regions encompassing amino acids 10–16 and 52–60 are responsible for its function. Alternatively, it could be argued that PEN-2 harboring deletions of amino acids 10–16 or 52–60 are inherently unstable and fail to associate with the complex. In this regard, it has been shown that large deletions in the ectodomain of NCT disrupt the native protein conformation, resulting in mutant proteins that are unstable and unable to incorporate into mature complexes (13Morais V.A.

Capell A. Schmitz J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16474-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is quite apparent that the steady-state levels of the Δ10–16 and Δ52–60 PEN-2 variants are lower than WT PEN-2 or other “functional” PEN-2 variants (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–8), suggesting that the “loss of function” phenotype of these mutants may be confounded by several, not mutually exclusive, issues (including alterations in protein folding or disrupted membrane insertion) that lead to enhanced turnover of these variants. Indeed, both segments are immediately proximal to the TMDs, and hence, it is not surprising that in the absence of these segments, the polypeptides may have perturbed membrane insertion. To address this issue directly, we chose to test the function of two additional PEN-2 mutants, sub10–16 and sub52–60, that harbored conserved amino acid substitutions in each of the two regions of interest (Fig. 2A). Coexpression of either the sub10–16 or the sub52–60 PEN-2 mutants together with APH-1, NCT, and PS1 led to endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (Fig. 2, C and G, lane 4) and the generation of the AICD (Fig. 2, E and I, lane 4), findings that we interpret to suggest that PEN-2 function is largely independent of the exact amino acid sequence in these specific regions. The Carboxyl Terminus of PEN-2 Is Required for Stabilization of PS1 Derivatives—Our finding that the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants, Δ85–92 and Δ93–100, appeared to be functional with respect to PS1 endoproteolysis (Fig. 1) seemed somewhat inconsistent with a recent report by Prokop et al. (9Prokop S. Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) showing that expression of the PEN-2 carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant in PEN-2 knockdown cells does not lead to an elevation in steady-state levels of PS1 fragments. To clarify this issue, we tested a mutant PEN-2 molecule with a truncation of the entirety of the carboxyl-terminal domain of 17 amino acids (Δ85–101) and coexpressed this construct with cDNA encoding APH-1, NCT, and PS1 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A). In these cells, the Δ85–101 PEN-2 mutant promoted proteolytic conversion of the PS1 holoprotein to PS1-NTF (Fig. 3A, lane 6) at levels similar to those observed in cells coexpressing WT PEN-2 and the other three components of the γ-secretase complex (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Realizing that our constructs harbor a CT11 epitope tag that may have influenced the function of the carboxyl-terminal deletion variant, we tested an untagged Δ85–101 PEN-2 variant. The behavior of this PEN-2 mutant, with respect to promoting PS1 endoproteolysis, was indistinguishable from the epitope-tagged Δ85–101 PEN-2 variant (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7). Perplexed with the discrepancies between our data and those from Prokop et al. (9Prokop S. Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that were performed in RNA interference-mediated PEN-2 knockdown lines, we considered the possibility that in our studies, endogenously expressed PEN-2 in HEK293 cells could contribute to the stabilization of PS1 fragments. Hence, we repeated the same experiments in PS1-deficient fibroblasts in which PEN-2 mRNA levels are unaltered. However, the steady-state levels of endogenous PEN-2 are markedly diminished in these cells due to the absence of the stabilizing influence of PS1 (22Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Similar to HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A), expression of APH-1, NCT, and PS1 in PS1-deficient fibroblasts resulted in the accumulation of the PS1 holoprotein without any further increase in levels of PS1 fragments, compared with cells expressing PS1 alone (Fig. 3B, compare lane 3 versus 2). Additional expression of either WT PEN-2 or the Δ85–101 PEN-2 mutant in these cells led to a reduction in levels of accumulated full-length PS1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 6). However, the accumulated levels of PS1-NTF in cells expressing the Δ85–101 PEN-2 mutant were clearly lower than the PS1-NTF levels in cells expressing WT PEN-2 (Fig. 3B, compare lane 6 versus 4). To test whether the differences in steady-state levels of PS1 fragments in these two settings were a result of differences in protein stability, we treated cells with cycloheximide to block de novo protein synthesis. Consistent with several earlier reports (reviewed in Ref. 1Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), PS1 fragments were quite stable in cells that coexpress PS1 with APH-1, NCT, and WT PEN-2, whereas the PS1 holoprotein was rapidly degraded (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–3). Most notable is the demonstration that the PS1 fragments in cells expressing PS1, APH-1, NCT, and the Δ85–101 PEN-2 variant were also relatively unstable (Fig. 3C, lanes 4–6), compared with the PS1-NTF that accumulates in cells expressing WT PEN-2, PS1, NCT, and APH-1 (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–3). These data are fully consistent with the data presented by Prokop et al. (9Prokop S. Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) showing that the half-life of PS1 derivatives in cells expressing carboxyl-terminal deletion variants of PEN-2 is considerably reduced compared with cells expressing WT PEN-2. Why do we observe an elevation in PS1 derivatives in cells expressing the carboxyl-terminal PEN-2 deletion variants, whereas Prokop et al. (9Prokop S. Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) do not? We propose that in contrast to PEN-2 knockdown cells, in which PEN-2 mRNA are depleted, the steady-state levels of PEN-2 mRNA are not altered in PS1-deficient cells relative to wild-type fibroblasts. Therefore, the expression of PS1, NCT, and APH-1 can serve to stabilize newly synthesized endogenous mouse PEN-2 molecules. Thus, a fraction of transiently expressed PS1 holoproteins is subject to endoproteolysis, and the resulting PS1 derivatives assemble into stable complexes with mouse PEN-2 and coexpressed NCT/APH-1 polypeptides. Once the limiting levels of endogenously expressed PEN-2 molecules are “saturated,” the remaining fraction of PS1 holoproteins that is stabilized by endogenous and exogenous APH-1/NCT is then subject to endoproteolysis by virtue of the expression of mutant PEN-2 molecules. Taken together with the results provided by Prokop et al. (9Prokop S. Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic region of PEN-2 (residues 85–101) is dispensable for promoting endoproteolysis of PS1 holoproteins but is critical for stabilizing the resulting PS1 derivatives. The TMD1 of PEN-2 Is Indispensable for Endoproteolysis of PS1 Holoproteins—Having established that deletions and/or substitutions of the vast majority of hydrophilic segments in PEN-2 sequences have little impact on promoting PS1 endoproteolysis, we turned our attention to the TMDs of PEN-2. In this regard, the proximal one-third of the NCT TMD and the GXXXG motif of the TMD4 of APH-1 have been shown to be critical for assembly of the γ-secretase complex (12C"

Together, these primary and secondary fusion events constitute the process of compound exocytosis. It has been suggested that the sequential nature of primary and secondary fusion is a consequence of the requirement for plasma membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors, such as syntaxin 2, to enter the membrane of the primary fused granule. We have tested this possibility by determining the location of syntaxin 2 in unstimulated and stimulated pancreatic acini. Syntaxin 2 was imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Fused granules were detected both through their filling with the aqueous dye lysine-fixable Texas Red-dextran and through the decoration of their cytoplasmic surfaces with filamentous actin. In unstimulated cells, syntaxin 2 was exclusively present on the apical plasma membrane. In contrast, after stimulation, syntaxin 2 had moved into the membranes of fused granules, as judged by its location around dye-filled structures of 1-μm diameter that were coated with filamentous actin. At long times of stimulation (5 min), the majority (85%) of dye-filled granules were also positive for syntaxin 2. In contrast, at shorter times (1 min), more dye-filled granules (29%) were syntaxin 2-negative. We conclude that syntaxin 2 enters the membrane of a fused zymogen granule after the opening of the fusion pore, and we suggest that this movement might permit the onset of secondary fusion.

Regulated exocytosis in the pancreatic acinar cell, in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (1Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), involves the fusion of the membranes of zymogen granules both with the apical plasma membrane and with each other (2Palade G.E.

This latter process, known as sequential or compound exocytosis, occurs in only a few cell types and, in the case of the acinar cell, is likely to be an adaptation to increase the efficiency of digestive enzyme secretion at the spatially restricted apical pole of the cell. It is now accepted that membrane fusion events occurring along the secretory pathway are mediated by trans-membrane complexes of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins (6Jahn R.

The SNAREs of one membrane contribute three helices, each of which contains a strategically located glutamine residue; hence, such SNAREs have been termed Q-SNAREs (e.g. syntaxin and 25-kDa synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP-25)). The fourth helix is provided by the SNARE present on the apposing membrane and contains a similarly placed arginine residue, hence the name R-SNARE (e.g. synaptobrevin). Exocytotic membrane fusion in the acinar cell is known to be SNARE-dependent (8Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 7: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), is likely to be involved in basolaterally directed membrane traffic. Syntaxins 3, 7, and 8 are all present on the granule membrane (8Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol.

Surprisingly, SNAP-23, the non-neuronal isoform of SNAP-25, seems to be located on the basolateral plasma membrane (11Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Wong P.P.S. Klip A. Trimble W.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and on the granule membrane (10Wang C-C. Ng C.P. Lu L. Atlashkin V. Zhang W. Seet L.-F. Hong W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Both endobrevin (VAMP 8) and synaptobrevin 2 are present on the granule membrane (9Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Wang C-C. Ng C.P. Lu L. Atlashkin V. Zhang W. Seet L.-F. Hong W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The phenotype of an endobrevin knockout mouse indicates that this protein acts as the major R-SNARE for zymogen granule exocytosis (10Wang C-C. Ng C.P. Lu L. Atlashkin V. Zhang W. Seet L.-F. Hong W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, synaptobrevin 2 seems to play only a minor role in granule exocytosis (9Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The exocytotic process in the mouse exocrine pancreas has recently been studied in real time in isolated living acini using two-photon excitation imaging (4Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In these experiments, a membrane-impermeant fluorescent dye is added to the bathing medium, and the cells are imaged during stimulation with an appropriate secretagogue, such as acetylcholine or carbachol. Shortly after agonist application, Ω-shaped fluorescent spots begin to appear in the subapical region, which have an approximate diameter of 1 μm, consistent with the filling of zymogen granules with dye through the open fusion pore (4Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These dye-filled granules are visible at the apical membrane for several minutes, indicating that the fusion pore remains open for extended periods (5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Two types of fusion events can be distinguished: those in which the granule fuses directly with the plasma membrane (primary fusion event) and those in which a granule lying deeper within the cell fuses with a granule that has itself already opened to the exterior (secondary fusion event). Analysis reveals that there are approximately equal numbers of primary and secondary fusion events (4Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). During the exocytotic response of a pancreatic acinar cell, granules apparently fuse together only when the first granule has made contact with the plasma membrane (4Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), with a mean time delay between primary and secondary events of 10–20 s (4Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To account for this delay, it has been suggested that secondary fusion requires the recruitment of components of the fusion machinery from the plasma membrane (4Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This might, for example, involve the migration of syntaxin 2 into the membrane of the fused granule, although this would raise the issue of the role of syntaxins 3, 7, and 8, which are already present on the granule membrane (8Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine whether the Q-SNARE syntaxin 2, initially present on the apical plasma membrane, migrates into the membranes of the zymogen granules as they undergo exocytotic membrane fusion. The answer to this question will provide important information about the nature of the fusion pore formed between the granule and plasma membranes and also about the mechanism underlying compound exocytosis. Reagents—A rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against recombinant rat syntaxin 2 was provided by Dr. R. Jahn (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany). Alexa 488-phalloidin, lysine-fixable (LF) Texas Red-dextran (3,000 Da), fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were from Sigma. Preparation of Recombinant Syntaxins—Full-length syntaxin 2 and the cytoplasmic domains of syntaxins 7 and 8 were expressed in the vector pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length syntaxins 1, 3, and 4 were expressed in pGEX-2T. Syntaxins tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST) were purified from bacterial lysates by binding to glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia). Bead slurries were suspended in sample buffer and heated to 95 °C to release the GST-syntaxins for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Rat Pancreatic Zymogen Granules—Zymogen granules and plasma membranes were isolated from rat pancreas as described previously (12Nadin C.Y. Rogers J. Tomlinson S. Edwardson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2801-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All buffers contained 1 mm EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 17 μg/ml benzamidine, and 50 μg/ml bacitracin). Granules were lysed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in 170 mm NaCl and 200 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.8; 1:3) to produce granule membranes. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schüll) by semidry blotting. Blots were probed with primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce and Warriner). Preparation of Mouse Pancreatic Acini—Acini were prepared essentially as described previously (13Thorn P. Petersen O.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A 5–8-week-old mouse was killed by exposure to a rising concentration of CO2, followed by cervical dislocation. The pancreas was excised and immediately transferred to ice-cold extracellular medium (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7). Collagenase (1000 units, type 1A, in 5 ml of extracellular medium; Sigma) was injected into the pancreas and the tissue was incubated at 37 °C for 7 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pancreas was washed twice in extracellular medium, followed by trituration with a large-bore plastic pipette. Once the cell suspension flowed freely, trituration was carried out twice more with pipettes with progressively narrower bores. Cells were pelleted from the suspension by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of extracellular medium and the acini were gently washed twice in the same medium. Cells were kept at room temperature for 10 min before 100-μl samples were plated onto poly-d-lysine (0.1%) pre-treated coverslips. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—All steps were carried out at room temperature, except where otherwise indicated. Acini attached to coverslips were used either unstimulated or after stimulation with 2 μm acetylcholine, usually for 5 min. Where appropriate, the fluid phase marker LF Texas Red-dextran (Molecular Probes; 1 mg/ml) was added 5 min before acetylcholine stimulation. After incubation with acetylcholine, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) for 10 min each time and then fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in sucrose/phosphate buffer (210 mm sucrose and 30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8), for 30 min. For studies using LF Texas Red-dextran, the initial washes were omitted, and the cells were washed three times in 4% paraformaldehyde over 30 min. After fixation, the cells were washed twice for 5 min in PBS, twice for 5 min in high-salt PBS (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 500 mm NaCl), and then incubated for 15 min in permeabilizing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100). Cells were washed three times for 5 min in permeabilizing buffer containing 5% (w/v) goat serum (blocking buffer) and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C on Parafilm. The cells were washed twice with high-salt PBS for 5 min and once for 5 min in blocker, before incubation with secondary antibody for 90 min. Cells were washed twice for 5 min with high-salt PBS, once with PBS, and finally once with low-salt PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 5 mm NaCl). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), sealed with nail varnish, and stored in the dark at 4 °C. Specimens were imaged using a Zeiss 100 M Axioscope confocal laser scanning microscope, with a 63× objective lens of numeric aperture 1.3, capturing an optical slice of ∼1 μm. Images were collected with the appropriate filters: fluorescein isothiocyanate and Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin were excited using the 488-nm line of a krypton/argon laser and imaged with a 505–550 band-pass filter. Cy3 and LF Texas Red-dextran were excited with a 543 nm line of a Helium/Neon laser and collected with a long-pass 560 nm filter. All images were captured using the multitrack mode of the microscope to reduce crosstalk of fluorescent signals. Using this mode, cross-talk was estimated to be less than 2%. Analysis was performed using LSM 510 and ImageJ software. The statistical significance of differences between means was assessed using Student's t test for unpaired data. Because the pancreatic acinar cell is known to contain syntaxin isoforms 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 (8Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Wang C-C. Ng C.P. Lu L. Atlashkin V. Zhang W. Seet L.-F. Hong W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it was important to establish that the antibody we intended to use to detect syntaxin 2 was specific for that isoform. To this end, we prepared these isoforms (along with syntaxin 1, which is not expressed in the acinar cell) as GST fusion proteins, and tested the ability of the anti-syntaxin 2 antibody to discriminate between them. Syntaxins 1–4 were full-length proteins, whereas syntaxins 7 and 8 were cytoplasmic domains. The Coomassie blue-stained gels shown in Fig. 1A demonstrate the approximately equal loading of the various syntaxin isoforms. The major bands seen on the gels migrate at positions appropriate to the combined molecular masses of syntaxin (28–35 kDa) and GST (25 kDa). The anti-syntaxin 2 antibody was a rabbit polyclonal raised against the entire cytoplasmic domain and has been used previously (9Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the antibody gave a strong signal when blotted against GST-syntaxin 2 but did not detect syntaxins 1, 3, 4, 7, or 8. Fig. 1B shows a Coomassie blue-stained gel of plasma membrane and zymogen granule membrane fractions isolated from rat pancreas. As expected from previous results (9Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the anti-syntaxin 2 antibody detected a 35-kDa band in the plasma membrane fraction but not in the zymogen granule membrane fraction. We used confocal immunofluorescence microscopy with the anti-syntaxin 2 antibody to locate syntaxin 2 within mouse pancreatic acini. As shown in Fig. 2A, syntaxin 2 was exclusively localized to the apical membranes of the acinar cells (red staining). The figure also shows the location of filamentous actin (F-actin), as detected using Alexa 488-phalloidin (green staining). F-actin is known to be concentrated at the apical pole of the acinar cell, just beneath the apical membrane (14Valentijn J.A. Valentijn K. Pastore L.M. Jamieson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Turvey M.R. Thorn P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 448: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Nemoto T. Kojima T. Oshima A. Bito H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37544-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the set of magnified images shown in Fig. 2B syntaxin 2 is clearly concentrated inside the “tram-line” arrangement of F-actin, consistent with its location on the plasma membrane. Close inspection of the red image also reveals that the syntaxin 2 signal appears as two parallel lines (arrowheads), indicating that it is present on two closely apposed apical membranes. To follow exocytosis in the acini, we used LF Texas Red-dextran (3,000 Da), an extracellular dye. As explained above, the dye will enter a fusing granule through the fusion pore, enabling the detection of single exocytotic fusion events. As shown in Fig. 3A, unstimulated acini showed little staining for LF Texas Red-dextran, although some dye entered the spaces between the cells (compare the red signal with the typical tramline appearance of F-actin beneath the apical membrane). In contrast, after a 5-min stimulation of the acini with acetylcholine (2 μm), the LF Texas Red-dextran could be seen in clusters of granular structures close to the apical membranes (arrowheads, Fig. 3B). The diameter of these features (∼1 μm) is consistent with the filling of fused zymogen granules with the extracellular dye. Stimulation of the acini also caused a dramatic remodeling of the actin-based cytoskeleton, so that the fused granules became surrounded by F-actin (Fig. 3B, arrows). This actin remodeling has been described previously (14Valentijn J.A. Valentijn K. Pastore L.M. Jamieson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Turvey M.R. Thorn P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 448: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Nemoto T. Kojima T. Oshima A. Bito H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37544-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although it was initially reported that the coating of the zymogen granules with F-actin precedes exocytotic membrane fusion (14Valentijn J.A. Valentijn K. Pastore L.M. Jamieson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), more recent evidence indicates that membrane fusion occurs first (15Turvey M.R. Thorn P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 448: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Nemoto T. Kojima T. Oshima A. Bito H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37544-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the actin coat stabilizes the fused granule and prevents the abnormal progression of fusion that occurs during acute pancreatitis (16Nemoto T. Kojima T. Oshima A. Bito H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37544-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The relationship between the F-actin and the LF Texas Red-dextran signals is more obvious in the higher power images shown in Fig. 3C. Note that some of the fused granules are adjacent to the apical membrane (arrowhead), although others are much deeper within the cell (arrow) and seem to be linked to the membrane via other fused granules. These two types of feature are consistent with primary and secondary fusion events, respectively. We next examined the location of syntaxin 2 before and after stimulation of exocytosis. As shown in Fig. 4, syntaxin 2 lined the apical membrane of unstimulated acinar cells. (Note the “tram-line” appearance of the staining, indicated by the arrowhead). The LF Texas Red-dextran had moved into the narrow spaces between the cells and gave a very similar signal to that of syntaxin 2. After stimulation (Fig. 5), the pattern of staining was dramatically different. Granules stained with LF Texas Red-dextran were seen as before, with the majority of granules now also stained for syntaxin 2 (Fig. 5A, top, arrowhead). Quantitation of LF Texas Red-dextran and syntaxin 2 staining in 11 images showed that after a 5-min stimulation there were 9.6 ± 0.7 (n = 38 cells) LF Texas Red-dextran positive exocytotic events per acinar cell, of which 8.3 ± 0.6 (i.e. 85 ± 2%) also stained for syntaxin 2. In many instances, the syntaxin 2 staining patterns were clearly circular, and surrounded the central red staining of the LF Texas Red-dextran (Fig. 5A, bottom). In a control experiment (data not shown), we found that the migration of syntaxin 2 into the granule membranes did not require the presence of LF Texas Red-dextran. Further, a preimmune serum, taken from the same rabbit used to generate the anti-syntaxin 2 antibodies, gave no specific staining (data not shown).Fig. 5Localization of syntaxin 2 and LF Texas Red-dextran in stimulated acini. Acini were incubated with cellular medium containing LF Texas Red-dextran (1 mg/ml) for 5 min before stimulation with 2 μm ACh for either 5 min (A) or 1 min (B). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-syntaxin 2 antibody (1:30), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:30). A, co-localization of LF Texas Red-dextran and syntaxin 2 is observed in the apical regions of cells (arrowhead), although occasionally dye staining appears in the absence of syntaxin 2 staining (arrow). An enlarged view of the area defined by the box in the bottom of (A) is shown on the right. B, the presence of syntaxin 2 around dye-filled structures is again observed in the apical regions of cells (arrowhead), although LF Texas Red-dextran staining in the absence of syntaxin 2 staining is now seen more frequently (arrows). Scale bars, A, main, 10 μm; right, 2 μm; B, 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When acini were stimulated with acetylcholine for 5 min, 15% of the granules that were filled with LF Texas Red-dextran were not stained for syntaxin 2 (e.g., Fig. 5A, arrow), and these granules were always terminal events. Because a finite time will be required for syntaxin 2 to diffuse around the open fusion pore into the granule membrane, these features may represent cases where fixation has “frozen” a granule after fusion pore opening but before significant syntaxin 2 migration. After 5 min of stimulation, the peak of the exocytotic burst is virtually complete (17Campos-Toimil M. Edwardson J.M. Thomas P. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To study an earlier phase of the exocytotic response, we imaged cells that had been fixed after a 1-min stimulation, when exocytosis is occurring robustly (17Campos-Toimil M. Edwardson J.M. Thomas P. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Analysis of 10 images taken at this time showed that there were 5.1 ± 0.5 (n = 33 cells) LF Texas Red/dextran-positive exocytotic events per acinar cell, of which 3.7 ± 0.5 (i.e. 71 ± 3%) also stained for syntaxin 2. Hence, the number of granules that had fused with the plasma membrane was significantly smaller after 1 min of stimulation than at 5 min (p < 0.001); of these fused granules, a significantly smaller proportion had taken up syntaxin 2 (p < 0.001). Fig. 5B shows an image taken after a 1-min stimulation. It can be seen that, compared with Fig. 5A, the number of granules filled with LF Texas Red-dextran is small; the fused granules line the apical membrane, and there are no detectable secondary fusion events. Further, although some of the fused granules stain positively for syntaxin 2 (arrowhead), others do not (arrows). This result supports the suggestion made above that the movement of syntaxin 2 into the membrane of fused granules lags behind the opening of the fusion pore; this entry of syntaxin 2 into that granule membrane may permit the secondary fusion seen so clearly at later times during the response (Fig. 5A). In a final experiment, we compared the staining pattern of syntaxin 2 in stimulated acini with that of F-actin, visualized using Alexa 488-phalloidin. As shown in Fig. 6A, circular features were visible near the apical plasma membrane in both the red channel (syntaxin 2) and the green channel (F-actin). At higher magnification, it is clear that the red labeling is inside the green labeling (Fig. 6B, arrowheads). This relationship between the two staining patterns is consistent with the presence of syntaxin 2 on the cytoplasmic surface of the granules, and the coating of the surfaces of fused granules with F-actin. Herein, we present evidence that in mouse pancreatic acinar cells the plasma membrane Q-SNARE syntaxin 2 moves into the granule membrane on cell stimulation. At rest, syntaxin 2 is present in the apical domain of the acinar cells in a band peripheral to F-actin, consistent with its localization on the apical plasma membrane. After cell stimulation, syntaxin 2 is observed in regions around zymogen granules that have undergone exocytosis, as marked with the aqueous dye LF Texas Red-dextran. We suggest that this movement of syntaxin 2 may play a role in the control of secondary exocytotic events during compound exocytosis. Previous work in pancreatic acinar cells provides abundant evidence for the existence of compound exocytosis (2Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar, 3Ichikawa A. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 24: 369-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 4Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K.

A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent imaging experiments show that this process occurs in a sequential manner, such that secondary granules fuse with a primary granule with a consistent delay of 10–20 s (4Nemoto T. Kimura R. Ito K. Tachikawa A. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) that this delay is indicative of movement of SNAREs from the plasma membrane to the vesicle membrane, effectively providing the secondary vesicles with a cognate Q-SNARE. Evidence has been provided that in pancreatic β cells, a cell that also undergoes compound exocytosis, SNAP-25 may move into the primary granule membrane after exocytosis (18Takahashi N. Hatakeyama H. Okado H. Miwa A. Kishimoto T. Kojima T. Abe T. Kasai H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We now show that in pancreatic acinar cells, syntaxin 2 may move and may therefore fulfil a role as a target SNARE for compound exocytosis. Our present results contrast with two previous lines of evidence suggesting that in secretory epithelial cells, the fusion pore may operate as a barrier to diffusion of proteins and lipids. First, an early freeze-fracture electron microscopic study of rat parotid acinar cells showed that the low density of intramembrane particles, presumed to be proteins, in the granule membrane does not change on exocytosis (19De Camilli P. Peluchetti D. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 70: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that granule membrane integrity is maintained and that there is no mixing with the plasma membrane. It should be mentioned, however, that in the guinea pig pancreas the density of intramembrane particles in the granule membrane and the plasma membrane are very similar, making it impossible to determine whether or not the membranes in this cell type mix upon fusion (20Tanaka Y. De Camilli P. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 84: 438-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More recently, Thorn et al. (5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have shown that over the lifetime of a fused granule its lipid identity is apparently maintained and that lipophilic dye present in the apical plasma membrane does not enter the granule membrane. These findings have led to the suggestion that granule membranes might be recycled back through the Golgi complex to be reused in further rounds of exocytosis. There is no easy way to reconcile the previous findings with those presented here, especially because Thorn et al. (5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) used the same mouse pancreatic acinar cell preparation. It could be that lipid movement is effectively suppressed in the pancreatic acinar cells, but that protein movement can still take place. It is known that granule lipid content is distinct from that of the apical plasma membrane (21Schmidt K. Schrader M. Kern H-F. Kleene R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14315-14323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); hence, the fusion pore may act as a barrier to lipid movement. Another possibility is that syntaxin 2 may be actively translocated into the granule membrane. Such a mechanism has been proposed in mast cells, another cell type that manifests compound exocytosis, where movement of the Q-SNARE SNAP-23 (22Guo Z. Turner C. Castle D. Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) into the secretory granule apparently precedes exocytosis. SNAP-23 is therefore not simply diffusing from the plasma membrane into the granule membrane but rather is actively transported. The nature of the fusion pore in pancreatic acinar cells is unknown. Because granule contents consist of digestive enzymes (i.e. proteins), the fusion pore must have a diameter of several nanometers, and there is evidence from AFM imaging of live acinar cells that the pores are in fact as large as 100–180 nm (23Schneider S.W. Sritharan K.C. Geibel J.P. Oberleithner H. Jena B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast, the fusion pores in neurons and neuroen-docrine cells have diameters of less than 1 nm (24Klyachko V.A. Jackson M.B. Nature. 2002; 418: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the fusion pore in PC-12 cells is lined by the transmembrane segments of five to eight syntaxin molecules (25Han X. Wang C-T. Bai J. Chapman E.R. Jackson M.B. Science. 2004; 304: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, it seems unlikely that the much larger fusion pores in the acinar cell are similarly lined by a ring of proteins, which would act as a physical barrier to mixing between the granule and plasma membranes and also prevent the collapse of the granule membrane into the target membrane after fusion. If movement of lipids and/or proteins between the two membranes is in some way controlled, this might instead depend on features of the membranes themselves that render them immiscible or on the operation of a scaffold on the cytoplasmic surface of the granule (possibly involving F-actin) that acts as a molecular “picket fence” (26Fujiwara T. Ritchie K. Murakoshi H. Jacobson K. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most intriguing possibility is that the differences between our results and those of Thorn et al. (5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) arise from the use different types of stimulation. In this study, we intentionally used maximal agonist concentrations, bath-applied for long periods, to elicit a large response. In contrast, Thorn et al. (5Thorn P. Fogarty K.E. Parker I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6774-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) examined single-granule exocytosis, which was either spontaneous or induced by the focal uncaging of caged carbachol, a stimulus that is small and transient. Under these conditions, compound exocytosis was observed only rarely. It is therefore possible that single vesicle exocytotic events preserve granule integrity, whereas loss of granule integrity and movement of SNAREs is a requirement to trigger compound exocytosis. To test this possibility, we would need to extend the present findings and follow the movement of SNAREs in living cells, where we can track the progress of single granules and determine whether or not compound exocytosis occurs. To do this, however, we would have to generate a syntaxin 2 construct labeled (e.g. with green fluorescent protein) so as to minimize effects on the properties of the protein and to express this construct efficiently in acinar cells, which are notoriously difficult to transduce, even using adenoviral expression systems (27Padfield P.J. Elliott A.C. Baldassare J.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The “ideal” experiment, therefore, presents enormous technical obstacles. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the movement of syntaxin 2 into the membrane of the fusing zymogen granule during exocytosis. Although we have not shown that this movement is necessary for the triggering of secondary granule fusion, the apparent lag between the opening of the fusion pore (allowing the entry of LF Texas Red-dextran) and the redistribution of syntaxin 2 is certainly consistent with this notion. We thank Reinhard Jahn (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany) for providing the anti-syntaxin 2 antibody and Paul Luzio and Sally Gray (Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, UK) for providing the syntaxin 7 and 8 constructs."
https://openalex.org/W1993589090,"Trastuzumab, a humanized antibody to HER-2, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of breast cancer in which HER-2 overexpression and metastasis occurs. In our search for an effective mimic epitope of HER-2 binding with trastuzumab and to develop HER-2 peptide vaccine, we screened a phage display 12-mer peptide library with trastuzumab as the target. A mimetic peptide (mimotope) H98 (LLGPYELWELSH) that could specifically recognize trastuzumab was isolated. The DNA encoding peptide H98 was cloned and expressed as the fusion protein GST-H98 in Escherichia coli BL21. The purified GST-H98 could specifically bind to trastuzumab and block the binding of trastuzumab to HER-2 protein. Moreover, H98 could significantly block the function of trastuzumab inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. Mice that were immunized with GST-H98 made specific antibody to H98 as well as to HER-2. In addition, T-cell proliferation occurred in mice immunized with GST-H98. Although no sequence homology was found between H98 and HER-2, through the use of structure analysis we were able to determine that peptide H98 contributed to a conformational epitope of HER-2. Furthermore, we determined that the last two amino acids at the C terminus, and the third together with the fourth amino acid at the N terminus of peptide H98 are critical to the binding of H98 to trastuzumab. As a result, we conclude that peptide H98 has potential for being developed as a HER-2 vaccine for biotherapy of cancer with HER-2 overexpression.

As a result, we conclude that peptide H98 has potential for being developed as a HER-2 vaccine for biotherapy of cancer with HER-2 overexpression. HER-2 (also known as Neu or ErbB-2) is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (also known as HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinase (1Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). HER receptors are essential mediators of cell proliferation and differentiation in the developing embryo and in adult tissues (2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the HER-2 oncogene is a frequent molecular event in multiple human cancers, including breast, ovarian, gastric, and colorectal carcinomas (3Wang S.C. Zhang L. Hortobagyi G.N. Hung M.C. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 21-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In patients with breast cancer, HER-2 overexpression is an independent predictor of survival. It is associated with poor prognosis, aggressive disease, resistance to chemotherapy and hormone therapy (4Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M.F. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar, 5Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L.

Treat. 1994; 29: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The critical role of HER-2 in epithelial oncogenesis as well as its selective overexpression on malignant tissues makes it an ideal target for immunotherapy (7Disis M.L. Cheever M.A. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 343-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies directed to HER-2 induce phenotypic changes in tumor cells including down-modulation of the HER2 receptor, inhibition of tumor cells growth, reversion of cytokine resistance, restoration of E-cadherin expression levels, and reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor production (8Sliwkowski M.X. Lofgren J.A. Lewis G.D. Hotaling T.E. Fendly B.M. Fox J.A. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 60-70PubMed Google Scholar). The humanized anti-HER-2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) has been proven to be effective in clinical trials in patients with HER-2-associated metastatic breast cancer (9Nahta R. Hortobagyi G.N. Esteva F.J. Oncologist. 2003; 8: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and has antitumor activities as both a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy (10Nabholtz J.M. Reese D.M. Lindsay M.A. Riva A. Clin. Breast Cancer. 2002; 3: S75-S79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying these growth inhibitory effects are not entirely clear. There is some evidence that antibodies to HER-2 may antagonize the constitutive growth signaling properties of the HER-2 system, enlist immune cells to attack the tumor target, and augment chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity (8Sliwkowski M.X. Lofgren J.A. Lewis G.D. Hotaling T.E. Fendly B.M. Fox J.A. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 60-70PubMed Google Scholar). The clinical application of trastuzumab has shown efficacy. However, several important drawbacks (generation of anti-idiotypic antibodies, inadequate tissue distribution, levels necessitating multiple infusions and hence the associated cost) limit the usefulness of passive immunotherapy protocols (11Dakappagari N.K. Pyles J. Parihar R. Carson W.E. Young D.C. Kaumaya P.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4242-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the other hand, vaccination strategy is an alternative option that can elicit endogenous tumor inhibitory antibodies, stimulate immunologic memory, and accordingly provide long-term benefits to patients at lower costs. The use of a peptide or part of a protein rather than a whole protein as vaccines may circumvent tolerance against self-protein HER-2 and induce cross-reactive immunity. Although many anti-HER-2 antibodies inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells, some actively stimulate cancer growth. It is well known that different biological effects are associated with the epitope specificity of the antibodies. Isolation of epitopes recognized by trastuzumab, an anti-tumor therapeutic monoclonal antibody directed against HER-2, can be useful in the development of peptide-based vaccines that are capable of stimulating an immune response directed to tumors. The screening of phage display libraries is a powerful technique that has been used in epitope or ligand mapping studies to define peptides that bind to a given antibody or receptor molecule (12Romanov V.I. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Liu R. Enstrom A.M. Lam K.S. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 11-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Yip Y.L. Ward R.L. Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2002; 3: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Aina O.H. Sroka T.C. Chen M.L. Lam K.S. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 184-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a phage display 12-mer peptide library to identify peptides that bind to trastuzumab, and tested their immune and biological activity. The screening of a 12-mer peptide library displayed on M13 filamentous phages led to the isolation of peptide H98 (LLGPYELWELSH). Further investigation showed that peptide H98, mimicking the binding epitope on HER-2 for trastuzumab, specifically blocked the binding of trastuzumab to HER-2 and elicited an anti-HER-2 antibody response as well as a cellular immune response in mice. Although no sequence homology was found between the mimotope and HER-2, given the known crystal structure of the binding domain of HER-2 and trastuzumab, we found that peptide H98 contributed to a conformational epitope of HER-2. Moreover, the last two amino acids at the C terminus, and the third together with the fourth amino acid at the N terminus of H98, were critical for the binding of H98 to trastuzumab. In addition, MutN1, a mutant of H98, enhanced the binding of trastuzumab to pro-peptide. The approach of using phage display peptide libraries to reveal conformational epitopes may play an important role in research of the immune activity of the HER-2 mimotopes. And the isolated peptide could become a candidate as a vaccine for the treatment of HER-2-associated cancers. Phage Library, Bacteria, Antibodies, Expression Vector, and Cells— The Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library Kit E8110S was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The library contained 1.5 × 1013 pfu 1The abbreviations used are: pfu, plaque-forming units; LB, Luria broth; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MTT, thiazolyl blue (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide); DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase./ml with a complexity of 2.7 × 109 transformants. The displayed peptides were expressed at the N terminus of the pIII coat protein of the filamentous coliphage M13. The library was stored in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, with 50% glycerol. Phage was propagated in Escherichia coli strain ER2738, which was provided with the kit. Antibody trastuzumab was provided by Breast Cancer Center at Beijing Cancer Hospital. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13 antibody and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion system were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene fusion system was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NIH3T3-ErbB2 cell line (provided by Dr. S. L. Sun, Peking University School of Oncology) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Bio-panning and Selection of Phage—Human normal IgG and trastuzumab were separately immobilized on protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Phages (1.5 × 1011 pfu) were preabsorbed on beads containing immobilized human normal IgG to remove any phages that were not specifically reactive with trastuzumab. The phages, diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with immobilized trastuzumab. The beads were washed 5 times with 0.1% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline. Then the phages that bound with trastuzumab and beads complex were amplified by direct infection with E. coli ER2738. The amplified phages were purified by precipitation with 20% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG8000), 2.5 m NaCl and used in the next cycle. Three rounds of selection were performed. After that, individual plaques were picked up randomly and subjected to analysis by phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and DNA sequencing, following amplification in E. coli ER2738. Phage ELISA—In total, 300 phage clones were tested for reactivity with trastuzumab by ELISA. A single clone was grown for 4.5 h in 1 ml of Luria broth (LB) and shaken at 37 °C. Bacterial cells were spun down, and the supernatant containing phage was added to the wells of a microtiter plate that was coated with 5 μg/ml trastuzumab or control human normal IgG in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.5, and then blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and washed 5 times with 0.05% Tween/Tris-buffered saline. Bound phages were detected by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, followed by washing and the addition of a peroxidase substrate (o-phenylenediamine, 0.4 mg/ml) in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.02% (v/v) H2O2. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 12.5% H2SO4. A492 was determined by using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad model 550). DNA Sequencing and Peptide Synthesis—Single-stranded phage DNA was prepared from 26 immunopositive clones by standard techniques as described in the phage display peptide library kit and sequenced by Shenyou Biology Inc. (Shanghai, China). Peptides representing the sequence of the positive clone H98 (LLGPYELWELSH) and an irrelevant control random peptide F56 (WHDPTPWWSWET) were synthesized by Bio-Scientific Inc. (Xian, China). Expression of Recombinant GST Peptide and DHFR Peptide Fusion Proteins in E. coli—To detect the activity of peptide H98 simply and conveniently, GST-H98 and DHFR-H98 fusion proteins were prepared, respectively. To make the GST-H98 fusion protein, the sense (5′-GATCCTTGTTGGGTCCGTATGAGTTGTGGGAGCTTTCTCATTGAAAGCTTG) and the antisense (5′-TCGACAAGCTTTCAATGAGAAAGCTCCCACAACTCATACGGACCCAACAAG) oligonucleotide fragments encoding the positive clone H98, with stop codon, HindIII site, and sticky ends of BamHI/SalI shown by the underlined nucleotides, were synthesized by Sangon Company (Shanghai, China) and inserted at the BamHI and SalI site of the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The ligated DNAs were used to transform E. coli BL21 cells. DNA of recombinants was identified by digestion with HindIII and EcoRV and then confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. All of these procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 5.3-6.59Google Scholar). Purification of DNA from agarose gels was performed with a QIAquick DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For the preparation of GST-H98 fusion proteins, transformed bacteria were cultured in LB medium with ampicillin selection to an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm. Next, 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added and the cultures were further incubated for 5 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Cell suspensions were sonicated for 1 min at a 20% pulse. After the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the GST-H98 fusion protein was purified with glutathione beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). To obtain DHFR-H98 fusion protein, the sense and antisense oligonucleotide fragments as described above were inserted at the BglII (the same sticky end as BamHI) and SalI sites of the pQE-40 vector (Qiagen). The ligated DNAs were used to transform E. coli SG13009 cells. The DHFR-H98 fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). ELISA—The reactivity of trastuzumab with GST and GST-H98 fusion protein was tested by ELISA. 96-Well microtiter plates were coated with 5 μg/ml GST or GST-H98 fusion protein in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.5, then blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS. The plates were added to dilutions of trastuzumab and held for 2 h at room temperature. Bound trastuzumab was detected using HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Zhong Shan Co., Beijing, China) with 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine as a peroxidase substrate, as described under “Phage ELISA.” Western Blot—The reactivity of trastuzumab with GST fusion protein was also tested by Western blot analysis. Two μg of GST, GST-H98, GST-HER-2, and DHFR-H98 fusion proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The proteins were probed with the anti-GST antibody to detect the expression of the GST fusion protein. They were also probed with either trastuzumab or human IgG antibody. After being washed, the filters were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and then developed with an electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Competitive Inhibition Assay—To test the inhibition of trastuzumab binding to HER-2, we coated 96-well microtiter plates with 5 μg/ml NIH3T3-ErbB2 cell lysate (which was prepared by lysing the cells in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) or GST-H98 fusion protein in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.5. Next, 0.5 μg/ml trastuzumab was mixed with dilutions of H98, F56, GST, GST-H98, and NIH3T3-ErbB2 cell lysate, and preincubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then transferred to the plates. Bound trastuzumab was detected by standard ELISA as described above. The peptides or proteins were tested at 0, 0.5, 5, 10, and 50 μg/ml. Each dilution was tested in duplicate. The inhibition was calculated by using the following formula: (ATrastuzumab - ATrastuzumab with protein)/ATrastuzumab × 100%. The experiment was repeated three times. Cell Proliferation Assay with MTT—The human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 overexpressing HER-2 were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either 1 μg/ml trastuzumab or human normal IgG with or without dilutions of peptides was added to the wells in a final volume of 150 μl. All treatments were performed in triplicate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Numbers of live cells were measured using a thiazolyl blue (MTT, Sigma) cell proliferation assay by reading A492. The proliferation inhibition rate was calculated by the formula as follow: (AHuman normal IgG - ATrastuzumab+H98/F56)/AHuman normal IgG × 100%. Immunization—Six- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice (purchased from the Animal Center of the Chinese Medical Academy) were immunized subcutaneously with 40 μg of GST-H98 or GST alone that was emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant the first time. Mice were boosted four times with the antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant every 3 weeks. Sera were taken on day 0 (preimmune) and 7 days after the third and fifth immunization. Antibody level in the sera of immunized mice was determined by ELISA. To test the antipeptide response, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 5 μg/ml DHFR-H98 fusion protein in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.5, and then blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS. A 1:1000 dilution of mice sera was added to the plates, which were then held for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected by using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody with 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine as the peroxidase substrate. To test the anti-HER-2 response, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 1 × 104 cells/well of NIH3T3-ErbB2 and then blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS. A 1:100 dilution of mice sera was added to the plates and anti-HER-2 response was assessed by standard techniques as described above. T Cell Proliferation Assay—Spleen cells from 2 randomly selected BALB/c mice, which were immunized 4 times with GST-H98 or GST-other peptide, were isolated according to the standard techniques on day 7 post-immunization (17Baral R.N. Saha A. Chatterjee S.K. Foon K.A. Krieg A.M. Weiner G.J. Bhattacharya-Chatterjee M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2003; 52: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 96-Well microtiter plates were coated with peptide H98 at different concentrations (0, 1, 10, and 100 μg/ml) and then washed twice with PBS. The splenocytes (2 × 105/well) were cultured in the coated 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. The number of live cells were measured by using the thiazolyl blue (MTT, Sigma) cell proliferation assay by reading A492. The proliferation percentage was calculated by the formula as follows: (AH98- Auntreated)/Auntreated × 100%. Each assay was performed at least in triplicate. The experiment was repeated twice. Structural Determinants of the Binding Sequence and Optimization of the Amino Acid Sequence—To analyze the minimal requisites for binding activity, a variety of truncation and mutation peptides were made fused with GST (Table I). The corresponding GST-truncate, GST-mutant, and GST-cyclic H98 peptide fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described above. The reactivity of trastuzumab with these GST fusion peptides was tested by ELISA and Western blot.Table ITruncations and mutants of peptide H98 Peptide H98 truncated at the N (N10 to N6), C (C10 to C6), or both N and C (M8 and M6) terminus, respectively.

For each biopanning, phages were titrated for pfu in the inputs and outputs to determine the degree of selection. The total number of phages bound to trastuzumab was increased from 8.2 × 104 pfu in the first round to 3.7 × 106 pfu in the third round. Specificity of Peptides Binding to Trastuzumab and Their Sequences—After 3 rounds of selection, roughly 13.7% (41/300) of the phage clones analyzed exhibited trastuzumab binding activity (data not shown). We sequenced 26 positive phage clones and 25 clones encoded the identical amino acid sequence (LLGPYELWELSH) named H98. Only one different sequence, H23 (HPRPYHHTLPLT), was seen. These two sequences are considerably different and have no obvious similarities in motif. The binding of trastuzumab to the fusion protein GST-H98 was also demonstrated by ELISA and Western blotting. For this experiment, oligonucleotide encoding the peptide H98 was expressed as a C-terminal extension of the GST protein. The results of the ELISA showed that trastuzumab could specifically bind to GST-H98 but not to GST (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, trastuzumab reacted with the GST fusion protein containing the H98, whereas no reaction was obtained with GST. The results of Western blotting also suggested that trastuzumab could specifically bind to H98 (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Western blot analysis of binding of trastuzumab to peptide. Different GST fusion proteins were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts (2 μg) of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The proteins were probed with anti-GST antibody (right panel) to detect the expression of GST fusion peptides and then probed with either trastuzumab (left panel) or human serum IgG (middle panel).

However, to demonstrate that H98 resembled the epitope of HER-2, we had to show that H98 blocked binding between trastuzumab and HER-2. To perform these experiments, we used an ELISA in which antibody and inhibitors (GST-H98 or peptide H98) were preincubated and plated onto the microtiter plates coated with HER-2. This analysis revealed that GST-H98 and peptide H98 inhibited the binding of trastuzumab to HER-2 in a dose-dependent manner, but GST protein and irrelevant peptide F56 did not produce noteworthy inhibition on their interaction (Fig. 3A). HER-2 Inhibiting Trastuzumab Binding to GST-H98 —To demonstrate that the trastuzumab that bound to GST-H98 or peptide H98 was specific for HER-2, we used HER-2 to inhibit trastuzumab binding to GST-H98. Trastuzumab was premixed with different dilutions of HER-2. The results show that HER-2 significantly inhibited trastuzumab binding to GST-H98 (Fig. 3B). In Fig. 3B, GST alone also demonstrated a concentration-dependent inhibition on trastuzumab binding to GST-H98, but the GST-H98 fusion protein doubled or tripled the inhibition effect, as compared with GST. The results demonstrated that peptide H98 played a critical role in inhibiting trastuzumab binding to GST-H98. Peptide H98 Blocked the Function of Trastuzumab on Inhibiting Cell Growth—Trastuzumab is well known to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells through interaction with HER-2. Because peptide H98 has the ability to block interaction between trastuzumab and HER-2, we therefore decided to test whether peptide H98 affects the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit cell growth. As shown in Fig. 4, the response of breast cancer cell SKBR3 to trastuzumab was significantly blocked by peptide H98 in a dose-dependent manner and the 50% block rate was reached when peptide H98 was present at a concentration of 60 μg/ml, whereas an equivalent concentration of the control peptide had no significant effect on cell growth inhibition. Mice Immunized with GST-H98 Made Anti-HER-2 Antibodies—Peptide H98 was expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-H98), and the immunogenicities were evaluated in mice. Four of 5 mice immunized with GST-H98 generated peptide-specific antibody (Fig. 5A) as well as antibody to HER-2 (Fig. 5B) after the fifth immunization. The anti-HER-2 response was lower than the anti-peptide response, and the anti-peptide H98 response could be detected earlier than the anti-HER-2 response. No antipeptide or anti-HER-2 response was observed in mice immunized with GST. One of 5 mice generated antibody to HER-2 that could be detected in an immunoprecipitation Western blot assay (data not shown). Development of Cellular Immune Response—Cellular immunity induced in mice that were immunized with GST-H98 or GST-other peptide was evaluated with T-cell proliferation assay. The spleens of two mice were isolated for use in this assay. T-cell proliferation was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using H98 as a stimulant. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that T-cell proliferation took place in mice immunized with GST-H98 but not in mice immunized with GST-other peptide. Structural Determinants of H98 Binding to Trastuzumab— Decrease in peptide length may simplify the modifications of the peptide sequence, as well as provide an indication of the characteristics of the binding cleft. The ELISA and Western blot results showed that among 15 kinds of GST-H98 including GST-truncate and GST-mutant peptide fusion protein, only GST-H98, GST-C10, GST-MutN1–2, GST-MutN1, and GST-cyclic H98 were able to specifically bind to trastuzumab (Figs. 7 and 8).Fig. 8Western blot analysis of trastuzumab binding to different GST peptide fusion proteins. The GST fusion proteins were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts (2 μg) of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Anti-GST antibody (upper panel)or trastuzumab (lower panel) was used separately as the first antibodies, and an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was applied to detect the protein reactions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, GST; lane 2, GST-H98; lane 3, GST-N10; lane 4, GST-N8; lane 5, GST-N6; lane 6, GST-C10; lane 7, GST-C8; lane 8, GST-C6; lane 9, GST-M8; lane 10, GST-M6; lane 11, GST-MutN3–4; lane 12, GST-MutC1–2; lane 13, GST-MutN1–2; lane 14, GST-MutN1; lane 15, GST-cyclic H98.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, GST-MutN3–4 (mutant of N-terminal GP to VA) and GST-C8 could not bind to trastuzumab, but GST-C10 could bind to trastuzumab. These differences in binding abilities imply that the third and fourth amino acids, glycine (Gly) and Proline (Pro), at the N terminus were essential for the activity of peptide H98. Moreover, neither GST-MutC1–2 (mutant of C-terminal SH to GA) nor GST-N10 could bind to trastuzumab, which suggested that serine (Ser) and histidine (His) at the C terminus were also essential to retain complete peptide binding activity. Alternatively, the ability of GST-MutN1–2 to bind to trastuzumab was significantly impaired but not completely abolished, which implied that the first two leucines (LL) at the N terminus were not very important for the binding activity of H98 but were likely to have an effect on the marginal structure formation of the peptide. Further deletion of 4 or 6 residues at the N or C terminus completely abolished the ability of peptide H98 to bind to trastuzumab. Thus it appears that the peptide must be more than 8 amino acids in length to fulfill the requirements of binding. Accordi"

To test the possible role of 3′-UTR-binding proteins in translational suppression of β2-AR mRNA, we expressed the full-length 3′-UTR or the adenylate/uridylate-rich (A+U-rich element (ARE)) RNA from the 3′-UTR sequences of β2-AR in cell lines that endogenously express this receptor. Reversal of β2-adrenergic receptor translational repression by retroviral expression of 3′-UTR sequences suggested that ARE RNA-binding proteins are involved in translational suppression of β2-adrenergic receptor expression. Using a 20-nucleotide ARE RNA from the receptor 3′-UTR as an affinity ligand, we purified the proteins that bind to these sequences. T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-related protein (TIAR) was one of the strongly bound proteins identified by this method. UV-catalyzed cross-linking experiments using in vitro transcribed 3′-UTR RNA and glutathione S-transferase-TIAR demonstrated multiple binding sites for this protein on β2-AR 3′-UTR sequences. The distal 340-nucleotide region of the 3′-UTR was identified as a target RNA motif for TIAR binding by both RNA gel shift analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments. Overexpression of TIAR resulted in suppression of receptor protein synthesis and a significant shift in endogenously expressed β2-AR mRNA toward low molecular weight fractions in sucrose gradient polysome fractionation. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for translational control of β2-AR mRNA by TIAR.

In the current work, we demonstrate that β2-AR expression is translationally repressed in two different cell lines, both of which endogenously express this receptor. Ectopic expression of β2-AR 3′-untranslated region sequences or the A+U-rich region present within the receptor 3′-UTR sequence was capable of altering receptor expression at the post-transcriptional level, suggesting that translational repression is caused by binding of a soluble factor or factors to sequences within the 3′-UTR. RNA affinity purification and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated high affinity binding of TIAR and TIA-1 to receptor 3′-UTR RNA. In support of the ability of TIAR to regulate β2-AR expression, ectopic expression of TIAR resulted in suppression of receptor expression and sequestration of receptor mRNA into nonpolysomal fractions in sucrose density gradient fractionation. Taken together, our results suggested that TIAR, by binding to 3′-UTR sequences, regulates translation of β2-AR mRNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—DDT1-MF2 vas deferens smooth muscle cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) as described before (11Tholanikunnel B.G.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15564-15572Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were cloned into the HindIII and ClaI sites of the retroviral pLNCX2 vector (BD Bioscience Clontech). A vector having the same number of nucleotides with randomly introduced mutations (5′-CGTTGGTATCTGATTCCTTCA-3′) served as a control. Plasmids containing the A+U-rich elements and the 21-nt scrambled sequences were constructed by using complementary synthetic oligonucleotides flanked by restriction sequences for HindIII at the 5′-end and ClaI at the 3′-end. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the pLNCX2 vector. Plasmid DNA concentrations were determined by UV spectrophotometry and confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis of linearized plasmid DNA. DDT1-MF2 cells and A431 cells were transfected with pLNCX2 containing the full-length 3′-UTR, the A+U-rich sequences, or the control vector, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectant clones were selected using 650 μg/ml G418 for DDT1-MF2 cells and 400 μg/ml G418 for A431 cells. The levels of expression of β2-AR were determined in DDT1-MF2 and A431 cells by radioligand binding assay (42Dixon R.A. Sigal I.S. Rands E. Register R.B. Candelore M.R. Blake A.D. Strader C.D.

(44Pinol-Roma S. Adam S.A Dreyfuss G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 411-418Google Scholar) with modifications as stated below. Selected clones were plated and serum-starved for 12 h and then incubated with normal medium containing 175 μCi/ml [5,6-3H]uridine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 6 h at 37 °C. The culture medium was removed, and cell monolayers were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline multiple times to remove unincorporated radiolabeled uridine. Cells were then exposed to short wave UV light (254 nm) for 20 min with minimal phosphate-buffered saline to cover the cells. Cytosolic extracts were made from both control and ARE RNA-expressing cells, digested with RNase, concentrated, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, treated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and visualized by fluorography.Construction of Plasmid Vectors for in Vitro Transcription and RNA Synthesis—The 21-nt ARE region of β2-AR mRNA 3′-UTR sequence (11Tholanikunnel B.G. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11471-11478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), 5′-CTTTTTTATTTTATTTTTTTA-3, was cloned into pSP70 (Promega) at XhoI and ClaI as described for the retroviral construct. This vector linearized by ClaI was used for in vitro transcription using SP6 DNA-directed RNA polymerase to produce RNA corresponding to the 21-nt ARE region. In vitro transcription reactions were performed using the Ribomax large scale RNA production systems from Promega. After RNA was transcribed, RNase-free DNase was added to the mixture to remove template DNA. RNA was extracted with phenol and then with chloroform and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, washed twice in 70% ethanol, and then reconstituted in RNase-free water. About 800 μg of ARE RNA were made by in vitro transcription.Biotinylation of RNA—ARE RNA made as described above was biotinylated using PHOTOPROBE (long arm) biotin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, ARE RNA and photoprobe biotin were mixed and exposed to light (365 nm), which covalently couples biotin to RNA. Unincorporated biotin was removed by extracting the mixture twice with 2-butanol, and the biotinylated RNA was precipitated with ammonium acetate, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 1.0 ml of RNase-free TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA).Purification of β2-AR ARE RNA-binding Proteins—Cytosolic extracts (about 125 mg of protein) were subjected to preclearance by incubating on a rotator with 3 ml of VECTREX Avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C in a binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (7.6), 3mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA (8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3 mg/ml heparin, 0.5 mg/ml yeast RNA, 40 mm KCl). After 3 h, avidin beads were pelleted, and the cytosolic extracts were removed, and RNase inhibitor (Promega) was added to a final concentration of 0.35 units/μl. Biotinylated ARE RNA was added to the precleared extracts and incubated as described above for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The binding mixtures containing biotinylated RNA and cytosolic extracts were then incubated with 3 ml of avidin for an additional 2 h in a rotator at 4 °C. The mixtures were added to 10.0-ml columns, and the flow-through was collected. The columns were washed three times, each with 5 ml of binding buffer containing 40 mm KCl, followed by two washes, each with 5 ml of same buffer containing 300 mm KCl. Proteins that were still bound and resistant to washing with 300 mm KCl were eluted with the same buffer containing 2 m KCl. All of the fractions were dialyzed, concentrated, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE analyses and UV-cross-linked label transfer assays.RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Supershifts—RNA gel shift assays were performed as described previously (13Tholanikunnel B.G. Raymond J.R. Malbon C.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15564-15572Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were incubated with radiolabeled ARE RNA probes (1–4 × 105 cpm) in 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 15 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm spermine, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 5 mg/ml heparin, and 20 units of RNasin in a total volume of 20 μl for 10 min at 25 °C (13Tholanikunnel B.G. Raymond J.R. Malbon C.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15564-15572Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min, and complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% native polyacrylamide gels in 45 mm TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) as the running buffer. For supershift experiments, binding mixtures were incubated with 1.0 μg each of the affinity-purified antibodies for hnRNP-A1, TIAR, TIA-1, HuR, AUF1, or TTP. The primary antibodies for TIAR, TIA-1 (goat polyclonal), TTP (rabbit polyclonal), and HuR (mouse monoclonal) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-AUF-1 (rabbit polyclonal) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Nonimmune serum was used as a control. All of the samples were incubated for an additional 15 min, and loading buffer containing 10% sucrose, 0.1% bromphenol blue in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added. Samples were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels that were prerun for 1 h before loading the samples. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.Western Blot of Purified Proteins—Proteins identified by gel shift and supershift assays were further confirmed by Western blot analysis using standard methods. TIAR, TIA-1, HuR, AUF1, and TTP antibodies were used in Western blot analysis. All of the antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin. After incubation with alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were visualized by a chemiluminescent method (CDP star; New England Biolabs).RT-PCR Isolation of TIAR and TIA-1—The cDNAs for both TIAR and TIA-1 were obtained by RT-PCR amplification using primers as described previously (31Yu Q. Cok S.J. Zeng C. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1579-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For TIAR, the forward primer was 5′-ATGATGGAAGACGACGGGCA-3′, and reverse primer was 5′-TCACTGTGTTTGGTAACTTG-3′. The cDNAs for both short and long isoforms of TIAR were obtained using these primers. Similarly, TIA-1 was PCR-amplified by using the forward primer 5′-ATGGAGGACGAGATGCCCAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCACTGGGTTTCATACCCTG-3′. The PCR-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced on both sense and antisense strands and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).GST Fusion Protein Constructs Using Full-length TIAR and TIA-1— The cDNAs for TIAR and TIA-1 obtained by RT-PCR from A431 cells were cloned into the pET-42a(+) vector (Novagen). The sequences of the inserts were verified by DNA sequencing and grown in the presence of kanamycin at 37 °C. After the OD reached ∼0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 3 h to induce expression of the GST fusion proteins. The bacteria were chilled on ice and spun at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored frozen at –70 °C. The bacteria were lysed in the presence of lysozyme, proteinase inhibitors, and benzonase (25 units) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were loaded onto a GST affinity column with a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Columns were washed with 10 volumes of wash buffer, and the fusion proteins were eluted using 3 volumes of elution buffer containing glutathione.Hamster β2-AR Deletion Constructs—The pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) was used to make the various deletion constructs of β2-AR cDNA as described previously (7Subramaniam K. Chen K. Joseph K. Raymond J.R. Tholanikunnel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27108-27115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The entire 5′-UTR and the coding region from hamster β2-AR cDNA including the stop codon was PCR-amplified using Pfu polymerase and cloned into pcDNA3. Similarly, the proximal 120- and 190-nt and distal 340-nt sequences from the 3′-UTR were PCR-amplified and inserted into pcDNA3. All of the constructs were sequenced to verify the orientation and sequence of the PCR-amplified region and used for in vitro transcription after linearization with a restriction enzyme that cleaves the plasmid immediately 3′ to the inserted receptor sequences.In Vitro Transcription and UV-cross-linked Label Transfer Assay— Transcription was performed in vitro using T7 DNA-directed RNA polymerase to produce uniformly labeled RNA corresponding to the various deletion constructs as described previously (11Tholanikunnel B.G.

https://openalex.org/W1971946737,"NF-κB is a family of essential transcription factors involved in both embryonic development and inflammatory responses of the immune system. NF-κB can be activated by two pathways, i.e. the canonical (NF-κB1) pathway, which acts through the catalytic components of the IκB kinase complex and leads to IκB phosphorylation, degradation, and subsequent NF-κB nuclear translocation, or the non-canonical (NF-κB2) pathway, which involves NF-κB-induced kinase-dependent proteolytic processing of p100/p52 to yield translocation-competent p52-containing NF-κB complexes. We examined the relative roles of the NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 pathways in TCR/CD28 costimulation. We found that TCR/CD28 costimulation activates the canonical but not the non-canonical NF-κB pathway and that the serine/threonine kinase protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) is essential for TCR/CD28-mediated canonical NF-κB activation in T cells. Importantly, TCR/CD28 costimulation induces higher p52 protein levels in T cells, but this effect is secondary to enhanced de novo synthesis of p100, not to enhanced processing of extant p100; PKCθ deficiency impairs signal-dependent p52 accumulation because of defects in p100 production. Finally, we found that TCR/CD28 costimulation induces IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ degradation, and PKCθ is required for IκBα and IκBϵ but not IκBβ degradation. PKCθ acts solely within the canonical pathway to activate NF-κB, and PKCθ deficiency impacts upon p100/p52 processing in a manner that is independent of NF-κB-induced kinase.

Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) 1The abbreviations are: NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; TCR, T cell receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; MAP3K, mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase; DN, dominant negative; LTβR, lymphotoxin β receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PKCθ, protein kinase Cθ; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is a family of essential transcription factors with a well recognized role in regulating the T cell response to foreign antigen. The members of the NF-κB protein family, p100/p52, p105/p50, p65 (RelA), RelB, and c-Rel, share a structural motif called a Rel homology domain that contains regions permitting protein dimerization, DNA binding, and nuclear localization. Limited proteolytic processing of the p100 and p105 proteins generates p52 and p50, respectively, and NF-κB DNA binding and transactivation is carried out by heterodimers of p50 or p52 with one of the transactivation-domain containing Rel proteins (RelA, RelB, or c-Rel) (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Activation (nuclear translocation and DNA binding) of NF-κB heterodimers is stimulated by upstream signaling events that impact on proteins of the inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of two catalytic components, IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), and the adaptor protein IKKγ (NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)). Activated IKKα or IKKβ phosphorylates proteins of the IκB family, which is comprised of IκBα, IκBβ, IκBϵ, p100, and p105 (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ bind to NF-κB heterodimers in the cytoplasm, masking one (IκBα and IκBϵ) or both (IκBβ) of the NF-κB nuclear localization sequences. IκBα and IκBϵ also contain nuclear export sequences that ensure rapid export of IκB-bound NF-κB molecules from the cell nucleus; therefore, when NF-κB complexes are bound to IκB, NF-κB is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (2Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. de Martin R. Schmid J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10842-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 3Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Importantly, the carboxyl-terminal portions of p100 and p105 bear significant homology to other IκB proteins, contributing to the cytoplasmic retention of unprocessed p100 and p105 (4Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of IκBα or IκBϵ proteins at amino-terminal serine residues, or of carboxyl-terminal residues in p100, by IKK complex proteins leads to degradation of IκB sequences and the subsequent nuclear localization of NF-κB complexes. Conversely, proteolytic processing and removal of IκB-like sequences from p105 to generate p50 appears to be a constitutive process, and additionally, IκBβ appears to be largely insensitive to signal-dependent processing (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Therefore, the majority of stimulus-dependent NF-κB signaling appears to depend on the degradation of IκBα (and/or IκBϵ) or on p100/p52 processing. There are two major pathways for NF-κB activation, known as the canonical (NF-κB1) and non-canonical (NF-κB2) activation pathways. In the canonical pathway, cytoplasmic sequestration of preformed NF-κB heterodimers is relieved by signal-dependent stimulation of IKKβ or IKKα activity and the subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of IκB proteins (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the non-canonical pathway, signaling by surface receptors leads to the activation of NF-κB-induced kinase (NIK), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K)-like enzyme that specifically phosphorylates and activates IKKα (5Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). NIK can also directly (but independently) bind both IKKα and p100, and upon activation by upstream signals, NIK recruits IKKα into a multiprotein complex with p100. Formation of this complex leads to the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal region of p100, stimulating proteolytic processing of p100 to p52 (6Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30099-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This processing releases p52 from inhibition imposed by its carboxyl-terminal IκB-like sequences, allowing p52-containing NF-κB complexes to translocate to the nucleus and bind DNA. Together, the canonical and non-canonical pathways mediate the stimulus-dependent NF-κB activation, although their relative importance in a given cell type depends on the constellation of surface receptors on a given cell and upon the nature of the activating stimulus received. The relative roles of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB activation pathways in signaling by the T cell receptor (TCR) and the costimulatory receptor CD28 have yet to be elucidated. Here we present genetic data indicating that the serine/threonine kinase PKCθ acts downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling to mediate the activation of NF-κB through the canonical pathway. Furthermore, we show that although NIK and IKKα are activated downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling, there is no signal-dependent increase in p100/p52 processing downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling. Instead, we elucidate a role for PKCθ in the canonical pathway for NF-κB activation, and indirectly in p52 generation, by demonstrating that PKCθ deficiency leads to the selective impairment of the canonical NF-κB activation pathway. Mice and Antibodies—PKCθ-deficient (PKCθ–/–) mice were a kind gift from Dr. Dan Littman (7Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A.

The immunoprecipitated kinases were incubated alone or with substrate at 30 °C for 20 min in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. The membrane was used subsequently for immunoblotting to analyze the expression of protein substrates. Substrate phosphorylation and protein level were quantitated using NIH Image 1.61 densitometry software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/index.html). Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-Chase—Jurkat-E6.1 cells in log phase were washed once with methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium, resuspended in the same medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum at a final concentration of 10 × 106 cells/ml, and cultured at 37 °C for 30 min. For Fig. 5C below, 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) was added to the cell culture for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were chased for different time periods with “cold” methionine in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28 costimulation. Cells were harvested at the indicated times, and lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose for 30 min and immunoprecipitated with anti-p100/p52 mAb. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. For Fig. 5B below, after culturing cells in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium, the cells were pulsed in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28 costimulation for the indicated times, harvested, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and processed as above. The radiolabeled protein bands were quantified using NIH Image 1.61 software.Fig. 5TCR/CD28 costimulation increases p100 synthesis and the de novo p100 synthesis-dependent processing of p100/p52.A, primary wild-type T cells were stimulated for the indicated times with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAbs in the absence or presence of cycloheximide (CHX, 10 μg/ml). Cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-p100/p52 antibody. B, Jurkat-E6.1 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and stimulated in parallel with anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs for the indicated times. p100/p52 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Primary T cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAbs for the indicated times. Nuclear extracts were prepared by first incubating the cells with a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors for 30 s on ice. Cells were spun down at 6,000 rpm for 5 min in a benchtop centrifuge. The supernatant was kept as cytosol fraction. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in an extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.63 m NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors and then vigorously vortexed for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysed nuclei were centrifuged at maximum speed for 30 min. Equal protein amounts of nuclear and cytosolic extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The Canonical NF-κB Activation Pathway Is Impaired in PKCθ–/–T Cells—PKCθ is a serine/threonine kinase with a well known role in NF-κB activation downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling in T cells (15Sedwick C.E. Altman A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Studies using overexpression of wild-type PKCθ or its mutants (constitutively active PKCθ-A148E or kinase-dead PKCθ-K/R) first placed PKCθ downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling in the activation of NF-κB reporter constructs and demonstrated that PKCθ specifically activates IKKβ but not IKKα (9Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) to phosphorylate IκB proteins (which target IκB proteins for degradation). Subsequently, two independently generated PKCθ gene knockout mice displayed defects in NF-κB activation following TCR/CD28 stimulation in peripheral T cells (7Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 17Pfeifhofer C. Kofler K. Gruber T. Tabrizi N.G. Lutz C. Maly K. Leitges M. Baier G. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), confirming an essential role for PKCθ in TCR/CD28-mediated NF-κB activation. Accordingly, we chose to investigate the mechanism of NF-κB impairment exhibited in T cells from PKCθ–/– mice (7Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). We examined whether PKCθ deficiency leads to the impairment of IKKβ activation by comparing the in vitro kinase activity of endogenous IKKβ immunoprecipitated from wild-type and PKCθ–/– T cells following PMA or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation. We found that immunoprecipitated IKKβ has little activity in resting T cells but that it efficiently phosphorylates GST·IκBα following PMA (Fig. 1A) or anti-CD3/CD28 (Fig. 1B) stimulation in wild-type peripheral mouse T cells. In contrast, IKKβ activity was severely impaired in PKCθ–/– T cells under these same conditions (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating a requirement for PKCθ in the initiation of stimulation-dependent IKKβ catalytic activation. In the canonical pathway for NF-κB activation, stimulation of IKK leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB proteins. At present, it is unclear which IκB proteins play a principal role in the TCR/CD28-mediated activation of NF-κB, so we examined which IκB isoforms are degraded in response to TCR/CD28 signaling. Additionally, because PKCθ–/– T cells exhibit impaired IKKβ activity, we examined whether PKCθ deficiency also impacts stimulation-dependent degradation of specific IκB proteins. We observed that either PMA (Fig. 2A) or anti-CD3/CD28 (Fig. 2B) stimulation could induce significant degradation of both IκBα and IκBϵ and to a lesser extent, IκBβ, in wild-type T cells. This finding is consistent with previous reports indicating that IκBα and IκBϵ are degraded in a stimulus-dependent manner but that IκBβ is relatively stimulus-insensitive (18May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, probably due to the defect in IKKβ activation (Fig. 1), we observed that T cells from PKCθ–/– mice show impaired stimulus-dependent (PMA or α-CD3/CD28) degradation of both IκBα and IκBϵ but not IκBβ (Fig. 2). Furthermore, although ligation of TCR/CD28 surface receptors results in nuclear translocation of both p50 and p65/RelA in wild-type T cells, we observed a block in nuclear translocation of p50 and p65/RelA in PKCθ–/– T cells (Fig. 3), which likely resulted from impaired signal-dependent IκB degradation. Together, these data supply genetic evidence that PKCθ acts through the canonical pathway for NF-κB activation by causing the activation of IKKβ, resulting in the degradation of IκB proteins and NF-κB nuclear translocation. NIK and IKKα Are Activated by TCR/CD28 Costimulation—In addition to the signal-dependent degradation of IκB proteins described above, other pathways may exist in T cells for regulation of NF-κB activation, for example, through the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, which involves the MAP3K-like protein NIK. Although NIK overexpression has been demonstrated to specifically activate IKKα in T cells, and IKKα can be activated downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling in T cells (22Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the operation of such a non-canonical pathway has not been demonstrated in T cells in response to TCR/CD28 signaling. Because NIK activity is required for non-canonical stimulation-dependent p52 generation (5Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), we examined whether NIK is activated following TCR/CD28 signaling, as represented by the autophosphorylation of immunoprecipitated endogenous NIK in vitro. We found that the strongest stimulation of NIK activity was obtained by subjecting T cells to a combination of PMA treatment and CD28 cross-linking (Fig. 4A). However, we also found that anti-CD3 stimulation alone could induce increased NIK autophosphorylation in Jurkat-E6.1 cells after 30 min of stimulation. Importantly, anti-CD3/CD28 costimulation induced NIK activity sooner than anti-CD3 stimulation alone, with NIK activity peaking by 10 min after stimulation (Fig. 4A). Therefore, NIK kinase activity is stimulated following TCR/CD28 signaling in T cells. Another signature event in the non-canonical p100/p52 processing pathway is the catalytic activation of IKKα, which is indispensable for processing of p100 (19Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated whether IKKα activity is stimulated following TCR/CD28 ligation in T cells by examining the autophosphorylation of endogenous IKKα. Fig. 4A shows that anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation induced IKKα activity that corresponded in intensity and timing with the activation of NIK described above. This result is consistent with an earlier report demonstrating that NIK could specifically activate IKKα in T cells (22Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we found that overexpression of a dominant-negative (kinase-inactive) form of NIK (DN-NIK) could block anti-CD3/CD28-mediated stimulation of an NF-κB reporter gene in Jurkat-TAg cells, although in our hands, DN-NIK had to be expressed at very high levels to achieve near complete blockade of NF-κB reporter activation (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data show that TCR/CD28 signaling can stimulate NIK and IKKα activity, which are principal components of the non-canonical NF-κB activation pathway downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling, in T cells. The Non-canonical Pathway for NF-κB Activation Is Not Operative Downstream of TCR/CD28 Signaling—In the case of lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) signaling, receptor-mediated stimulation of p100/p52 processing requires NIK and IKKα, and increases in p52 levels correspond with decreasing cellular p100 protein levels, indicative of the induced processing of p100 to form p52 (20Muller J.R. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12006-12012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because both NIK and IKKα are activated downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling, we examined T cells for evidence of p100/p52 processing following TCR/CD28 signaling and found that stimulation of murine primary T cells through anti-CD3/CD28 treatment resulted in increased levels of p52 (Fig. 5A). However, this increase in p52 levels paralleled a time-dependent increase in p100 protein levels. Furthermore, the TCR/CD28-stimulated increases in both p52 and p100 protein levels were blocked by the addition of cycloheximide, indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis. These findings raised the possibility that the increase in p52 observed after TCR/CD28 stimulation is secondary to increases in p100 protein levels. To address this possibility, we stimulated [35S]methionine-labeled Jurkat-E6.1 T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs for different durations and examined the level of immunoprecipitated p100 and p52 protein in the cells by autoradiography. Fig. 5B shows that p100 steadily accumulates in unstimulated cells and that there appears to be a constitutive level of p52 processing ongoing in these cells. Nonetheless, increased p100 levels were detected as early as 1 h after stimulation and were quite marked by 5 h after stimulation, whereas p52 increased in a delayed fashion, with the first detectable increase observed at 5 h after stimulation. In contrast, when the cells were pulsed for 1 h with [35S]methionine and then chased for increasing durations in the presence of TCR/CD28 costimulation, no changes were observed in either p100 or p52 protein levels (Fig. 5C). Therefore, unlike LTβR signaling (20Muller J.R. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12006-12012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but similar to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling (21Mordmuller B. Krappmann D. Esen M. Wegener E. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), TCR/CD28 costimulation does not induce detectable p100/p52 processing. Instead, the increases in p52 (Fig. 5, A and B) do not appear to result from enhanced p100 degradation but rather are likely secondary to TCR/CD28-stimulated increases in p100 protein levels. Similar experiments in primary T cells were inconclusive due to technical difficulties in labeling these cells with [35S]methionine to a sufficiently high specific activity (data not shown). PKCθ Operates Independently of NIK to Activate NF-κB— Because both PKCθ-dependent NF-κB activation and NIK activation occur downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling, it was important to determine whether these two proteins cooperate in the activation of NF-κB signaling or whether they act in separate pathways. As demonstrated by others (22Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that DN-NIK could block the activation of an NF-κB reporter construct following anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation (Fig. 4B). However, DN-NIK failed to block NF-κB activation induced by expression of a constitutively active PKCθ mutant (PKCθ-A148E) in Jurkat-TAg cells (Fig. 6A), indicating that NIK does not act downstream of PKCθ in the PKCθ-mediated activation of NF-κB. Moreover, consistent with earlier reports (9Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we found that PKCθ-A148E specifically activated IKKβ but not IKKα in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, overexpression of DN-NIK failed to block the PKCθ-A148E-induced activation of IKKβ as demonstrated by the fact that FLAG-tagged IKKβ immunoprecipitated from cells expressing both PKCθ-A148E and DN-NIK phosphorylated GST·IκBα in vitro to the same extent as FLAG-IKKβ immunoprecipitated from cells expressing PKCθ-A148E alone (Fig. 6C). These data, together with the finding from another group (16Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) that NIK specifically activates IKKα but not IKKβ, indicate that NIK does not act downstream of PKCθ to activate NF-κB. Since PKCθ and NIK are separately activated by TCR/CD28 signaling, we hypothesized that NIK activation should be intact in PKCθ–/– T cells. Accordingly, we observed that endogenous NIK from murine primary T cells exhibited a significant basal level of kinase activity against myelin basic protein in vitro but that stimulation of the cells through α-CD3/CD28 (Fig. 7A) or through PMA (Fig. 7B) caused an increase in NIK-mediated myelin basic protein phosphorylation. This signal-dependent increase in NIK activity was unaffected by PKCθ deficiency, as evidenced by the fact that the in vitro kinase activity of NIK following PMA or anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation of PKCθ–/– T cells was identical to that observed in wild-type T cells (Fig. 7, A and B). Of note, the finding that PMA-mediated NIK activation is unaffected by PKCθ deficiency (Fig. 7B) rules out a role for PKCθ in the PMA-stimulated NIK activation observed here and in Fig. 4A. Taken together, the above data indicate that T cell activation signaling separately regulates PKCθ and NIK. Both NIK and IKKα are activated downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling, and NIK activation is normal downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling in PKCθ–/– cells. However, although NIK activation and IKKα activation are required for stimulation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, the experiments in Fig. 5 demonstrated that TCR/CD28 signaling does not drive signal-dependent increases in p100/p52 processing. Therefore, NIK activation and IKKα activation are apparently not sufficient to drive signal-dependent p100/p52 processing; instead, p52 generation in response to TCR/CD28 signaling appears to be secondary to de novo synthesis of p100. The p100 gene promoter is itself a target of NF-κB (23Liptay S. Schmid R.M. Nabel E.G. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7695-7703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so it was possible that the increase in p100 level and the generation of p52 in response to TCR/CD28 signaling is an indirect effect of PKCθ-mediated NF-κB activation. We therefore examined whether p100/p52 processing was affected by PKCθ deficiency by comparing the extent of TCR/CD28-stimulated p52 generation in wild-type versus PKCθ–/– murine peripheral T cells. We found that the TCR/CD28-dependent increase in p100 and p52 expression was impaired in PKCθ–/– T cells (Fig. 7C), indicating that PKCθ activity is required for p52 generation by TCR/CD28 signaling. This requirement most likely reflects an indirect role of PKCθ in up-regulating p100 in an NF-κB-dependent manner (Fig. 8). Of note, the basal level of p100/p52 in PKCθ–/– T cells was higher than in wild-type T cells, although p100 was not inducible in PKCθ–/– T cells. This result suggests that sustained basal activity of PKCθ may negatively regulate p100 through an unknown pathway other than the canonical NF-κB pathway. Here we provide genetic evidence for the specific activation of IKKβ by PKCθ and subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of IκBs. Although the specific action of PKCθ in IKKβ activation has been demonstrated before (9Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), this earlier work relied on overexpression studies, so our data provide significant additional evidence that PKCθ acts within the canonical NF-κB activation pathway. Furthermore, although both independently generated PKCθ knockout mice show deficiencies in TCR/CD28-dependent p50 nuclear mobilization (7Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 17Pfeifhofer C. Kofler K. Gruber T. Tabrizi N.G. Lutz C. Maly K. Leitges M. Baier G. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we extend these findings by showing that this defect in p50 nuclear mobilization results from impairments in αCD3/CD28-stimulated IKKβ activation and in the subsequent signal-dependent degradation of IκB isoforms (primarily IκBα and IκBϵ), definitively placing the action of PKCθ downstream of TCR/CD28 and within the canonical pathway for NF-κB generation. Some surface signaling events have been demonstrated to stimulate p52 generation, including signaling through the LTβR (20Muller J.R. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12006-12012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Mordmuller B. Krappmann D. Esen M. Wegener E. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), LPS receptor (21Mordmuller B. Krappmann D. Esen M. Wegener E. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and CD40 (24Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, signaling through the surface receptor induces an increase in the expression of p52 that is dependent on de novo protein synthesis; blockade of protein neosynthesis by cycloheximide prevents increases in stimulus-dependent cellular p52 levels even at very early time points (24Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). There are two mechanisms whereby signal-dependent increases in cellular p52 levels may be achieved. The first is direct and involves a stimulated increase in the rate of proteolytic processing of p100/p52, which is dependent on the catalytic activity of NIK (5Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and the subsequent recruitment of a ubiquitin ligase to a lysine residue in p100 (25Amir R.E. Haecker H. Karin M. Ciechanover A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2540-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this scenario, for example, with LTβR signaling, p52 generation may correlate with a decrease in the amount of p100 precursor (20Muller J.R. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12006-12012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The second means by which p52 levels may become elevated in cells is not through enhanced processing of p100 but simply through increases in p100 protein levels. In this case, the rate of p100/p52 processing remains unchanged, but p100/p52 processing takes place co-translationally on p100 (21Mordmuller B. Krappmann D. Esen M. Wegener E. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) so that the level of p52 protein in the cell is elevated due to the increased amount of p100 precursor being generated. This appears to be the case for TCR/CD28-stimulated and also for LPS-stimulated p52 increases. Our data do not rule out a role for NIK and IKKα in TCR/CD28-mediated p52 generation, but it does seem unlikely that NIK or IKKα plays a major role in this process because although NIK and IKKα activity is elevated downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling, the rate of p100/p52 processing is not. This idea is consistent with the finding that NIK is not required for constitutive p100/p52 processing in mouse embryo fibroblasts, but both are required for LTβR-mediated increases in p100/p52 processing (20Muller J.R. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12006-12012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether IKKα protein expression is required for constitutive p100/p52 processing; however, IKKα kinase activity appears to be dispensable for constitutive p100/p52 processing (19Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 26Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that overexpression of DN-NIK could incompletely block TCR/CD28-mediated NF-κB activation (complete blockade of TCR/CD28-induced NF-κB signaling could only be achieved when DN-NIK was drastically overexpressed) but that DN-NIK could not block PKCθ-A148E-mediated NF-κB activation. We speculate that under normal conditions, TCR/CD28 signaling activates both IKKα and IKKβ, which may cooperate to induce canonical NF-κB activation (and subsequent p100 protein synthesis). However, in the presence of DN-NIK, IKKα may be sequestered, leading to the impairment of NF-κB induction. Overexpression of PKCθ-A148E may bypass this effect of DN-NIK by specifically overdriving the activation of IKKβ, which may be informative with respect to the relative roles of PKCθ and IKKβ (when compared with IKKα) in canonical NF-κB activation. Although it is generally accepted that TCR/CD28 signaling activates NF-κB through the canonical pathway, generation of p52 downstream of TCR/CD28 signaling has never been directly addressed. Others have described stimulation of p52 processing by different combinations of costimulatory signals (e.g. CD2/CD28 costimulation) and weak, delayed activation of p52 after CD3 signaling (27Kahn-Perles B. Lipcey C. Lecine P. Olive D. Imbert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21774-21783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas another report indicated that signaling through CD28 alone leads to the nuclear translocation of pre-existing p52/RelA heterodimers but not to p100/p52 processing or the generation of additional p100 (28Marinari B. Costanzo A. Marzano V. Piccolella E. Tuosto L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6098-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that a combination of TCR and CD28 signaling up-regulates p100 expression and co-translational processing of p52 much more strongly than either signal alone reportedly does (27Kahn-Perles B.

The data presented here therefore represent the first effort to directly address the mechanism of p52 up-regulation by TCR/CD28 costimulation. Some surface receptor signaling events are capable of stimulating both the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB activation pathways. For example, both pathways of NF-κB activation are stimulated downstream of signaling through the LTβR, by LPS signaling or, as we demonstrate here, by TCR/CD28 costimulation. In the case of LTβR or LPS signaling, RelA-containing (canonical) NF-κB nuclear complexes predominate in the early phase of the response, but these are gradually replaced by p52- and RelB-containing complexes that result after delayed p100/p52 processing (20Muller J.R.

The generation of p52-containing nuclear NF-κB complexes results in long term NF-κB activation that is required in developmental events such as the generation and maintenance of lymphoid architecture. However, the stimulation of p100 generation by TCR/CD28 signaling may have special consequences for T cell activation signaling and survival because the constellation of genes bound and activated by p52-containing hetero- (20Muller J.R.

One potential gene target of p52 is the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2, the transcription of which can be stimulated by p50 or p52 homodimers in combination with Bcl-3 (30Viatour P. Bentires-Alj M. Chariot A. Deregowski V. de Leval L. Merville M.P. Bours V. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2003; 17: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This interaction could be of particular significance if early Bcl-2 gene induction is mediated by p50 homodimers, but long term Bcl-2 production is mediated by p52 homodimers. This intriguing possibility has yet to be investigated, but it could provide an explanation for how TCR/CD28 costimulation mediates some of its antiapoptotic effects and the role of PKCθ in regulating these effects.

Both are also activated under pathological conditions following ischemia, convulsions, or electroconvulsive shock. Although in non-neuronal cells PYK2 activates ERK through the recruitment of Src-family kinases (SFKs), the link between these pathways in the hippocampus is not known. We addressed this question using K+-depolarized rat hippocampal slices. Depolarization increased the phosphorylation of PYK2, SFKs, and ERK. These effects resulted from Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and were diminished by GF109203X, a protein kinase C inhibitor. Inhibition of SFKs with PP2 decreased PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation dramatically, but not its autophosphorylation on Tyr-402. Moreover, PYK2 autophosphorylation and total tyrosine phosphorylation were profoundly altered in fyn-/- mice, revealing an important functional relationship between Fyn and PYK2 in the hippocampus. In contrast, ERK activation was unaltered by PP2, Fyn knock-out, or LY294002, a phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase inhibitor. ERK activation was prevented by MEK inhibitors that had no effect on PYK2. Immunofluorescence of hippocampal slices showed that PYK2 and ERK were activated in distinct cellular compartments in somatodendritic regions and nerve terminals, respectively, with virtually no overlap. Activation of ERK was critical for the rephosphorylation of a synaptic vesicle protein, synapsin I, following depolarization, underlining its functional importance in nerve terminals. Thus, in hippocampal slices, in contrast to cell lines, depolarization-induced activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and ERK occurs independently in distinct cellular compartments in which they appear to have different functional roles.

In most cells, including neurons, activation of PYK2 appears to be a Ca2+/protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanism (5Girault J.A. Costa A. Derkinderen P. Studler J.M. Toutant M.

Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). PYK2 activation results from its autophosphorylation on Tyr-402, which creates an Src homology 2-binding site that recruits Src family kinases (SFKs), which phosphorylate several other tyrosine residues of PYK2 (34Dikic I.

Interactions between the activated PYK2/Src module and other proteins such as the Grb2-Sos complex, p130Cas, paxillin, and Graf regulate intracellular signaling (37Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In addition, in hippocampal neurons PYK2 is associated with NMDA receptors and regulates their function in combination with SFKs (11Huang Y. Lu W. Ali D.W. Pelkey K.A. Pitcher G.M. Lu Y.M. Aoto H.

PYK2 acts as an upstream regulator of ERK via activation of SFKs in several cell types in culture (31Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar, 34Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J.

For example, in PC12 cells, a chromaffin cell line often used as a neuronal model, PYK2 appears to link bradykinin and lysophosphatidic acid receptors with ERK after recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex and the subsequent activation of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway (34Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Moreover, in these cells ERK activation in response to increases in intracellular free Ca2+ requires PYK2 (40Barsacchi R. Heider H. Girault J. Meldolesi J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Hence, it has been postulated that PYK2 and ERK are components of the same important pathway controlling neuronal plasticity (7Henley J.M. Nishimune A. Neuron. 2001; 29: 312-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the role of PYK2 in the activation of ERK in the nervous system is not known. To investigate this issue we examined PYK2, SFK, and ERK phosphorylation states, reflecting their activation, in KCl-depolarized hippocampal slices. We demonstrate that KCl depolarization activates the PYK2/SFK module and ERK independently from each other in distinct cellular compartments where they may have different functions. Reagents—4-Amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) and 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol [3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP3) were from Calbiochem, LY290004 was from Biomol, and PD98059 was from New England Biolabs.

Mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK, reacting with active ERK1/2 and doubly phosphorylated on the tyrosine and threonine residues of the activation loop (clone MAPK-YT), was from Sigma (blot, 1:4000; fluorescence, 1:200). Rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 (blot, 1:4000) and anti-phospho-SFK (blot 1:2500) were from Biosource and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Polyclonal affinity-purified anti-PYK2 antibody (blot, 1:200) was obtained by immunizing a rabbit against a 17-amino acid peptide encompassing residues 2-18 of rat PYK2 (32Siciliano J.C. Toutant M.

Polyclonal affinity-purified anti-phospho-Tyr-402-PYK2 antibodies were either from Biosource (blot, 1:200) or raised in rabbits immunized with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptide (Cys-Ser-Ile-Glu-Ser-Asp-Ile-Tyr(P)-Ala-Glu-Ile-Pro-Asp-Glu-Thr) corresponding to amino acids 395-409 of PYK2 (fluorescence, 1:200) (15Tian D.

Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2; fluorescence, 1:2000) and synaptobrevin (1:1000) mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Chemicon and Synaptic System, respectively. Alexa 488- or Cy3-coupled secondary antibodies (1:400) were from Molecular Probes. Rat Hippocampal Slices—Rat hippocampal slices (300 μm) were prepared from young male Sprague-Dawley rats (100-150 g) with a McIlwain tissue chopper and incubated as described previously (32Siciliano J.C. Toutant M. Derkinderen P. Sasaki T. Girault J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28942-28946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, slices were dissected in ice-cold Ca2+-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) and placed for 10 min in polypropylene tubes (three slices per tube) containing 1 ml of Ca2+-free ACSF at 34 °C and equilibrated at pH 7.4 in O2/CO2 (95:5, v/v). The slices were then incubated at 34 °C in 900 μl of ACSF containing 1.1 mm Ca2+ and 1 μm tetrodotoxin for 45 min before depolarization by 40 mm (final concentration) KCl or vehicle. The addition of 40 mm NaCl as a control for possible osmotic effects did not alter protein phosphorylation (data not shown). Tetrodotoxin was added to prevent indirect effects due to neuronal firing and had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation by itself (data not shown). Pre-treatments were added 30 min before depolarization by KCl. At the end of the experiment, ACSF was aspirated, and the slices were immediately frozen on dry ice and kept at -80 °C. Slices were either used for immunoprecipitation (see below) or solubilized by sonication in 200 μl of a 100 °C solution of 1% (w/v) SDS and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and placed on a boiling water bath for 5 min. Mice hippocampal slices from wild type and fyn knock-out mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were prepared as rat slices, except that the hippocampus was dissected in ice-cold ACSF from coronal sections (300 μm) obtained with a vibratome. Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of SDS slice lysates (100 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond Pure, Amersham Biosciences). Membrane were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) with 0.1% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline-Tween) or 5% nonfat milk (Tris-buffered saline-milk) for the detection of phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated proteins, respectively. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, washed three times, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (diluted 1:4 000; Amersham Biosciences). Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). When necessary, membranes were stripped in buffer containing 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v) for 45 min at room temperature, followed by extensive washing in Tris-buffered saline before reblocking and reblotting. Quantifications were carried out by scanning the autoradiograms and measuring relative optical density with Scion Image software. Data were normalized to the mean value of untreated controls in the same autoradiograms. Statistical analysis was done with ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test using Prism 3.02 software. Immunoprecipitations and Analysis of Protein Tyrosine Phosphorylation—For immunoprecipitation, six hippocampal slices (500-600 μg of protein), from two independent samples were pooled and homogenized in ice-cold buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 20 μl of preimmune or immune rabbit antiserum with pre-absorption and washing on protein A-Sepharose beads, as described previously (41Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Kadaré G. Ledent C. Parmentier M. Girault J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38289-38296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—After a 2-min KCl treatment, ACSF was removed and immediately replaced by 1 ml of a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.5. Slices were post-fixed overnight in the fixative solution and stored at 4 °C. Slices were then embedded in a block of agarose (4%). Sections (30-μm-thick) were cut with a vibratome (Leica) and kept at -20 °C in a solution containing 30% ethylene glycol, 30% glycerol, and 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Immunolabeling procedures were as described previously (42Valjent E. Corvol J.C. Pages C. Besson M.J. Maldonado R. Caboche J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8701-8709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using Alexa 488- or Cy3-coupled secondary antibodies. Sections were mounted in Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole counterstain (Vector Laboratories) and studied using sequential laser-scanning confocal microscopy (SP2, Leica). Depolarization Induces a Rapid and Reversible Phosphorylation of PYK2, SFKs, and ERK in Hippocampal Slices—Treatment of rat hippocampal slices with 40 mm KCl for 2 min induced the appearance of two major phosphotyrosine immunoreactive bands at 115 and 42 kDa (Fig. 1A). These bands comigrated with PYK2 and P-ERK2, respectively (data not shown). Depolarization-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 was directly demonstrated by immunoprecipitation followed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of ERK was demonstrated by immunoblotting with antibodies specifically reacting with ERK doubly phosphorylated on threonine and tyrosine in its activation loop (Fig. 1C). Although the amounts of ERK1 and ERK2 were similar, phosphorylation predominated on ERK2 as reported previously in the hippocampus after high frequency electrical stimulation or other stimuli (10English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24329-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 43Derkinderen P. Valjent E. Toutant M. Corvol J.C. Enslen H. Ledent C. Trzaskos J.M. Caboche J. Girault J.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This difference may indicate a preferential activation of ERK2 by depolarization, although we cannot exclude a difference in the affinity of antibodies for the two isoforms. These results confirm previous reports of depolarization-induced activation of ERK and PYK2 in hippocampal slices (24Baron C. Benes C. Van Tan H. Fagard R. Roisin M.P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Siciliano J.C. Toutant M. Derkinderen P. Sasaki T. Girault J.A. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). By contrast, no change in the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was observed in the same experiments (data not shown). We examined the time course of PYK2 and ERK activation and compared it with that of SFK phosphorylation using an antibody specific for SFKs phosphorylated on tyrosine in the activation loop (Fig. 1D). Kinetics of PYK2, SFK, and ERK activation were slightly different after a 2-min KCl depolarization. PYK2 and SFK phosphorylation states followed the same time course with a peak at 1 min and a return to baseline after 10 min, suggesting a common mechanism in PYK2 and SFK activation. By contrast, ERK2 activation was slower (peak at 3 min) but more sustained (Fig. 1D). Depolarization-induced Phosphorylation of PYK2 and ERK Involves Voltage-gated Ca2+ Channels and PKC—PYK2 and ERK activation were both prevented in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or in the presence of Co2+, a nonspecific voltagegated Ca2+ channel blocker (Fig. 2A). In contrast, NMDA or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor inhibitors (MK801 and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), respectively) did not alter the depolarization-induced phosphorylation of PYK2 and ERK (Table I), ruling out a major contribution of endogenously released glutamate. Blockade of a single class of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels did not suffice to prevent depolarization-induced phosphorylation of PYK2 and ERK, which persisted in the presence of nifedipine, a L- and T-type channel blocker, Ni2+, a R-type blocker, or ω-conotoxin, a N/P/Q-type inhibitor (Table I). These results indicate that depolarization induces the phosphorylation of PYK2 and ERK by triggering Ca2+ influx through the opening of multiple types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in hippocampal slices and that the blockade of a single type of channel is not sufficient to prevent this effect.Fig. 2Role of Ca2+ influx and PKC in the activation of PYK2 and ERK by depolarization in hippocampal slices.A, hippocampal slices were incubated for 2 min in the absence (Control) or the presence of 40 mm KCl in standard ACSF, ACSF without Ca2+, or ACSF with 5 mm Co2+, as indicated.

When cells are wounded twice, the subsequent resealing is generally faster. Physiological and biochemical studies have shown the initiation of two different repair signaling pathways, which are termed facilitated and potentiated responses. The facilitated response is dependent on the generation and recruitment of new vesicles, whereas the potentiated response is not. Here, we report that the two responses can be differentially defined molecularly. Using recombinant fragments of synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin C2 domains we were able to dissociate the molecular requirements of vesicle exocytosis for initial membrane resealing and the facilitated and potentiated responses. The initial resealing response was blocked by fragments of synaptobrevin-2 and the C2B domain of synaptotagmin VII. Both the facilitated and potentiated responses were also blocked by the C2B domain of synaptotagmin VII. Although the initial resealing response was not blocked by the C2AB domain of synaptotagmin I or the C2A domain of synaptotagmin VII, recruitment of new vesicles for the facilitated response was inhibited. We also used Ca2+ binding mutant studies to show that the effects of synaptotagmins on membrane resealing are Ca2+-dependent. The pattern of inhibition by synaptotagmin C2 fragments that we observed cannot be used to specify a vesicle compartment, such as lysosomes, in membrane repair.

Puncture of the plasma membrane invokes a rapid resealing response that depends on a source of intracellular membrane and delivery of this membrane to the plasma membrane by exocytosis to ensure cell survival (1McNeil P.L. Steinhardt R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 697-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Repair signaling pathways are initiated by the sudden rise in cytosolic Ca2+ due to influx through the puncture site (2Steinhardt R.A. Bi G.-Q. Alderton J.M. Science. 1994; 263: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). When cells are wounded twice, the second wound generally reseals more quickly. Two different signaling responses, facilitated and potentiated, have been described and depend on the site of the second wound in relation to the first. The facilitated response is characterized by a faster resealing response to a second wound at the same initial wound site and depends on the generation of new vesicles in a protein kinase C and Golgi-dependent manner (3Togo T. Alderton J.M. Bi G.-Q. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 719-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells also have a globally increased exocytotic response to a second wound that increases the rate of repair to a second wound at a different site from the initial wound. This potentiated response does not depend on the generation of new vesicles (4Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The global increase in exocytosis and repair is cAMP- and protein kinase A-dependent in the first few minutes, becomes dependent on protein synthesis within a few hours, and with CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) activation can last for 24 h or more (4Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism mediating Ca2+-dependent exocytosis has been extensively investigated and appears to require the assembly of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; syb2, synaptobrevin 2; SNAP-25, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa; syt, synaptotagmin; NRK, normal rat kidney.1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; syb2, synaptobrevin 2; SNAP-25, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa; syt, synaptotagmin; NRK, normal rat kidney.

The fusion event requires coupling of the plasma membrane-localized heterodimer target SNAREs, syntaxin and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), and the vesicle-localized SNARE, synaptobrevin 2 (syb2) (8Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar, 9Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). However, fusion of purified SNAREs in an in vitro vesicle-vesicle fusion assay occurs with slow (minutes) kinetics and is Ca2+-independent (10Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The addition of soluble synaptotagmin I (syt I) markedly enhanced both the rate and extent of vesicle fusion in a Ca2+-dependent manner (11Tucker W.C. Weber T. Chapman E.C. Science. 2004; 304: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus, synaptotagmin and SNAREs probably comprise the minimal proteins required for Ca2+-mediated exocytosis. syt is a large family of at least 15 identified isoforms that are expressed at different levels in a variety of tissues and implicated in numerous types of vesicular traffic (7Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 1-11Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Marqueze B. Berton F. Seagar M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All syts share the structural organization of tandem C2 domains (13Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C2 domain is a motif of ∼130 residues, initially identified in protein kinase C and later in more than 100 proteins (14Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 15Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The tandem C2 domains of syt are separated into the membrane proximal C2 domain called C2A, and the membrane distal C2 domain is called C2B. Similar to its function in some protein kinase C isoforms, the C2AB domain of syt I (C2AB1) binds Ca2+ ions and phospholipids and is thought to act as the Ca2+ sensor for regulating secretion (11Tucker W.C. Weber T. Chapman E.C. Science. 2004; 304: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 16Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although C2AB domains from nearly half of the identified isoforms of syts do not bind Ca2+/phospholipids, nearly all do bind the target SNARE heterodimer (17Rickman C. Craxton M. Osborne S. Davletov B. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); thus, syts may trigger Ca2+-dependent exocytosis either as the Ca2+ sensor or in collaboration with an additional Ca2+ sensor. Participation of SNARE proteins in membrane repair has been suggested by the use of neurotoxins, recombinant protein fragments, and inhibitory antibodies (2Steinhardt R.A. Bi G.-Q. Alderton J.M.

Recombinant syt I and VII C2 domains and also an antibody against syt VII C2A (C2A7) domain have been tested on plasma membrane repair in NRK fibroblasts. Recombinant fragments of C2A7, as well as the antibody against this domain blocked plasma membrane repair, whereas recombinant C2A1 had no effect (20Reddy A. Caler E.V. Andrews N.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Because these C2 domains also had differential effects on Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of secretory lysosomes (23Martinez I. Chakrabarti S. Hellevik T. Morehead J. Fowler K. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that lysosomal fusion is the sole source of membrane for membrane resealing (20Reddy A. Caler E.V. Andrews N.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 24Andrews N.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 316-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). An important experimental support for this proposal was that C2B7 did not block lysosome exocytosis (23Martinez I. Chakrabarti S. Hellevik T. Morehead J. Fowler K. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) or membrane resealing (24Andrews N.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 316-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These results are surprising since the two C2 domains share many interactions with other molecules (16Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An exclusive use of lysosomes in membrane repair would also appear to conflict with earlier evidence of the sensitivity of resealing and exocytosis to botulinum neurotoxin B and tetanus toxin and the sensitivity of the facilitated response to brefeldin-A (3Togo T. Alderton J.M. Bi G.-Q. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 719-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sensitivities are also unexpected if enlargosomes are exclusively used in membrane repair (25Borgonovo B. Cocucci E. Racchetti G. Podini P. Bachi A. Meldolesi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Here we have extended the use of recombinant protein domains in tests of membrane resealing of 3T3 fibroblasts with the goal of better understanding which intracellular compartments are used in repair and to find which functional properties of the C2 domains are essential for successful resealing. We focused mainly on tests of competitive inhibition using recombinant C2 domains of syts I and VII, mutant variants of these domains that are unable to bind Ca2+, and the cytoplasmic domain of syb2 (cd-syb2). Our results support the view that the pool of membrane vesicles for membrane repair is a heterogeneous population rather than a specific sub-type, that the Ca2+ binding properties of syt C2 domains are essential for inhibition of membrane resealing, and that different vesicle pools have different sensitivities to exogenous syt C2 domains.

Science. 1994; 263: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Fura-2 was introduced into the cells by AM-ester loading of 1 μm fura-2-AM at 25 °C for 1 h and washed with Ringer's solution containing 1.8 mm Ca2+. During experiments the cells were maintained in 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution. Ca2+-free Ringer's solution contained 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.06 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm d-glucose, and 12.4 mm HEPES (pH 7.25). A stock solution of 100 mm CaCl2 was used to adjust the concentration of Ca2+ to 1.8 mm in all experiments. Before the wounding experiments, the purified recombinant fragments, which ranged in concentration from 44 to 160 μm in buffer A, were diluted into the Rodent Ringer's to a final concentration of 10, 20, or 30 μm, and Ca2+ was adjusted to 1.8 mm. 10 μm recombinant syt C2 domains maximally inhibited exocytosis in PC12 cells. 2W. C. Tucker and E. R. Chapman, unpublished observations. Similar concentrations have previously been tested on secretory lysosome exocytosis (23Martinez I. Chakrabarti S. Hellevik T. Morehead J. Fowler K. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and membrane resealing after glass bead wounding (20Reddy A. Caler E.V. Andrews N.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) in NRK fibroblasts. Fura-2-loaded cells were wounded with a 0.5-μm-tipped diameter solid glass needle pulled with a PE-2 vertical puller (Narishige, Tokyo) and manipulated using an Eppendorf 5242 microinjector and 5170 manipulator (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY) mounted on a Zeiss IM-35 inverted microscope. The time setting for wounding was 0.3 s. Resealing was monitored by photometric measurements of fura-2 fluorescence at 500–520 nm. Wounding was marked by a persistent decrease in the Ca2+-insensitive 357-nm excited fluorescent intensity (as an indicator of dye loss) together with an increase in the ratio of fluorescent intensity excited by 357/385-nm light (as an indicator of increased intracellular Ca2+ activity). Membrane resealing was marked by a cessation of dye loss. The duration between wounding and cessation of dye loss is the resealing time, and the resealing rate is defined as the inverse of the resealing time in seconds. Thus, a faster resealing time is reflected as a greater resealing rate. For cells that failed to reseal after the second wounding, the rate was defined as zero. In these experiments the recombinant proteins were added to the bath before wounding. Because diffusion of these fragments into the cell after micropuncture occurs in tens of milliseconds and membrane resealing requires tens of seconds, the addition of fragments in the bath before wounding should not significantly alter their effects on the kinetics of membrane resealing events. Exocytosis in cracked PC12 cells was inhibited regardless of the addition of recombinant fragments before, during, or after the addition of Ca2+ to stimulate fusion (31Tucker W.C. Edwardson J.M. Bai J. Kim H-J. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 23–25 °C. Data Analysis—All data are indicated as the means ± S.E. Statistics were calculated by Student's t test for paired data and Mann-Whitney (nonparametric) test for unpaired data using InStat 2.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts rapidly reseal after puncture of the plasma membrane. To analyze membrane resealing, fura-2-loaded cells were wounded as previously described (2Steinhardt R.A. Bi G.-Q. Alderton J.M. Science. 1994; 263: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Wounding (arrows in Fig. 1) by a 0.3-s jab of a microneedle is indicated by a sharp rise in the Ca2+-sensitive fura-2 ratio (lower trace) and loss of fura-2 dye, which results in a decrease in the fluorescent intensity of fura-2 (upper trace) excited at a Ca2+-insensitive wavelength (357 nm). When the cell resealed, the decrease in fluorescence intensity stopped (bars in Fig. 1). In the control, 1.8 mm Ca2+ Ringer's, the average resealing time for an initial wound was 15.12 ± 0.88 (n = 51) s, or an average resealing rate of 0.077 ± 0.004 s-1 (Table I). Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts are able to withstand multiple punctures and usually reseal even faster after a second wounding. The faster resealing to a second wounding at the same site is called a facilitated response (3Togo T. Alderton J.M. Bi G.-Q. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 719-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the example shown in Fig. 1A the resealing time is the 27 s between the initial wound (first arrow) and the cessation of fura-2 dye loss (first bar). The second wounding (arrow) required only 16 s to reseal (bar). Each 0.3-s poke stimulated a rise in intracellular Ca2+, which is seen as a rise in ratio of the 520 emission to excitation at 357 and 385 nm. When cells were wounded at the same site, the average initial resealing rate of 0.08 ± 0.006 (n = 29) was significantly (p < 0.0001, Student's t test) increased to a resealing rate of 0.132 ± 0.009 for the second wound. When plotted as the rate of membrane resealing for the second wound on the y axis to the rate of membrane resealing for the first wound on the x axis, most of the data fall above the diagonal (Fig. 1B, ○). A second wounding at a different site also shows a faster resealing rate but uses a different pathway and is called a potentiated response (4Togo T. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 93-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cells were wounded at different sites, the average initial resealing rate of 0.074 ± 0.007 (n = 22) was observed to significantly (p < 0.003) increase to 0.118 ± 0.013 for the second wound. When plotted as the rate of the second membrane resealing to the rate of the first membrane resealing, most of the data fall above the diagonal (Fig. 1B, •), reflecting the faster resealing response to the second wound. The average ratios of the second with respect to the first resealing rates of control cells for facilitation and potentiation were 1.81 ± 0.16 (n = 29) and 1.9 ± 0.14 (n = 22), respectively.Table IEffect of vesicle fusion fragments on initial resealing rates in NIH 3T3 Cells Cells were micropunctured in Ringer's solution containing different recombinant fragments, and the rate of membrane resealing for an initial wounding was determinedTreatmentInitial resealing rateaInitial membrane resealing recordings pooled from same and different site recordingsMann-Whitney paired TestbComparison with initial resealing rates of untreated control cellsControl (untreated)0.077 ± .004 (51)cMean ± S.E.

Biol. 2003; 19: 697-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmins are a family of membrane proteins proposed to regulate Ca2+-triggered membrane traffic to the plasma membrane (34Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 35Koh T.W. Bellen H.J. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recombinant fragments of synaptotagmin domains would be expected to inhibit membrane repair depending on their ability to disrupt endogenous synaptotagmin-effector interactions required for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Two well studied synaptotagmins, syt I (36Tarantini F. La Vallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Garfinkel S. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and syt VII (37Caler E.V. Chakrabarti S. Fowler K.T. Rao S. Andrews N.W. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1097-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), are expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and we focused on the Ca2+ binding domains of these two isoforms. The addition of 30 μm recombinant C2B domain of syt I (C2B1) did not inhibit the resealing rate to the first wound or the facilitation response to a second wound at the same site (Fig. 2, ▴). The first resealing rate was 0.063 ± 0.006 (n = 16), which is not significantly (p = 0.23, Mann-Whitney, unpaired nonparametric test) changed from that of untreated control cell (0.077 ± 0.004, n = 51). The resealing rate of C2B1-treated cells to a second wounding at the same site was observed to increase to 0.119 ± 0.015 or a second/first resealing ratio of 2.06 ± 0.185. Thus, similar to a previous report for C2A1 (20Reddy A. Caler E.V. Andrews N.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), the single recombinant C2B1 domain did not inhibit membrane resealing. Inhibition of exocytosis in PC12 cells has been shown to require fragments containing the tandem C2 domains of C2A-C2B of syt I (31Tucker W.C. Edwardson J.M. Bai J. Kim H-J. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which is required for efficiently binding target SNAREs, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 (30Earles C.A. Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2004; 41: 929-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For 3T3 cells in the presence of 30 μm C2AB1, the resealing rate to the first wound was 0.08 ± 0.005 (n = 54), which was not significantly (p = 0.497) changed from that of untreated control cells (Table I). But the facilitated resealing response to a second wounding at the same site was blocked in the C2AB1-treated cells (Fig. 2, ○). The second resealing rate was 0.091 ± 0.012 (n = 29), which was not significantly (p < 0.35) increased from the resealing rate of the initial wound (0.081 ± 0.008). The potentiated response to a second wounding at a different site was also blocked by the addition of 30 μm C2AB1 to the medium (data not shown). The first resealing rate of 0.079 ± 0.006 (n = 25) was decreased to 0.066 ± 0.006 resealing rate for a second wounding at a different site on the cell. With C2AB1 competitive inhibition the vesicle fusions that increase the resealing rate to a second wound appear to be inhibited, whereas the initial response remains intact. The role of synaptotagmins in membrane fusion depends on their function as Ca2+ binding modules mediating Ca2+-dependent interactions with other fusion proteins (16Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the Ca2+ binding properties of syt I impairs synaptic exocytosis (39Fernandez-Chacon R. Konigstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcia J.

The effect of C2AB1 on the facilitated membrane resealing response was dependent on its Ca2+ binding properties. The syt I Ca2+ ligand mutant C2AB (D230N, D232N,D363N,D365N) (30Earles C.A. Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) did not inhibit the facilitated membrane resealing response. The second resealing rates of 3T3 cells treated with 30 μm syt I C2AB (D230N,D232N,D363N,D365N) was significantly (p < 0.0002) increased from the first resealing rates (Fig. 2, •)"
https://openalex.org/W1978741566,"Activation of GABAB receptors in chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons inhibits the Cav2.2 calcium channel in both a voltage-dependent and voltage-independent manner. The voltage-independent inhibition requires activation of a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the α1 subunit of the channel and thereby recruits RGS12, a member of the “regulator of G protein signaling” (RGS) proteins. Here we report that RGS12 binds to the SNARE-binding or “synprint” region (amino acids 726-985) in loop II-III of the calcium channel α1 subunit. A recombinant protein encompassing the N-terminal PTB domain of RGS12 binds to the synprint region in protein overlay and surface plasmon resonance binding assays; this interaction is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation and yet is within a sequence that differs from the canonical NPXY motif targeted by other PTB domains. In electrophysiological experiments, microinjection of DRG neurons with synprint-derived peptides containing the tyrosine residue Tyr-804 altered the rate of desensitization of neurotransmitter-mediated inhibition of the Cav2.2 calcium channel, whereas peptides centered about a second tyrosine residue, Tyr-815, were without effect. RGS12 from a DRG neuron lysate was precipitated using synprint peptides containing phosphorylated Tyr-804. The high degree of conservation of Tyr-804 in the SNARE-binding region of Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 calcium channels suggests that this region, in addition to the binding of SNARE proteins, is also important for determining the time course of the modulation of calcium current via tyrosine phosphorylation. Activation of GABAB receptors in chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons inhibits the Cav2.2 calcium channel in both a voltage-dependent and voltage-independent manner.

Multiple G protein-mediated signaling pathways are known to modulate Cav2.2 (N-type) calcium channels (1Ikeda S.R. Dunlap K. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 131-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Catterall W.A.

Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 531-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). This modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels is a transient phenomenon. Upon prolonged exposure to a neurotransmitter, neurons become unresponsive or desensitized. Despite the common requirement for the activation of a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK3) for desensitization of the neurotransmitter-mediated inhibition of calcium current (5Diversé-Pierluissi M.

In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the activation of γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors induces both voltage-dependent and voltage-independent inhibition of Cav2.2 channels (9Luebke J.I. Dunlap K. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Voltage-independent inhibition requires the activation of a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the pore-forming α-subunit of the calcium channel (10Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diversé-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the α-subunit becomes a target for the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of RGS12, a member of the RGS protein superfamily that specifically accelerates the rate of desensitization of this response (10Schiff M.L.

To better understand the molecular basis for the RGS12-Cav2.2 channel interaction and its functional implications, we used recombinant proteins and peptides containing the cytoplasmic regions of the α1 subunit of the Cav 2.2 channel to map the site of interaction with RGS12. Results from protein-protein interaction and electrophysiological experiments indicate that the SNARE-binding region of the channel interacts with RGS12. The SNARE-binding region of calcium channels has been shown to bind the target SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP-25 and the vesicular SNARE synaptotagmin (11Catterall W.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 144-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The binding of syntaxin to the channel is important for stabilization of the binding of Gβγ subunits (12Spafford J.D. Zamponi G.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that a tyrosine-based motif within the synprint region (centered about Tyr-804) plays an important role in determining the rate of desensitization of GABA-mediated voltage-independent inhibition. Materials—Recombinant active Src and the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody (1:2000) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-RGS12 antiserum raised against the RGS box has been described previously by Schiff et al. (10Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diversé-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The ProFound pull-down biotinylated protein-protein interaction kit was obtained from Pierce. A pET30 vector (Novagen) was used for the expression of His6-tagged channel loop constructs. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Anti-syntaxin (1:1000) was obtained from StressGen. Peptides—Sequences of the peptides used in this study were based on the Cav2.2 α1 sequence from chick DRG neuron (CDB1; GenBank™ accession number AAD51815). Peptides were synthesized by FastMoc chemistry at the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography with >97% purity as determined by mass spectrometry. An amino-terminal biotin was included in every peptide. Peptides were first dissolved in 5 mm acetic acid at 1 mg/ml and then diluted into the internal solution for electrophysiological experiments or a HEPES-buffered saline solution for biochemical experiments. Cell Culture—Embryonic chick sensory neurons were grown in culture as described previously (5Diversé-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 579-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Dorsal root ganglia were dissected from 11-12-day-old chick embryos. Cells used for electrophysiology were plated at a density of ∼50,000 cells per collagen-coated 35-mm tissue culture dish and studied for 1-3 days in vitro. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell recordings were performed as described (5Diversé-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 579-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For extracellular application, agents were diluted into standard extracellular saline and applied via a wide bore pipette. The calcium current was corrected for rundown by measuring calcium current as a function of time in control cells without a neurotransmitter. Cells used for experiments exhibited a rundown of the current of <1% per minute. The external saline contained 133 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 25 mm HEPES, 12.5 mm NaOH, 5 mm glucose, and 0.3 μm tetrodotoxin. The pipette internal solution contained 150 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgATP, and 5 mm bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-tetraacetic acid. Pipettes resistances prior to forming high resistance seals ranged from 1-2 megaohms. Data Analysis—Data were filtered at 3 kHz, acquired at 10-20 kHz, and analyzed using PulseFit (HEKA) and IgorPro (WaveMetrics) on a Macintosh G3 computer. Strong depolarizing conditioning pulses (to 80 mV) that preceded test pulses (to 0 mV) reversed GABA-induced voltage-dependent inhibition without affecting voltage-independent inhibition. Such conditioning pulses had no effect on the control currents recorded in the absence of GABA. During neurotransmitter application, test pulse currents measured before and after the conditioning pulse were subtracted to yield the voltage-dependent component. Test pulses measured following the conditioning pulse were subtracted from control currents (measured in the absence of GABA) to yield the voltage-independent component. In Vitro Phosphorylation—In vitro phosphorylation of recombinant channel loop proteins was performed using a recombinant active form of Src kinase (Upstate Biotechnology). 10-20 units of recombinant Src per assay were used. The kinase reaction buffer contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ATP. Reactions were incubated for 40 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved in a 12% SDS acrylamide gel, and tyrosine phosphorylation was detected using immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (1:1000). For phosphorylation reactions using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 10 μCi per reaction was used. Bands containing the recombinant proteins were excised from the gels and quantified in the scintillation counter using liquid scintillant. Reported values represent the results of three independent assays with each sample performed in duplicate. Cellular Phosphorylation of the Tyr-804 Peptide—A biotinylated Tyr-804 peptide was synthesized with an N-terminal Antennapedia penetratin motif (Arg-Gln-Ile-Lys-Ile-Trp-Phe-Gln-Asn-Arg-Arg-Met-Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys) that allows the peptide to permeate the membrane. A stock solution of the peptide Antennapedia penetratin-Tyr-804 was incubated alone for 15 min at 37 °C prior to its addition to the DRG medium at a final concentration of 1.4 μg/ml. DRG neurons were treated in the presence of the peptide for 15 min in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C prior to exposure to 100 μm baclofen or saline (vehicle control) for 20 s. After agonist treatment, DRG neurons were lysed with ice-cold buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 250 μm sodium pervanadate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 100 μg/ml calpain I and 100 μg/ml calpain II inhibitors). DRG neuron lysates (25 μl) were then applied onto a SAM2 biotin capture membrane (Promega) to capture the biotinylated peptide, and tyrosine phosphorylation was detected using immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (1:500; Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoblot Quantitation—For quantitation of bands in immunoblots visualized using chemiluminescence, images were obtained using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI. ImageQuant 1.11 (for Macintosh) was used to analyze the data. Values were pooled for all of the experiments, and mean ± S.E. was plotted. All experiments were repeated 2-5 times with similar results. Representative examples are shown for the biochemical experiments. For electrophysiological experiments, data derived using cells from three independent platings are shown. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Biosensor Measurements—SPR binding assays were performed at 25 °C on a BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at the University of North Carolina Department of Pharmacology Protein Core Facility. For the screening of relative binding specificity, N-terminally biotinylated, synthetic peptides were bound to a streptavidin-coated sensor surface (Sensor Chip SA, BIAcore, Uppsala Sweden) per the manufacturer's instructions at a density of 400 resonance units. Binding analyses were performed using HBS-EP buffer (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) as the running buffer. The GST-rRGS12-(1-440) fusion protein, purified as described previously (20Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), was diluted in HBS-EP buffer and injected at a 10 μl/min flow rate over four flow cell surfaces simultaneously using the KINJECT command. Surface regeneration was performed by 10-μl injections of 0.05% SDS in HBS-EP buffer at a 20 μl/min flow rate. Background binding to a negative control peptide surface (control) was subtracted from all binding curves using BIAevaluation software version 3.0 (BIAcore Inc.) and plotted using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (Graph-Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). For quantitative binding analyses of the phosphotyrosine synprint motif, N-terminally biotinylated Tyr(P)-804/Tyr-815 peptide (biotin-Met-His-Asn-Phe-Arg-Asn-Ser-Cys-Glu-Ala-Leu-Tyr(P)-Asn-Glu-Leu-Asp-Pro-Glu-Glu-Arg-Val-Arg-Tyr-Ala-Thr-Thr-Leu) was bound to a streptavidin-coated sensor surface to a density of 0, 100, and 400 resonance units, respectively, on three independent flow cell surfaces. To eliminate any potential contribution of GST/GST dimerization to kinetic binding measurements, the open reading frame of the pGEX-RGS12-(1-440) construct was recloned by PCR into the hexahistidine-tagged prokaryotic expression vector pProEXHTb (Invitrogen), and the recombinant His6-RGS12-(1-440) protein was purified from Escherichia coli by sequential application of a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity matrix, anion exchange, and size exclusion chromatographic separations using previously described methods (13Kimple R.J. De Vries L. Tronchere H. Behe C.I. Morris R.A. Farquhar M.G. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29275-29281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses of His6-rRGS12-(1-440) binding to the Tyr(P)-804/Tyr-815 peptide were performed using a running buffer containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Purified His6-rRGS12-(1-440) protein was diluted in running buffer at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 μm, and 50 μl of it was injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min over four flow cell surfaces simultaneously using the KINJECT command. The sensorgrams were normalized to the signal achieved due to binding the control “blank” flow cell surface (0 resonance units), and the normalized data were globally fit to a 1:1 binding model (bulk refractive index effect = 0) using BIAevaluation software version 3.0. The resultant apparent dissociation constant (KD) was derived from calculated kon and koff rates and is the result of four independent sets of titrations. Binding of Endogenous RGS12 to Channel Peptides—Affinity columns were prepared by incubating 100 μg of N-terminally biotinylated synthetic peptides with streptavidin-Sepharose beads per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). 2 mg of DRG lysate was loaded onto the biotinylated peptide-avidin column and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Negative controls using beads without peptide and a lysate from HEK293T cells were run in parallel. Elution was performed per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Eluate was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunodetection of RGS12 was carried out as described previously using an antibody raised against the RGS box (1:1000) (10Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diversé-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); syntaxin was detected using anti-syntaxin (1:1000, Stressgen) RGS12 Binds to the Tyrosine-phosphorylated Synprint Region of Cav2.2 Channel—The PTB domain of RGS12 (amino acids 236-440) binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the Cav2.2 channel in a neurotransmitter-induced manner, and this interaction accelerates the desensitization of neurotransmitter-mediated channel inhibition (10Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diversé-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the SNARE-binding (or synprint) region and the C terminus of the α1 subunit of the Cav2.2 channel can be phosphorylated by Src kinase (14Richman R.W. Tombler E. Lau K.K. Anantharam A. Rodriguez J. O'Bryan J.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25649-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine which region of the α1 channel subunit binds to RGS12, we performed overlay assays using recombinant proteins encompassing cytoplasmic regions of the Cav2.2 α1 subunit. In these overlay assays, a recombinant GST fusion protein comprising the first 440 amino acids of rat RGS12 bound to an in vitro Src-phosphorylated channel loop encompassing the synprint region (Fig. 1A). This binding was dependent on phosphorylation, as no binding was seen without prior Src phosphorylation (data not shown). Despite the fact that the C terminus is heavily phosphorylated (14Richman R.W. Tombler E. Lau K.K. Anantharam A. Rodriguez J. O'Bryan J.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25649-25658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar), no binding to GST-RGS12 was detected for this region of the channel.Fig. 1The N terminus of RGS12 binds to the synprint region.A, a recombinant RGS12 N terminus binds to the Src-phosphorylated synprint region peptide in a protein overlay assay. Phosphorylated His6-tagged recombinant proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml recombinant GST fusion protein comprising the N-terminal 440 amino acids of RGS12. Data are representative of four experiments. An anti-GST antibody (1:2000) was used to detect binding. B, sequence of loop II-III of a chick Cav2.2 channel. Tyrosine residues Tyr-804 and Tyr-815 are indicated in red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The synprint region of the chick Cav2.2 α1 subunit contains two tyrosine residues, Tyr-804 and Tyr-815 (Fig. 1B). To test which tyrosine residue was phosphorylated, synprint region proteins with tyrosine-to-phenylalanine (Tyr → Phe) mutations were expressed and purified as His6-tagged fusion proteins and phosphorylated by Src in vitro (Fig. 2A) (conversion to phenylalanine removes the hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring of the residue side chain required for phosphorylation). Mutation of tyrosine 804 caused a 55% decrease compared with a positive control containing both tyrosine residues (wild-type), whereas mutation of the second tyrosine residue (Tyr-815) decreased phosphorylation by 45% (Fig. 2B). In vitro phosphorylation assays using [γ-32P]ATP confirmed these observations. In the wild-type recombinant protein the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was 1.9 mol of phosphate/mol peptide, with a 57 ± 9 and 43 ± 10% decrease in phosphate incorporation in Phe-804 and Phe-815 peptides, respectively (n = 3). These results suggest that both Tyr-804 and Tyr-815 can be phosphorylated. Neither tyrosine residue falls within the canonical Asn-Pro-Xaa-Tyr(P) motif commonly recognized by PTB domains (15Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Mark T Temple UhlikB. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 345: 1-20Google Scholar). Synprint Peptides Slow the Desensitization Rate of GABA-mediated Cav2.2 Channel Inhibition—We have shown previously that the endogenous RGS12 protein, and not other RGS family members, controls the timing of desensitization of the GABA-mediated, voltage-independent inhibition of calcium current in embryonic DRG neurons (10Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diversé-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, synthetic peptides containing Tyr-804 and/or Tyr-815 (supplemental table I, available in the on-line version of this paper) were tested in electrophysiological assays to determine their ability to interfere with the rate of desensitization of GABA-mediated inhibition of calcium current. Embryonic chick DRG neurons express only one type of voltage-dependent calcium channel, the Cav2.2 (N-type, ω-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive) channel (17Lu Q. Dunlap K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34566-34575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Calcium current as a function of time was monitored using whole-cell electrophysiology to determine any agonist-independent effect that the peptides might have on the basal calcium current. Peptide concentrations from 1 nm to1 mm were introduced into the cytosolic environment through the recording pipette. DRG neurons were exposed to 100 μm GABA (in the presence of 100 μm bicuculline to block GABAA receptors), and both the magnitude and the time course of the GABA-mediated voltage-independent inhibition were determined. Under these experimental conditions, the peptides did not cause a significant change in the magnitude of voltage-independent inhibition; GABA-induced voltage-independent inhibition was 34 ± 8% in control cells compared with 31 ± 9% in the presence of peptide. At 1 μm, the 16-amino acid Tyr(P)-804-containing peptide (supplemental table I) slowed the rate of desensitization by a factor of 48, whereas the Tyr-804-containing peptide slowed the rate of desensitization by a factor of 23 (peptides Tyr(P)-804 and Tyr-804 respectively; Fig. 3A). The mutation of Tyr-804 to phenylalanine severely curtailed this effect on the desensitization rate (peptide Phe-804 (F804); Fig. 3). Peptides containing solely the second tyrosine motif (Tyr-815) had no significant effect on the desensitization rate. Effects of Tyr-804-containing peptides were observed at concentrations down to the nanomolar range (1 nm; Fig. 3A). In contrast, even at high concentrations the Tyr-815-containing peptides were without effect. Although our previous data suggested that RGS12 interacts with the calcium channel (10Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diversé-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner, both the Tyr(P)-804- and Tyr-804-containing peptides altered the rate of desensitization of GABA-induced voltage-independent inhibition of calcium current. We therefore tested whether the Tyr-804-containing peptide could be phosphorylated within the cellular environment upon the activation of GABAB receptors in DRG neurons. To answer this question, a biotinylated and cell-permeant form of the Tyr-804 peptide was introduced into DRG neurons, and then cells were exposed to saline or an agonist prior to lysis. Cell lysates containing the biotinylated peptide were spotted onto a streptavidin membrane and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The Tyr-804 peptide introduced into cells exposed to baclofen exhibited a much higher degree of phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). This finding suggests that the Tyr-804 peptide becomes phosphorylated in the cellular environment of the DRG neurons. In time course electrophysiological experiments, cells containing peptide Tyr-804 did not exhibit significant desensitization after exposure to GABA for 200 s (Fig. 3B), whereas cells containing other peptides or control internal solution exhibited complete desensitization by 100 s. Results obtained in experiments with the 27 amino acid peptides spanning Tyr-804 (supplemental table I in the on-line version of this article) were the same as the results obtained with the 16 amino acid peptides spanning Tyr-804 (data not shown). These results suggest that, whereas both Tyr-804 and Tyr-815 can be phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 2), only those peptides containing the Tyr-804-centered motif interfere with the rate of desensitization. Mapping the Determinants of the RGS12/Synprint Motif Interaction—SPR biosensor measurements were carried out to test which phosphotyrosine residue-containing motif had the potential to mediate association with RGS12 in vitro. Initially, the ability of the recombinant GST-RGS12-(1-440) fusion protein to bind biosensor surfaces pre-adsorbed with Tyr(P)-804/Tyr-815 and Tyr-804/Tyr(P)-815 peptides was tested. (Fig. 4A). As a positive control, a 20-amino acid biotinylated peptide comprising the C terminus of the interleukin-8 receptor CXCR2, which we have previously shown interacts with the N-terminal RGS12 PDZ domain (18Snow B.E. Hall R.A Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Gilman A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), was used. The recombinant RGS12 N terminus was observed to bind both the control CXCR2 peptide and the Tyr(P)-804/Tyr-815 channel-loop peptide surfaces (Fig. 4A), whereas any interaction with the Tyr-804/Tyr(P)-815 peptide was below the detection limit of the SPR biosensor. Fusion of the RGS12 N terminus with the 26-kDa GST moiety allows for a higher signal-to-noise ratio in SPR measurements, because the biosensor response is directly proportional to the molecular mass of the analyte binding to the biosensor (18Snow B.E. Hall R.A Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Gilman A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, as mass transport and GST/GST dimerization artifacts can complicate kinetic determinations (19Malmqvist M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), independent SPR experiments were performed using low density peptide surfaces and varying concentrations of the hexahistidine-tagged RGS12 N terminus protein to obtain an apparent dissociation constant (KD) of 13.4 ± 0.8 μm for the interaction with the Tyr(P)-804/Tyr-815 peptide (see representative dose-response curves in Fig. 4B). We also tested the ability of Tyr-804- and Tyr-815-containing peptides to interact with full-length, endogenous RGS12 by micro-affinity chromatography of chick DRG neuron lysates using these biotinylated peptides bound to streptavidin resin. Although RGS12 binding was detected in eluates from peptide columns containing Tyr-804- and Tyr(P)-804-containing peptide columns, no RGS12 was detected in eluates from peptide columns solely containing Tyr-815- or Tyr(P)-815-centered motifs (Fig. 4C). Collectively, our results suggest that a polypeptide span surrounding Tyr-804 within the Cav2.2 channel synprint region is the binding site for RGS12. An alignment of this Cav2.2 channel region across different species indicates that this Tyr-804 tyrosine residue has been conserved in multiple species (Fig. 5). The surrounding residues are also conserved. To test whether residues surrounding Tyr-804 contribute to the interaction with RGS12, peptides were designed with single residue substitutions and tested for their ability to bind endogenous RGS12 by streptavidin micro-affinity chromatography of chick DRG neuron lysates. Most of the amino acid substitutions N- and C-terminal to the Tyr-804 position decreased RGS12 binding to the background level seen for the Phe-804 negative control (Fig. 6, a and b); three of the four positions at which alanine substitutions did not abrogate RGS12 binding (Phe-796, Asn-805, and Leu-807; Fig. 6a) are not conserved between chick and mammalian Cav2.2 sequences (Fig. 5).Fig. 6a, binding of endogenous RGS12 from chick DRG lysates to Tyr-804-containing synprint peptides (amino acids 796 to 807) with single amino acid substitutions (as indicated by arrows). Experiment was performed as described for Fig. 4C. The lane labeled lysate at the extreme left represents total chick DRG lysates. Data are representative of six independent experiments. b, histogram shows quantitation of endogenous RGS12 bound to mutant peptides. Density of the RGS12 band was normalized to the density of the RGS12 band from samples bound to wild-type Tyr(P)-804 peptide and expressed as a percentage. Error bars represent mean ± S.E. Data are representative of six independent experiments. c, binding of syntaxin to the synprint region peptides. Binding of endogenous syntaxin from chick brain lysates to channel peptides was performed by micro-affinity chromatography as described for the RGS12 binding experiments. Immunodetection was performed using an anti-syntaxin antibody (1:1000). Data are representative of five independent experiments. d, competition of RGS12 and syntaxin for binding to synprint region peptides. Binding of endogenous syntaxin from chick brain lysates to channel peptides was performed by micro-affinity chromatography as described for RGS12 binding experiments. Peptide columns were pre-incubated with control or GST-RGS12-(1-440)-containing solutions prior to loading the cell lysates. Immunodetection was performed using anti-syntaxin antibody (1:1000) to detect syntaxin or anti-GST (1:3000; Sigma) to detect the GST-RGS12 recombinant (GST-r) protein. Data are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the RGS12 binding site is part of the SNARE-binding region of the calcium channel, we tested whether syntaxin could bind to the synprint region peptides. By micro-affinity chromatography, syntaxin was detected in eluates from Tyr-804-containing peptide columns but not detected in eluates from Tyr-815 or Tyr(P)-815 peptide columns (Fig. 6b and data not shown). Unlike RGS12, the binding of syntaxin to Tyr-804-containing peptides was not dependent on the phosphorylation status of the tyrosine residue (Tyr-804 (Y804) versus Tyr(P)-804 (pY804); Fig. 6c). To test whether syntaxin and RGS12 compete for the same binding region, Tyr-804 and Tyr(P)-804 peptide columns were pre-incubated with the GST-RGS12-(1-440) fusion protein prior to loading of the cell lysates. Tyr(P)-804 peptide columns bound with recombinant RGS12 showed a decrease in syntaxin binding (Fig. 6d). RGS12 was confirmed to be present in eluates from Tyr(P)-804 peptide columns upon anti-GST immunoblotting (Fig. 6d). These results raise the possibility that syntaxin and RGS12 may compete for the same binding site in vivo. RGS12 has the potential to serve as a signal transduction “nexus” that modulates multiple signaling pathway components by virtue of its multi-domain architecture including N-terminal PDZ and PTB domains, a central RGS-box with Gαi/o-specific GTPase-accelerating activity, C-terminal Ras-binding domains, and a GoLoco motif (13Kimple R.J.

Biol. 1999; 34: 215-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our previous studies of the involvement of RGS12 in modulating presynaptic GABAB-receptor signaling in chick DRG neurons suggest that RGS12, in binding to the calcium channel, modulates channel activity directly in addition to its ability to accelerate Gα-subunit GTPase activity (10Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diversé-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we have mapped the region of the calcium channel that interacts with RGS12 to the SNARE-binding or synprint region (amino acids 726-985). Introduction of a peptide that contains Tyr-804 and flanking residues is sufficient to alter the rate of desensitization of the GABA-mediated inhibition of calcium current. Several proteins are known to bind to the synprint region, an intracytosolic portion of the channel that has been extensively studied as important for the regulation of both channel activity and secretion (22Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). Binding of syntaxin to this channel region plays a role in voltage-dependent inhibition (23Sheng Z.H. Rettig J. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and is thought to stabilize the binding of G protein βγ subunits to the channel (24Jarvus S.E. Magga J.M. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin also binds to the channel in this region upon depolarization in a calcium-dependent manner (25Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have shown here that RGS12 and syntaxin are both capable of binding the Tyr-804-based peptide motif; however, the RGS12 interaction appears to be phosphorylation-dependent (see below), whereas the syntaxin interaction occurred irrespective of phosphorylation status. The binding of RGS12 to the phosphorylated synprint region prevents syntaxin binding. We are currently investigating whether the binding of RGS12 to the calcium channel synprint region can displace syntaxin protein from this site and thus reverse the inhibition of the calcium channel. The PTB domain was first identified in Shc (26Blaikie P. Imanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), a signaling adaptor protein that mediates phosphotyrosine-dependent interactions between growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream effectors (28Pellici G.

PTB domains were first assumed to be strictly targeted to phosphotyrosine residues, as the prototypic PTB domains of Shc and IRS-1 were found to recognize phosphotyrosine sites in the context of a conserved sequence motif: Asn-Pro-Xaa-Tyr(P) (29van der Greer P.

However, as other PTB domains have been identified and their binding sites characterized, it is clear that a PTB domain can also have non-phosphorylated and non-Asn-Pro-Xaa-Tyr motif-based polypeptide targets (15Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Mark T Temple UhlikB. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 345: 1-20Google Scholar). Here we have determined that the RGS12 N terminus binds in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner to the synprint region polypeptide of the sequence Arg-Ala-Ser-Cys-Glu-Ala-Leu-Tyr(P)-Asn-Glu. This sequence, centered about Tyr-804, represents a novel target for PTB domain interactions as it does not possess an Asn-Pro-Xaa-pY motif and, moreover, mutagenesis of this sequence suggests that at least one residue C-terminal of the phosphotyrosine (namely Glu-806) is required for the RGS12 interaction. The interaction between recombinant RGS12-N-terminal fusion proteins and the Tyr-804-centered synprint motif was strictly dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation; however, both electrophysiological measurements and cell lysate chromatography suggested some activity also for the non-phosphorylated Tyr-804-containing peptide. The simplest explanation for this apparent dichotomy is phosphorylation of the synthetic Tyr-804 peptide (e.g.Fig. 3C) by endogenous tyrosine kinase activity upon its addition to the DRG neurons (and lysates thereof), which is under study. Future experiments are necessary to determine whether the tyrosine residue involved in the interaction between RGS12 and the Cav2.2 channel also plays a role in the onset of channel modulation by a neurotransmitter. Point mutations of residues Tyr-804 and Tyr-815 to phenylalanine in the context of the full-length Cav2.2 channel will help to distinguish which residue(s) are important for the onset of neurotransmitter-mediated modulation and whether the phosphorylation of Tyr-804 causes inhibition of calcium influx prior to its interaction with RGS12.

Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved docetaxel combined with prednisone for the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer, and it does show a survival benefit. Hence, anti-microtubule drugs might be of benefit in chemotherapy of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. We used metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer PC-3 cells to investigate potential molecular mechanisms for CIL-102, a semisynthetic alkaloid derivative. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenylte-trazolium bromide and sulforhodamine B assays indicated that CIL-102 inhibits cell growth dose-dependently. Immunofluorescence microscopy and in vitro tubulin assembly assays indicated that CIL-102 binds to tubulin and disrupts microtubule organization. Flow cytometry showed that CIL-102 causes cells to accumulate in G2/M phase and sub-G0/G1 phase. CIL-102-induced apoptosis was also characterized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Western blotting and kinase assays showed that CIL-102 exposure induced up-regulation of cyclin B1 and p34cdc2 kinase activity and olomoucine, a p34cdc2 inhibitor, profoundly reduced the number of cells accumulated in mitotic phase. Moreover, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, Cdc25C phosphorylation, and survivin expression were increased. CIL-102-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3, but a noncaspase pathway may also be involved, since benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a pancaspase inhibitor, only partially inhibited the apoptosis, and apoptosis-inducing factor was translocated from mitochondria to cytosol. We conclude that CIL-102 induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis by binding to tubulin and inhibiting tubulin polymerization. CIL-102 causes mitotic arrest, at least partly, by modulating cyclin-dependent kinases and then apoptosis executed by caspase and noncaspase pathways.

Western blotting and kinase assays showed that CIL-102 exposure induced up-regulation of cyclin B1 and p34cdc2 kinase activity and olomoucine, a p34cdc2 inhibitor, profoundly reduced the number of cells accumulated in mitotic phase. Moreover, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, Cdc25C phosphorylation, and survivin expression were increased. CIL-102-induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3, but a noncaspase pathway may also be involved, since benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a pancaspase inhibitor, only partially inhibited the apoptosis, and apoptosis-inducing factor was translocated from mitochondria to cytosol. We conclude that CIL-102 induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis by binding to tubulin and inhibiting tubulin polymerization. CIL-102 causes mitotic arrest, at least partly, by modulating cyclin-dependent kinases and then apoptosis executed by caspase and noncaspase pathways. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 230,110 new cases of prostate cancer in the United States in 2004, and about 29,900 men will die of this disease this year alone (1Jemal A. Tiwari R.C. Murray T. Ghafoor A. Samuels A. Ward E. Feuer E.J. Thun M.J. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2004; 54: 8-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (3898) Google Scholar). Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer initially respond to androgen ablation therapy with tumor cells undergoing apoptosis, but then the patients relapse rapidly and develop advanced or metastatic, hormone-refractory, and apoptosis-resistant prostate cancer. The mortality of these patients is high, because conventional chemotherapeutic drugs have little effect on hormone-refractory prostate cancer and do not provide a marked survival advantage (2Dixon S.C. Knopf K.B. Figg W.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 73-91PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel agents for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Apoptosis is a morphologically and biochemically distinct form of cell death that occurs under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. Impaired apoptosis and defects in the regulation of the cell cycle are hallmarks that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. These events cause aberrant growth of cancer cells (3Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22042) Google Scholar). Since impaired apoptosis and defects in regulation of the cell cycle play central roles in the pathogenesis of cancer, the search is accelerating for novel agents that activate this machinery. There are many pathways that, when modulated, could stop a cell from dividing and induce cell death. Tubulin is the main component of the cytoskeleton and is essential to cell division. Disorganized microtubule formation prevents cell cycle progression and is a potent signal for apoptosis. Clinically used anti-microtubule drugs generally fall into two main groups. One group, which includes vinca alkaloids, inhibits microtubule polymerization. The other group, including taxanes, stabilizes microtubule polymerization. These microtubule-targeted drugs arrest cell cycle progression in mitosis by influencing microtubule function and have potent clinical activity in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (4Rowinsky E.K. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 353-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 5Earhart R.H. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 8-13PubMed Google Scholar). The consequence of disrupting microtubule organization with these drugs appears to be the same: G2/M phase arrest in dividing cells and induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by anti-microtubule drugs are associated with a variety of signal pathways. These include, but are not limited to, phosphorylation of Bcl-2, phosphorylation of Cdc25C, and expression of survivin. Alterations of several kinase pathways, including p34cdc2, Ras/Raf, protein kinase C/protein kinase A, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and caspase cascades have also been reported (6Wang L.G. Liu X.M. Kreis W. Budman D.R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 7Bhalla K.N. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9075-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Natural products have been potential sources of novel anti-cancer drugs over the last few decades (8Mann J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 9Tang W.C. Hemm I. Bertram B. Planta Medica. 2003; 69: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Many synthetic compounds have been based on key structural features of the bioactive compounds isolated from herbal plants. Indeed, the discovery of taxanes and vinca alkaloids in natural products has contributed significantly to cancer treatment. New drug targets regulating microtubule dynamics have recently emerged. Many new microtubule-targeted drugs are in clinical trials, and most compounds have been discovered in large scale screening of natural products (10Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar). Dictamnine, a natural alkaloid, was isolated from the root wood of Zanthoxylum simulans (11Chen I.S. Wu S.J. Lin Y.C. Tsai I.L. Seki H. Ko F.N. Teng C.M. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 237-239Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and has been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation and show anti-insect and vasorelaxing effects (12Yu S.M. Ko F.N. Su M.J.

In a recent study, dictamine was reported to induce cytotoxicity in human cervix, colon, and oral carcinoma cells with a range of EC50 values within 2.5–20.6 μg/ml (16Wu T.S. Shi L.S. Wang J.J. Iou S.C. Chang H.C. Chen Y.P. Kuo Y.H. Chang Y.L. Teng C.M. J. Chin. Chem. Soc. 2003; 50: 171-178Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, some 4-anilinofuro[2,3-b]quinoline derivatives were synthesized from dictamnine and evaluated for their cytotoxicity in the NCI, National Institutes of Health, full panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (17Chen I.L. Chen Y.L. Tzeng C.C. Chen I.S. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2002; 85: 2214-2221Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In a previous study, 1-[4-(furo[2,3-b]quinolin-4-ylamino)phenyl]ethanone, called CIL-102, was the most active agent with new antiproliferative properties among 4-anilinofuro[2,3-b]quinoline derivatives. CIL-102 was efficacious against prostate cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, and breast cancer cell lines. However, the target and anti-cancer mechanism of this new compound is still unclear. In the present study, our aim was to elucidate the anti-cancer mechanism of CIL-102-induced effects in the metastatic androgen-refractory human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line PC-3 cells. Reagents—CIL-102 was synthesized as described previously (17Chen I.L. Chen Y.L. Tzeng C.C. Chen I.S. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2002; 85: 2214-2221Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and all other tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling apoptosis detection kits were from Promega (Madison, WI). Antibodies of Bcl-2, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Cdc2, cyclin B, Cdc25C, β-tubulin, Survivin, anti-mouse IgGs, and anti-rabbit IgGs were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody of anti-OxPhos complex IV subunit II was obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Antibody of caspase-3 was obtained from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Antibody of anti-α-tubulin was obtained from Serotec Products (Beverly, MA). Antibody of anti-MPM-2 was obtained from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Cell Culture—Human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3, LNCaP, and DU 145 cells (derived from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air. MTT Assay and Sulforhodamine B (SRB) Assay Methods—Cells were inoculated into 96-well microtiter plates and examined for cell proliferation and cytotoxicity using the SRB and MTT colorimetric assay as described previously (18Huang Y.T. Chueh S.C. Teng C.M. Guh J.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) after treatment with CIL-102, respectively. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded into an 8-well slide chamber the day before treatment. The analytic method was modified from the previous description (19Guh J.H. Hwang T.L. Ko F.N. Chueh S.C. Lai M.K. Teng C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Huang D.M. Guh J.H. Huang Y.T. Chueh S.C. Wang H.P. Teng C.M. J. Biomed. Sci. 2002; 9: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In brief, after the cells were incubated with CIL-102, they were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then cells were covered with 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min. Then cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with anti-β-tubulin antibody at 4 °C overnight. After the incubation period, cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody plus 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. The slides were washed twice with PBS and then examined by a Leica TCS SP2 confocal spectral microscope using a ×63 oil immersion objective to detect the presence of chromatin condensation/fragmentation as a marker of apoptosis. Approximately 100 cells were counted to calculate the percentage of changed cells. Flow Cytometry—Progression of cells through the cell cycle and cell apoptosis were examined using flow cytometry. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight, and washed once with PBS. After centrifugation, the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 0.5 ml of phosphate-citric acid buffer (0.2 m NaHPO4, 0.1 m citric acid, pH 7.8). For MPM-2 mitotic phosphoepitope expression, cells were centrifuged and labeled with 100 μl of anti-MPM-2 antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by the addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 °C. Then cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of propidium iodide solution (1% Triton X-100, 80 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 0.1 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A). For DNA content analysis, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of propidium iodide solution after the step incubation with phosphate-citric acid buffer. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, and the DNA content was analyzed using the FACScan and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Data were expressed as the percentage of MPM-2-positive cells in the entire population. Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity—A commercial assay kit (BioVison, Mountain View, CA) for detection of caspase-3 activity was used in this study. After the treatment of the indicated agent, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer on ice for a 10-min incubation. The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and supernatants were removed for the determination of caspase-3 activity. Proteolytic reactions were performed containing five cytosolic extracts and caspase-3 colorimetric substrate (DEVD-p-nitroanilide). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h, and then the formation of p-nitroanilide was measured at 405 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Western Blotting—Total cell lysate was lysed with lysis buffer as previously described (18Huang Y.T. Chueh S.C. Teng C.M. Guh J.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mitochondrial/cytosol fractionation kit (BioVison, Mountain View, CA) was used to isolate the enriched mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from treated PC-3 cells. Cell homogenates were diluted with loading buffer and boiled for 5 min for detecting cleavage, phosphorylation, and expression of proteins. For Western blot analysis, proteins (30–60 μg) were separated by electrophoresis in a 6–15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation at room temperature in PBS plus 5% nonfat milk for 1 h, the membrane was washed three times with PBS plus 1% Tween 20. Then the membrane was immunoreacted with mouse anti-human Bcl-2, survivin, AIF, Cdc25C, caspase-3, and caspase-8 monoclonal antibodies or the rabbit anti-human PARP, cyclin B1, p34cdc2 polyclonal antibody for overnight at 4 °C. After four washings with PBS plus 1% Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs (diluted 1:2000) were applied to the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). p34cdc2 Kinase Assay—A Cdk1/Cdc2 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used to determine the activity of p34cdc2 kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells exposed to CIL-102 were lysed with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 5% (v/v) protease inhibitors. Protein samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min and quantified. Then the lysates were harvested for immunoprecipitation at 4 °C overnight. Fifty μg of protein/immunoprecipitate were incubated with 400 μg/ml histone H1, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1:5 inhibitor mixture in assay dilution buffer (total volume 50 μl) at 30 °C for 10 min. A 25-μl aliquot of reaction mixture was transferred onto P81 paper. After washing three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone, cpm of γ-32P incorporated into histone H1 was monitored using a Miscellaneous LS 6000 TA liquid scintillation analyzer (Beckman Instrument Co., Taiwan). Analysis of Microtubule Polymerization in Vitro—The CytoDYNA-MIX ScreenTM3 (CDS-03) kits was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO) were used for the detection of polymerization of tubulin/microtubule. Tubulin proteins (>99% purity) were suspended (300 μg/sample) with 100 μl of G-PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm GTP, pH 6.9) plus 5% glycerol in the absence or presence of the test compound at 4 °C. Then the sample mixture was transferred to the prewarmed 96-well plate, and the polymerization of tubulin was measured by the change in absorbance at 340 nm every 1 min for 45 min (SpectraMAX Plus; Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) at 37 °C. Statistics and Data Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. for the indicated number of separate experiments. Statistical analysis of data was performed with Student's t test, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Effect of CIL-102 on Growth Regulation in PC-3 Cells—The antiproliferative effect of CIL-102 in PC-3 cells was measured by an SRB assay. CIL-102 induced a concentration-dependent inhibition with a GI50 of 54 nm (Fig. 1A). An MTT assay showed (Fig. 1B) that CIL-102 reduces cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1–3 μm). Furthermore, morphological examination of cells on culture plates revealed that CIL-102 caused PC-3 cells to round up, show cytoplasmic membrane blebbing, and die (data not shown). Apoptosis was detected in CIL-102-treated cells by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, using immunofluorescence microscopy; cells also showed chromatin condensation (Fig. 1C, right panel, roughly 75%), indicating the occurrence of apoptosis (control cells were negative; Fig. 1C, left panel). Labeling breaks in the DNA strand using in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling reaction assays also revealed that CIL-102-treated cells were dying due to apoptosis (data not shown). Thus, CIL-102 inhibits cell growth and induces cell death. Effect of CIL-102 on Cell Cycle—To examine whether CIL-102-induced growth inhibition was associated with cell cycle regulation, the cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. As illustrated in Fig. 2, CIL-102 caused accumulation of cells at 24 h in G2/M DNA content and a decrease in cells in G0/G1 DNA content. The accumulation of cells in G2/M DNA content was followed by an increase in hypodiploid (sub-G0/G1 phase) cells at later time points (48 h), indicative of apoptosis. Thus, CIL-102 induces cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Effect of CIL-102 on Microtubule Polymerization—Because CIL-102 caused marked cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, we investigated whether CIL-102 affects microtubule organization. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to examine the effect of CIL-102 on the microtubule cytoskeleton. Normal microtubule distribution in untreated PC-3 cells is shown in Fig. 3A. Treatment with vincristine resulted in inhibition of microtubule polymerization and the appearance of short microtubule fragments in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). In contrast, paclitaxel treatment resulted in maintenance of microtubule polymerization with an increase in the density of microtubules (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, CIL-102 treatment resulted in findings similar to those for vincristine-induced microtubule changes, and there was only a diffuse stain visible throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D). Because CIL-102 disrupted the microtubule organization in situ, we further examined whether CIL-102 binds directly to tubulin and affects tubulin formation in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4, purified tubulins were polymerized to steady state in the presence of GTP at 37 °C in control samples. In the presence of CIL-102 (1–30 μm), tubulin polymerization was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. For comparison, tubulin polymerization was completely inhibited in the presence of 10 μm vincristine, a microtubule polymerization inhibitor. These findings suggest that microtubule polymerization may be the primary target in CIL-102-induced anti-tumor effects.Fig. 4Effect of CIL-102 on microtubule assembly in vitro. Tubulin in reaction buffer was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of vehicle (Me2SO; DMSO) or the indicated concentration of CIL-102 or vincristine (10 μm), and microtubule assembly was then measured by spectrophotometry. Data are from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of CIL-102 on p34cdc2 Activity—It is well established that the p34cdc2-cyclin B1 complex regulates the mitotic phase switch of the cell cycle. Therefore, we examined the expression of cyclin B1 and the kinase activity of p34cdc2 in CIL-102-treated PC-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, there was no difference in p34cdc2 expression after CIL-102 treatment, but cyclin B1 was accumulated after CIL-102 exposure compared with the expression of Me2SO-treated at 12–24 h. It is well known that the kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinases is tightly controlled by the expression of cyclins (21Murray A.W. Cell. 2004; 116: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Since CIL-102 enhanced the expression of cyclin B1 protein, we determined the effect of CIL-102 on the activity of p34cdc2 kinase. Relative kinase activity was expressed as the kinase activity in treated cells compared with that in control cells. The p34cdc2 kinase activity was low in control cells and was significantly increased in cells treated with CIL-102 for different time periods, similar to paclitaxel (Fig. 5B). Thus, CIL-102 induces the up-regulation of cyclin B1 followed by increasing p34cdc2 kinase activity. Effects of CIL-102 on G2/M-regulated Proteins—We examined the status of phosphoproteins that are specifically recognized by MPM-2 antibody and found only in mitotic phase cells using flow cytometry (22Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5C, we found significant elevation in the percentage of the population of cells that was MPM-2 antigen-positive and the G2/M DNA content after 24-h treatment with CIL-102 or paclitaxel. We found ablation of the population by co-treating with olomoucine, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. Thus, CIL-102-induced mitotic phase arrest is mediated by p34cdc2-cyclin B1 complex activity. Moreover, similar changes in the migration of Cdc25C and Bcl-2 and expression of survivin were observed in PC-3 cells treated with the anti-microtubule drugs paclitaxel and CIL-102 for 18 h (Fig. 5A). CIL-102-induced migration of Cdc25C and expression of survivin were abrogated by olomoucine. Thus, activation of p34cdc2 is involved in CIL-102-induced mitotic phase arrest and alteration of cell cycle-related proteins. Involvement of Caspases in CIL-102-induced Apoptosis—Activation of caspases during apoptosis results in the cleavage and activation/inactivation of a range of critical cellular substrates, including the DNA repair enzyme PARP. Death induced by anti-mitotic agents has been reported to be associated with the activation of caspase-3-like proteases (7Bhalla K.N. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9075-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of CIL-102 on the activation of caspase-3 and PARP. To investigate the possible involvement of caspase-3 activation, the expression as well as enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, CIL-102 induced a concentration-dependent cleavage of procaspase-3 and PARP (Western blotting and quantitative caspase-3 activity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays). In contrast, no cleavage of the upstream initiator caspase, caspase-8, was detected after CIL-102 treatment (data not shown). Z-VAD-fmk, a general inhibitor of caspases, partly inhibited CIL-102-induced increases in sub-G0/G1 phase cells, suggesting that the activation of caspases is involved in CIL-102-induced cell death (Fig. 6C). Because the cell death induced by CIL-102 is only partly inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk, it is likely that a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway also contributes to CIL-102-induced cell death. AIF has been shown to translocate from mitochondria to the cytosol as well as the nucleus when apoptosis is induced and AIF is believed to mediate caspase-independent death, because inhibition of caspase activity does not abolish the proapoptotic action of AIF (23Cande C. Vahsen N. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the localization of AIF by Western blotting. We observed AIF release from mitochondria after CIL-102 treatment (Fig. 6D, lane 2). This event was also observed in paclitaxel and vincristine-treated PC-3 cells (Fig. 6D, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, CIL-102-induced apoptosis is mediated by both caspase and noncaspase pathways. Effects of CIL-102 in LNCaP and DU 145 Cells—To confirm that the anti-tumor effect of CIL-102 is caused by disruption of tubulin polymerization followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we tested other prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and DU 145 cells. The flow cytometry assay showed that CIL-102 caused accumulation of cells at 24 h in G2/M DNA content and followed by an increase in hypodiploid (sub-G0/G1 phase) cells at 48 h, indicative of apoptosis (Supplementary Data, Fig. S1A). Moreover, CIL-102-induced activation of caspase-3 is also detected by Western blotting (Supplementary Data, Fig. S1B). Furthermore, CIL-102 also affects microtubule organization in LNCaP and DU 145 cells as well as in PC-3 cells (Supplementary Data, Fig. S2). Taken together, CIL-102-caused cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis is presumably via interfering with microtubule polymerization in other prostate cancer cell lines. In the present study, we found evidence that CIL-102 causes its strong anti-cancer effects against hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells by dose-dependently binding to tubulin, inhibiting tubulin polymerization, and disrupting the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Despite the fact that the consequences of different anti-microtubule drugs is the same, these drugs may exert their effects on different dynamic aspects of tubulin polymerization and exhibit different spectra of anti-tumor activity. Accordingly, combinations of anti-microtubule drugs hold great promise of enhance activity against tumors that do not respond well to conventional anti-mitotic agents or may modulate tumor sensitivity to these agents without inducing side effects (10Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that CIL-102 has potent, broad spectrum antiproliferative activity in various cancer cell lines despite the P-glycoprotein multidrug-resistant or p53 status of these cells; this suggests that this novel anti-microtubule compound might have potential as a lead compound for treating drug-refractory cancers. In our study, we found that CIL-102 causes cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. It has been well established that the timing of cell cycle progression is regulated by the expression and/or activation of different classes of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and other regulators. Disrupting the regulation of these regulators could cause blockade of cell cycle progression and lead to programmed cell death (24Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). The formation of p34cdc2-cyclin B1 complex plays a key role in entrance into G2/M phase. We found that CIL-102 significantly increased the protein level of cyclin B1 but had no effect on the expression of p34cdc2. Because p34cdc2 activity is tightly regulated by the level of cyclin B1 protein, we examined the activity of p34cdc2 kinase. The kinase assay revealed that exposure of CIL-102 activated p34cdc2 kinase activity in a time-dependent manner, similar to paclitaxel. Emerging evidence indicated that anti-microtubule drugs, such as paclitaxel, vincristine, and estramustine, inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells by blockade of the cell cycle at G2/M phase, which involves the activation of p34cdc2 kinase via up-regulation of cyclin B1 (6Wang L.G. Liu X.M. Kreis W. Budman D.R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The pattern of CIL-102-induced activation of cyclin B1 and p34cdc2 kinase activity is consistent with the effects of these anti-microtubule drugs. In addition, CIL-102-induced mitotic phase arrest is significantly attenuated by CDK inhibitor. Therefore, CIL-102 induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase by increasing the activation of p34cdc2-cyclin B1 complex activity. Our results also show that in addition to directly disrupting microtubules and cell cycle regulators, such as p34cdc2, CIL-102 initiates a signal cascade resulting in the phosphorylation or expression of Bcl-2, Cdc25C, and survivin. Published observations suggest that changes in these proteins are consistent with cell cycle arrest in mitosis induced by anti-microtubule drugs (6Wang L.G. Liu X.M. Kreis W. Budman D.R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 7Bhalla K.N. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9075-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Although the process by which anti-microtubule drugs induce apoptosis is poorly understood, the effect of the Bcl-2 family proteins on membrane permeability plays a major role. It has been shown previously that apoptosis in various cancer cells exposed to anti-microtubule drugs can stimulate Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Several reports have demonstrated that Bcl-2 phosphorylation is required in Paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (25Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1253-1255PubMed Google Scholar, 26Blagosklonny M.V. Giannakakou P. ElDeiry W.S. Kingston D.G.I. Higgs P.I. Neckers L. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other reports showed that Bcl-2 phosphorylation is a common event in mitosis (27Ling Y.H. Tornos C. Perez-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18984-18991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 28Scatena C.D. Stewart Z.A. Mays D. Tang L.J. Keefer C.J. Leach S.D. Pietenpol J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30777-30784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Despite the controversy regarding the role of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in anti-microtubule drug-induced apoptosis, several studies have demonstrated that Bcl-2 phosphorylation can be specifically induced by drugs that affect microtubule depolymerization or prevent microtubule assembly. This effect is not seen with DNA-damaging agents (29Pratesi G. Perego P. Zunino F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additionally, disruption of microtubule structures and induction of apoptosis by anti-microtubule drugs have been associated with altering a variety of cellular signaling pathways, such as Ras/Raf, protein kinase C/protein kinase A, mitogen-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p34cdc2. These protein kinases have been reported to be associated with Bcl-2 phosphorylation (6Wang L.G. Liu X.M. Kreis W. Budman D.R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 7Bhalla K.N. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9075-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of these protein kinases in the anti-tumor effects of CIL-102 needs further investigation to link G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. CIL-102 induced phosphorylation of Cdc25C, and this event is inhibited by olomoucine. This indicates that CIL-102-induced activation of p34cdc2-phosphorylated Cdc25C completes a positive feedback loop. This is consistent with well documented studies indicating that Cdc25C can activate p34cdc2-cyclin B1 complex activity, and phosphorylation of Cdc25C is required for positive regulation by p34cdc2-cyclin B1 complex (30Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Survivin is an essential chromosomal passenger protein interacting with the inner centromere protein and Aurora-B kinase (31Altieri D.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8581-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that exposure of cancer cells to anti-tumor agents results in increased survivin expression (32Castedo M. Perfettini J.L. Roumie T. Andreau K. Medema R. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2825-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Carvalho et al. (33Carvalho A. Carmena M. Sambade C. Earnshaw W.C. Wheatley S.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) demonstrated that survivin is required for stable checkpoint activation in paclitaxel-treated HeLa cells. In addition, ablation of p34cdc2 kinase activity could inhibit survivin phosphorylation and result in loss of survivin expression (34Wall N.R. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Pommier Y. Altieri D.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 230-235PubMed Google Scholar). In our model, the increased survivin expression is observed in CIL-102-treated PC-3 cells, and this event is ablated by CDK inhibitors. Taken together, the increased survivin expression of CIL-102-treated PC-3 cells is associated with p34cdc2 kinase activity (consistent with previously published observations), and its accumulation in PC-3 cells may reflect drug interference with mitotic CDK-survivin-Aurora machinery. Emerging evidence indicates that evasion from apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer, and the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic agents have been associated with apoptotic pathways (3Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22042) Google Scholar, 35Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Caspase-3, which leads to cleavage and inactivation of key cellular proteins such as PARP, is thought to play a key role in apoptosis in many cells. In the present study, PARP cleavage was observed and accompanied by procaspase-3 cleavage intermediates, suggesting the activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk could only partly prevent the hypodiploid DNA content phase induced by CIL-102. These results suggest that a caspase-3-like protease is involved in CIL-102-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Nevertheless, apoptosis may proceed via both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways (36Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). For example, several chemotherapeutic drugs, including Ara-C, doxorubicin, vincristine, and paclitaxel, induce caspase cleavage and apoptosis in leukemia OCI-AML3 cells, but blocking of caspase activation by a pancaspase inhibitor did not prevent chemotherapy-induced cell death and did not inhibit or only partially inhibited mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, Smac, and AIF (37Carter B.Z. Kornblau S.M. Tsao T. Wang R.Y. Schober W.D. Milella M. Sung H.G. Reed J.C. Andreeff M. Blood. 2003; 102: 4179-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In our model, CIL-102 caused the translocation of mitochondrial AIF into the cytosol. This result might explain why the caspase inhibitor only partially rescued CIL-102-induced apoptosis. Indeed, the translocation of mitochondrial AIF into the cytosol induced by anti-microtubule drugs, arsenic trioxide and paclitaxel, has received more attention in recent studies. Arsenic trioxide has been reported to induce AIF release in myeloma cells (38Akay C. Thomas C. II I Gazitt Y. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 324-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and paclitaxel induces caspase-independent AIF-dependent apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma SKOV3 cells (39Ahn H.J. Kim Y.S. Kim J.U. Han S.M. Shin J.W. Yang H.O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hence, CIL-102-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells is mediated by both caspase and noncaspase proteases. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the anti-tumor effects of the recently described novel compound, CIL-102, in PC-3 cells are caused by direct disruption of tubulin polymerization followed by apoptosis. Cell cycle arrest is caused by p34cdc2-cycln B1, because the CDK inhibitor ablated the mitotic phase arrest. Although the signal cascades activated by CIL-102 still require further investigation, changes in Bcl-2 phosphorylation, Cdc25C phosphorylation, and survivin expression are similar to changes caused by other anti-microtubule drugs. In addition, CIL-102-induced apoptosis is mediated by both caspase-3-like and noncaspase protease cascade. We thank Prof. C.-L.

https://openalex.org/W1974054783,"βγ-Crystallin is a superfamily with diverse members from vertebrate lens to microbes. However, not many members have been identified and studied. Here, we report the identification of a putative exported protein from Yersinia pestis as a member of the βγ-crystallin superfamily. Even though calcium has been known to play an important role in the physiology and virulence of the Yersinia genus, calcium-binding proteins have not yet been identified. We have studied the calcium-binding properties of two of the three crystallin domains present in this putative exported protein designated “Yersinia crystallin.” These two domains (D1 and D2) have unique AA and BB types of arrangement of their Greek key motifs unlike the domains of other members of the βγ-crystallin superfamily, which are either AB or BA types. These domains bind two calcium ions with low and high affinity-binding sites. We showed their calcium-binding properties using various probes for calcium and the effect of calcium on their secondary and tertiary structures. Although both domains bind calcium, D1 underwent drastic changes in secondary and tertiary structure and hydrodynamic volume upon calcium binding. Domain D1, which is intrinsically unstructured in the apo form, requires calcium for the typical βγ-crystallin fold. Calcium exerted an extrinsic stabilization effect on domain D1 but not on D2, which is also largely unstructured. We suggest that this protein might be involved in calcium-dependent processes, such as stress response or physiology in the Yersinia genus, similar to its microbial relatives and mammalian lens crystallins. βγ-Crystallin is a superfamily with diverse members from vertebrate lens to microbes.

Calcium exerted an extrinsic stabilization effect on domain D1 but not on D2, which is also largely unstructured. We suggest that this protein might be involved in calcium-dependent processes, such as stress response or physiology in the Yersinia genus, similar to its microbial relatives and mammalian lens crystallins. Crystallins are the major structural proteins of the lens. Three major crystallins, α-crystallin, β-crystallins, and γ-crystallins, are known to be present ubiquitously in mammalian lenses (1Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). β- and γ-Crystallins share structural similarities and are classified together as βγ-crystallins (1Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Topologically, β- and γ-crystallins are made up of two globular domains; each domain consists of two Greek key motifs arranged as four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets. The domain of these proteins is referred to as the crystallin fold or βγ motif. Two types of Greek key motifs are described, “A-type” and “B-type,” which are present as either AB or BA combinations. The βγ, or Greek key, motif was found in several other non-lens proteins, and they were all classified as being within the βγ-crystallin superfamily. Some members of this superfamily are Protein S (2Wistow G. Summers L. Blundell T. Nature. 1985; 315: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), Spherulin 3a (3Wistow G. J. Mol.

Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These members show structural similarity despite relatively low sequence identity, which reflects the functional diversity found among these proteins. Two microbial homologues of βγ-crystallins, Protein S and Spherulin 3a, have been studied extensively (for review, see Ref. 12Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 435-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Protein S is a two-domain protein, whereas Spherulin 3a is one-domain protein present as a dimer. These proteins share the intrinsic thermodynamic stability of γ-crystallins. Under drastic conditions of starvation, desiccation, or heavy metal exposure, the slime mold Physarum polycephalum sporulates with a high level expression of Spherulin 3a (13Bernier F. Lemieux G. Pallotta D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, upon stress, soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus differentiates into spores protected by a spore coat containing a high level of Protein S (14Inouye M. Inouye S. Zusman D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both proteins are known to bind calcium at the homologous sites (15Bagby S. Harvey T.S. Eagle S.G. Inouye S. Ikura M. Structure (Camb.). 1994; 2: 107-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Clout N.J. Kretschmar M. Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The calcium-binding sites are located at the Greek key motif, as depicted in the schematic diagram (Fig. 1). The stability of these proteins is increased severalfold upon the binding of calcium, suggesting a calcium-dependent protective role of these proteins under adverse conditions (12Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 435-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Other than Protein S and Spherulin 3a, γ-crystallin and AIM1 are known to bind calcium ions (17Rajini B. Shridas P. Sundari C.S. Muralidhar D. Chandani S. Thomas F. Sharma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38464-38471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Rajini B. Graham C. Wistow G. Sharma Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4552-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas others, such as SKLP (5Ohki S.Y. Kariya E. Hiraga K. Wakamiya A. Isobe T. Oda K. Kainosho M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), WmKT (10Antuch W. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 1998; 282: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have not been shown to bind calcium. The calcium-binding property of members of this protein family is, thus, debated. It is, therefore, of immense interest and importance that new members be identified and analyzed for their calcium-binding properties. Rapid increase in the number of genomes sequenced in the recent past led us to look for more βγ-crystallin members. Because the genome sequence of Yersinia pestis was completed (19Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Thomson N.R. Titball R.W. Holden M.T. Prentice M.B. Sebaihia M. James K.D. Churcher C. Mungall K.L. Baker S. Basham D. Bentley S.D. Brooks K. Cerdeno-Tarraga A.M. Chillingworth T. Cronin A. Davies R.M. Davis P. Dougan G. Feltwell T. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Jagels K. Karlyshev A.V. Leather S. Moule S. Oyston P.C. Quail M. Rutherford K. Simmonds M. Skelton J. Stevens K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 2001; 413: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), we were interested in knowing whether microbial homologues of βγ-crystallins are present in this pathogen. Y. pestis is the causative agent of the dreaded disease plague. Yersinia genus consists of three species pathogenic to humans and animals, namely Y. pestis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Y. pestis is the most fatal of all three and has caused more numbers of deaths than any other disease (20Perry R.D. Fetherston J.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 35-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a threat because of its potential use as a bioweapons agent. It has been known for a long time that Y. pestis is unable to grow at 37 °C in calcium-depleted medium (21Higuchi H. Smith J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 605-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is known as a low calcium response. Loss of this property makes the bacterium avirulent. Calcium level also affects the physiology and metabolism of Y. pestis during growth at 37 °C (22Zahorchak R.J. Charnetzky W.T. Little R.V. Brubaker R.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 792-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fowler J.M. Brubaker R.R. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); still no calcium-binding protein from this pathogen has been identified. The calcium-binding microbial homologous of crystallins, if any, in Y. pestis, with analogy to microbial βγ-crystallins, could be a possible candidate for stress response encountered during the various phases of the life cycle in animals and humans. We, therefore, searched the genome sequence of Y. pestis CO92 and found a putative exported protein (locus tag YPO2884) and a hypothetical protein (locus tag YPO0466) as microbial relatives of βγ-crystallins, containing three and two βγ domains, respectively. In this context, we studied two of the three βγ-crystallin domains present in the sequence of a putative exported protein, which we refer to as “Yersinia crystallin.” Yersinia crystallin domains show novel Greek key motif combinations (AA and BB types), which have not been found in other crystallin domains. Our data showed that domains of Yersinia crystallin bind calcium with micromolar affinity. We report that calcium was required for the proper fold and stability of one of the domains. We also report the presence of a homologue and a paralogue of Yersinia crystallin that we have identified in this pathogen and another microorganism. Identification and Selection of βγ-Crystallin Domains from Y. pestis—Using γ-crystallin and other members of the crystallin superfamily as a template sequence, we performed a BLAST program (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72097) Google Scholar) search against the genome sequence of the Y. pestis strain CO92. The signature sequence YXXXX(F/Y)XG forms the beginning of a crystallin-type Greek key motif about 35 residues in length with a conserved Ser at about 34th position in a stretch of (D/N)XXS. The hits were scanned for the presence of crystallin signature sequence YXXXX(F/Y)XG. We obtained two proteins with genuine Greek key motifs occurring in pairs. These proteins were annotated as the putative exported protein (GenBank™ accession number NP_406389, locus tag YPO2884) and the hypothetical protein (GenBank™ accession number NP_404108, locus tag YPO0466). Two single domains of Yersinia crystallin, D1 (first) from residue 21 to 112 (92 residues) and D2 (second) from amino acid 110 to 215 (107 residues) were selected. Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was performed either using the web-based Swiss Modeler server (25Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4568) Google Scholar) or the three-dimensional PSSM fold recognition server (26Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The nearest homologue for D1 was the N-terminal domain of Protein S (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1nps) (24% identity and 56% similarity) (27Wenk M. Baumgartner R. Holak T.A. Huber R. Jaenicke R. Mayr E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the nearest homologue for D2 was Spherulin 3a (PDB code 1hdf) (32% identity and 49% similarity) (16Clout N.J. Kretschmar M. Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Region YRGNYPERKQS (137–147) of D2 was an insertion and could not be modeled. The initial coordinates generated were energy-minimized using 200 iterations each of steepest descent and conjugate algorithm on an Onyx work station (Silicon Graphics, Inc.) using the Discover module of InsightII software (Accelrys Inc.). The final model of D1 consisted of residues from Ala-2 to Ala-92, and the root mean square deviation at Cα atoms was 1.873 Å compared with the template structure. Similarly, the final model of D2 had residues from Lys-2 to Phe-104 and the root mean square deviation of 1.959 Å. The final models were evaluated using the PROCHECK program (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and 95% of the residues were found to be in the allowed region for D2; for D1, this was 94%. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of D1 and D2 Crystallin Domains—Genomic DNA of Y. pestis was a kind gift from Dr. S. Shivaji, Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology (29Shivaji S. Bhanu N.V. Aggarwal R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both domains D1 and D2 were amplified from the genomic DNA using PCR and cloned into an expression vector pET21a (Novagen) under T7 promoter. To facilitate fluorescence studies, we engineered a Trp residue at the penultimate amino acid position at the C-terminal end of D2. The cloned sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosytems ABI PRISM 3700). The expression constructs were transformed to Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The transformed E. coli cells were grown to mid-log phase and heterologous protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cultures were harvested after 3 h, and the cell pellet was stored at -80 °C. The cell pellet containing D1 in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; CD, circular dichroism; BAPTA, 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-acetic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. and 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was lysed by sonication, and the supernatant was loaded on a Q-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A without DTT and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bound protein was eluted using a gradient of 50–200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the protein were concentrated to 2 ml and loaded on a Sephadex G-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) (1.0 × 150 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm KCl and 1 mm DTT. The purified protein was decalcified using Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad)-treated buffer and stored in plastic ware at -80 °C. D2 was expressed as an inclusion body in the E. coli. After cell lysis in 50 mm imidazole-Cl (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA by sonication, the pellet was washed with the lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and then subsequently with Triton X-100-free buffer. The washed inclusion body was solubilized in lysis buffer containing 8 m urea and 5 mm DTT for 2 h. The solubilized inclusion body was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded on a Q-Sepharose FF column equilibrated in the same buffer. Under these conditions, protein bound to the column. After washing with the start buffer to remove unbound proteins, the column was washed with urea-free start buffer for refolding. The bound protein was then eluted with start buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. The eluted protein was further purified on a Sephadex G-75 (Amersham Biosciences) (1 × 150 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm KCl and 1 mm DTT. The protein was decalcified with Chelex-100-treated buffer. All the buffers used in the studies were treated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) to remove calcium. 45Ca Overlay Assay—The assay was performed as described earlier (30Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 50 μg of protein was spotted on a nitrocellulose paper and washed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.0) and 50 mm KCl. The blot was incubated in this buffer containing 1 μCi 45Ca (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 10 min at room temperature. The blot was then washed three times with 50% ethanol, air-dried, and scanned in a phosphorimaging device (Fuji FLA-3000). Determination of Macroscopic Binding Constants—Chromophoric calcium chelator BAPTA tetra potassium salt (Molecular Probes) was used to determine the macroscopic calcium-binding constants for the domains as described earlier (31Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chelex-100-treated buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm KCl) was used at 25 °C in a 1-ml quartz cuvette. Protein concentrations used were 20–30 μm. Aliquots from stock calcium solution were added, and absorbance at 263 nm was read in a Shimadzu UV-visible 1601 spectrophotometer. The titration data were analyzed using the Caligator software (32Andre I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which uses a Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear curve-fitting routine. The data were best fit to a two-site model. The macroscopic dissociation constants from the best fit to data were used. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer. The cuvettes were soaked in EDTA solution and were rinsed with Chelex-100-treated MQ-water (Millipore) and dried before use. The spectra were recorded in the correct spectrum mode of the instrument using excitation and emission band passes of 5 nm. All measurements were done at room temperature. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—Far- and near-UV CD spectra of both domains were recorded at room temperature on a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter using 0.01 and 1 cm path-length cuvettes, respectively. Secondary structure fractions from far-UV CD spectra were calculated using the CDPro software package (33Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2556) Google Scholar), which uses multiple algorithms and CDNN based on neural networks (34Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Terbium Binding—Terbium binding to both the domains was carried out on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 285 nm with band passes of 5 nm for both excitation and emission. The titration buffer consisted of 10 mm BisTris (pH 6.7) and 10 mm KCl. Dissociation constants of the protein for terbium were calculated by non-linear curve fitting to the following equation (35Drake S.K. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1753-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using the program Microcal Origin 6.0, F=(Fmax−Fmin)[Tb] f[Tb] f+Kd+Fmin where F, Fmax, and Fmin represent the fluorescence intensity at a given point, at saturation and without terbium, respectively. Tbf is the free terbium concentration at a given point, which was calculated using the following equation. Tb] f=[Tb] tot−[P](F−Fmin)(Fmax−Fmin)P is the total protein concentration. Hydrodynamic Volume—Hydrodynamic volumes of the domains were determined using a Superdex G-75 (Amersham Biosciences) column, calibrated using standard molecular weight markers. Each domain protein was run with EDTA or with calcium added to a final concentration of 1 and 10 mm respectively. The buffer used was 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT. EDTA was replaced with 10 mm CaCl2 for holoproteins. Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking—Glutaraldehyde (Sigma) was used for cross-linking studies. 100 μm of protein was exchanged to 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm KCl for cross-linking reaction. Final glutaraldehyde concentrations were 0.1 and 0.2%. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Unreacted glutaraldehyde was quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) at the end of incubation. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and the sample boiled for 5 min at 100 °C. The samples were analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Sequence Analysis and Identification of Yersinia Crystallins—We identified a putative exported protein (locus tag YPO2884) from Y. pestis strain CO92 as a member of the βγ-crystallin superfamily. This 806 amino acid protein has a 22 amino acid long secretion signal at the N-terminal, suggesting possible localization in periplasm. We identified six Greek key motifs in their N-terminal ends organized as three βγ-crystallin domains. The last two Greek key motifs are variants. This is the first multidomain microbial crystallin. The long C-terminal end of Yersinia crystallin shows probability for the presence of a coiled-coil motif (residues 533–566) (36Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3488) Google Scholar). Paralogue and Homologue of Yersinia Crystallin—We also found a paralogue and a homologue of Yersinia crystallin. Hypothetical protein (GenBank™ accession number NP_404108, locus tag YPO0466) from Y. pestis CO92 is a paralogue of this protein. Both proteins show 35.3% identity and 57.5% similarity. This protein also has a secretion signal. The fourth Greek key does not have the usually conserved Gly, which is replaced by Ala-180 (Fig. 2). We have found this pair of crystallin paralogues in the genome of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica (37Golubov A. Heesemann J. Rakin A. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2003; 38: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with minor variations and also in other strains of Y. pestis, namely strain 91001 (38Song Y. Tong Z. Wang J. Wang L. Guo Z. Han Y. Zhang J. Pei D. Zhou D. Qin H. Pang X. Han Y. Zhai J. Li M. Cui B. Qi Z. Jin L. Dai R. Chen F. Li S. Ye C. Du Z. Lin W. Wang J. Yu J. Yang H. Wang J. Huang P. Yang R. DNA Res. 2004; 11: 179-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and Kurdistan Iran Man (KIM) (39Deng W. Burland V. Plunkett G. II I Boutin A. Mayhew G.F. Liss P. Perna N.T. Rose D.J. Mau B. Zhou S. Schwartz D.C. Fetherston J.D. Lindler L.E. Brubaker R.R. Plano G.V. Straley S.C. McDonough K.A. Nilles M.L. Matson J.S. Blattner F.R. Perry R.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We have also identified a hypothetical protein (GenBank™ accession number CAG22738, locus tag PBPRB0866) having homology to Yersinia crystallin with two crystallin domains, in the genome of Photobacterium profundum, 2A. Vezzi, S. Campanaro, M. D'Angelo, F. Simonato, N. Vitulo, F. Lauro, A. Cestaro, G. Malacrida, B. Simionati, N. Cannata, D. Bartlett, and G. Valle, genome analysis of Photobacterium profundum revealing the complexity of high pressure adaptations; direct submission to the EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ data bases, 2004. a marine bacterium living at high pressure and low temperature (Fig. 2). It is likely that all these proteins had a common ancestor and evolved to their present form, because minor variations are found in the paralogous pair of genes in Y. pseudotuberculosis, from which Y. pestis has recently originated (41Achtman M. Zurth K. Morelli G. Torrea G. Guiyoule A. Carniel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14043-14048Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Unique Combination of Greek Key Motifs in Yersinia Crystallin—Two types of Greek key motifs have been described. They are called A-type and B-type motifs arranged as AB or BA. The arrangement of Greek key motifs is AA in D1 and BB in D2 (Fig. 2), which has not been reported in other crystallin domains. This combination of Greek key motifs is also found in the paralogue and homologue of Yersinia crystallin. All B-type motifs of Yersinia crystallin lack usually conserved Trp in the “a” strand, and the typical GDY patch of sequence is replaced by EDY, DLY, or IKY (Fig. 2). Molecular Modeling—Our attempts to crystallize these domains for structure determination failed, and therefore we could not pursue solving their three-dimensional structure. We built homology models of both of the domains. Modeled structures of D1 and D2 were typical of βγ-crystallin domain, having four anti-parallel β strands (Fig. 3). We calculated the secondary structure composition from our models using the MOLEMAN 2 software program, which indicated the prevalence of sheet (47 and 49%) and loop (46 and 47%) in D1 and D2, respectively, with the remainder constituting a helical region (5.5 and 3.2%, respectively). D2 has a short stretch of α-helix in the loop. Spherulin 3a also has a helical segment (GLNDVV from amino acids 43–48) in its first Greek key motif. A homologous sequence PLNDEV from amino acids 152–157 is present in this domain forming an α-helical stretch. It is seen that D1 and D2 share structural characteristics with βγ-crystallins from vertebrate eye lens. Cloning and Purification of Individual βγ-Crystallin Domains (D1 and D2) of Yersinia Crystallin—The domain D1 corresponding to 22–112 amino acids of Yersinia crystallin was cloned, expressed, and purified as a soluble protein of 10.5 kDa in E. coli (Fig. 4). The D2 domain corresponding to residues 110–215 of Yersinia crystallin was cloned and purified as a 12.7 kDa protein from inclusion bodies. We have also purified the domain D2 from soluble fraction for comparison, although the yield was very poor. The βγ-Crystallin domain is an independent fold, and there are many single domain proteins, such as SMPI, WmKT, and Spherulin 3a. As seen from sequence analysis, D1 and D2 appeared to have different features. To understand the properties at domain level, we studied them separately as they exhibited novel Greek key combination. Their domain-domain interaction and folding could have been affected in a multi-domain protein. Moreover, only single domain studies would establish that individual domains bind calcium, which could not have been ascertained from a two or three domain protein. To examine whether these domains bind calcium, we performed a number of assays for studying calcium-binding properties. Direct Calcium Binding to D1 and D2 by 45Ca Overlay Assay—We investigated calcium binding by dot-blot calcium overlay method (30Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Direct assay using radioactive 45Ca revealed that both domains, D1 and D2, bind calcium as shown in Fig. 5. Bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control and exhibited the anticipated results. This qualitative and simple assay confirmed that these proteins are calcium-binding crystallins and prompted us to further study their calcium-binding properties. Calcium Dissociation Constants of D1 and D2—We have determined the dissociation constants (kDa) of calcium for these domains using the chromophoric calcium chelator BAPTA. The titration data for both domains were best fit to a two-site model using Caligator software (32Andre I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both domains bind calcium in submicromolar and submillimolar range. There are high (K2 for D1 is 3.923 × 10–7m, and for D2, K2 is 9.504 × 10–6m) and low affinity site (K1 for D1 and D2 are 1.681 × 10–4m and 3.298 × 10–4m, respectively) in both domains (Table I). Such low and high affinity sites have also been described for Protein S and Spherulin 3a (27Wenk M. Baumgartner R. Holak T.A. Huber R. Jaenicke R. Mayr E.M. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2004812449,"Eukaryotic type IA topoisomerases are important for the normal function of the cell, and in some cases essential for the organism, although their role in DNA metabolism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we cloned Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase (topo) IIIα from an embryonic cDNA library and expressed and purified the protein to >95% homogeneity. This enzyme partially relaxes a hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid substrate consistent with other purified topo IIIs. A novel, covalently closed bubble substrate was prepared for this study, which topo IIIα fully relaxed, regardless of the handedness of the supercoils. Experiments with the bubble substrate demonstrate that topo IIIα has much different reaction preferences from those obtained by plasmid substrate-based assays. This is presumably due to the fact that solution conditions can affect the structure of plasmid based substrates and therefore their suitability as a substrate. A mutant allele of the Top3α gene, Top3α191, was isolated through imprecise excision mutagenesis of an existing P-element inserted in the first intron of the gene. Top3α191 is recessive lethal, with most of the homozygous individuals surviving to pupation but never emerging to adulthood. Whereas this mutation can be rescued by a Top3α transgene, ubiquitous overexpression of D. melanogaster topo IIIβ cannot rescue this allele.

Whereas this mutation can be rescued by a Top3α transgene, ubiquitous overexpression of D. melanogaster topo IIIβ cannot rescue this allele. DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes found in all cells and some viruses that regulate the topology of DNA in such cellular processes as replication, transcription, and recombination (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). These enzymes work by making a transient covalent bond to the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA, creating a protein mediated DNA gate, which allows another strand (or strands) of DNA to pass through this reversible break. Type II topoisomerases create double-stranded breaks, and double strand passage, whereas type I topoisomerases break a single strand of DNA. The type I topoisomerases are further divided into the IA and IB subfamilies, based on structural and mechanistic differences (3Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 4Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragon A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase III (topo III) 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; HNSC, hypernegatively supercoiled; PSC, positively supercoiled; GFP, green fluorescent protein. is a member of the type IA subfamily that is conserved from bacteria to humans. Topo III was originally purified by following superhelical relaxation activity from extracts of Escherichia coli containing a deletion for topo I (5Srivenugopal K. Lockshon D. Morris D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This enzyme was also independently purified based on its decatenating abilities in an assay utilizing plasmid DNA replication intermediates (6DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the strong sequence homology that this protein shares with E. coli topo I (7Tse-Dinh Y.C. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), purified topo III shows a weak ability to relax negatively supercoiled DNA (5Srivenugopal K. Lockshon D. Morris D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The relaxation activity of Topo III is strongly inhibited by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (5Srivenugopal K. Lockshon D. Morris D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the enzyme was subsequently shown to preferentially bind ssDNA. The decatenase activity of topo III also depends on the presence of single-stranded regions in the catenated DNA (6DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Nurse et al. showed that topo III serves as a decatenase in vivo by removing precatenanes that arise during replication of circular DNAs (8Nurse P. Levine C. Hassing H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8653-8660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results, combined with others, have lead to the thought that topo III is responsible for decatenating replication and possibly recombination intermediates. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TOP3 was discovered in a screen for mutants that enhanced the deletion of a marker flanked by repeated DNA sequences (9Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that TOP3 deletions result in hyperrecombination, impaired sporulation, and a slow growth phenotype (9Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Some of these phenotypes can be suppressed by mutations in SGS1, a member of the RecQ helicase family (10Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). This interaction between topo III and RecQ helicase proteins has since been shown to be a physical interaction that is conserved through evolution into higher eukaryotes (11Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2443-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), differing primarily in their long carboxyl-terminal sequences. These two isoforms show very high homology with each other, as well as bacterial topo I, topo III, and yeast topo III, through the first 600 amino acids of the sequence, hereafter referred to as the type IA core region. This region contains the four type IA topoisomerase domains along with the active site tyrosine (4Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragon A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although both the α and the β carboxyl terminal regions contain several potential zinc finger motifs, there is very little homology between the two. The carboxyl terminus of E. coli topo I shows some similarity to the α isozymes and has been shown to possess five zinc ribbon domains with the first three binding zinc (22Zhu C.X. Tse-Dinh Y.C.

Topo IIIα has been shown to be essential for embryogenesis in the mouse (28Li W. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas topo IIIβ deletions survive to adulthood, although they show a predisposition to tumors, a shortened life span, and reduced litter size (29Kwan K.Y.

Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that human BLM and topo IIIα can separate oligonucleotides joined by a very short (15-bp) double Holliday junction, an intermediate of homologous recombination (41Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). We have identified topo IIIα in Drosophila melanogaster and report here this protein's preferences for relaxation of a hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid substrate. We also prepared a new covalently closed DNA substrate that contains a single-stranded bubble, and we compared the activity of Dmtopo IIIα on this substrate with that on the hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid substrate. The importance of topo IIIα to fruit fly development was assessed through the isolation and study of Top3α191, a recessive lethal allele. Cloning the D. melanogaster Topoisomerase IIIα Gene—The Dm-Top3α gene was discovered in the D. melanogaster genomic DNA data base via homology searches. Oligonucleotides were designed to amplify a highly conserved region of the type IA core region of DmTop3α. This PCR product was used as a probe to screen a D. melanogaster embryonic cDNA library, which was prepared in our laboratory. A clone with a 3.9-kb insert that corresponded to the DmTop3α cDNA was isolated and sequenced (deposited in GenBank™ with accession number AF255733). Rescue of the Slow Growth Phenotype of a Δtop3 S. cerevisiae Strain with DmTop3α—The Top3α coding region was PCR-amplified from the above clone with a 5′ primer that included a Met-His6 coding sequence before the start codon. The product was digested and ligated into YEpG, placing it under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter, to make YEpGTop3α. Once the sequence was confirmed, YEpG and YEpGTop3α were transformed into JCW253, a Δtop3 derivative of FY251, using standard protocols. Transformants and the parental strains were grown in selective media overnight, and culture densities were adjusted to 1 × 107 cells/ml. 10-fold serial dilutions were made, and 1 μl of each was spotted onto nonselective plates containing either dextrose or galactose as the exclusive sugar source. The plates were incubated at 30 °C until the colonies were readily detectable (2–3 days). Purification of topo IIIα from yeast transformed with YEpGTop3α was explored, but expression levels were too low to make it feasible for biochemical studies. Preparation of an Anti-topo IIIα Antibody—Peptides TopoIIIα-1 (GIIQSIFQCPKCNEAPLALK) and TopoIIIα-2 (YEUUDVCRSIKPNISVYRAT) were synthesized using the multiple antigen peptide method (42Posnett D. McGrath H. Tam J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1719-1725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and injected into a rabbit using standard protocols. The peptides were covalently linked to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) amine reactive cross-linking resin using the anhydrous method provided with the resin. This column was used to affinity-purify the polyclonal antibody anti-TopoIIIα-1 from the rabbit's serum using standard methods. D. melanogaster Topo IIIα Expression and Purification—Topo IIIα was overexpressed using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) in Sf9 cells and purified using a cleavable N-terminal GST tag and a C-terminal decahistidine tag. The GST tag was PCR-amplified from pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using oligonucleotides that amplified from the start codon of GST to just after the recognition sequence for PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences). DmTop3α was PCR-amplified from its start codon to its C terminus, excluding the stop codon. The decahistidine tag followed by a stop codon was synthesized as two complementary oligonucleotides, and the three pieces were sequentially cloned into pFastBac1 and the sequence was verified to create pFBG-T3α-H10. This plasmid was developed into a baculovirus (bvG-T3α-H10) using the Bac-to-Bac kit protocols. Supernatants of transfections or amplifications of the baculovirus were assayed by dot blot using an anti-gp (64) monoclonal antibody (eBioscience) to detect the presence of baculovirus. Baculovirus titer was estimated by comparison of cleared supernatants with baculovirus of known titer. Four liters of Sf9 cells were infected at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml using an empirically determined amount of bvG-T3α-H10 (multiplicity of infection ∼2). The cells were harvested at 65 h postinfection and spun down at 550 × g for 10 min. All of the following steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C, and all buffers were prechilled and contained 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 80 nm aprotinin, 45 μm leupeptin, 3.6 μm bestatin, 1.5 μm pepstatin A, and 1.4 μm E-64. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.32 m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The nuclei were then pelleted at 1500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was decanted off of the nuclear pellet. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of nuclear resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 25% glycerol). 50 ml of nuclear extraction buffer (80 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.06% Triton X-100) was slowly added to the resuspended nuclei while stirring. 50 ml of DNA precipitation buffer (18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1 m NaCl) was slowly added with stirring, and the solution was incubated for 30 min on ice with stirring. The insoluble material was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The cleared supernatant was added to a pre-chilled bottle with 2 ml of glutathione resin (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-topo IIIα-H10 was allowed to batch bind at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle stirring. The glutathione resin with bound GST-topo IIIα-H10 was gently pelleted and washed twice in batch with 20 ml of glutathione wash buffer I (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Triton X-100). The resin was then washed once in batch with 20 ml of glutathione wash buffer II (glutathione wash buffer I at 150 mm NaCl) and then resuspended in 2 ml of glutathione wash buffer II. 30 μl of Pre-Scission Protease was added to the slurry, and the GST tag was digested off of the topo IIIα-H10 for 4 h at 4 °C. Following digestion, the slurry was loaded into a column, and the flow-through was collected. The resin was washed once with 2 ml of glutathione wash buffer II and then with 4 ml of GST eluate dilution buffer (glutathione wash buffer II at pH 8.8). The final pH of the collected flow-through and washes is ∼7.9, allowing it to be loaded directly onto equilibrated TALON Co2+ IMAC resin (Clontech). This column was washed with six volumes of IMAC wash buffer (glutathione wash buffer II at pH 7.9) and then eluted with IMAC elution buffer (IMAC wash buffer with 400 mm imidazole). Peak fractions were pooled, and bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs) was added to 0.25 mg/ml to help stabilize the topo IIIα. A mock was prepared at this time using bovine serum albumin and IMAC elution buffer. The topo IIIα and the mock were then dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 50% Glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at –20 °C. Topo IIIα concentrations were determined using densitometry of stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels using β-galactosidase (EIA grade; Roche Applied Science) as a reference. Immunoprecipitation of Endogenous Topo IIIα from S2 Cells—D. melanogaster S2 cells were grown in suspension using standard procedures. 3 × 109 S2 cells in midlog phase growth were pelleted at 550 × g for 10 min, and the media were discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 0.1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 80 nm aprotinin, 45 μm leupeptin, 3.6 μm bestatin, 1.5 μm pepstatin A, and 1.4 μm E-64) and incubated on ice for 15 min, and then the solution was homogenized gently with a Dounce homogenizer. NaCl was added to 350 mm with stirring, the solution was incubated on ice for 15 min, and the insoluble cell debris was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Topo IIIα was immunoprecipitated from 1 ml of this cleared supernatant with 10 μl of protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) and 7 μg of anti-TopoIIIα-1 using standard procedures. Preparation of the Substrates—Hypernegatively supercoiled (HNSC) plasmid substrate was prepared as described previously (17Wilson T.M. Chen A.D. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bubble substrate was prepared by annealing and linking the plus- and minus-strands of pBlueScript SK with ADP and Archaeoglobus fulgidus reverse gyrase, purified according to a published procedure (43Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When reverse gyrase is used with ADP as the cofactor, the enzyme relaxes a circular DNA rather than positively supercoiling it as it does with an ATP cofactor. Plasmids pBlueScript SK+ and pBlueScript SK–(Stratagene) were transformed into E. coli XL-2 MRF′ cells (Stratagene) and then infected with the helper phage M13K07 (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The phagemids were purified according to Lin et al. (44Lin T.C. Webster R.E. Konigsberg W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10331-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phenol/chloroform-extracted, and dialyzed against TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA). Equal amounts of the plus- and minus-strands were mixed together in a reaction containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.005% gelatin, 1 mm ADP, 50 μg/ml reverse gyrase, and 80 μg/ml total DNA. This reaction was incubated at 80 °C for 20 min, and then stopped with the addition of SDS to 1% and EDTA to 10 mm. The reaction was then extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol, and the DNA was redissolved in TE. The bubble substrate was then negatively supercoiled by using the same procedure used to make hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid substrate, except with half the amount of ethidium bromide. Positively supercoiled substrates were generated either by incubating relaxed substrates in the presence of ethidium bromide or by positively supercoiling the substrate with A. fulgidus reverse gyrase, using the reaction conditions given above except with 1 mm ATP as the cofactor. Topo IIIα Assays—Unless otherwise indicated, topo IIIα reactions contained 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.125 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.2 μg/μl substrate, and 10 ng/μl topo IIIα for plasmid substrate reactions. Bubble substrate reactions were the same except with 2 mm MgCl2 and 200 mm sodium acetate. The reactions were set up on ice by adding all of the components except the MgCl2 and the substrate. The reactions were started by adding MgCl2 and substrate and shifting the reaction to 37 °C. Reactions were incubated for 15 min unless indicated otherwise and then stopped with the addition of NaCl to 500 mm. After 5 min at 37 °C, DNA loading buffer (with SDS and EDTA) was added, and the reaction was diluted out 5-fold. Any reactions including ethidium bromide to positively supercoil the DNA, were stopped as described, extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and processed for loading onto an agarose gel. After electrophoresis, gels were then stained or destained as was appropriate and imaged with a UVP Bio-Chemi System and software. Isolation of Top3α191—Top3αEP2272 is an allele of Top3α in which a P-element is inserted 7 bases downstream of the first intron/exon junction. This allele is homozygous viable and does not have a detectable difference in the amount of topo IIIα produced. Top3α191 was created from this less severe allele via imprecise excision of the P-element inserted in the first intron of Top3α (45Engels W.R. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Eggleston W.B. Sved J. Cell. 1990; 62: 515-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The offspring were screened for the loss of the w+mC marker on the P-element. These white-eyed flies were then checked for the recessive lethality that we expected from a stronger allele of Top3α. The recessive lethal stocks were then tested for complementation with an Hsp70-promoted Top3α cDNA transgene. Stock 191 was rescued by the transgene, and the Top3α191 allele was sequenced. Creation of the HSP → Top3α and HSP → Top3β Transgenic Lines— The coding sequences of Top3α and Top3β were PCR-amplified from the appropriate cDNA clones. The cDNAs were then cloned into the multiple cloning site of pP{CaSpeR-hs/act}, placing them under the control of the Hsp70 heat shock-inducible promoter with the 3′-untranslated region of Actin5C. The P-elements were injected into w1118 flies, and transgenic lines were isolated and mapped using standard protocols. Rescue experiments were performed by crossing males of w–; Top3α191/CyO; P{HSP → Top3α (or β)}/+ to virgin females of w–/w–; Top3α191/CyO; +/+. The parents were removed from the vial after day 3, and the offspring were removed and scored daily until day 19. Time of Death for Top3a191—Top3α191 was placed over the balancer chromosome CyO, P{w+mC, GAL4-twi.G}2.2, P{UAS-2xEGFP}AH2.2, which marks larvae carrying the balancer chromosome with green fluorescent protein, thus differentiating heterozygotes from Top3a191 homozygotes. Note that the genotype of CyO/CyO dies as an embryo, so all of the fluorescent larvae are of the genotype Top3α191/CyO. This stock was crossed inter se, and the embryos were collected for 4-h intervals on grape juice plates. Approximately 36 h later, the plates were viewed with a fluorescent dissecting microscope, and the fluorescent and nonfluorescent larvae were counted and placed into separate vials with standard fly food. The vials were monitored daily and scored for pupation and eclosion of these two genotypes. Cloning of D. melanogaster Topoisomerase IIIα—To isolate and study the Top3α gene from D. melanogaster, primers were designed from the genomic sequence to amplify a region from the highly conserved type IA core region of the gene, and this PCR product was used to screen a D. melanogaster embryonic cDNA library. A clone was isolated that contained a 3.9-kb insert. This cDNA was sequenced, and it encoded a short 5′ untranslated region, an open reading frame, and a short 3′-untranslated region with polyadenylation signal. The genomic structure of the gene is shown in Fig. 1A. The Top3α gene is located on the left arm of chromosome 2 at the cytological location 34E. The gene is very compact, containing three small introns, each of which is less than 60 bp in length, a short promoter region, and a short intergenic sequence to genes neighboring either its 5′-end or 3′-end. The largest open reading frame of the cDNA encodes a 1250-amino acid protein with high overall similarity to human and mouse topo IIIα. Like the human and mouse homologs, D. melanogaster topo IIIα has a short, unconserved region at the N terminus of the protein, which contains"

We find that mutations in three of the four conserved sequence elements within the spacer alter enzyme activity, processivity, and/or DNA binding affinity. In addition, several mutations affect differentially DNA polymerase and exonuclease activity and/or functional interactions with mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Based on these results and crystallographic evidence showing that the template-primer binds in a cleft between the exonuclease and DNA polymerase domains in family A DNA polymerases, we propose that conserved sequences within the spacer of pol γ may position the substrate with respect to the enzyme catalytic domains.

The mitochondrion is the eukaryotic organelle that carries out oxidative phosphorylation, fulfilling cellular requirements for energy production. Disruption of mitochondrial energy metabolism can occur by genetic or biochemical mechanisms and is associated with human disorders including degenerative diseases, cancer, and aging (1Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). Mutations in both the mitochondrial genome and in nuclear genes whose products have mitochondrial functions are linked to mitochondrial disease syndromes.

Pol γ has also been shown to be a target of oxidative damage, which reduces DNA polymerase activity in the mitochondrial matrix (6Graziewicz M.A. Day B.J. Copeland W.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Pol γ is the only DNA polymerase known to be required for mitochondrial DNA replication in animals (7Kaguni L.S.

The interaction between DNA polymerase and template-primer DNA has also been revealed in molecular detail by structural determination of pol:DNA co-crystals and in biochemical studies. The pol domain comprises palm, fingers, and thumb subdomains that are separated from the 3′-5′ exonuclease (exo) domain by a cleft that binds the template-primer. Whereas the template strand lies along the cleft between the two domains, the 3′-end of the primer (or nascent DNA strand) shuttles between them during proof-reading DNA synthesis (18Joyce C.M.

Mitochondrial DNA polymerases have a conserved inter-domain region that we have termed the spacer region (7Kaguni L.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 293-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) that is not conserved in E. coli pol I or other members of the family A group such as bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase. The spacer region, which includes four γ-specific conserved sequence elements, is found in pol γs from yeast to humans (Fig. 1). Although the specific function of the conserved spacer sequences is not known, a missense mutation in the spacer region of Drosophila pol γ-α causes mitochondrial and nervous system dysfunction and developmental lethality in the larval third instar (24Iyengar B. Roote J. Campos A.R. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, hereditary progressive external ophthalmoplegia is associated with mutations in human pol γ-α, some of which map to the spacer region (5Van Goethem G. Dermaut B. Lofgren A. Martin J.J.

Here we examine the consequences of site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid sequences in the spacer region of Drosophila pol γ-α. Mutant holoenzymes were expressed from baculovirus constructs in insect cells, purified to near homogeneity, and characterized biochemically. Our results show that mutations in conserved amino acid sequences within the spacer region alter enzyme activity, processivity, and DNA binding affinity. In addition, several mutations affect differentially DNA polymerase and exonuclease activity and/or functional interactions with mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein, mtSSB. Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids—Unlabeled deoxy- and ribonucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences; for use at concentrations above 30 μm, nucleotide solutions were adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris base (Research Organics). [3H]dTTP, [α-32P]dATP, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from ICN Biochemicals. Calf thymus DNA (highly polymerized Type I) was purchased from Sigma and was activated by partial digestion with DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by Fansler and Loeb (27Fansler B.S. Loeb L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 29: 53-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Poly(rA)·poly(dT) was purchased from P-L Biochemicals and contained adenine and thymine in a molar ratio of 20:1, such that the average single-stranded DNA region between primers was 200 nucleotides. Recombinant and wild type M13 DNAs (10,650 and 6407 nt, respectively) were prepared by standard laboratory methods for use in DNA polymerase and processivity assays. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems model 477 oligonucleotide synthesizer.

Amino Acid Residues Important for DNA Polymerase Activity Are Distributed within the Spacer Region of Pol γ-α—To examine the role of the four conserved sequence elements, γ1–γ4, in the spacer region of the catalytic subunit of Drosophila DNA polymerase γ, we began by producing recombinant proteins carrying amino acid deletions in each of the conserved elements (Fig. 1). Mutant pol γ-α variants were co-expressed with wild-type pol γ-β in the baculovirus system, and the reconstituted holoenzymes were purified by phosphocellulose chromatography. Proteins were characterized by immunoblot analysis, and DNA polymerase activity was assayed on DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA and on poly(rA)·oligo(dT) (Fig. 2). Pol γ-αΔ413–470 (Δγ1) and pol γ-αΔ666–742 (Δγ4) were obtained in small amounts due to low solubility, and these mutants had barely detectable DNA polymerase activity. In contrast, pol γ-αΔ483–533 (Δγ2) and pol γ-αΔ536–581 (Δγ3) were expressed efficiently and were purified as soluble holoenzyme complexes associated with wild-type pol γ-β. The DNA polymerase activity of the Δγ3 holoenzyme was reduced greatly as compared with wild type, but that of Δγ2 was >80% of wild-type holoenzyme.Fig. 2Conserved sequence elements in the spacer region of Drosophila pol γγ-α are essential for holoenzyme assembly and activity. Deletion mutant constructs were generated for each γ-specific element, spanning the following amino acid residues: Δγ1, Δ413–470; Δγ2, Δ483–533; Δγ3, Δ536–581; and Δγ4, Δ666–742. The mutant pol γ-α proteins were co-expressed with pol γ-β in the baculovirus system, and the reconstituted pol γ was purified by phosphocellulose chromatography as described under “Methods.” A, proteins (25 μg of Fraction IIb) were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with subunit-specific antisera against Dm pol γ-α and -β. DNA polymerase activity of wild type (wt) and mutant pol γ was measured on DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA (B) and on poly (rA)·(dT) (C) and is presented in terms of specific activity.

Because structural information on pol γ-α is very limited, a secondary structure prediction algorithm (PredictProtein) was used to identify the positions of potential α-helices and β-strands in the spacer region, and this information was taken into consideration in the generation of triple and nested single alanine mutations that were introduced as substitutions for highly conserved residues in the γ1, γ3, and γ4 elements (Fig. 1). Mutant proteins were co-expressed with wild-type pol γ-β in the baculovirus system, and the reconstituted holoenzymes were purified to near homogeneity by phosphocellulose chromatography, followed by nickel-nitriloacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography and velocity gradient sedimentation. Proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE, DNA polymerase activity was assayed on DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA, and specific activities were determined (Fig. 3). The P556A/K557A/L558A (PKL) and G575A/W576A/F578A (GWF) mutations in γ3 and the S719A/Y720A/W721A (SYW) mutation in γ4 reduced DNA polymerase activity as much as 100-fold. In contrast, the Y419A/E420A/D421A (YED) mutation in γ1 and the K687A/D688A/F689A (KDF) mutation in γ4 resulted in DNA polymerase activities that were 60–80% of wild-type pol γ. Single alanine substitutions within the PKL and GWF triplets showed that the W576A mutant was nearly inactive, whereas the L558A and F578A mutants retained ∼50% of wild-type DNA polymerase activity, and the P556A, K557A, and G575A mutants had nearly normal activity. In composite, our deletion and amino acid substitution mutagenesis data indicate that amino acids important for DNA polymerase activity are distributed over a large portion of the pol γ-α spacer region. Spacer Region Mutants with Reduced Processivity—Standard gap-filling assays revealed that mutations in the pol γ-α spacer region have differential effects on DNA polymerase-specific activity. To examine the products of DNA synthesis by the mutant proteins in more detail, we assessed the relative processivity of the mutant polymerases. The processivity assay is carried out with excess oligonucleotide-primed M13 DNA under conditions that limit the initiation-dissociation cycle to one per holoenzyme molecule, and DNA product strand length is measured by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Mutants with very weak DNA polymerase activity on gapped DNA could not be evaluated in this assay. Among the mutants with measurable activity, pol γ-α L558A, F578A, YED, and KDF exhibited ∼60% of wild-type processivity, whereas that of mutants P556A, K557A, G575A and Δγ2 was nearly equal to that of wild-type holoenzyme (Fig. 4). Spacer Region Mutants with Altered Pol/Exo Activity Ratios—DNA polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities were measured on oligonucleotide-primed M13 DNA in the presence or absence of a 3′-terminal mispair, respectively. The ratio of polymerase to exonuclease activity was compared for wild-type and mutant pol γ holoenzymes (Fig. 5). Most of the mutant pol γs exhibited a lower pol/exo ratio than wild-type holoenzyme, suggesting that mutations in the spacer region have a larger negative impact on DNA polymerase activity than on 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. For example, the YED, PKL, L558A, GWF, W576A, F578A and KDF mutants demonstrated strong or moderate reduction of DNA polymerase activity and/or processivity, but they retained a nearly wild-type level of 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. The Δγ2, P556A, K557A, and G575A mutants demonstrated little or no reduction in either DNA polymerase or 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. However, the SYW mutant within γ4 retains barely detectable DNA polymerase activity (<1%) yet exhibits a 3-fold higher level of 3′-5′ exonuclease activity than wild-type holoenzyme. Spacer Region Mutants with Reduced DNA Binding Affinity—The effect of spacer region mutations on template-primer DNA binding was examined by gel mobility shift assay in comparison with wild-type pol γ. We find that DNA polymerase activity generally correlates with DNA binding activity (Fig. 6). The Δγ2, P556A, K557A, and G575A mutant holoenzymes have nearly wild type DNA polymerase and DNA binding activity. Mutants PKL, GWF, and W576A with very low DNA polymerase activity showed no detectable DNA binding activity. However, among the mutants with substantial DNA polymerase activity, L558A and F578A showed significantly lower relative DNA binding activity, whereas YED and KDF showed little apparent reduction in DNA binding as compared with wild-type pol γ. Interestingly, although the SYW mutant shows a 3-fold higher 3′-5′ exonuclease activity than wild-type holoenzyme, it exhibits a relatively low DNA binding activity. Defects in Functional Interactions between Spacer Region Mutants and mtSSB—Mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein stimulates initiation and elongation of DNA strands by wild-type pol γ and increases pol γ processivity (29Farr C.L. Wang Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14779-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Thommes P. Farr C.L. Marton R.F. Kaguni L.S. Cotterill S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Functional interaction between spacer region mutants and mtSSB were evaluated by assaying DNA polymerase activity in the presence or absence of mtSSB using oligonucleotide-primed M13 DNA as the substrate. The mutants PKL, GWF, W576A, and SYW that show strong defects in DNA polymerase function were not stimulated by mtSSB to a detectable level (Fig. 7). Mutants L558A and F578A with moderate defects in DNA polymerase function were stimulated moderately by mtSSB (4–5-fold lower stimulation than wild-type holoenzyme). The remaining mutants with nearly wild-type DNA polymerase activity, including YED and KDF with reduced processivity, were stimulated by mtSSB to approximately the same extent as wild-type pol γ. In this study, we examined Drosophila pol γ-α variants with deletion and base substitution mutations in each of the four conserved sequence elements in the interdomain spacer region. The mutants displayed widely varying biochemical characteristics (Fig. 8), with functional defects that affect predominantly the DNA polymerase activity of the holoenzyme, suggesting that the spacer comprises a functionally significant part of the polymerase catalytic domain. Furthermore, our results suggest that the conserved γ3 sequence element spanning amino acids 536–581 contributes substantially to pol function and may play a role in stable DNA binding during DNA synthesis. In contrast, no functional requirement for the conserved γ2 sequence element was identified, whereas the γ1 and γ4 elements were also found to contribute to pol function. One interesting mutant in the γ4 element was found to affect differentially pol versus exo function, exhibiting a significantly increased exo activity. In initial efforts to express and purify pol γ-α variants, it was evident that deletion mutants Δγ1 and Δγ4 had limited solubility when overexpressed in insect cells. In contrast, the remaining pol γ-α mutants in each of the four conserved elements were expressed efficiently and were reconstituted readily into pol γ holoenzyme complexes, including the 51-amino acid deletion mutant Δγ2. Thus, it appears that the γ1 and γ4 elements may either contribute some of the multiple sequence contacts that we have shown previously are involved in subunit interactions in the Drosophila pol γ holoenzyme (38Fan L. Kaguni L.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or they contain structural motifs that are important for the folding and/or the conformational stability of the catalytic subunit. Notably, the YED and KDF triple-alanine substitutions in the γ1 and γ4 elements, respectively, show reduced processivity, whereas they retain normal pol and exo function and exhibit normal levels of stimulation by mtSSB. One possible explanation might be that these mutants have altered interactions between the catalytic and accessory subunits, such that the enhanced processivity contributed by the accessory subunit is diminished. Pol γ-α mutants L558A and F578A within the conserved γ3 sequence element also show reduced processivity on a single-stranded DNA substrate. We would suggest that this derives from a different mechanism, because both these and the parent deletion mutant Δγ3 retain strong subunit interactions that are comparable with wild-type pol γ. One interesting possibility is that the reduced processivity of the L558A and F578A mutants is related to defective interaction with mtSSB, a factor that increases strongly both the activity and processivity of wild-type DNA pol γ (37Thommes P. Farr C.L. Marton R.F. Kaguni L.S. Cotterill S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39Williams A.J. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Notably, the stimulation of DNA polymerase activity on M13 DNA by mtSSB is reduced 4–5-fold in the L558A and F578A mutant holoenzymes as compared with wild type (6–7- versus 30-fold stimulation). In general, mutations in the pol γ spacer region that lowered significantly DNA polymerase activity also lowered DNA binding activity. However, the loss of DNA binding activity occurred without significant loss of exonuclease activity. Biochemical studies suggest that 5–8 base pairs of duplex DNA are covered by E. coli Klenow fragment when the primer terminus is in the pol active site (33Minnick D.T. Astatke M. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24954-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the co-crystal structure of an editing complex, the 3′ terminus is bound in the exo active site, whereas the duplex portion of the template-primer occupies the cleft between exo and pol domains similar to binding in the pol mode (18Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 40Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Importantly, the extent of single-stranded DNA binding in the 3′-5′ exo active site dictates that three or four base pairs of the duplex DNA must be melted before binding occurs (41Cowart M. Gibson K.J. Allen D.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 42Lam W.C. Thompson E.H. Potapova O. Sun X.C. Joyce C.M. Millar D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3943-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrates that a duplex DNA substrate binds much more tightly to the pol versus exo active site, and the presence of mismatched base pairs increases the binding of DNA to the exonuclease site (43van der Bailey M.F. Schans E.J. Millar D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 673-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although we show that our polymerase-defective mutants PKL, GWF, and W576A bind the duplex oligonucleotide substrate poorly, binding to the mismatched DNA substrate is clearly sufficient for these holoenzymes to hydrolyze efficiently a 3′-terminal mispaired nucleotide. The earlier study showed that the tip of the thumb subdomain in Klenow is important for template-primer DNA binding and enzyme processivity (33Minnick D.T. Astatke M. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24954-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); side chain changes in the thumb also affect the fractional occupancies of template-primer into the two active sites (44Van der Lam W.C. Schans E.J. Joyce C.M. Millar D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Likewise, amino acid substitutions in the spacer region of the catalytic subunit of pol γ may increase the partitioning of the 3′ terminus to the 3′-5′ exonuclease active site. In particular, the SYW mutant lies within the γ4 conserved sequence element that maps immediately adjacent to the pol active site motif A, a position comparable with the thumb subdomain of Klenow. The SYW holoenzyme retains only ∼1% of DNA synthetic activity and 30% residual DNA binding activity, yet its exonuclease activity is reproducibly 3-fold higher than that of wild-type pol γ. Given the relevance of mitochondrial mutagenesis to aging (7Kaguni L.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 293-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 45Trifunovic A. Wredenberg A. Falkenberg M.

In perforated patch clamp experiments we found that taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate depolarized pancreatic acinar cells. At low bile acid concentrations this occurred without rise in the cytosolic calcium concentration. Measurements of the intracellular Na+ concentration with the fluorescent probe Sodium Green revealed a substantial increase upon application of the bile acid. We found that bile acids induce Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent components of the Na+ concentration increase. The Ca2+-independent component was resolved in conditions when the cytosolic Ca2+ level was buffered with a high concentration of the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). The Ca2+-dependent component of intracellular Na+ increase was clearly seen during stimulation with the calcium-releasing agonist acetylcholine. During acetylcholine-induced Ca2+ oscillations the recovery of cytosolic Na+ was much slower than the recovery of Ca2+, creating a possibility for the summation of Na+ transients. The bile-induced Ca2+-independent current was found to be carried primarily by Na+ and K+, with only small Ca2+ and Cl– contributions. Measurable activation of such a cationic current could be produced by a very low concentration of taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate (10 μm). This bile acid induced a cationic current even when applied in sodium- and bicarbonate-free solution. Other bile acids, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, and bile itself also induced cationic currents.

Bile acids can get access to pancreatic acinar cells in certain pathological conditions either as a result of bile reflux into the pancreatic duct (due to blocked ampulla of Vater) or via interstitial leakage. Bile is considered a putative trigger of acute pancreatitis (1Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Namkung W. Sun A.Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Shin D.M. Muallem S. Lee M.G.

Other bile acids, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TC) and taurocholic acid, also initiated cytosolic calcium responses (10Voronina S. Longbottom R. Sutton R. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. J.

Furthermore, bile acids have been shown to increase membrane permeability to ions in a number of model cell lines (11Devor D.C. Sekar M.C. Frizzell R.A. Duffey M.E. J. Clin.

The membrane potential of pancreatic acinar cells is dependent on the activity of the Na+/K+ pump and is influenced by electrogenic transporters (e.g. Na+-amino acid co-transporters) and ionic channels (14Kidd J.F. Thorn P. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 441: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Matthews E.K. Petersen O.H. J. Physiol.

The ionic channels expressed in pancreatic acinar cells include Ca2+-activated non-selective cationic channels (permeable to Na+ and K+) (18Thorn P. Petersen O.H.

Bile acids were reported to enter into pancreatic acinar cells via an anionic HCO–3-dependent exchanger and a Na+-dependent co-transporter (1Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Namkung W. Sun A.Q.

The Na+/bile co-transporters have been shown to be electrogenic in hepatocytes (24Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Weisiger R.A. Scharschmidt B.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G478-G485PubMed Google Scholar) and ileal epithelial cells (25Weinman S.A. Carruth M.W. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34691-34695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, bile acids could potentially affect membrane voltage by activation/formation of ionic channels and by activation of electrogenic bile transporters. Activation of ionic conductances and the depolarizing effect on the transmembrane potential could be contributing factors to the pathological action of bile on pancreatic acinar cells. The electrophysiological effects of bile have not been characterized before in pancreatic acinar cells. This became a focus of our study. The largely unexpected results of this investigation are described below. Cell Preparation—Pancreata were obtained from adult mice (CD1) killed by cervical dislocation in accordance with the Animal (Scientific Procedure) Act of 1986. Pancreatic acinar cells were prepared by injecting 1 ml of 200 units ml–1 collagenase (Worthington Lakewood, NJ) and digesting for 16–17 min at 37 °C with constant agitation. After digestion the pancreas was agitated manually to release single cells or small clusters in solution. Cells were washed three times by centrifugation in standard Na-HEPES buffer. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C), and cells were used within 3–4 h after isolation. Solutions—The standard extracellular solution (Na-HEPES buffer) used for cell preparation and for perfusion of cells during experiments contained 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.13 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Sodium and potassium-free solutions contained 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+). In some experiments chloride was replaced by aspartate (Asp). During standard whole-cell recordings, the pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. In some experiments calcium was heavily buffered by the addition of 10 or 20 mm BAPTA and 2 mm CaCl2. In K+-free pipette solution, K+ was replaced by NMDG+; in Cl– low pipette solution KCl was replace by K-Asp. For perforated whole-cell recordings, the pipette solution contained 15 mm KCl, 100 mm K2SO4, 10 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The cells were placed on a cover glass coated with poly-l-lysine (0.01%), and the cover glass was attached to an open perfusion chamber. Solutions were perfused using a gravity-fed system. Patch Clamp Recording—The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to record currents from single pancreatic acinar cells. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, Kent, UK) and fire-polished. The pipettes had a resistance of 3 to 5 megaohms when filled with an intracellular solution (containing 140 mm KCl). Whole cell currents were sampled at 10 KHz using an EPS-8 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Pfalz, Germany). In the standard protocol the membrane voltage was clamped at –30mV, and voltage steps to +10mV (test potential) were applied for 50-ms durations twice per second. The averaged currents at the holding potential and the test potential were calculated. For investigations of current-voltage relationships voltage ramps were applied from –50 to +40 mV (the slope was 300 or 400 mV/s). In current clamp experiments we utilized the perforated patch mode; in these experiments amphotericin B was added to the patch pipette solution at a concentration of 300 μg ml–1. Measurements of Intracellular Sodium and Calcium Concentrations—To monitor changes of sodium concentration in the cells we initially attempted to use the cell-permeable forms of the indicators Sodium Green (Sodium Green tetraacetate) and SBFI (SBFI, AM). The intracellular distribution of the indicators in these experiments was not uniform with patches of the indicators found in the perigranular area. With this loading we did not manage to obtain the expected responses to applications of monensin, gramicidin, and ouabain. Loading of the cell-impermeant Sodium Green, tetramethylammonium salt (40–50 μm) through the patch pipette was much better; the distribution was uniform, and reasonable changes in fluorescence were observed. The fluorescence was monitored using the Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope. Sodium Green was exited by an argon laser line at 488 nm, and fluorescence was collected using a BP 505–550 emission filter. Sodium Green was calibrated in separate experiments conducted using a fluorimeter LS 50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The wavelengths of excitation/emission light were similar to that used in confocal experiments. To increase the concentration of Na+ in calibration solutions, NaCl was introduced into the solution in exchange for KCl. In our experiments the estimated dissociation constant of Sodium Green to Na+ (Kd = 23 mm) was similar to that reported by Molecular Probes (Kd = 21 mm) for the indicator in K+-containing solution (www.probes.com/media/pis/mp06900.pdf). We also attempted intracellular calibration of Sodium Green in the whole cell patch clamp configuration using gramicidin. In these experiments we recorded the expected changes of Sodium Green fluorescence but had difficulties in attaining a plateau of fluorescence for both sodium-free and high sodium solutions (possibly due to diffusion of Na+ into the patch pipette). We, therefore, used the results of the cell-free calibration for the estimations of rates of sodium change. The intracellular calcium concentration was measured with Fluo-4 dye. 3 μm Fluo-4 AM was loaded into the cell for 20–25 min at room temperature. The fluorescence of Fluo-4 was excited using the 488-nm laser line, and the emitted light was collected using a LP505 filter. Chemicals—Sodium Green tetramethylammonium salt and Fluo-4 AM were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, 2 Na (DIDS) was purchased from Calbiochem. TLC-S, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDC), TC, sodium salt of bile acid mixture from ox bile (BA), N-methyl-d-glutamine (NMDG) and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Fig. 1 shows an example of perforated patch clamp experiments (current clamp mode) in which we observed voltage changes induced by the bile acid TLC-S and by the calcium-releasing secretagogue acetylcholine (ACh). Amphotericin B was used as a perforating agent; this preserves the normal composition of the cytosol of the intact cell, since only very small molecules and monovalent ions can be exchanged through amphotericin pores. The resting membrane potential recorded from isolated acinar cells in our experiments ranged from –16 to –30 mV (n = 26), values expected for single isolated cells, that are usually somewhat depolarized (26Park M.K. Lee M. Petersen O.H. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The application of a low concentration of the bile acid (25 μm) induced a slow depolarization, whereas ACh applications produced oscillatory hyperpolarizations (Fig. 1A). ACh-induced hyperpolarizations are consistent with activation of the calcium-dependent chloride current (the reversal potential for Cl– under the condition of these experiments was approximately –35mV). The TLC-S-induced depolarization implies activation of Na+ or Ca2+-conducting channels. In experiments with a low concentration of TLC-S (25 μm) a slow depolarization was observed in 22 of 24 cells tested. The amplitude of TLC-S-induced depolarization ranged from 4 to 23 mV and tended to be higher in cells with a more negative resting membrane potential. In one out of these 22 cells the slow depolarization was preceded by an initial fast hyperpolarization (not shown), probably reflecting a cytosolic calcium concentration rise that could be observed sometimes even at this low concentration of the bile acid (10Voronina S. Longbottom R. Sutton R. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An example of the combined measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and membrane potential in the perforated patch mode is shown in Fig. 1B (representative of four experiments). The voltage change induced by the bile acid was clearly different from that triggered by the calcium-releasing secretagogue. Although ACh produced clearly-resolved calcium responses and hyperpolarizations, a low dose of TLC-S most frequently triggered depolarization and only a very small (if any) calcium response. We previously reported that higher doses of TLC-S induce calcium signals in the majority of pancreatic acinar cells (10Voronina S. Longbottom R. Sutton R. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In a perforated patch clamp experiment, application of 100 μm TLC-S triggered a complex response in which fast hyperpolarizing transients were superimposed on a slow depolarization (Fig. 1C, n = 4). We hypothesized that the bile-induced depolarization reflects calcium-independent activation of cationic, most probably Na+-permeable channels. One way to verify this hypothesis was to measure sodium changes induced by TLC-S. Changes of [Na+]c Induced by TLC-S— [Na+]c was measured using the indicator Sodium Green. We loaded the indicator into the cell through a patch pipette and conducted experiments in the whole cell mode, since loading with a cell-permeant form of this probe was ineffective (see “Experimental Procedures”). In experiments where cytosolic calcium was not buffered with BAPTA, we were able to record both current and sodium changes induced by TLC-S and ACh (Fig. 2, A and B). In these experiments we used equal Cl– concentrations in the patch pipette and in the extracellular solution; the chloride equilibrium potential should, therefore, be close to 0 mV. The calcium oscillations under this condition are reflected by transient activations of an inward chloride current (currents were recorded at –30mV). In the experiment shown in Fig. 2A, two components of the bile-induced sodium increase can be seen. The addition of 50 μm TLC-S induced a slowly developing inward current accompanied by a slow sodium concentration increase. Increasing the bile acid concentration to 100 μm produced oscillations of the inward current (which reflects calcium oscillations) and stepwise increases of [Na+]c. Sodium changes induced by ACh seem to follow calcium transients; each spike in [Ca2+]c is accompanied by a stepwise increase in sodium (Fig. 2B). It is interesting to note that during the ACh-induced oscillations and after removal of the agonist, the recovery of [Na+]c was much slower than the recovery of the calcium-dependent current. This provides an opportunity for the summation of sodium responses (Fig. 2B) and could result in sodium overload (if the [Ca2+]c spike frequency is too high). The kinetics of the current transients and [Na+]c changes strongly suggest that the sodium responses induced by ACh are calcium-dependent. The two components of the TLC-S induced [Na+]c changes could be interpreted as calcium-independent (the slow rise induced by a low dose of bile) and calcium-dependent (stepwise increases of [Na+]c during calcium transients). To reveal the calcium-independent component of the bile-induced sodium changes, we conducted an experiment in which [Ca2+]c was effectively buffered by a calcium chelator, BAPTA, added to the patch pipette solution (and used at a very high concentration, 10 or 20 mm). In this condition application of TLC-S induce an increase in Sodium Green fluorescence accompanied by an inward current in cells held at –30 mV (Fig. 2C). These experiments (n = 5) strongly suggest the existence of calcium-independent sodium influx and a calcium-independent cationic current. The properties of this TLC-S-induced calcium-independent current were further investigated. Na+/K+ Current—In the experiments described in this section we used high concentrations of the calcium chelator BAPTA (10 or 20 mm) in the patch pipette (similarly to the experiments described above and shown in Fig. 2C) to prevent activation of calcium-dependent currents. Even a very low concentration of TLC-S (10 μm) induced a measurable current (22 ± 5 pA, n = 14 recorded at –30 mV, see Fig. 3 and the left inset of A). Subsequent increases of the bile concentration to 25 μm and then to 100 μm produced further slowly developing increases of currents (inward at –30 mV and outward at +10 mV). The averaged amplitude of currents induced by different concentrations of TLC-S (recorded at –30 mV) are shown in the right inset of Fig. 3A. Removal of the bile acid resulted in recovery of the currents to the prestimulated values (Fig. 3A). The recordings at –30 and +10 mV were interrupted by ramp protocols at the indicated time points. The reversal potential for bile-induced currents was close to 0 mV (Fig. 3B). The current-voltage relationship was largely linear for the range of voltages used in our experiments. The results shown in Fig. 3 suggest activation or formation of non-selective cationic channels. To verify this hypothesis we carried out substitutions of Na+ with NMDG+ in the extracellular solution (Fig. 4A) and K+ with NMDG+ in the intracellular (patch pipette) solution (Fig. 4B). In the NMDG+-containing extracellular solution, application of TLC-S produced only a small inward current (most probably carried by NMDG+), and the amplitude of the inward current increased drastically when NMDG+ was replaced by Na+ (Fig. 4A, n = 15), suggesting that this current is preferentially carried by Na+. Substitution of K+ by NMDG+ in the intracellular (pipette) solution largely abolished the outward current recorded at +10 mV (Fig. 4B, n = 25), indicating that the outward current is mainly carried by K+.Fig. 4Effect of substitution of small monovalent cations with NMDG+ on bile-induced transmembrane currents. The Patch pipette solution contained 10 mm BAPTA to eliminate calcium-dependant currents. A, in sodium-free (NMDG+ containing) solution, the bile acid TLC-S induced only a small inward current, probably mediated by NMDG+ (lower trace). Substitution of bath NMDGCl with NaCl resulted in a strong rise of the inward current (lower trace) recorded at –30mV but had only a small effect on the outward current measured at +10mV (upper trace). B, comparison of TLC-S-induced outward currents (measured at +10 mV) in potassium-containing and potassium-free intracellular solution. The current traces were recorded in different cells. The upper trace shows the current recorded using standard patch pipette solution containing 140 mm K+. The lower trace depicts the outward current when K+ in the patch pipette solution was replaced by NMDG+; only a very small current can be recorded in these conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ca2+ and Cl– Currents—The possible contribution of Ca2+ to the TLC-S-induced inward current was examined by comparing the inward currents (produced in NMDG+-based solution) in the presence and absence of calcium. In these experiments we were able to resolve a small additional inward current (Fig. 5A) when an extracellular solution with a very high calcium concentration (40 mm) was introduced (n = 7). In these experiments we used a very high concentration of BAPTA in the patch pipette (20 mm) to prevent any intracellular [Ca2+] rise and activation of calcium-dependent currents. We were not able to resolve changes of the current when the extracellular calcium concentration was 10 mm (n = 6, not shown). TLC-S also induced a small Cl– current. Changes of Cl– concentration from 5 to 145 mm resulted in only a small change (Fig. 5B, representative of 14 cells) of the inward current recorded at –30mV. The notion that Cl– makes only a minor contribution to the bile-induced current was challenged when we found that DIDS (usually considered an inhibitor of Cl– currents) had a very strong inhibitory effect on both inward and outward currents triggered by TLC-S (Fig. 6A). However, TLC-S produced substantial currents in conditions when almost all Cl– in the intracellular and extracellular solutions was replaced by aspartate, and DIDS strongly inhibited this Cl–-independent bile-induced cationic current (Fig. 6B). Like TLC-S, other bile acids (TCDC and TC) induced calcium-independent currents (recorded using 10 mm BAPTA in patch pipette), although at higher concentrations than TLC-S. Fig. 7A shows currents induced by 100 μm and 250 μm TCDC. When added at a concentration of 100 μm, TCDC induced very slowly developing calcium-independent currents, and a subsequent increase of the bile acid concentration to 250 μm resulted in stronger activation of the currents (n = 4). TC applied at relatively high concentrations (0.5 mm followed by 1 mm) also induced calcium-independent currents (Fig. 7B, n = 5). Finally, we tested the ability of bile (mixture of bile acids extracted from crude ox bile) to induce calcium-independent currents. In these experiments we sequentially tested concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/ml. We found that bile at 0.1 mg/ml did not produce resolvable activation of currents, 0.25 mg/ml induced very small and slowly developing responses, and a higher concentration (0.5 mg/ml) induced substantial calcium-independent currents (Fig. 7C, n = 4). We report that bile acids induce Ca2+-independent currents mainly carried by Na+ and K+. The contributions of Cl– and Ca2+ to these currents are small. The activation of cationic current explains the depolarization of the cells recorded in current clamp experiments. The inward sodium current creates Na+ influx and increase [Na+]c, resolved in our experiments with the fluorescent indicator Sodium Green. This should also be accompanied by a loss of K+ from the cytosol of the cell. In a study on the T84 colonic cell line, Devor et al. (11Devor D.C. Sekar M.C. Frizzell R.A. Duffey M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) characterized the electrophysiological effects of taurodeoxycholate and taurocholic acid. The authors reported activation of K+ and Cl– channels. These channels were Ca2+-dependent; incubation of the cells with BAPTA-AM eliminated the currents through these channels (11Devor D.C. Sekar M.C. Frizzell R.A. Duffey M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pathway leading to activation of Cl– and K+ currents involved taurodeoxycholic acid-induced accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and calcium release from internal stores. Interestingly, this study also described a taurodeoxycholic acid-induced nonselective cation current that could be blocked by replacing Na+ in the extracellular solution with NMDG+. There are, however, some differences between the nonselective cationic current characterized by Devor et al. (11Devor D.C. Sekar M.C. Frizzell R.A. Duffey M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the one found in our study. The nonselective current described by Devor et al. (11Devor D.C. Sekar M.C. Frizzell R.A. Duffey M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in T84 cells was mediated by infrequent openings of very high conductance channels (channel openings were visible even in whole-cell experiments). This is clearly different from the current found in pancreatic acinar cells. There were other differences in kinetics and relative amplitude of bile-mediated cationic currents in T84 and pancreatic acinar cells (e.g. development of the cationic current was much slower in acinar cells, whereas the amplitude was larger). An important finding in the study of Devor et al. (11Devor D.C. Sekar M.C. Frizzell R.A. Duffey M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that is in complete agreement with our work (Ref. 10Voronina S. Longbottom R. Sutton R. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and this study) is that bile acids do not induce a leak of fluorescent indicators from the cytosol of the cells. Good retention of the small molecular weight fluorescent indicator in the cytosol indicates that the detergent effect of bile acids is minimal. It is possible that activation of Ca2+-independent cationic currents also occur in other cell types exposed to elevated concentrations of bile in pathological conditions. We conducted a preliminary investigation of the effect of TLC-S on voltage-clamped and BAPTA-loaded rat hepatocytes. We resolved a calcium-independent cationic current induced by application of 100 μm of TLC-S but had difficulties reversing this current by the removal of TLC-S (n = 4, not shown). The effect of TLC-S on hepatocytes and other cell types that could be exposed to this toxic bile acid deserves a separate detailed investigation. Two types of bile acid transporters were recently described in pancreatic acinar cells; they are a Na+-dependent co-transporter and a HCO–3-dependent exchanger. It is interesting to note that the outward potassium current in BAPTA-buffered cells develops effectively in a bicarbonate-free solution and in the complete absence of extracellular Na+. This suggests that Na+-dependent and HCO–3-dependent transports are not essential for activation of nonselective currents by TLC-S. In hepatocytes the amplitude of the current generated by the Na+/bile exchanger is only a few pA at a physiological membrane potential (24Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Weisiger R.A. Scharschmidt B.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G478-G485PubMed Google Scholar). This is much smaller than the amplitude of currents induced by TLC-S and other bile acids in pancreatic acinar cells. It is possible, therefore, that the small current of the exchanger is masked in our experiments by the much larger bile-induced cationic current. Our experiments also represent an important warning regarding measurements of the electrophysiological effects of the Na+/bile exchanger, since even small activation of nonselective cationic channels by bile acids could drastically affect such measurements. The development of substantial non-selective cationic currents should result in changes of ionic concentration and would inevitably put additional stress on the energy homeostasis of the cells. The bile-induced Na+ flux is substantial. Our estimations from experiments with Sodium Green show that the calcium-independent sodium influx results in an increase of [Na+]c by a few mm/min (e.g. ∼2 mm/min for the experiment shown in Fig. 2A and 8 mm/min for the one shown in Fig. 2C). Even more drastic sodium changes are observed during calcium oscillations. We found that during a single calcium transient [Na+]c can increase by more than 5 mm. Both the calcium-dependent and the calcium-independent sodium influx induced by bile acids should put a very considerable pressure on ATP turnover in the acinar cell. A decrease of the transmembrane sodium gradient could also have an adverse effect on sodium dependent transporters responsible for delivery of amino acids into the cell (27Iwatsuki N. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1980; 386: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or for regulation of ionic concentrations (28Brown D.A. Melvin J.E. Yule D.I. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2003; 285: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Muallem S. Loessberg P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12806-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Muallem S. Loessberg P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12813-12819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that for calcium-dependent sodium responses, the recovery of sodium transients is much slower than the recovery of the underlying calcium transients. This creates the possibility for summation of sodium transients and formation of a sustained elevated sodium level during calcium oscillations. This phenomenon is, however, beyond the scope of this paper and deserves a separate investigation. Another important effect of bile acids will be on fluid secretion. Bile-induced depolarization of the plasma membrane of pancreatic acinar cells, due to increased Na+ permeability, will inevitably decrease the driving force for Cl– efflux across the apical membrane into the luminal space. The decreased Cl– exit (and consequently water transport) into the luminal space will suppress the initial stage of transport of secreted enzymes through the pancreatic ducts. Retention of zymogens in the vicinity of the acinar cells could increase the probability of inappropriate activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreas. It is important to emphasize that TLC-S induces activation of Ca+-independent currents even when applied at a very low concentration; 10 μm concentrations of this bile acid are sufficient to produce measurable changes in current in the majority of cells. This concentration is almost 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that found in bile (31Cowen A.E. Korman M.G. Hofmann A.F. Cass O.W. Coffin S.B. Gastroenterology. 1975; 69: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hofmann A.F. Adv. Intern. Med. 1976; 21: 501-534PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, even minor reflux of this toxic bile component into the pancreas will most probably have deleterious effects on pancreatic functions. The low level of TLC-S, which has been found in this study to activate the Ca2+-independent current, is close to the concentrations of sulfated lithocholic acid conjugates detected in serum in different pathological conditions (33Cowen A.E. Korman M.G. Hofmann A.F. Turcotte J. Carter J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 698-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kuipers F. Bijleveld C.M. Kneepkens C.M. van Zanten A. Fernandes J. Vonk R.J. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1985; 20: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The concentration of TLC-S necessary to induce cationic current is even smaller than that required to trigger cytosolic calcium responses (in our previous work we found that a higher concentration of TLC-S (25 μm) produced calcium responses in only 11% of the cells tested) and similar to the threshold concentration that has been reported to induce transient mitochondrial depolarization (35Voronina S.G. Barrow S.L. Gerasimenko O.V. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27327-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of non-selective calcium-independent conductances could be one of the primary effects of bile on pancreatic acinar cells and could conceivably occur not only due to pancreatic reflux of the concentrated bile acid but also due to the action of bile accumulated at a much lower concentration in serum. The potency of bile acids in terms of their ability to induce non-selective current in BAPTA-loaded cells, decreased with increasing number of hydroxyl groups and a decrease of hydrophobicity. TLC-S was more effective than TCDC, which in turn was more potent than TC. This suggests that the mechanism of activation of the non-selective currents requires lipid partitioning of bile acids. However, trihydroxy (such as TC) and dihydroxy (such as TCDC) bile acids are present in bile at higher concentrations than monohydroxy bile acids (e.g. TLC-S) and could, therefore, make a substantial contribution to the total non-selective currents and membrane depolarizations in the case of interstitial leakage or bile reflux.

https://openalex.org/W2092468972,"β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG) is a bovine milk protein sensitive to thermal denaturation. Previously, we demonstrated that such structural change can be detected by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to denatured β-LG. In the present study, we show a dramatic increase in β-LG immunoreactivity when heating raw milk between 70 and 80 °C. To map out the specific epitope of β-LG recognized by this mAb, we used a combined strategy including tryptic and CNBr fragments, chemical modifications (acetylation and carboxymethylation), peptide array containing in situ synthesized peptides, and a synthetic soluble peptide for immunoassays. The antigenic determinant we defined was exactly located within the D strand (residues 66–76) of β-LG. Circular dichroic spectral analysis shows that carboxymethylation on β-LG not only resulted in a substantial loss of β-configuration but also exerted a 10 times increase in immunoreactivity as compared with heated β-LG. The result suggests that a further disordered structure occurred in β-LG and thus rendered the mAb recognition. Mutations on each charged residue (three Lys and one Glu) revealed that Lys-69 and Glu-74 were extremely essential in maintaining the antigenic structure. We also show an inverse relationship between the immunoreactivity in heated β-LG and its binding to retinol or palmitic acid. Most interestingly, pH 9–10, which neutralizes the Lys groups of β-LG, not only reduced its immunoreactivity but also its binding to palmitic acid implicating a role of Lys-69. Taken together, we concluded that strand D of β-LG participated in the thermal denaturation between 70 and 80 °C and the binding to retinol and palmitic acid. The antigenic and biochemical roles of mAb specific to D strand are discussed in detail. β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG) is a bovine milk protein sensitive to thermal denaturation.

Bovine β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) 1The abbreviations used are: β-LG, β-lactoglobulin; CM-LG, carboxymethylated-β-LG; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDB, Protein Data Bank; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; LDL, low density lipoprotein; CM, carboxymethylated. is one of the major proteins in milk consisting of about 10–15% (1Hambling S.G. MacAlpine A.S. Sawyer L. Fox P.F. Advanced Dairy Chemistry. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 141-190Google Scholar). Because of the thermally unstable and molten globule nature, β-LG has been studied extensively for its physical and biochemical properties (2Qi X.L. Brownlow S. Holt C. Sellers P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Sawyer L. Kontopidis G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The protein comprises 162 amino acid residues, with one free cysteine and two disulfide linkages (Fig. 1). According to the three-dimensional crystallographic studies, β-LG is predominantly a β-sheet configuration containing nine antiparallel β-strands from A to I (4Qin B.Y. Bewley M.C. Creamer L.K. Baker H.M. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14014-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 5Qin B.Y. Bewley M.C. Creamer L.K. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2541-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Topographically, strands A–D form one surface of the barrel (calyx), and strands E–H form the other. The only α-helical structure with three turns is at the COOH terminus, which follows strand H lying on the outer surface of the calyx (7Uhrinova S. Smith M.H. Jameson G.B. Uhrin D. Sawyer L. Barlow P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3565-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A remarkable property of the calyx is its ability to bind in vitro hydrophobic molecules such as retinol, fatty acids, vitamin D, and cholesterol (8Narayan M. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Qin B.Y. Creamer L.K. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B.

Biol. 2002; 318: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic studies have demonstrated that irreversible modification of the β-LG structure occurs upon thermal treatment above 65–70 °C. Thermodynamic analysis of the calorimetric signal reveals that there are two domains unfolding independently while heating (12Fessas D. Iametti S. Schiraldi A. Bonomi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5439-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The exact regions involved in the thermal denaturation are still unclear. Whether the subtle unfolding changes can be detected by an immunochemical approach remains a question. Regardless of intensive research, the biological function of this protein has not yet been satisfactorily resolved. Recently, we immunized the mice with commercially prepared dry milk and produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). From the 900 hybridomas screened, a clone specific to dry milk, but not to raw milk, has been selected. Characterization of this dry milk-specific mAb reveals that this antibody recognizes thermally denatured β-LG (13Chen W.L. Huang M.T. Liu H.C. Li C.W. Mao S.J.T. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2720-2729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It suggests that a new antigenic epitope in β-LG is being exposed by a heating process used in the preparation of dry milk. In the present study, we defined the immunoreactive site that was recognized by this specific mAb, and we attempted to relate it to the thermal denaturation properties of β-LG. The strategy for epitope mapping combined several approaches, including tryptic and CNBr fragments, chemical modifications (acetylation and carboxymethylation), peptide array containing in situ synthesized peptides (with overlapped regions), and a synthetic peptide in solution for immunoassays. We demonstrate that the epitope was located exactly within the D strand of β-LG (residues 66–76). The immunoreactivity as recognized by this mAb was correlated to the thermal denaturation and conversion of β-sheet to a disordered structure of β-LG. Most interestingly, the D strand is associated with the A–C strands forming one domain at the opening of the calyx (Fig. 1). For this reason, we also studied the effect of heating and pH on β-LG binding to retinol and palmitic acid. Further epitope mapping shows that conversion of Glu-74 into either Ala or negatively charged Asp totally abolished its immunoreactivity. A similar result was seen in Lys-69 but not the other Lys residues. Finally, we propose that strand D plays a provocative role in the molten globule state of β-LG as probed by our mAb. Materials—β-LG was purified from fresh raw milk using 30% saturated ammonium sulfate top fraction followed by a G-150 column chromatography as described previously (13Chen W.L. Huang M.T. Liu H.C.

Preparation of Monoclonal Antibody Specific to Dry Milk—Monoclonal antibodies were produced according to the standard procedures described previously by us (15Mao S.J.T. Rechtin A.E. Jackson R.L. J.

In brief, the myeloma cell line (FO) was fused with spleen cells from immunized BALB/c mice at a ratio of 1:5. The culture medium (between days 14 and 21 after fusion) was assayed for the production of specific antibodies by a solid-phase ELISA using both raw and dry milk as the respective antigen. Each monoclonal antibody was established by limiting dilutions at least two times (15Mao S.J.T. Rechtin A.E. Jackson R.L. J.

Trypsin and CNBr Fragmentation—For trypsin treatment, 50 μg of β-LG in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.02 m phosphate and 0.12 m NaCl, pH 7.4, were preheated at 100 °C for 10 min. After this, 1 μl of trypsin (0.1 mg/ml) was added and incubated at room temperature for 4 h (13Chen W.L. Huang M.T. Liu H.C. Li C.W. Mao S.J.T. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2720-2729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Trypsinized LG was analyzed on an SDS-PAGE (18% polyacrylamide) followed by a Western blot. For CNBr fragmentation (17Mao S.J.T. Gotto Jr., A.M. Jackson R.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4127-4131Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Mao S.J.T. Sparrow J.T. Gilliam E.B. Gotto Jr., A.M. Jackson R.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4150-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), 5 mg of β-LG were first dissolved in 70% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid with the addition of 10 mg of CNBr in the dark for 24 h at room temperature. After evaporating three times in a Speed Vac (CVE 200D, ELELA, Japan) with the addition of 5× volume of deionized water, the dry material was dissolved in the 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The immunoreactivity of CNBr fragments was then analyzed on an 18% SDS-PAGE, followed by a Western blot. Acetylation and Carboxymethylation of β-LG—Chemical modification of β-LG by acetylation was conducted by a modification of the procedure described previously by us (19Mao S.J.T. Sparrow J.T. Gotto A.M. Jackson R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To 5 mg of β-LG in 2 ml of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, containing 6 m urea, 5 μl of acetic anhydride were slowly added into the reaction mixture step by step, while maintaining the pH at 8.0 by using 0.1 m NaOH. After 3 h of incubation at room temperature, the acetylated protein was desalted on Bio-Gel P-2 column eluted by 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized. For carboxymethylation (19Mao S.J.T.

Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), 5 mg of β-LG were first dissolved in 5 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, containing 6 m ultra pure urea and 0.02 m dithiothreitol. Following flushing with nitrogen, 20 mg of iodoacetic acid were added into the reaction mixture, while maintaining the pH at 8.6 by the addition of 0.1 m NaOH, and were incubated for another 3 h. Finally, carboxymethylated (CM) β-LG was desalted on a Bio-Gel P2 column eluted by 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized. By amino acid analysis, the CM-β-LG contained 4.98 residues of CM cysteine per mol of β-LG. CD Spectrum—The secondary structure of native, heated, or chemically modified β-LG was determined using a computerized Jasco J-715 CD spectropolarimeter. Each protein sample was dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. About 300 μl of the protein solution were used for analysis within a cuvette of 1-mm path length. The obtained spectra were accumulated for 25 times at a scanning rate of 50 nm/min. All the data were shown as the mean residue molar ellipticity [θ]MRW (20Tseng C.F. Lin C.C. Huang H.Y. Liu H.C. Mao S.J.T.

Peptide Array—Twelve synthetic peptides in one nitrocellulose array, each containing 15 amino acid residues, were designed corresponding to residues 25–107 of β-LG or to residues 67–75 within strand D (Fig. 1). The synthetic peptides were prepared under a contract with Genesis Biotech Inc. (Taipei, Republic of China). Briefly, the peptides were directly synthesized in situ on a nitrocellulose paper according to the method described previously (22Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane in 0.01 m Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) was blocked with 5% (w/v) gelatin in TBST for 2 h at room temperature followed by washing three times. After incubation with mAb for 2 h and three washes, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in 0.5% gelatin/TBST was added and incubated. Finally, following the washes, the chemiluminescent substrate (ECL™ Western blotting System, Amersham Biosciences) was added, washed, and immediately developed by exposing onto a film. Competitive ELISA—In brief, heated β-LG (1 μgin50 μl of PBS) was first immobilized onto microtiter wells followed by three washes to remove unbound β-LG (13Chen W.L. Huang M.T. Liu H.C. Li C.W.

After three washes, 50 μl of the competitive protein (β-LG, heated β-LG, acetylated or carboxymethylated β-LG, or synthetic peptide residues 67–76) in PBS containing 0.3% gelatin were mixed with 50 μl of mAb and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following washes and secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP) incubation, the microtiter plate was developed with 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and read at 415 nm. Effect of pH on β-LG Binding to mAb—β-LG (1 μg/well) was immobilized onto a microtiter plate followed by blocking and washing at neutral pH. The immobilized β-LG was then incubated with mAb at various pH values for 2 h at room temperature. After removing the unbound mAb, the plate was developed according to the standard ELISA procedures at neutral pH (13Chen W.L. Huang M.T. Liu H.C. Li C.W. Mao S.J.T. J.

Because pH itself can affect the antigen-antibody binding, a control experiment using mouse IgG as immobilized antigen was also conducted at various pH values for a parallel comparison. Retinol and Palmitic Acid Binding to β-LG—β-LG was reported to be a 1 to 1 binding ratio with retinol or palmitic acid as measured by fluorescence emission techniques (24Yang J. Powers J.R. Clark S. Dunker A.K. Swanson B.G. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 5207-5214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In general, binding of retinol to β-LG was measured by extrinsic fluorescence emission of the retinol molecule at 470 nm using excitation at 287 nm. Binding of palmitic acid to β-LG was measured by the fluorescence enhancement of Trp residues of β-LG at 332 nm by using excitation at 287 nm. For the effect of the pH experiment, 5 or 20 μm of native β-LG was instantly incubated with 5 μm of retinol or 20 μm of palmitic acid, respectively, at various pH values at 24 °C. For the effect of the heat experiment, β-LG was pre-heated at 80 or 100 °C for 5 min and then incubated with retinol or palmitic acid at pH 8.0. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at 24 °C with a fluorescence Spectrophotometer F-4500 (Hitachi High-Tech Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

Li C.W. Mao S.J.T. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2720-2729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) show that the monoclonal antibody (mAb) used in this report is specific to processed dry milk but not to raw milk. It only recognizes β-LG, one of the major milk proteins. The mAb is apparently able to discriminate the denatured β-LG from a given milk product (13Chen W.L. Huang M.T. Liu H.C. Li C.W. Mao S.J.T. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2720-2729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because heating procedures are used to process the dry milk, the finding indicates that β-LG undergoes a conformational rearrangement, which facilitates the binding of this mAb. In the present study, we show a dramatic and sharp increase in β-LG immunoreactivity when raw milk was heated between 70 and 80 °C over time (Fig. 2). It was of interest that the increase in immunoreactivity was concomitant with the reported transition temperature for converting native to denatured β-LG (27de Wit J.N. Swinkels G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 624: 40-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding suggests that the immunoreactive site recognized by this mAb lies in the thermal denatured region of β-LG.Fig. 2Immunoreactivity of β-LG in raw milk heated at different temperatures over time. Immunoreactivity was monitored using an ELISA on raw milk heated at various temperatures. The increase in immunoreactivity of β-LG assessed by dry milk-specific mAb is correlated to the molten globule state of β-LG with a transition between 70 and 80 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mapping of Antigenic Determinant of Denatured β-LG Utilizing Tryptic Digestion and Acetyl Modification—To initially map out the specific immunoreactive region, heated β-LG was limitedly digested by trypsin. On Western blot, we demonstrated that the immunoreactivity was totally abolished after the trypsin treatment (13Chen W.L. Huang M.T. Liu H.C. Li C.W. Mao S.J.T. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2720-2729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that Lys, Arg, or both residue(s) were probably involved in maintaining the antigenic structure for β-LG. Chemical modification using acetylation (pH 8.0) on positively charged residues (mostly Lys) attenuated the immunoreactivity of β-LG on a competitive ELISA (Fig. 3A). These two experiments support the notion that positively charged amino acids of β-LG attributed for the mAb recognition. Immunoreactivity of CNBr Fragments of β-LG—To delineate further the major antigenic domain, CNBr cleavage on β-LG was conducted. Western blot analysis shows that there was a major immunoreactive fragment corresponding to a molecular mass of about 9 kDa (Fig. 3B). As estimated from its Met cleavage site, this fragment was presumed a peptide containing residues 25–107 (Fig. 1). Subsequently, the amino-terminal sequence of this fragment was determined. The first six amino acid residues (AASDIS) confirmed that the immunoreactive site was located between residues 25 and 107 of β-LG (Fig. 1). Final Antigenic Mapping Using a Solid-phase Peptide Array—As described above, Lys-enriched areas were assumed to participate in maintaining the antigenic structure. Pro residues are also considered to be involved as they are located at or near the antigenic determinant by forming a loop at the surface of a given protein. By using an EMBOSS program for searching a possible antigenic determinant within residues 25–107 of β-LG (Fig. 4), we predicted that two domains, namely residues 42–56 and 67–81, were most likely to be immunoreactive. Accordingly, a solid-phase peptide array containing the above predicted regions and 10 other overlapped synthetic peptides (each with 15 residues) was prepared. These peptides were directly synthesized on a nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 4). After binding of mAb and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, the array was developed by a chemiluminescent agent. We show that only peptides 4 (residues 70–84), 8 (residues 61–75), and 12 (residue 67–81) were immunoreactive (Fig. 4). Peptide 4 gave partial immunoreactivity, suggesting that residues 67–70 were essentially involved in the reactive site (Fig. 4). Because the size of an epitope is relatively small, usually containing 6–9 amino acid residues (16Mao S.J.T. Rechtin A.E. Krstenansky J.L. Jackson R.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 63: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Mao S.J.T. Yates M.T. Owen T.J. Krstenansky J.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 120: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Bhatnagar P.K. Mao S.J.T. Gotto A Jr M. Sparrow J.T. Peptides (Elmsford). 1983; 4: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 30Atassi M.Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), it was possible to narrow down the reactive site from the immunoreactivity in overlapped peptides. We proposed that the reactive site was closely associated with AQKKIIAEK (or nine residues 67–75) (Fig. 4). Notably, this region is highly positive in charges. By observing the high resolution crystal structure of β-LG (6Kuwata K. Hoshino M. Forge V. Era S. Batt C.A. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2541-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it is fascinating to see that this proposed region is exactly located within the D strand of surfaced β-sheet (residues 66–76) (Fig. 1). We therefore defined this immunoreactive site as an epitope. Another noticed point is that there is a disulfide linkage between strand D (Cys-66) and the carboxyl terminus (Cys-160). This disulfide linkage plays an important role in stabilizing the β-structure by forming antiparallel sheets of β-LG. The proposed epitope (residues 67–75) in its native state is rather ordered with a β-sheet span about 28 Å in length. As such, the orientation in native β-LG may prohibit the binding of our specific mAb. We hypothesized when the D strand underwent disordered structure, it would then allow the “denatured” mAb binding. Carboxymethylated β-LG and CD Spectrum—To test the above hypothesis by which the conformational change of the D strand would enhance the binding of our mAb, we chemically modified all the Cys residues to irreversibly block the disulfide linkages within the native β-LG (Fig. 5A). By using a competitive ELISA with heated β-LG as a positive control, it revealed that carboxymethylation on β-LG resulted in a striking increase in its immunoreactivity. The increase was about 10× greater than that of heated β-LG (Fig. 5B). Meanwhile, analysis of CD spectra on carboxymethylated β-LG further confirmed a significant conformational change by converting a β-sheet (typically at 215 nm) to a more disordered structure than that of heated β-LG (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Circular dichroic spectra of native β-LG, heated β-LG, carboxymethylated LG (CM-LG), and synthetic peptide 67–76. Samples at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were used for the study. A typical β-structure of native β-LG is shown at 215 nm. β-LG was heated at 100 °C for 5 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoreactivity of a Soluble Synthetic Peptide—Finally, a soluble peptide corresponding to the linear sequence of strand D (residues 67–76 or AQKKIIAEKT) was synthesized. Fig. 7 shows that this linear sequence was able to inhibit completely mAb binding to heated β-LG on a competitive ELISA. Furthermore, this synthetic peptide exhibited a typical disordered structure rather than a β-configuration (Fig. 6). Role of Charged Residues in Epitope Specificity—To determine which lysines were responsible for the mAb recognition, mutation on each Lys (Lys-69, Lys-70, and Lys-75) with Ala was conducted. As shown in Fig. 8, only Lys-69 was very specific for the mAb binding. Replacement with positively charged Arg did not salvage the immunoreactivity. Glu-74 played a similar role; replacement with Ala or negatively charged Asp failed to show any immunoreactivity. Ile-71 and Ile-72 also played an essential hydrophobic role, although the exact residue has not been identified. Meanwhile, negative control peptides (Fig. 8, peptides 11–12) retaining all the Lys residues did not show any binding. Effect of pH on β-LG Binding to mAb—Because the structural stability of β-LG is pH-dependent (31Casal H.L. Kohler U. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we tested whether changes of pH could also induce an increase in β-LG immunoreactivity. Fig. 9A shows that the CD structure of β-LG was stable at pH 2 with some changes between 3 and 7, whereas a transition to disorder was seen from 8 to 10. However, such a disordered structure did not facilitate the mAb binding (Fig. 9B). Because Lys-69 was essential (Fig. 8) and the overall positive charge of this residue started to become neutralized under pH 8–10, the immunoreactivity was decreased (Fig. 9B). A control experiment showing a typical pH-dependent antigen-antibody reaction was performed (Fig. 9C), and there was a slight decrease in immunoreactivity at pH 9–10. Effect of pH and Heating on β-LG Binding to Retinol and Palmitic Acid—To explore the correlation between the structural change of β-LG (at various pH) and its retinol binding, we monitored the extrinsic fluorescent change of retinol upon the binding to β-LG. The optimal binding for retinol appeared to be at pH between 8 and 10 (Fig. 10A). Heating β-LG at temperatures greater than 80 °C almost completely abolished its binding for retinol (Fig. 10B). The data support the notion that the striking increase in immunoreactivity of the D strand at this temperature (Fig. 2) was negatively correlated to the retinol binding, which requires the integrity of a β-sheet structure of β-LG. Most interestingly, the binding to palmitic acid was decreased to some extent at pH 9–10 (Fig. 10C), which correlated with the binding to mAb (Fig. 9B). Because Lys-69 played an very essential role in the antigenic site (Fig. 8), such correlation suggests that the protonated state of this residue might be involved in stabilizing both the mAb binding and β-LG-palmitic acid complex formation (see more details under “Discussion”). Similarly, heating on β-LG substantially reduced the binding for palmitic acid. Molten globules are thought to be general intermediates in protein folding and unfolding (32Ptitsyn O.B. Pain R.H.

https://openalex.org/W1969263585,"DNA polymerase λ contains template-dependent (DNA polymerase) and template-independent (terminal transferase) activities. In this study we enzymologically characterized the terminal transferase activity of polymerase λ (pol λ-tdt). Pol λ-tdt activity was strongly influenced by the nature of the 3′-terminal sequence of the DNA substrate, and it required a single-stranded (ss) DNA 3′-overhang of about 9–12 nucleotides for optimal activity. The strong preference observed for pyrimidine versus purine nucleotide incorporation was found to be due, at least partially, to a steric block imposed by the residue Tyr-505 in the active site of pol λ. Pol λ-tdt was found to be able to elongate a 3′-ssDNA end by two alternative mechanisms: first, a template-independent one resulting in addition of 1 or 2 nucleotides, and second, a template-dependent one where a homopolymeric tract as short as 3 nucleotides at the 3′-end could be used as a template to direct DNA polymerization by a looping back mechanism. Furthermore repetitive cycles of DNA synthesis resulted in the expansion of such a short homopolymeric terminal sequence. Most importantly we found that the proliferating cell nuclear antigen was able to selectively block the looping back mechanism while stimulating the single terminal nucleotide addition. Finally replication protein A completely suppressed the transferase activity of pol λ while stimulating the polymerase activity, suggesting that proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication protein A can coordinate the polymerase and the terminal transferase activities of pol λ.

Human pol λ (63.4 kDa) consists of a nuclear localization signal (residues 1–35), a BRCA1 C-terminal domain (residues 36–132), a proline-serine-rich region (residues 133–243), and a pol β-like core region (residues 244–575). The C-terminal part of pol λ (residues 244–575) is composed of a catalytic core that is similar to pol β (8-kDa domain and 31-kDa finger, palm, and thumb polymerization domain) and has 32% amino acid identity to pol β. Pol λ possesses multiple enzymatic activities, including DNA polymerase, terminal transferase, deoxyribose phosphate lyase, and polynucleotide synthetase, all localized in the C-terminal region containing the pol β-like core domain (2Ramadan K.

The fact that pol λ possesses both DNA polymerase and terminal transferase activity within the same active site raises the question of how these two activities are regulated. In the present work, we aimed to investigate in details the biochemical properties of pol λ-terminal transferase (pol λ-tdt) as well as the possible regulatory roles of the two auxiliary proteins, PCNA and replication protein A (RP-A).MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals[3H]dTTP (30 Ci/mmol), [3H]dCTP (18 Ci/mmol), [3H]dATP (73 Ci/mmol), [3H]dGTP (73 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences.

All the experiments were performed in triplicate. Error bars (±S.D.) are shown in the plots.RESULTSThe Terminal Transferase Activity of Pol λ Is Influenced by the 3′-End Terminal Sequence of the ssDNA Substrate—The activity of both cellular and viral terminal transferases have been shown to be influenced by the 3′-terminal sequence of the ssDNA substrate (26Vo N.V. Tuler J.R. Lai M.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10579-10591Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To verify whether this was true for pol λ, we analyzed 23 different oligonucleotides as substrates for pol λ-tdt activity. These oligonucleotides bear random sequences (Table I, oligos 1–10) or two particular subsets of DNA sequences such as triplet repeats AAC, AAG, AGG, AAT, (AAC)2, or AAAAAC (Table I, oligos 11–16) or telomeric sequences present in the G-rich and in complementary strands of human telomeres (Table I, oligos 17–23). As described previously, pol λ-tdt showed a strong preference for pyrimidine nucleotide incorporation; however, we found that the activity was also strongly influenced by the 3′-terminal sequence (2Ramadan K. Maga G. Shevelev I.V. Villani G. Blanco L. Hubscher U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Pol λ-tdt activity was maximal on the AAC, (AAC)2, and AAAAAC repeats (Table I, oligos 11, 15, and 16, respectively). Inspection of the sequences of the last nucleotides at the 3′-end of all 23 substrates utilized allowed the identification of a minimal consensus for optimal activity, which was (from position 0 to –4) RRYNC, RRRNC, or RYRNC where C is cytosine, R is a purine, Y is a pyrimidine, and N is any nucleobase (Table I). In particular, a strong discrimination against two adjacent pyrimidines at the –4, –3 and/or –3, –2 positions was noted.Table IActivity of pol λ-tdt on different oligonucleotide substratesaa Oligonucleotides 1–14 were 27-mers, oligonucleotides 15 and 16 were 30-mers, and oligonucleotides 17–23 were 24-mers. The first 18 nucleotides at the 5′-end of the sequence were identical for all substrates and were 5′-AGGATGTATGTTTAGGTA-3′. Highest activities are in bold. Sequences matching the consensus are underlined.b R, purine; Y, pyrimidine; N, any.c n.d., not determined.Pol λ-tdt Differs from Calf Thymus TdT in Nucleotide and DNA Substrate Specificities—Next we compared the activity of pol λ-tdt and calf thymus TdT on the triplet repeats (Table I, oligos 11–16) and the telomeric DNA sequences (Table I, oligos 17–23). As shown in Fig. 1A, the order of preference for terminal nucleotide addition on substrates 11–16 for pol λ-tdt was dT > dC > dA, but this activity was additionally influenced by the 3′-terminal sequence. Calf thymus TdT added dTTP with almost the same efficiency to the ssDNA oligonucleotides tested, thus showing no sequence preferences. When the activity of pol λ-tdt was next tested on telomeric substrates 17–23, an even stronger nucleotide and sequence specificity was observed (Fig. 1B). Pol λ was able to add specifically dATP to the sequence -AGGGTT (oligo 17) and dTTP to the sequence -TAACCC (oligo 23), while it was almost inactive on all other substrates tested. Calf thymus TdT, on the other hand, showed higher incorporation of dT and dC with respect to dA but did not display a significant preference for any telomeric sequences analyzed. Together these results suggested that the substrate selectivity observed for pol λ-tdt is an intrinsic feature of this enzyme that is not shared by the canonical TdT.Fig. 1Pol λ-tdt differs from calf thymus TdT in its nucleotide and DNA substrate specificity. A, terminal transferase reactions were performed as described under “Material and Methods” in the presence of 50 nm pol λ or 50 nm calf thymus TdT and a 4 μm concentration of each of ss oligonucleotide DNA substrates 11 (-AAC), 12 (-AAG), 13 (-AAT), 14 (-AGG), 15 (-AACAAC), and 16 (-AAAAAC) and in the presence of 2 μm labeled dTTP (light gray bars), dCTP (gray bars), and dATP (dark gray bars) for pol λ or 2 μm labeled dTTP (black bars) for calf thymus TdT. B, terminal transferase reactions were performed as described under “Material and Methods” in the presence of 50 nm pol λ or 50 nm calf thymus TdT and in the presence of a 4 μm concentration of each of the ss oligonucleotide telomeric DNA substrates indicated in the panel and in the presence of 2 μm labeled dTTP (white bars), dCTP (gray bars), and dATP (black bars) for both pol λ-tdt and calf thymus TdT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Pol λ-tdt Activity Requires a ssDNA Protruding 3′-End— The details of pol λ-tdt properties were further tested on the -AAC terminal sequence (substrate 11, Table I), which was used as a reference substrate for further characterization. The first objective was to test whether pol λ-tdt requires an ssDNA or whether it is able to utilize dsDNA blunt ends as does TdT or even 3′-recessed ends as does pol μ. Different complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to substrate 11 to create partially ds oligonucleotides with ss 3′-overhangs of decreasing lengths. Pol λ-tdt required a 3′-protruding ssDNA tract between 9 and 12 nucleotides for terminal addition (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–7). The same results were obtained with a truncated pol λ-tdt mutant lacking the BRCA1 C-terminal and Pro-rich domains at its N-terminal part (Fig. 2A, lanes 8–14), suggesting that the interaction with the ssDNA tract involves mainly the catalytic domain of pol λ. Since the product distribution indicated a distributive pattern with the main product of a single nucleotide addition, we next investigated the kinetics of the reaction. On the 27-mer ssDNA substrate (oligo 11), only a +1 product was formed within the first 5 min of the reaction, whereas a +2 product appeared only at later times (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–5). The same pattern was observed when the 27/15-mer substrate with a 12-nucleotide ss 3′-overhang was tested (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–10). This was consistent with a mechanism of single nucleotide addition following enzyme dissociation/reassociation until incorporation of the next nucleotide could occur.Fig. 2The pol λ-tdt activity requires a ssDNA 3′-overhang of 9–12 nucleotides. A, terminal transferase reactions for pol λ were performed as described under “Material and Methods” in the presence of a 50 nm concentration of each of the different 5′-labeled oligonucleotide substrates (27-mer, 27/15-mer, 27/18-mer, 27/21-mer, 27/24-mer, and 27/27-mer) bearing 3′-ssDNA overhangs of different lengths as indicated at the bottom of the panel. Reactions were carried out for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 μm dTTP with 50 nm full-length pol λ (lanes 2–7) or with a 50 nm concentration of the N-terminally truncated mutant pol λΔN (lanes 8–14). M, ss 27-mer oligonucleotide alone as marker. B, time course experiments for dTTP incorporation were performed in the presence of 50 nm pol λ and with 10 μm dTTP and a 50 nm concentration of 5′-end-labeled ss 27-mer DNA (oligo 11, Table I) (lanes 1–5) or a 50 nm concentration of 5′-end-labeled ss 27-mer DNA (oligo 19, Table I) but annealed to a labeled complementary 15-mer to generate a partially ds 27/15-mer (lanes 6–10). C, terminal transferase assays for pol λ were performed for 45 min at 37 °C as described under “Material and Methods” in the presence of 50 nm pol λ and a 50 nm concentration of the ss 27-mer (oligo 11) (lanes 1–4) or the partially ds 27/15-mer (lanes 5–8) DNA substrates in the presence of single nucleotides at a fixed concentration (lanes 1–8) or in the presence of the ss 27-mer DNA only and increasing concentrations of dTTP (lanes 9–11) or dGTP (lanes 12–14). wt, wild type; nt, nucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally the nucleotide substrate specificity of pol λ-tdt on this template was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2C, only dTTP, dCTP, and dATP were incorporated on the ss 27-mer (lanes 1–3) or the partially ds 27/15-mer (lanes 5–7), whereas dGTP was not (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 8). Titration of increasing dGTP concentrations showed that discrimination on this DNA substrate against its incorporation was almost absolute (Fig. 2C, lanes 12–14). Also dGTP was not incorporated on any of the substrates analyzed with the exception of oligo 23 as will be discussed later (Table I and see also below).The Nucleotide Substrate Selectivity of Pol λ-tdt Is Influenced by the Tyr-505 of the Polymerase Active Site—To investigate the molecular basis for the pyrimidine versus purine nucleotide discrimination by pol λ-tdt, the kinetic parameters for single nucleotide addition on the reference substrate (oligo 11, Table I) were tested. Under these conditions, the reaction followed a time-dependent biphasic curve with a fast rate (burst) corresponding to the first nucleotide addition followed by a slow steady-state rate likely determined by the dissociation of the enzyme and subsequent binding and addition of the second nucleotide (Fig. 3). The burst amplitude increased as a function of enzyme (Fig. 3A), nucleotide (Fig. 3B), and DNA substrate (Fig. 3C) concentrations. By using a mixed exponential kinetic model (see “Materials and Methods” for details), the kinetic parameters for the whole reaction pathway of dTTP and dATP addition were derived. The kinetic pathway is depicted in Scheme 1,Scheme 1, and the values are summarized in Table II. As can be seen, pol λ-tdt showed a nearly 6-fold higher efficiency (k3/KdNTP) for dTTP versus dATP addition. This resulted mainly from a combination of faster association (k2) and catalytic (k3) rates for dTTP, suggesting the presence of some steric barrier for dATP within the active site of pol λ-tdt. We have previously shown that the Tyr-505 of pol λ is part of the nucleotide binding site, a finding that has been subsequently confirmed by the resolution of the crystal structure of pol λ (20Shevelev I. Blanca G. Villani G. Ramadan K. Spadari S. Hubscher U. Maga G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6916-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By exploiting the mutant Y505A, we were able to demonstrate that removal of the side chain of Tyr-505 increased dramatically both the association (k2) and the catalytic (k3) rates for dATP addition, suggesting that this residue was responsible for the A versus T discrimination (Table II). As a result, the Y505A mutant showed a 13-fold preference for dATP over dTTP terminal addition. When pol λ-tdt was tested on telomeric DNA sequences, both the sequence and the nucleotide specificities were extremely selective since only two 3′-terminal sequences were recognized as substrates by pol λ-tdt, -GGGTT (substrate 17) on the G-rich strand and AACCC (substrate 23) on the complementary strand (Table I and Fig. 1B). Moreover the nucleotide addition specificity was almost absolute with only dTTP being incorporated on the TAACCC sequence (giving the product TAACCCT) and remarkably dATP on the GGGTT sequence (giving the product GGGTTA). Therefore, we wanted to investigate the reasons for this absolute substrate specificity. For this, the kinetic parameters for single nucleotide addition on the telomeric substrates 17 and 23 were determined (Table III). It can be seen that the preference for dATP on substrate 17 and for dTTP on substrate 23 was due to faster association (k2) and catalytic (k3) rates in both cases for the preferred nucleotide. Remarkably substrate 17 was slightly different from the optimal consensus sequence in that it has a T instead of a C at position 0 (see also Table I). When the same substrates were tested in the presence of the Y505A mutant, again the binding (k2) and the catalytic (k3) rates for dATP addition were increased with respect to the wild type enzyme on both substrates. However, the effect was less pronounced than in the case of substrate 11 (see Table II for comparison), suggesting that for the telomeric sequences examined also the DNA structure/sequence might play a major role in determining the nucleotide specificity. Taken together these results suggested that the residue Tyr-505 could act as a steric barrier for the large purine ring, whereas it facilitated accommodation of the pyrimidine nucleotides in the active site of the enzyme.Fig. 3Kinetic analysis of terminal nucleotide addition by pol λ-tdt.

This observation leads to a question concerning the conformation of the filament barbed end that might be recognized by specific actin-binding proteins. To try to detect possible new actin polymer conformations that might be intermediate in the pathway leading to mature F-actin, we monitored the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of yeast and muscle actins polymerized at pH 6 to accelerate the rate of filament formation. This allowed temporal resolution of the Pi release process from the slower process of polymerization. With both actins, we detected a biphasic instead of the usual monophasic fluorescence change, a rapid decrease that tracks with filament formation followed by a slower rebound (the second phase). This second phase postpolymerization conformational change requires Pi release and occurs nearly coincident with its release. The addition of Pi causes this second phase response to disappear, and the inclusion of Pi during polymerization prevents its appearance. At pH 7.5, with higher yeast actin concentrations to accelerate polymerization, a two-phase fluorescence change is also observed. In this case, the second phase change lags substantially behind Pi release. Pi release could also be resolved from polymer formation. V159N yeast actin, hypothesized previously as remaining in a postpolymerization ATP-like state, exhibits the same two-phase intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence behavior as wild-type yeast actin.

Together, these observations demonstrate the presence of an intermediate filament state between ADP-Pi and mature ADP-F-actin. Actin, a highly conserved and abundant protein in virtually every eukaryotic cell, plays an important role in a number of cellular processes, including cell structure determination, cytokinesis, locomotion, and the production of contractile force (1Pollard T.D. Earnshaw W.C. Schmitt W.R. Hacker H.N. Cell Biology. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia2002: 557-577Google Scholar). Participation of actin in the majority of these biological processes requires that it polymerize from its globular form (G-actin) into its filamentous (F-actin) form. In vivo, actin filaments are dynamic structures that constantly undergo cycles of polymerization and depolymerization in response to cellular needs. Actin binds a molecule of adenine nucleotide with high affinity in the central cleft separating the two domains of the protein (2Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). G-actin exhibits a slow ATPase activity that is enhanced by more than 3 orders of magnitude during polymerization (3Pollard T.D. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). With most actins and especially with muscle actin, subsequent to polymerization and ATP hydrolysis, the Pi is retained, creating an intermediate ADP-Pi state prior to its release to yield the ADP-bound form (4Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7789-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Melki R. Fievez S. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12038-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Hence, inside most eukaryotic cells, newly polymerized actin will be composed of either ATP- or ADP-Pi-actin subunits, and as the filament ages, this filament composition shifts to a mixture composed primarily of ADP-bound subunits with some ADP-Pi and only a few ATP subunits at the filament ends (6Carlier M.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An extensive body of evidence indicates that the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics depends on two major factors: 1) the hydrolysis of actin-bound ATP and subsequent Pi release and 2) a wide array of actin-binding proteins. Progression from one nucleotide-bound form to another has several functional implications for filament dynamics. First, ATP and ADP-Pi filaments have essentially equivalent stabilities, whereas ADP filaments are less stable (8Rickard J.E. Sheterline P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The addition of millimolar Pi or a phosphate analogue such as aluminum or beryllium fluoride to ADP-F-actin in vitro will force it back to an ADP-Pi state (9Combeau C. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the state of the bound nucleotide influences filament polarity. The barbed or plus end of the filament, enriched in ATP or ADP-Pi actin, has an approximate 10-fold lower critical concentration, the minimum concentration below which filament growth will not occur, than that of the pointed or minus end (11Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Therefore, under conditions in which the concentration of free actin monomers in solution is between the critical concentration of both ends of the filament, the rapid addition of ATP-actin to the barbed end will compensate for the release of the ADP-actin from the pointed end, resulting in the treadmilling of actin monomers through the filament (12Wegner A. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 108: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Because ATP hydrolysis is faster than Pi release for most actins, the rate of Pi release functions as an intrinsic timer for destabilizing the older end of the filament (6Carlier M.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This nucleotide-dependent filament stability must be reflected in nucleotide-dependent changes in actin conformation. Crystallographic studies of G-actin modified at the residue penultimate to the C terminus by the attachment of tetramethylrhodamine revealed structural differences between ATP- and ADP-actin, particularly in the loops bordering the bound nucleotide and in the DNase I loop in subdomain 2 of the protein (13Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 14Graceffa P. Dominguez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34172-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the case of the DNase I loop, there is an alteration of a 12-residue segment from an unstructured loop in the ATP-bound form to an α-helix in the ADP-bound form. Structural changes in subdomain 2 have also been observed by optical reconstruction of electron micrographs of muscle actin filaments formed under various conditions (15Belmont L.D. Orlova A. Drubin D.G. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Egelman and co-workers (15Belmont L.D. Orlova A. Drubin D.G. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have data suggesting that in newly formed actin filaments, the monomers are incorporated loosely in the filament in a more “tilted” and “open” conformation, creating filaments that look “kinked” or “ragged,” which then collapse into the more closed conformation observed generally with mature actin filaments. They also present results indicating that the conformation of the monomers that comprise the barbed and pointed ends of the filaments are structurally different (17Galkin V.E. Orlova A. VanLoock M.S. Shvetsov A. Reisler E. Egelman E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This result provides supporting evidence that the conformational changes linked to Pi release occur following F-actin formation. The dynamic equilibrium that exists between the monomeric and filamentous forms of actin inside cells is modulated by an extensive array of actin-binding proteins. These include capping proteins that control filament length and access to the two filament ends, nucleating proteins that initiate polymer growth, filament-severing proteins, and monomer-sequestering proteins that regulate the concentration of free G-actin. Several studies have demonstrated that many of these proteins are sensitive to the state of the actin bound nucleotide (11Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Profilin, a G-actin-binding protein that enhances nucleotide exchange, displays a higher binding affinity for ATP-actin than ADP-actin (18Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D.

Direct observation of the polymerization process reveals that there may be a preference for Arp2/3-dependent filament branching at or near the barbed end of an existing filament, suggesting that Arp2/3 may have a higher affinity for either ATP- or ADP-Pi-F-actin subunits versus ADP-F-actin (24Amann K.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) indicates that with yeast actin neither the ATP- nor the ADP-Pi state exists for any appreciable amount of time in actively growing filaments when polymerization is carried out at low actin concentrations. This observation is the opposite of the result observed with muscle actin under similar conditions in which an appreciable phosphate lag is observed between filament formation and Pi release (4Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7789-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Melki R. Fievez S. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12038-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This initial observation suggests that Arp2/3-dependent barbed end branching, at least in yeast actin, does not result from a higher affinity of the complex for ATP- or ADP-Pi-F-actin but from an immature ADP-actin conformation (ADP*) at or near the barbed end of the filament. Post-Pi release intermediate conformations prior to mature ADP-F-actin formation have yet to be observed in solution studies. The absence of this documentation may be the result, in part, of conditions in which actin polymerization is usually studied, consisting of dilute actin concentrations in which the rate of polymerization may be rate-limiting relative to the rate constants for subsequent isomerizations. In this study, using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as a probe of the conformation of actin subdomain 1, we utilized conditions that accelerated the rate of polymer formation to try to uncover the existence of such postulated intermediate filament states. Materials—DNase I (grade D) was purchased from Worthington. DE52 DEAE-cellulose was purchased from Whatman. Micro Bio-Spin P-30 Tris gel filtration chromatography columns and Affi-Gel 10-activated resin were purchased from Bio-Rad. N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide, ATP, and AMPPNP 1The abbreviations used are: AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate; PBP, phosphate-binding protein; MES, 2-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild-type. were purchased from Sigma. The EnzChek™ phosphate assay and ϵATP were purchased from Molecular Probes. All other compounds used were reagent grade quality. The A197C Escherichia coli mutant phosphate-binding protein (PBP) conjugated to N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide used in the Pi release assays was a generous gift from Dr. Howard D. White. The V159N yeast mutant constructed originally by Belmont and Drubin (28Belmont L.D. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was remade by Yao and Rubenstein 2X. Yao and P. A. Rubenstein, unpublished data. using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and oligodeoxynucleotides purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Actin Purification—Wild-type and mutant yeast actins were purified in the Ca2+ form using a combination of a DNase I affinity column and DEAE ion exchange chromatography followed by subsequent polymerization-depolymerization cycling according to Cook et al. (29Cook R.K. Sheff D.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in Ca2+ G-Buffer (2.9 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C. Wild-type actin was purified from commercially available yeast cakes. For the preparation of mutant yeast actin, yeast cells expressing the V159N mutant actin as their sole actin were grown in yeast extract (1%), bactopeptone (2%), and dextrose (2%) liquid media at 30 °C for 36–48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen prior to purification of the actin. Rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (30Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was stored at 4 °C in F-Buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% NaN3). Prior to use, the muscle F-actin was depolymerized by dialysis against at least three changes of G-Buffer followed by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C in a TLA 100.2 Beckman rotor at 75,000 rpm for 1 h using a Beckman TL100 instrument to remove any polymerized or denatured protein. The concentration of G-actin was determined from the ultraviolet absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.63 mg-1 ml cm-1. All actins were used within 4 days after the completion of purification. Actin Polymerization—Polymerization experiments were monitored using a Fluoromax-3 (Jobin Yvon, Inc.) fluorescence spectrometer containing a computer-controlled, thermostatted cuvette chamber set at a constant temperature of 25 ± 0.1 °C. Actin polymerization was triggered by the addition of F-salts consisting of a 159 volume of 120 mm MgCl2 and 3 m KCl to yield final concentrations of 2 and 50 mm, respectively. The total reaction volume was 120 μl. To assess polymerization by the change in light scattering, both the excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 360 nm, and slit widths were set at 1 and 2 nm, respectively. Actin was labeled at Cys-374 with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide according to Feng et al. (31Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and was combined with unlabeled actin at a ratio of 1 to 9. The polymerization-dependent increase in pyrene fluorescence was monitored by exciting the pyrene probe at 365 nm and following the change in pyrene fluorescence at 386 nm as a function of time. Slit widths were 1 and 2 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Assessment of the polymerization-dependent change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as a function of time was performed by using an excitation wavelength of 300 nm and monitoring the change in the emission of tryptophan fluorescence at 335 nm with slit widths of 1 and 3 nm, respectively. The fluorescent signal was recorded every 10 s, and the integration time for each point reading was 1 s. All polymerization experiments were performed in quartz microcuvettes at least three times with different actin preparations. pH Adjustment—Acidification of actin solutions to pH 6 was carried out by adding equal parts of a 2.9 mm Tris-HCl G-Buffer/actin solution, pH 7.5, to 4 mm MES buffer, prepared from an ultrapure grade free acid monohydrate solution, pH 5.65. Adjustment of the pH in the PBP assay at pH 6.0 was achieved by using the same scheme described above; however, the addition of 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.6, was added in place of an equal amount of 4 mm MES buffer, pH 5.65. The final pH before and after the addition of F-salts was verified using a pH meter equipped with an NMR pH electrode. Nucleotide Depletion—Unbound nucleotide and Pi were removed from the samples using Micro Bio-Spin P-30 Tris gel filtration columns that had been equilibrated with 2.9 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's specifications. Following depletion, the protein was kept on ice, and all nucleotide-depleted actins were used within 4 h. Pi Release from Actin—The rate of Pi release at pH 7.5 from polymerizing actin samples following ATP hydrolysis was assessed using the commercially available EnzChek™ phosphate assay at 25 °C (purine nucleoside phosphorylase). Briefly, this spectrophotometric assay utilizes the phosphorolysis of 6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside to ribose 1-phosphate and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine, the latter of which has a characteristic absorbance at 360 nm that is not shared by the nucleotide substrate at pH values greater than 6.5 (5Melki R. Fievez S. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12038-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Following induction of polymerization of 11.9 μm actin, the absorbance was monitored as a function of time, with readings taken automatically at 10-s intervals at 360 nm using a thermostatted cuvette holder set to 25 °C ± 0.1 °C. Because of the pH dependence of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase assay, we also monitored Pi release using the E. coli mutant PBP, constructed originally and characterized by Brune et al. (33Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 425 and 464 nm, respectively, and both excitation and emission slit widths were 1 nm. The increase in fluorescence of the PBP on binding to free Pi was recorded every 10 s, and the signal was averaged for 1 s. To decrease the initial background Pi levels, excess nucleotide and Pi were depleted as stated above prior to the initiation of actin polymerization. The final ratio of actin/PBP concentration was 11.9–110 μm, respectively. Under our conditions, the assay was linear up to 30 μm Pi based on standard curves, with all experimental conditions producing phosphate concentrations within this range. Again, these experiments were performed in a Fluoromax-3 fluorometer at 25 ± 0.1 °C using quartz microcuvettes. All experiments were performed at least three times with different actin preparations. Actin-dependent ATP Hydrolysis—Both the purine nucleoside phosphorylase and PBP assays can detect only free (unbound) Pi, not bound Pi. Therefore, the determination of the rate of ATP hydrolysis was accomplished by removing an aliquot from an F-actin mixture and rapidly denaturing the protein by chelating both Mg2+ and Ca2+ with a solution of 3 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm EGTA prior to exposing the protein to 100 °C for 1 min in preheated glass tubes. Immediately following thermal denaturation, the samples were cooled to 4 °C. The samples were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes and vortexed, and the remaining denatured protein was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min using an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. A fixed volume of the supernatant was removed from each tube, and the amount of total Pi was measured using either the EnzChek™ phosphate assay following adjustment of the pH to 7.5 or via PBP as described previously. Controls showed that free ATP was not substantially hydrolyzed under the conditions of the assay. Effect of Pi on Polymerization-dependent Change in Tryptophan Fluorescence—Polymerization of 11.9 μm actin was induced and monitored via the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as described above. Potassium monobasic phosphate, adjusted to the pH of the reaction, was added to an actin solution at a final concentration of 15 mm, either initially or following completion of polymerization. Data Fitting—The observed first-order rate constants for the second phases of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence curves were determined independently by fitting only the second phase of the unmanipulated polymerization curve with Bio-Kine (version 3.26, Bio-Logic SA) using the following equation. y=at+b+∑i=1Ncie−kit Parameters of the fit were minimized using the Simplex algorithm. After the first-order rate constant (ki) was obtained, the amplitude of the second phase (Δ2) was determined by extrapolating that portion of the polymerization curve back to t = 0. Both the average first-order rate constants and the average Δ2 values for the second phase were obtained from the sum of the individually calculated rate constants and the total change in magnitude of the second phase based on the values determined from the extrapolation along with the standard deviations. A two-sample Student's t test analysis was used to determine whether the rate constants were statistically similar or different. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Behavior of Polymerizing Yeast Actin—To accelerate actin polymerization relative to Pi release to determine whether we could temporally resolve the two processes, we carried out polymerization of yeast actin at pH 6.0 based on the previous work of Zimmerle and Frieden (34Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7766-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We examined polymerization using the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, which is characterized typically by a time-dependent decrease following induction of the process (35Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 358: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Frieden C. Du J. Schriefer L. Buzan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Yeast and muscle actins contain four tryptophan residues, all of which are located in subdomain 1. Doyle et al. (38Doyle T.C. Hansen J.E. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 427-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), using site-directed mutagenesis of yeast actin, demonstrated that the polymerization-dependent fluorescence decrease is the combined contribution of three of the four tryptophan residues, Trp-79, Trp-86, and Trp-340, all of which are near the nucleotide binding site in subdomain 1. Fig. 1A shows that the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence behavior on induction of polymerization of 11.9 μm WT yeast actin at pH 7.5 is characterized generally by a monophasic decrease in fluorescence as shown previously for muscle actin (35Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 358: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and yeast actin (36Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Frieden C. Du J. Schriefer L. Buzan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The small rapid initial increase in fluorescence we observed probably resulted from the conversion of Ca2+-actin to Mg2+-actin following the introduction of MgCl2 and KCl to initiate polymerization (35Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 358: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A method generally employed to assess filament formation is the change in fluorescence of a pyrene moiety attached to Cys-374. When we compared the polymerization-dependent changes in fluorescence of 10% Cys-374 pyrene-labeled actin and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, we observed that the rate of change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was somewhat faster than the change in pyrene fluorescence (Fig. 1B). This result suggested that the change in orientation of the pyrene probe on the flexible C-terminal arm occurred more slowly than the change in environment sampled by the tryptophan residues. Surprisingly, Fig. 2A shows that the polymerization-dependent change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence is very different at pH 6.0 compared with 7.5. At pH 6, there is a rapid decrease in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (first phase) followed by a slower rebound (second phase). To determine the relationship of each of these phases to filament formation, we compared the normalized polymerization-dependent tryptophan fluorescence change with that obtained using Cys-374-pyrene maleimide-labeled actin as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2B). For ease in comparison, we inverted the change in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence curve. The results indicated that the initial decrease in tryptophan fluorescence corresponded to filament formation as monitored by pyrene fluorescence. Kinetic analysis of the postpolymerization second phase change demonstrated a first-order process with an average apparent first-order rate constant, kobs, of 0.0059 s-1± 0.0017 (n = 11). To determine whether the biphasic fluorescence response was a general actin characteristic, we carried out similar experiments using rabbit skeletal muscle actin. Fig. 2C demonstrates that rabbit skeletal muscle actin displays a similar biphasic intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence response under similar conditions. The average kobs for the second phase of muscle actin was 0.0046 s-1± 0.0007 (n = 13), which was slightly but significantly smaller than that of yeast actin (p = 0.02). pH 6.0 Postpolymerization Pi Release—To determine the relationship between the second phase fluorescence change and Pi release following ATP hydrolysis, we assessed the effect of pH on Pi release. At pH 7.5, the Pi release and tryptophan fluorescence curves were superimposable (Fig. 3A). This lack of an appreciable lag between polymerization and Pi release was noted previously by Yao and Rubenstein (27Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At pH 6, however, Pi release was reproducibly slower than the polymerization-dependent first phas"

Fyn localizes to the cell body and processes and is the only active non-receptor tyrosine kinase in early oligodendrocyte development (18Osterhout D.J. Wolven A. Wolf R.M. Resh M.D. Chao M.V. J.

It has also been demonstrated that Fyn phosphorylates and binds p190 RhoGAP, and in that manner, regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation (20Wolf R.M. Wilkes J.J. Chao M.V. Resh M.D. J.

MAP-2c is expressed early in development, in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites; and in human fetal spinal cord is also expressed in the axon (8Riederer B. Matus A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We present biochemical evidence that tyrosine 67 (Tyr67) on MAP-2c is phosphorylated by Fyn creating a consensus motif (pYSN) for the binding of the SH2 domain of Grb2 that exists at low levels in the human central nervous system. In addition, we note that an indirect interaction between MAP-2 and the SH3 domains of Grb2 also exists. cDNA Constructs and Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—cDNAs from full-length Grb2-GST and GST protein without insert (pGEX vector) were obtained from Dr. Hamid Band (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA).

The eluted proteins were concentrated and buffer exchanged to 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol using the ultrafree-15 centrifugal device (30K, Millipore). Protein quantification was performed at 280 nm considering the respective His tag-MAP-2c extinction coefficients obtained at ProtoParam tool (ExPASy), and calculated according to the equation: A = ϵ c l, where A = absorbance at 280 nm, ϵ = extinction coefficient, c = concentration, and l = length of the cuvette. Mutagenesis—Mutations of tyrosine residues of human MAP-2c (accession number I67793) were made by PCR cloning as described under the QuikChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis kit instruction manual (Stratagene). The primers used to mutate either the first or second tyrosine residues (underlined) to phenylalanine on MAP-2c were: mut1 (mutation of Tyr-50): GCCAATGGATTCCCATTCAGGGAGGATGAAGAG (sense), CTCTTCATCCTCCCTGAATGGGAATCCATTGGC (antisense); and mut2 (mutation of Tyr-67): GGGTCACAGGGCACCTTTTCAAATACCAAAGAG (sense), CTCTTTGGTATTTGAAAAGGTGCCCTGTGACCC (antisense). The amplification protocol consisted of 18 cycles of the following conditions: denaturation for 0.3 min at 95 °C, although the first cycle was 0.6 min; primer annealing at 55 °C for 1 min; chain extension at 68 °C for 20 min, and an extra 20 min for the last cycle. The constructs were sequenced to verify the reading frames and the mutation sites. Heat-stable Protein Extractions—Heat-stable protein extraction of the in vitro kinase reactions was performed by adding NaCl (0.34 m final) and β-mercaptoethanol (0.28 m final) to the reaction mixtures, and boiling the samples for 5 min. Then, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were retained. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Bacterially expressed human His tag-MAP-2c (2 μg) was incubated with 0.2 units of Fyn kinase (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). The reaction conditions were performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol, in a reaction volume of 25 μl, either in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/reaction; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, NEG002A) and cold ATP (0.5 mm), or cold ATP only (0.5 mm). Although at 15 min MAP-2c was phosphorylated, the amount of radioactivity increased with time reaching a plateau at 90 min. Therefore, the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The samples were then placed on ice and mixed with 6× sample buffer (350 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 3% SDS, 60% glycerol, 1.7 m β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were then loaded either in a 10 or 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. When the kinase reaction was performed with [γ-32P]ATP, the gel was stained with Coomassie (0.25% Brilliant Blue, 45% methanol, and 10% acetic acid), de-stained (45% methanol and 10% acetic acid), vacuum dried, and exposed to Kodak Bio-Max MR film. The radioactive bands were cut, placed in a scintillation vial with 0.5 ml of water and 0.5 ml of Solvable (Packard Bioscience Company), and incubated at 50 °C for 3 h. Ten ml of scintillation fluid (Aquasol, DuPont) was then added to the vial, and incubated overnight at room temperature. The samples were counted in a β-scintillation counter (LKB, 1219 Rackbeta, Wallac). The final count/min values for all the His tag-MAP-2c were obtained after subtracting the Fyn only counts. Filter Overlay Assays—Proteins from the in vitro kinase reactions performed with cold ATP were loaded in a 10% SDS-PAGE. Following protein transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml GST fusion proteins in 5% milk, 1× TBS, washed 3 times (10 min each) with 1× TBS and 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with the anti-GST mAb DT-12 (1:500; 1.5 h at room temperature), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) goat antimouse IgG1 (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Visualization of immunoreactivity was by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Human Fetal Brain Homogenates—Fetal brain tissue (19 gestational weeks) was homogenized in extraction buffer at 3 times weight/volume, and centrifuged at 22,900 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was saved and the protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad protein assay). The brain protein homogenates were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. The Clinical Investigation and the Health and Hospital Corporation of the City of New York and the Institutional Clinical Review Committee approved all studies. Co-immunoprecipitations and Pull-down Assays—Frozen brain homogenates were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 250,000 × g at 4 °C for 25 min to eliminate association of MAPs with tubulin. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. For each immunoprecipitation (IP), 1 mg of the supernatant protein was adjusted to 1 ml with IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5% Triton X-100). The samples were pre-cleared with either 1 μg of an irrelevant IgG1 control Ab or 1 μg of rabbit serum, plus 20 μl of resuspended protein-G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The homogenates were gently mixed in a nutator for 30 min, and centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were incubated with 10 μg of the Grb2 polyclonal antibody or rabbit serum as a control, anti-MAP-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) HM-2 or an irrelevant IgG1 antibody as a control. The samples were mixed on a nutator for 2 h, and then 20 μl of resuspended protein-G PLUS-agarose was added, and the samples were rocked overnight. The samples were separated in a 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. For competition assays, following immunoprecipitation with Grb2 the washed antibody-protein G complex was resuspended in 1 ml of IP buffer and incubated with 50 and 100 μg of GST-SH2-Grb2 for 30 min at 4 °C on a nutator. Protein G-associated proteins were then washed 5 times with IP buffer, boiled for 5 min in 2× loading dye mixture, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernantant was removed and separated by gel electrophoresis. Following transfer to nitrocellulose the blot was incubated with phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology), MAP-2 mAb, and a Grb2 mAb to the SH2 domain (IgG1, Transduction Labs). For each of the pull-down assays, 1 mg of the human fetal brain supernatant protein was adjusted to 1 ml with IP buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μg of GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads, and processed as previously described (15Zamora-Leon S.P. Lee G. Davies P. Shafit-Zagardo B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39950-39958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—Following SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) and incubated with either 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TBS or, for the phosphotyrosine antibody, in 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in 1× TBS. Following blocking, the membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Visualization was by ECL. Antibodies included: anti-MAP-2 mAbs HM-2 (Sigma) and Tau46 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); the mAb DT-12 (anti-GST) and the mAb anti-His, provided by Dr. Peter Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY); the anti-Grb2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-255) and mAb (Transduction Labs); anti-Fyn mAb (Transduction Laboratories); anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated mAbs P-Tyr-100 (Cell Signaling) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology); and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The MAP-2 and the irrelevant synthetic peptides (Table I) were synthesized with a biotin tag at the amino terminus by the Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis and Proteomics (Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY). The peptides were bound to neutravidin-coated ELISA plates at 20 ng/well in 2% bovine serum albumin, 1× TBS for 1.5 h at room temperature. The peptides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with full-length Grb2-GST, SH2-Grb2-GST fusion proteins, or GST protein without insert, at 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, and 0.0013 μg/well in 2% bovine serum albumin, 1× TBS. Binding was detected by incubation with the anti-GST mAb DT-12 (1:100; 2h), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (1:500; 1 h) and horseradish peroxidase substrate A and B (ABTS substrate, Bio-Rad; 30 min). Optical densities were recorded at 405 nm.Table ISynthetic peptides spanning the YSN motif on MAP-2MAP-2 peptides 1466: GSQGTYSNTK 1466-P: GSQGTYSNTKIrrelevant phosphotyrosine peptide PY: GGYMDMSKDE (human PDGF receptor β) Open table in a new tab Fyn Phosphorylates the Second Tyrosine Residue on MAP-2c—To determine which tyrosine residue is phosphorylated by Fyn, sequential mutagenesis of individual tyrosine residues were performed beginning with the N-end of MAP-2c (Fig. 1A). Human His tag-MAP-2c, mut1-MAP-2c, consisting a mutation of the first tyrosine (Tyr50) to phenylalanine, or mut2-MAP-2c, consisting of the second tyrosine (Tyr67) to phenylalanine, were incubated with cold ATP at 37 °C in the presence or absence of active Fyn kinase. A heat-stable protein extraction was performed after the kinase reaction to eliminate the Fyn from the reaction mixture. Following electrophoresis and protein transfer, the membranes were incubated with the MAP-2 mAb Tau-46 (Fig. 1B lanes 1–3), an anti-His mAb (lanes 4–6), and the phosphotyrosine mAb PY-100 (lanes 7–13). Tau-46 detected only the full-length MAP-2c (lanes 1–3), whereas the anti-His mAb detected full-length MAP-2c and lower bands representative of degradation products from the carboxyl terminus of MAP-2c (lanes 4–6). The pY100 mAb (lanes 7–13) confirmed that WT MAP-2c and mut1-MAP-2c were tyrosine phosphorylated when incubated with active Fyn kinase (compare lanes 11 and 12, and lanes 9 and 10, respectively). Lane 8, containing mut2-MAP-2c and Fyn, was faintly positive with the phosphotyrosine mAb, and that band co-migrated with Fyn in the Fyn only sample (lane 13). Blots previously incubated with pY100 mAb were stripped and incubated with the anti-Fyn mAb. As shown in the lower panel, residual Fyn was detected in some of the supernatants, predominantly in lanes 8 and 13. This supported our claim that the faint phosphorylation detected in the Fyn/mut2-MAP-2c lane corresponded to autophosphorylation on Fyn and not mut2-MAP-2c. Because we determined that the phosphorylation was on Tyr67, mutagenesis of the last 3 tyrosine residues was not performed. To confirm that the second tyrosine (Tyr67) on MAP-2c is phosphorylated by Fyn, [γ-32P]ATP in vitro kinase reactions were performed in duplicate. Following the kinase reactions, the samples were placed on ice, and MAP-2c was added as a carrier. Again, heat-stable proteins were extracted and examined for the incorporation of radioactivity into full-length MAP-2c and the degradation products. As shown in Fig. 2A, WT MAP-2c (lanes 6 and 7) and mut1-MAP-2c (lanes 4 and 5) were tyrosine phosphorylated, but mut2-MAP-2c was not (lanes 2 and 3). There was not a radioactive band for the Fyn only sample in lane 1, indicating that although we observed variability in various preparations, this time Fyn was not retained in the heat-stable fraction. The Coomassie-stained gel (lower panel) showed that there were equal amounts of MAP-2c protein in each reaction mixture. Because MAP-2c was added as a carrier, the Fyn only sample (lane 1) contains nonradioactive MAP-2c. The table in Fig. 2B contains the total counts/min incorporated into WT and mutant MAP-2c proteins. Background levels of Fyn were obtained after performing the heat-stable protein extraction, thereby precipitating the majority of Fyn. This data confirms that only WT MAP-2c and mut1-MAP-2c were phosphorylated by Fyn, and mut2-MAP-2c was not. To further confirm this result in vivo, WT, or mut 2 MAP-2c, and WT Fyn were co-transfected into COS7 cells and 24 h post-transfection, the protein homogenate was immunopreciptated with the MAP-2-specifc mAb HM2, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot was incubated with the phosphotyrosine mAb pY100. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 2C lanes 2 and 6, WT MAP-2c and WT Fyn were positive with the pY100 mAb. WT or mut-2 forms of MAP-2c transfected alone (not shown); with WT Fyn and mut 2 (lane 3), mut Fyn and WT MAP-2c (lane 4), or mut Fyn and MAP-2c mut 2 (lane 5) were negative with mAb pY100. The middle and lower panels of Fig. 2C demonstrate the efficiency of co-transfection and immunoprecipitation. Note that lane 1 was immunoprecipitated with an irrelevant IgG1 mAb and was negative for both MAP-2c and Fyn. Lane 7 contains an aliquot of the WT Fyn, WT MAP-2c transfection prior to IP. Fig. 2D representing immunoprecipitation experiments with MAP-2 mAb HM-2 demonstrated that when WT Fyn was co-transfected with WT MAP-2c (lanes 1), and mut-1 (lanes 2, 4) MAP-2c was tyrosine phosphorylated. By contrast, no phosphorylation on tyrosine was observed on MAP-2c when Fyn was co-transfected with mut-2 (lanes 3 and 5) further confirming that Tyr67 is the sole site on MAP-2c phosphorylated by Fyn. As shown in lane 6, an irrelevant IgG1 mAb failed to immunoprecipitate MAP-2c. MAP-2 Interacted with Grb2 in Human Fetal Brain Homogenates—Fyn phosphorylation of Tyr67 on MAP-2c creates a consensus sequence for the recruitment of the SH2 domain of Grb2, pYSN. Although Tyr67 was phosphorylated in COS7 cells, a pull-down assay with SH2-Grb2 was negative for MAP-2c. In addition, immunoprecipitation of MAP-2c from COS7 cells following the triple transfection of Fyn, MAP-2c, and YFP-SH2-Grb2 fusion protein inconsistently co-immunoprecipitated YFP-SH2-Grb2 (data not shown). To explore whether MAP-2 and Grb2 interact in the central nervous system, immunoprecipitations and a pull-down assay with human fetal brain homogenates were performed. As shown in Fig. 3A, Grb2 co-immunoprecipitated with MAP-2c. Incubation of the membrane with the anti-MAP-2 mAb confirmed MAP-2 in the pellet (data not shown). The MAP-2/Grb2 interaction was further confirmed by an immunoprecipitation performed with a Grb2 polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, the Grb2 antibody co-immunoprecipitated high and low molecular weight MAP-2. Incubation of the membrane with the anti-Grb2 polyclonal Ab confirmed Grb2 in the pellet (data not shown). These results indicated that MAP-2c and Grb2 interact in vivo but it did not establish that the interaction was via the Grb2-SH2 domain. To address this, Grb2 was immunoprecipitated from the brain homogenate and the Grb2 antibody-protein G-agarose complex was extensively washed, resuspended in IP buffer, and incubated with 50 and 100 μg of GST-SH2-Grb2 for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed, boiled, and the supernatant was subject to electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose. Fig. 3C shows that when GST-SH2-Grb2 was added to the immunoprecipitated complex there was a decrease in phosphotyrosine on MAP-2, detected with mAb4G10 (compare lanes 2 and 4), demonstrating that an interaction between MAP-2c and the SH2 domain of Grb2 exists in vivo. To further examine the domain that bound MAP-2c, pull-down assays were performed with human fetal brain homogenates and N-SH3-Grb2-, SH2-Grb2-, full-length Grb2-GST fusion proteins, and GST protein without insert coupled to glutathione-agarose beads. Following the assay, the proteins were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the anti-MAP-2 mAb HM-2. As shown in Fig. 3D (upper panel) fetal brain MAP-2c interacted with full-length Grb2-, the SH3-Grb2-, and the SH2-Grb2-GST fusion proteins but not the GST-only fusion protein. This data supports an interaction between MAP-2c and the SH3 domain of Grb2, and the SH2 domain of Grb2. Because MAP-2c recruits the SH2 domain of Grb2 this supports our data that endogenous MAP-2c is tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo within the YSN motif. To confirm that all lanes contained GST fusion proteins, the blots were stripped and re-incubated with the GST-specific DT-12 mAb (Fig. 3D lower panel). Phosphorylation of MAP-2c by Fyn Recruits the SH2 Domain of Grb2—To further confirm that the SH2 domain of Grb2 binds to the pYSN motif on MAP-2c, a direct filter overlay assay was performed following an in vitro kinase assay. The kinase reaction was performed with cold ATP, Fyn kinase, and WT MAP-2c or mut2-MAP-2c; WT MAP-2c without Fyn was included as a control. Following the kinase reactions, total protein homogenates were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Filter overlay assays were performed by incubating the membranes with 10 μg/ml full-length Grb2-, SH2-Grb2-, N-SH3-Grb2-GST fusion proteins, or GST protein without insert. To identify the input proteins in the reaction mixtures, the blot was incubated with an anti-Fyn mAb (Fig. 4A lanes 1–3), and anti-MAP-2 mAb HM-2 (lanes 4–6). As shown in Fig. 4A, WT MAP-2c bound Grb2 only when it was phosphorylated by Fyn (compare lanes 8 and 9, and 11 and 12). N-SH3-Grb2-GST fusion protein did not bind to WT MAP-2c (lanes 13–15). Although lanes 7 and 10 containing the mut2-MAP-2c and Fyn showed interactions with full-length Grb2- and SH2-Grb2-GST fusion proteins, respectively, the bands co-migrate with Fyn indicating an interaction between Fyn and the SH2 domain of Grb2. To corroborate that the SH2 domain of Grb2 binds to Fyn, an in vitro kinase assay with cold ATP and only Fyn kinase was performed. A 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with varying amounts of Fyn were loaded (160–10 ng), and following protein transfer, the membrane was incubated with either SH2-Grb2-GST fusion protein, or GST without insert. Fig. 4B shows that the SH2 domain of Grb2 bound quantitatively to Fyn (lanes 2–6), corroborating the data from Fig. 4A that showed that the band present in the filter overlay assay with the mut2-MAP-2c is because of an interaction between Fyn and Grb2 and not the mutated MAP-2c (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 10). No binding was observed with GST without insert (Fig. 4B lanes 7 and 8). To determine whether the interaction between the tyrosine-phosphorylated MAP-2c and Grb2 was quantitative, an in vitro kinase assay with cold ATP, WT MAP-2c, and Fyn was performed, and varying amounts of MAP-2c protein were loaded/lane (1.6–0.1 μg). Following electrophoresis and protein transfer, the membrane was incubated with the GST fusion proteins as above. As shown in Fig. 4C, SH2-Grb2-GST bound in a concentration-dependent manner to the tyrosine-phosphorylated MAP-2c (lanes 3–7); no binding was observed with GST protein without insert (lanes 8 and 9). The SH2 Domain of Grb2 Interacts with the pYSN Motif on MAP-2—To confirm that the SH2 domain of Grb2 binds directly to the pYSN motif on MAP-2c, MAP-2 synthetic peptides (Table I) spanning the YSN motif were used in ELISAs. The analysis demonstrated that full-length Grb2-GST fusion protein interacted with high affinity only with the phosphorylated MAP-2 peptide (1466-P). Grb2-GST did not bind to the unphosphorylated MAP-2 (1466), or to the phosphotyrosine peptide (Tyr(P)) spanning the SH2 binding site for the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase on the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, SH2-Grb2-GST fusion strongly interacted with the 1466-P-phosphorylated MAP-2 peptide. Although there was binding with the 1466 unphosphorylated MAP-2 and the Tyr(P) irrelevant peptides at 0.2 μg/ml, the specificity of the interaction between SH2-Grb2 and the 1466-P peptide was higher and remained high and concentration-dependent at more dilute concentrations, whereas the other peptides fell off after 0.1 μg/ml. The results obtained in these ELISAs confirmed that the interaction with the tyrosine-phosphorylated MAP-2 peptide was through the SH2 domain of Grb2. These data are consistent with the brain pull-down assays and filter overlay assays (Figs. 3 and 4) that demonstrated that Grb2 bound to the YSN motif on MAP-2c only when phosphorylated by Fyn.
