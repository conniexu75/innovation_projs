https://openalex.org/W2170908011,"To provide context for the diversification of archosaurs—the group that includes crocodilians, dinosaurs, and birds—we generated draft genomes of three crocodilians: Alligator mississippiensis (the American alligator), Crocodylus porosus (the saltwater crocodile), and Gavialis gangeticus (the Indian gharial). We observed an exceptionally slow rate of genome evolution within crocodilians at all levels, including nucleotide substitutions, indels, transposable element content and movement, gene family evolution, and chromosomal synteny. When placed within the context of related taxa including birds and turtles, this suggests that the common ancestor of all of these taxa also exhibited slow genome evolution and that the comparatively rapid evolution is derived in birds. The data also provided the opportunity to analyze heterozygosity in crocodilians, which indicates a likely reduction in population size for all three taxa through the Pleistocene. Finally, these data combined with newly published bird genomes allowed us to reconstruct the partial genome of the common ancestor of archosaurs, thereby providing a tool to investigate the genetic starting material of crocodilians, birds, and dinosaurs."

Although coalescent-based species tree estimation methods can have good accuracy in the presence of ILS, they are sensitive to gene tree estimation error. We propose a pipeline that uses bootstrapping to evaluate whether two genes are likely to have the same tree, then it groups genes into sets using a graph-theoretic optimization and estimates a tree on each subset using concatenation, and finally produces an estimated species tree from these trees using the preferred coalescent-based method. Statistical binning improves the accuracy of MP-EST, a popular coalescent-based method, and we use it to produce the first genome-scale coalescent-based avian tree of life."
https://openalex.org/W2023723781,"We have previously reported 27 differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) during human monocyte differentiation into immature dendritic cells (imDCs) and mature DCs (mDCs). However, their roles in DC differentiation and function remain largely elusive. Here, we report that microRNA (miR)-146a and miR-146b modulate DC apoptosis and cytokine production. Expression of miR-146a and miR-146b was significantly increased upon monocyte differentiation into imDCs and mDCs. Silencing of miR-146a and/or miR-146b in imDCs and mDCs significantly prevented DC apoptosis, whereas overexpressing miR-146a and/or miR-146b increased DC apoptosis. miR-146a and miR-146b expression in imDCs and mDCs was inversely correlated with TRAF6 and IRAK1 expression. Furthermore, siRNA silencing of TRAF6 and/or IRAK1 in imDCs and mDCs enhanced DC apoptosis. By contrast, lentivirus overexpression of TRAF6 and/or IRAK1 promoted DC survival. Moreover, silencing of miR-146a and miR-146b expression had little effect on DC maturation but enhanced IL-12p70, IL-6, and TNF-α production as well as IFN-γ production by IL-12p70-mediated activation of natural killer cells, whereas miR-146a and miR-146b overexpression in mDCs reduced cytokine production. Silencing of miR-146a and miR-146b in DCs also down-regulated NF-κB inhibitor IκBα and increased Bcl-2 expression. Our results identify a new negative feedback mechanism involving the miR-146a/b-TRAF6/IRAK1-NF-κB axis in promoting DC apoptosis. Background: MicroRNA (miR)-146a and miR-146b (miR-146a/b) expression is induced upon human monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs). Results: miR-146a/b negatively regulates DC apoptosis and cytokine production. Conclusion: The miR-146a/b-TRAF6/IRAK1-NF-κB axis is responsible for DC apoptosis. Significance: Our data reveal a novel negative feedback regulation in DCs and may have implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1970413727,"Prion diseases are a group of transmissible, fatal neurodegenerative disorders associated with the misfolding of the host-encoded prion protein, PrPC, into a disease-associated form, PrPSc. The transmissible prion agent is principally formed of PrPSc itself and is associated with extracellular vesicles known as exosomes. Exosomes are released from cells both in vitro and in vivo, and have been proposed as a mechanism by which prions spread intercellularly. The biogenesis of exosomes occurs within the endosomal system, through formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), which are subsequently released from cells as exosomes. ILV formation is known to be regulated by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, although an alternative neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) pathway has been suggested to also regulate this process. Here, we investigate a role for the nSMase pathway in exosome biogenesis and packaging of PrP into these vesicles. Inhibition of the nSMase pathway using GW4869 revealed a role for the nSMase pathway in both exosome formation and PrP packaging. In agreement, targeted knockdown of nSMase1 and nSMase2 in mouse neurons using lentivirus-mediated RNAi also decreases exosome release, demonstrating the nSMase pathway regulates the biogenesis and release of exosomes. We also demonstrate that PrPC packaging is dependent on nSMase2, whereas the packaging of disease-associated PrPSc into exosomes occurs independently of nSMase2. These findings provide further insight into prion transmission and identify a pathway which directly assists exosome-mediated transmission of prions.Background: Exosomes are a novel mechanism of intercellular transmission of infectious prions.Results: Chemical and RNAi inhibition of the neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) pathway impairs exosome formation and prion packaging.Conclusion: The nSMase pathway regulates exosome formation and packaging of infectious prions.Significance: This reveals a novel role for the nSMase pathway in exosomal prion packaging and identifies a direct pathway, which mediates prion transmission.

Prion diseases, such as scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans are a family of invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by a progressive loss of neurons and spongiform vacuolation of the brain. According to the protein only hypothesis, the underlying cause of prion disease is misfolding of the normal soluble cellular prion protein, PrPC, into the disease-associated isoform, PrPSc, which has an increased propensity to aggregate (1Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). Prion diseases are unique among neurodegenerative diseases as they can be acquired through exposure to the infectious agent, giving the disease a transmissible etiology. The exact mechanism by which prion disease is transmitted intercellularly is yet to be identified, although three mechanisms have been proposed, including: direct cell-cell contact; tunnelling nanotubes, which are fine membrane protrusions connecting the cytoplasm of one cell with a neighboring cell; and extracellular vesicles such as microvesicles and exosomes (2Kanu N.

Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles released by cells, ∼30–100 nm in diameter, as determined using TEM, and contain proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs (6Théry C. Zitvogel L. Amigorena S.

Whereas microvesicles are generated via budding at the plasma membrane, exosomes are distinct and are generated within the endosomal system (11Beaudoin A.R. Grondin G.

Zitvogel L. Amigorena S. Exosomes: composition, biogenesis and function.Nature Reviews Immunology. 2002; 2: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). The MVB either fuses with lysosomes, resulting in degradation of the ILVs, a well-known process for down-regulating transmembrane receptors, or it fuses with the plasma membrane, resulting in release of the ILVs as exosomes. Consistent with the endosomal origin, exosomes have a unique protein and lipid composition, and contain proteins such as Tsg101, a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, and are enriched in raft-associated lipids such as cholesterol, sphingolipids, ceramide, and glycerophospholipids (6Théry C.

A link between exosomes and prion disease was first established in rabbit kidney epithelial cells expressing ovine PrP (ROV). The ROV cells release exosomes which contain PrPSc and are capable of transmitting infection to mice (4Fevrier B. Vilette D. Archer F. Loew D. Faigle W. Vidal M. Laude H. Raposo G. Cells release prions in association with exosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9683-9688Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In support of this, exosomes released from a prion-infected mouse neuronal cell line are also capable of transmitting infection to naïve cells and to mice (10Coleman B.M. Hanssen E. Lawson V.A.

Pathol. 2007; 211: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Exosomes are also able to transmit infectivity between heterologous cell types, suggesting that exosomes could assist prion transmission from the periphery to the central nervous system (13Vella L.J. Sharples R.A. Lawson V.A. Masters C.L. Cappai R. Hill A.F. Packaging of prions into exosomes is associated with a novel pathway of PrP processing.J.

In addition to prion disease, exosomes have also been implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where the disease-associated proteins have also been found in exosomes (14Rajendran L.

Furthermore, HIV-1 has also been proposed to hijack the exosomal pathway to produce new viral particles (19Izquierdo-Useros N. Naranjo-Gómez M. Archer J. Hatch S.C. Erkizia I. Blanco J. Borràs F.E.

Given the proposed role of exosomes in facilitating the spread of disease-related proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders, elucidating pathways which regulate exosome protein packaging could be valuable for understanding disease pathogenesis (20Bellingham S.A. Guo B.B. Coleman B.M. Hill A.F. Exosomes: vehicles for the transfer of toxic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases?.Front. Physiol. 2012; 3: 124Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The most common mechanism of protein targeting into ILVs is mono-ubiquitination and recruitment of the ESCRT machinery (21Hicke L. Protein regulation by monoubiquitin.Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 22Raiborg C. Stenmark H.

However, ubiquitin-independent mechanisms have also been described, including lipid-raft-association, higher-ordered oligomerization, association with tetraspanin-enriched domains, and the generation of ceramide via the neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) pathway (23de Gassart A.

These alternative pathways are dependent on a reduction in the diffusion rate of cargo proteins, either through association with other proteins or with microdomains within the limiting membrane of endosomes, leading to retention of the proteins and subsequent incorporation into budding ILVs. The nSMase pathway was first demonstrated to assist ILV formation and packaging of the proteolipid protein in mouse oligodendroglial cells, and have since then being found to also regulate packaging of miRNA into ILVs (27Kosaka N.

Furthermore, nSMase-dependent exosome biogenesis has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease as the exosomes were proposed to promote clearance of Aβ by microglia (28Yuyama K. Sun H. Mitsutake S.

Both nSMase1 and nSMase2 have been reported to have nSMase activity in vitro, although only nSMase2 has nSMase activity in vivo. With exosomes implicated as vehicles for intercellular transmission of prions, we aimed to investigate a role for the nSMase pathway in exosome biogenesis and packaging of PrP into exosomes by inhibiting the nSMase pathway using a chemical inhibitor, GW4869, and using lentivirus-mediated RNAi to silence nSMase1 and nSMase2.

https://openalex.org/W2055291719,"Gut microbial metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids have attracted much attention because of their various physiological properties. Dysfunction of tight junction (TJ) in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We evaluated the effects of five novel gut microbial metabolites on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced barrier impairment in Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice. 10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid (HYA), a gut microbial metabolite of linoleic acid, suppressed TNF-α and dextran sulfate sodium-induced changes in the expression of TJ-related molecules, occludin, zonula occludens-1, and myosin light chain kinase. HYA also suppressed the expression of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 cells and colonic tissue. In addition, HYA suppressed the protein expression of TNFR2 in murine intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, HYA significantly up-regulated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40 expression in Caco-2 cells. It also induced [Ca2+]i responses in HEK293 cells expressing human GPR40 with higher sensitivity than linoleic acid, its metabolic precursor. The barrier-recovering effects of HYA were abrogated by a GPR40 antagonist and MEK inhibitor in Caco-2 cells. Conversely, 10-hydroxyoctadacanoic acid, which is a gut microbial metabolite of oleic acid and lacks a carbon-carbon double bond at Δ12 position, did not show these TJ-restoring activities and down-regulated GPR40 expression. Therefore, HYA modulates TNFR2 expression, at least partially, via the GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway and may be useful in the treatment of TJ-related disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Background: The physiological activity of gut microbial metabolites has recently attracted much attention. Results: A gut microbial metabolite of linoleic acid, 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid (HYA), ameliorates intestinal epithelial barrier impairments by regulating TNFR2 expression via the GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway. Conclusion: HYA-induced GPR40 signaling contributes to the intestinal homeostasis. Significance: Our findings indicate a novel function of GPR40 in the inflamed intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2011749905,"Steroid hormones are essential for carbohydrate metabolism, stress management, and reproduction and are synthesized from cholesterol in mitochondria of adrenal glands and gonads/ovaries. In acute stress or hormonal stimulation, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) transports substrate cholesterol into the mitochondria for steroidogenesis by an unknown mechanism. Here, we report for the first time that StAR interacts with voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) at the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM) prior to its translocation to the mitochondrial matrix. In the MAM, StAR interacts with mitochondrial proteins Tom22 and VDAC2. However, Tom22 knockdown by siRNA had no effect on pregnenolone synthesis. In the absence of VDAC2, StAR was expressed but not processed into the mitochondria as a mature 30-kDa protein. VDAC2 interacted with StAR via its C-terminal 20 amino acids and N-terminal amino acids 221–229, regulating the mitochondrial processing of StAR into the mature protein. In the absence of VDAC2, StAR could not enter the mitochondria or interact with MAM-associated proteins, and therefore steroidogenesis was inhibited. Furthermore, the N terminus was not essential for StAR activity, and the N-terminal deletion mutant continued to interact with VDAC2. The endoplasmic reticulum-targeting prolactin signal sequence did not affect StAR association with the MAM and thus its mitochondrial targeting. Therefore, VDAC2 controls StAR processing and activity, and MAM is thus a central location for initiating mitochondrial steroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2027755050,"Songbirds represent an important model organism for elucidating molecular mechanisms that link genes with complex behaviors, in part because they have discrete vocal learning circuits that have parallels with those that mediate human speech. We found that ~10% of the genes in the avian genome were regulated by singing, and we found a striking regional diversity of both basal and singing-induced programs in the four key song nuclei of the zebra finch, a vocal learning songbird. The region-enriched patterns were a result of distinct combinations of region-enriched transcription factors (TFs), their binding motifs, and presinging acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) enhancer activity in the regulatory regions of the associated genes. RNA interference manipulations validated the role of the calcium-response transcription factor (CaRF) in regulating genes preferentially expressed in specific song nuclei in response to singing. Thus, differential combinatorial binding of a small group of activity-regulated TFs and predefined epigenetic enhancer activity influences the anatomical diversity of behaviorally regulated gene networks."

https://openalex.org/W2111225873,"Background Dietary factors are known to influence colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, however, their association with CRC survival is unclear. Therefore, we prospectively examined the association between diet quality scores, dietary patterns and colorectal cancer (CRC) survival. Methods 1201 women diagnosed with stage I–III CRC between 1986 and 2008, were followed through 2010. Diet was assessed via a food frequency questionnaire administered at least 6 months after diagnosis. We computed the Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), alternate Mediterranean Diet score (aMED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension score (DASH) and derived two dietary patterns, Western (unhealthy) and prudent (healthy), by principal component analysis for each woman. Results During follow-up, we documented 435 deaths, including 162 from CRC. After adjusting for potential confounders, only a higher AHEI-2010 score was significantly associated with lower overall mortality (HR comparing extreme quintiles = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52–0.98, p trend = 0.01) as well as borderline significantly with lower risk of CRC mortality by the trend test (HR Q5 vs Q1 = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.43–1.21, p trend = 0.07). When AHEI-2010 components were examined separately, inverse associations for overall mortality were primarily accounted for by moderate alcohol intake (HR comparing abstainers vs 5–15 g/d = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.05–1.61) and lower intake of sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juices combined (HR for each additional serving = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01–1.23). No other diet quality score or dietary pattern was associated with overall or CRC-specific mortality. Conclusion Higher AHEI-2010 score may be associated with lower overall mortality, moderate alcohol consumption and lower consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and juices combined appeared to account for most of the observed associations."
https://openalex.org/W1995902122,"The aggregation of polyglutamine (polyQ)-containing proteins is at the origin of nine neurodegenerative diseases. Molecular chaperones prevent the aggregation of polyQ-containing proteins. The exact mechanism by which they interact with polyQ-containing, aggregation-prone proteins and interfere with their assembly is unknown. Here we dissect the mechanism of interaction between a huntingtin exon 1 fragment of increasing polyQ lengths (HttEx1Qn), the aggregation of which is tightly associated with Huntington's disease, and molecular chaperone Hsc70. We show that Hsc70, together with its Hsp40 co-chaperones, inhibits HttEx1Qn aggregation and modifies the structural, seeding, and infectious properties of the resulting fibrils in a polyQ-independent manner. We demonstrate that Hsc70 binds the 17-residue-long N-terminal flank of HttEx1Qn, and we map Hsc70-HttEx1Qn surface interfaces at the residue level. Finally, we show that this interaction competes with homotypic interactions between the N termini of different HttEx1Qn molecules that trigger the aggregation process. Our results lay the foundations of future therapeutic strategies targeting huntingtin aggregation in Huntington disease."

Data were collected via a semi-structured questionnaire with farmers, inspection of the production environment and an in-depth interview with a sample of 26 farmers. Herds had an average of 22.3 lactating cows and an average milk production of 12.7 L/cow/day. Calves were dehorned in 98% of the farms, with a hot iron in 95%. Male calves were castrated in 71% of the farms; methods were surgery (68%), emasculator (29%), or rubber rings (3%). No pain control was used for these interventions. In 51% of the farms all newborn male calves were reared, sold or donated to others; in 35% all newborn males were killed on the farm. Calves were separated from the dam up to 12 h after birth in 78% of the farms, and left to nurse colostrum from the dam without intervention in 55% of the farms. The typical amount of milk fed to calves was 4 L/day until a median age of 75 days. In 40% of the farms milk was provided in a bucket, in 49% with bottles, and in 11% calves suckled from a cow. Solid feeding in the milk-feeding period started at a median age of 10 days. Calves were housed individually in 70% of the farms; in 81% of the farms calves were housed in indoor pens, in 6% in outdoor hutches and in 13% they were kept on pasture. Diarrhoea was reported as the main cause of calf mortality in 71% of the farms. Farmers kept no records of calf disease, mortality, or use of medicines. Changing the scenario identified in this survey is essential to support the sustainable development of dairy production, an activity of great economic and social relevance for the region."
https://openalex.org/W2055432560,"After cell entry, HIV undergoes rapid transport toward the nucleus using microtubules and microfilaments. Neither the cellular cytoplasmic components nor the viral proteins that interact to mediate transport have yet been identified. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified four cytoskeletal components as putative interaction partners for HIV-1 p24 capsid protein: MAP1A, MAP1S, CKAP1, and WIRE. Depletion of MAP1A/MAP1S in indicator cell lines and primary human macrophages led to a profound reduction in HIV-1 infectivity as a result of impaired retrograde trafficking, demonstrated by a characteristic accumulation of capsids away from the nuclear membrane, and an overall defect in nuclear import. MAP1A/MAP1S did not impact microtubule network integrity or cell morphology but contributed to microtubule stabilization, which was shown previously to facilitate infection. In addition, we found that MAP1 proteins interact with HIV-1 cores both in vitro and in infected cells and that interaction involves MAP1 light chain LC2. Depletion of MAP1 proteins reduced the association of HIV-1 capsids with both dynamic and stable microtubules, suggesting that MAP1 proteins help tether incoming viral capsids to the microtubular network, thus promoting cytoplasmic trafficking. This work shows for the first time that following entry into target cells, HIV-1 interacts with the cytoskeleton via its p24 capsid protein. Moreover, our results support a role for MAP1 proteins in promoting efficient retrograde trafficking of HIV-1 by stimulating the formation of stable microtubules and mediating the association of HIV-1 cores with microtubules."

Surprisingly the binding affinity and stability of the 15-mer epitopes in complex with HLA-A*02:01 were comparable with the values observed for canonical length (8 to 11 aa) HLA-A*02:01-restricted peptides. We solved the structures of two 15-mer epitopes in complex with HLA-A*02:01, within which the peptides adopted distinct super-bulged conformations. Moreover, we demonstrate that T-cells can recognize the 15-mer peptides in the context of HLA-A*02:01, indicating that these 15-mer peptides represent immunogenic ligands. Collectively, our data expand our understanding of longer epitopes in the context of HLA-I, highlighting that they are not limited to the HLA-B family, but can bind the ubiquitous HLA-A*02:01 molecule, and play an important role in T-cell immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2129894141,"The conversion of α-synuclein from its intrinsically disordered monomeric state into the fibrillar cross-β aggregates characteristically present in Lewy bodies is largely unknown. The investigation of α-synuclein variants causative of familial forms of Parkinson disease can provide unique insights into the conditions that promote or inhibit aggregate formation. It has been shown recently that a newly identified pathogenic mutation of α-synuclein, H50Q, aggregates faster than the wild-type. We investigate here its aggregation propensity by using a sequence-based prediction algorithm, NMR chemical shift analysis of secondary structure populations in the monomeric state, and determination of thermodynamic stability of the fibrils. Our data show that the H50Q mutation induces only a small increment in polyproline II structure around the site of the mutation and a slight increase in the overall aggregation propensity. We also find, however, that the H50Q mutation strongly stabilizes α-synuclein fibrils by 5.0 ± 1.0 kJ mol−1, thus increasing the supersaturation of monomeric α-synuclein within the cell, and strongly favors its aggregation process. We further show that wild-type α-synuclein can decelerate the aggregation kinetics of the H50Q variant in a dose-dependent manner when coaggregating with it.

https://openalex.org/W1998671407,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common inherited causes of pediatric mortality. SMA is caused by deletions or mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which results in SMN protein deficiency. Humans have a centromeric copy of the survival of motor neuron gene, SMN2, which is nearly identical to SMN1. However, SMN2 cannot compensate for the loss of SMN1 because SMN2 has a single-nucleotide difference in exon 7, which negatively affects splicing of the exon. As a result, most mRNA produced from SMN2 lacks exon 7. SMN2 mRNA lacking exon 7 encodes a truncated protein with reduced functionality. Improving SMN2 exon 7 inclusion is a goal of many SMA therapeutic strategies. The identification of regulators of exon 7 inclusion may provide additional therapeutic targets or improve the design of existing strategies. Although a number of regulators of exon 7 inclusion have been identified, the function of most splicing proteins in exon 7 inclusion is unknown. Here, we test the role of SR proteins and hnRNP proteins in SMN2 exon 7 inclusion. Knockdown and overexpression studies reveal that SRSF1, SRSF2, SRSF3, SRSF4, SRSF5, SRSF6, SRSF7, SRSF11, hnRNPA1/B1 and hnRNP U can inhibit exon 7 inclusion. Depletion of two of the most potent inhibitors of exon 7 inclusion, SRSF2 or SRSF3, in cell lines derived from SMA patients, increased SMN2 exon 7 inclusion and SMN protein. Our results identify novel regulators of SMN2 exon 7 inclusion, revealing potential targets for SMA therapeutics."

Here, we present the crystal structures of the apo- and c-di-AMP-bound PstA protein, which is trimeric in solution as well as in the crystals. The structures combined with detailed bioinformatics analysis revealed that the protein belongs to a new family of proteins with a similar core fold but with distinct features to classical PII proteins, which usually function in nitrogen metabolism pathways in bacteria. The complex structure revealed three identical c-di-AMP-binding sites per trimer with each binding site at a monomer-monomer interface.

Although virtually all stages of the antiviral silencing pathway can be inhibited by VSRs, small RNAs (sRNAs) and Argonaute (AGO) proteins seem to be the most frequent targets. Recently, GW/WG motifs of some VSRs have been proposed to dictate their suppressor function by mediating interaction with AGO(s). Here we have studied the VSR encoded by Pelargonium line pattern virus (family Tombusviridae). The results show that p37, the viral coat protein, blocks RNA silencing. Site-directed mutagenesis of some p37 sequence traits, including a conserved GW motif, allowed generation of suppressor-competent and -incompetent molecules and uncoupling of the VSR and particle assembly capacities. The engineered mutants were used to assess the importance of p37 functions for viral infection and the relative contribution of diverse molecular interactions to suppressor activity. Two main conclusions can be drawn: (i) the silencing suppression and encapsidation functions of p37 are both required for systemic Pelargonium line pattern virus infection, and (ii) the suppressor activity of p37 relies on the ability to bind sRNAs rather than on interaction with AGOs. The data also caution against potential misinterpretations of results due to overlap of sequence signals related to distinct protein properties. This is well illustrated by mutation of the GW motif in p37 that concurrently affects nucleolar localization, efficient interaction with AGO1, and sRNA binding capability.

https://openalex.org/W2042806653,"Regulatory mechanisms of ALX/FPR2, the lipoxin A4 receptor, expression have considerable relevance in inflammation resolution. Because microRNAs (miRs) are emerging as key players in inflammation resolution, here we examined microRNA-mediated regulation of ALX/FPR2 (lipoxin A4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor 2) expression. By matching data from bioinformatic algorithms, we found 27 miRs predicted to bind the 3′-UTR of ALX/FPR2. Among these, we selected miR-181b because of its link with inflammation. Using a luciferase reporter system, we assessed miR-181b binding to ALX/FPR2 3′-UTR. Consistent with this, miR-181b overexpression in human macrophages significantly down-regulated ALX/FPR2 protein levels (−25%), whereas miR-181b knockdown gave a significant increase in ALX/FPR2 (+60%). miR-181b levels decreased during monocyte to macrophage differentiation (−50%), whereas ALX/FPR2 expression increased significantly (+60%). miR-181b overexpression blunted lipoxin A4 (0.1–10 nm)- and resolvin D1 (0.01–10 nm)-stimulated phagocytic activity of macrophages. These results unravel novel regulatory mechanisms of ALX/FPR2 expression and ligand-evoked macrophages proresolution responses mediated by miR-181b, thus uncovering novel components of the endogenous inflammation resolution circuits."

A unique mode of regulation of V-ATPases is the reversible disassembly of V1 and VO, which reduces ATPase activity and causes silencing of ion conduction. The subunits D and F are proposed to be key in these enzymatic processes. Here, we describe the structures of two conformations of the subunit DF assembly of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScDF) V-ATPase at 3.1 A resolution. Subunit D (ScD) consists of a long pair of α-helices connected by a short helix ((79)IGYQVQE(85)) as well as a β-hairpin region, which is flanked by two flexible loops. The long pair of helices is composed of the N-terminal α-helix and the C-terminal helix, showing structural alterations in the two ScDF structures. The entire subunit F (ScF) consists of an N-terminal domain of four β-strands (β1-β4) connected by four α-helices (α1-α4). α1 and β2 are connected via the loop (26)GQITPETQEK(35), which is unique in eukaryotic V-ATPases. Adjacent to the N-terminal domain is a flexible loop, followed by a C-terminal α-helix (α5). A perpendicular and extended conformation of helix α5 was observed in the two crystal structures and in solution x-ray scattering experiments, respectively. Fitted into the nucleotide-bound A3B3 structure of the related A-ATP synthase from Enterococcus hirae, the arrangements of the ScDF molecules reflect their central function in ATPase-coupled ion conduction. Furthermore, the flexibility of the terminal helices of both subunits as well as the loop (26)GQITPETQEK(35) provides information about the regulatory step of reversible V1VO disassembly."

Urinary FABP4 (U-FABP4) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured. Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was followed up one year later.In 93 (23.7%) of the 392 subjects, U-FABP4 level was below the sensitivity of the assay. Subjects with undetectable U-FABP4 were younger and had lower UACR and higher eGFR levels than subjects with measurable U-FABP4. U-FABP4 level was positively correlated with age, systolic blood pressure and levels of serum FABP4 (S-FABP4), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), urinary FABP1 (U-FABP1) and UACR (r = 0.360, p<0.001). Age, S-FABP4, U-FABP1 and UACR were independent predictors of U-FABP4. On the other hand, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c and U-FABP4 were independently correlated with UACR. Reduction in eGFR after one year was significantly larger in a group with the highest tertile of baseline U-FABP4 than a group with the lowest tertile.Urinary FABP4 level is independently correlated with level of albuminuria and possibly predicts yearly decline of eGFR. U-FABP4 would be a novel biomarker of glomerular damage."
https://openalex.org/W2038825130,"Fatty acid synthesis and oxidation are frequently exacerbated in leukemia cells, and may therefore represent a target for therapeutic intervention. In this work we analyzed the apoptotic and chemo-sensitizing action of the fatty acid oxidation inhibitor etomoxir in human acute myeloid leukemia cells. Etomoxir caused negligible lethality at concentrations up to 100 µM, but efficaciously cooperated to cause apoptosis with the anti-leukemic agent arsenic trioxide (ATO, Trisenox), and with lower efficacy with other anti-tumour drugs (etoposide, cisplatin), in HL60 cells. Etomoxir-ATO cooperation was also observed in NB4 human acute promyelocytic cells, but not in normal (non-tumour) mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Biochemical determinations in HL60 cells indicated that etomoxir (25-200 µM) dose-dependently inhibited mitochondrial respiration while slightly stimulating glycolysis, and only caused marginal alterations in total ATP content and adenine nucleotide pool distribution. In addition, etomoxir caused oxidative stress (increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, decrease in reduced glutathione content), as well as pro-apoptotic LKB-1/AMPK pathway activation, all of which may in part explain the chemo-sensitizing capacity of the drug. Etomoxir also cooperated with glycolytic inhibitors (2-deoxy-D-glucose, lonidamine) to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells, but not in NB4 cells. The combined etomoxir plus 2-deoxy-D-glucose treatment did not increase oxidative stress, caused moderate decrease in net ATP content, increased the AMP/ATP ratio with concomitant drop in energy charge, and caused defensive Akt and ERK kinase activation. Apoptosis generation by etomoxir plus 2-deoxy-D-glucose was further increased by co-incubation with ATO, which is apparently explained by the capacity of ATO to attenuate Akt and ERK activation. In summary, co-treatment with etomoxir may represent an interesting strategy to increase the apoptotic efficacy of ATO and (with some limitations) 2-deoxy-D-glucose which, although clinically important anti-tumour agents, exhibit low efficacy in monotherapy."

Furthermore, we also provide evidence that Plk1 inhibition makes PCa cells carrying WT p53 much more sensitive to low-dose metformin treatment. Mechanistically, we found that co-treatment with BI2536 and metformin induced p53-dependent apoptosis and further activated the p53/Redd-1 pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2056557449,"Bacterial toxins require localization to specific intracellular compartments following injection into host cells. In this study, we examined the membrane targeting of a broad family of bacterial proteins, the patatin-like phospholipases. The best characterized member of this family is ExoU, an effector of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion system. Upon injection into host cells, ExoU localizes to the plasma membrane, where it uses its phospholipase A2 activity to lyse infected cells. The targeting mechanism of ExoU is poorly characterized, but it was recently found to bind to the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a marker for the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. We confirmed that the membrane localization domain (MLD) of ExoU had a direct affinity for PI(4,5)P2, and we determined that this binding was required for ExoU localization. Previously uncharacterized ExoU homologs from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Photorhabdus asymbiotica also localized to the plasma membrane and required PI(4,5)P2 for this localization. A conserved arginine within the MLD was critical for interaction of each protein with PI(4,5)P2 and for localization. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of the full-length P. fluorescens ExoU and found that it was similar to that of P. aeruginosa ExoU. Each MLD contains a four-helical bundle, with the conserved arginine exposed at its cap to allow for interaction with the negatively charged PI(4,5)P2.

A deleterious immune attack is avoided by orchestration of cellular, hormonal, and enzymatic factors. However, the precise mechanisms underlying fetomaternal tolerance are not yet completely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that sphingolipid metabolism constitutes a novel signaling pathway that is indispensable for fetomaternal tolerance by regulating innate immune responses at the fetomaternal interface. Perturbation of the sphingolipid pathway by disruption of the sphingosine kinase gene (Sphk) during pregnancy caused unusually high expression of neutrophil chemoattractants, CXCL1 and CXCL2, in the decidua, leading to a massive infiltration of neutrophils into the fetomaternal interface with enhanced oxidative damage, resulting in early fetal death. Sphk-deficient mice also exhibited neutrophilia in the peripheral blood, enhanced generation of granulocytes in the bone marrow, and a decrease in the number of decidual natural killer cells. The blockage of neutrophil influx protected Sphk-deficient mice against pregnancy loss. Notably, a similar result was obtained in human decidual cells, in which Sphk deficiency dramatically increased the secretion of CXCL1 and IL-8. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the sphingolipid metabolic pathway plays a critical role in fetomaternal tolerance by regulating innate immunity at the fetomaternal interface both in mice and humans, and it could provide novel insight into the development of therapeutic strategies to treat idiopathic pregnancy loss in humans.Mechanisms by which the mother does not reject the fetus are not fully understood.ResultsIn sphingosine kinase-deficient mice, the innate arm of the maternal immune system attacks the fetus, resulting in miscarriage.ConclusionSphingolipid metabolism has an essential role in maternal immunological adaptation to the fetus.SignificanceOur findings may help to develop treatments for unexplained miscarriages in humans.

https://openalex.org/W2113128467,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) causes significant neurological morbidity and short survival times. Brain invasion by GBM is associated with poor prognosis. Recent clinical trials of bevacizumab in newly-diagnosed GBM found no beneficial effects on overall survival times; however, the baseline health-related quality of life and performance status were maintained longer in the bevacizumab group and the glucocorticoid requirement was lower. Here, we construct a clinical-scale model of GBM whose predictions uncover a new pattern of recurrence in 11/70 bevacizumab-treated patients. The findings support an exception to the Folkman hypothesis: GBM grows in the absence of angiogenesis by a cycle of proliferation and brain invasion that expands necrosis. Furthermore, necrosis is positively correlated with brain invasion in 26 newly-diagnosed GBM. The unintuitive results explain the unusual clinical effects of bevacizumab and suggest new hypotheses on the dynamic clinical effects of migration by active transport, a mechanism of hypoxia-driven brain invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1996228504,"The endothelium is actively involved in many functions of the cardiovascular system, such as the modulation of arterial pressure and the maintenance of blood flow. These functions require a great versatility of the intracellular Ca2+ signaling that resides in the fact that different signals can be encoded by varying the frequency and the amplitude of the Ca2+ response. Cells use both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ pools to modulate the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. In non-excitable cells, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is responsible for the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular store. The proteins STIM1 and STIM2 are also located on the ER and they are involved in the activation of a store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Due to their Ca2+ sensor property and their close proximity with IP3Rs on the ER, STIMs could modulate the activity of IP3R. In this study, we showed that STIM1 and STIM2 are expressed in bovine aortic endothelial cells and they both interact with IP3R. While STIM2 appears to play a minor role, STIM1 plays an important role in the regulation of agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization in BAECs by a positive effect on both the SOCE and the IP3R-dependent Ca2+ release."

The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins play important roles in inflammatory processes, diabetes, and cancer and therefore represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. The SOCS proteins, among their other functions, serve as substrate receptors of CRL5 complexes. A member of the CRL family, SOCS2-EloBC-Cul5-Rbx2 (CRL5(SOCS2)), binds phosphorylated growth hormone receptor as its main substrate. Here, we demonstrate that the components of CRL5(SOCS2) can be specifically pulled from K562 human cell lysates using beads decorated with phosphorylated growth hormone receptor peptides. Subsequently, SOCS2-EloBC and full-length Cul5-Rbx2, recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and in Sf21 insect cells, respectively, were used to reconstitute neddylated and unneddylated CRL5(SOCS2) complexes in vitro. Finally, diverse biophysical methods were employed to study the assembly and interactions within the complexes. Unlike other E3 ligases, CRL5(SOCS2) was found to exist in a monomeric state as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography with inline multiangle static light scattering and native MS. Affinities of the protein-protein interactions within the multisubunit complex were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. A structural model for full-size neddylated and unneddylated CRL5(SOCS2) complexes is supported by traveling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry data."

Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), the best characterized member of the PLK family plays an active role in carcinogenesis and contribute to transformed properties of cancer cells (33Cholewa B.D. Liu X. Ahmad N. The role of polo-like kinase 1 in carcinogenesis: cause or consequence?.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 6848-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similar to BMI1, PLK1 is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of cancers and often correlates with a poor prognosis (34Strebhardt K.

Recently, it was shown that PLK1 inhibition can induce cellular senescence in human diploid fibroblasts (37Kim H.J. Cho J.H. Kim J.R.

Datta S. Band V. Dimri G.P. Mel-18, a polycomb group protein, regulates cell proliferation and senescence via transcriptional repression of Bmi-1 and c-Myc oncoproteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it is possible that PLK1 inhibition induces senescence via regulation of BMI1. Here, we studied the effect of PLK1 inhibition on BMI1 expression and determined whether the PcG protein BMI1 is a target of PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536. Our data suggest that PLK1 regulates BMI1 expression and that its inhibition results in down-regulation of BMI1 and PRC1 activity. Furthermore, BMI1 overexpression can rescue inhibition of oncogenicity induced by PLK1 inhibition. Mechanistically, PLK1 inhibition appears to regulate BMI1 expression via up-regulation of miR-200c and miR-141.

The results are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. To determine whether the PLK1 can regulate activity and function of PcG proteins, we analyzed expression of BMI1 in control and PLK1 knockdown cells by Western blot analysis. We also determined whether PLK1 knockdown results in down-regulation of H2AK119 ubiquitination activity of PRC1 by analyzing total H2A and H2AK119Ub levels by Western blot analysis. Our data indicated that PLK1 knockdown using two different shRNAs (PLKi46 and PLKi47) but not a control shRNA resulted in down-regulation of BMI1 as well as decreased levels of H2AK119Ub in MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we determined whether stable overexpression of PLK1 in MCF10A results in up-regulation of expression of BMI1 and H2AK119Ub levels indicative of PRC1 activity. Our results indicated that indeed PLK1 overexpression leads to up-regulation of BMI1 and PRC1 activity (Fig. 1B). Next, we determined whether BI 2536, a well-known and highly effective inhibitor of PLK1 (36Steegmaier M. Hoffmann M. Baum A. Lénárt P. Petronczki M. Krssák M. Gürtler U. Garin-Chesa P. Lieb S.

Hereditary HD is primarily caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin (Htt) gene, which results in the production of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) with an expanded amino-terminal polyglutamine (poly(Q)) stretch. Besides pathological mHTT aggregation, reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, impaired neurotrophin signaling, and compromised mitochondrial functions also contribute to the deleterious progressive etiology of HD. As a well tolerated Food and Drug Administration-approved antidepressant, amitriptyline (AMI) has shown efficacy in treating neurodegenerative murine models via potentiation of BDNF levels and amelioration of alterations in neurotrophin signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2068085131,"Functional maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is constantly challenged by stresses like DNA damage and oxidative stress. Here we show that the Fanconi anemia protein Fancd2 and stress transcriptional factor Foxo3a cooperate to prevent HSC exhaustion in mice. Deletion of both Fancd2 and Foxo3a led to an initial expansion followed by a progressive decline of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells. Limiting dilution transplantation and competitive repopulating experiments demonstrated a dramatic reduction of competitive repopulating units and progressive decline in hematopoietic repopulating ability of double-knockout (dKO) HSCs. Analysis of the transcriptome of dKO HSCs revealed perturbation of multiple pathways implicated in HSC exhaustion. Fancd2 deficiency strongly promoted cytoplasmic localization of Foxo3a in HSCs, and re-expression of Fancd2 completely restored nuclear Foxo3a localization. By co-expressing a constitutively active CA-FOXO3a and WT or a nonubiquitinated Fancd2 in dKO bone marrow stem/progenitor cells, we demonstrated that Fancd2 was required for nuclear retention of CA-FOXO3a and for maintaining hematopoietic repopulation of the HSCs.

We categorized invertebrate prey into six functional groups, including oil-seed rape pests; pests of other arable crops; other crop-provisioned taxa; coprophilous taxa; and taxa living in non-crop and mixed crop/non-crop habitats. Seasonality impacted functional groups differently, but the general direction of change (increase/decrease) of all groups was consistent as indexed by prey composition of the three aerial insectivores studied here. After the oil-seed rape crop harvest (mid July), all three species exhibited a dietary shift from oil-seed rape insect pests to other aerial invertebrate prey groups. However, Common Switfts also consumed a relative large quantity of oil-seed rape insect pests in the late summer (August), suggesting that they could reduce pest insect emigration beyond the host plant/crop. Since these aerially foraging insectivorous birds operate in specific conditions and feed on specific pest resources unavailable to foliage/ground foraging avian predators, our results suggest that in some crops like oil-seed rape cultivations, the potential integration of the insectivory of aerial foraging birds into pest management schemes might provide economic benefits. We advise further research into the origin of airborne insects and the role of aerial insectivores as agents of the biological control of crop insect pests, especially the determination of depredation rates and the cascading effects of insectivory on crop damage and yield."
https://openalex.org/W2075743356,"To better study the role of PKCδ in normal function and disease, we developed an ATP analog-specific (AS) PKCδ that is sensitive to specific kinase inhibitors and can be used to identify PKCδ substrates. AS PKCδ showed nearly 200 times higher affinity (Km) and 150 times higher efficiency (kcat/Km) than wild type (WT) PKCδ toward N6-(benzyl)-ATP. AS PKCδ was uniquely inhibited by 1-(tert-butyl)-3-(1-naphthyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (1NA-PP1) and 1-(tert-butyl)-3-(2-methylbenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (2MB-PP1) but not by other 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP1) analogs tested, whereas WT PKCδ was insensitive to all PP1 analogs. To understand the mechanisms for specificity and affinity of these analogs, we created in silico WT and AS PKCδ homology models based on the crystal structure of PKCι. N6-(Benzyl)-ATP and ATP showed similar positioning within the purine binding pocket of AS PKCδ, whereas N6-(benzyl)-ATP was displaced from the pocket of WT PKCδ and was unable to interact with the glycine-rich loop that is required for phosphoryl transfer. The adenine rings of 1NA-PP1 and 2MB-PP1 matched the adenine ring of ATP when docked in AS PKCδ, and this interaction prevented the potential interaction of ATP with Lys-378, Glu-428, Leu-430, and Phe-633 residues. 1NA-PP1 failed to effectively dock within WT PKCδ. Other PP1 analogs failed to interact with either AS PKCδ or WT PKCδ. These results provide a structural basis for the ability of AS PKCδ to efficiently and specifically utilize N6-(benzyl)-ATP as a phosphate donor and for its selective inhibition by 1NA-PP1 and 2MB-PP1. Such homology modeling could prove useful in designing molecules to target PKCδ and other kinases to understand their function in cell signaling and to identify unique substrates.A traceable form of PKCδ is needed to investigate PKCδ functions.ResultsAnalog-specific PKCδ could utilize N6-(benzyl)-ATP to phosphorylate PKCδ substrates and was specifically inhibited by PP1 analogs.ConclusionBinding to the catalytic domain glycine-rich loop, Lys-378, Glu-428, Leu-430, and Phe-633 is the likely mechanism by which N6-(benzyl)-ATP and PP1 analogs interact with analog-specific PKCδ.SignificanceThis study provides tools to investigate PKCδ-mediated pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2008680918,"The primary pathway of TTP synthesis in the heart requires thymidine salvage by mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (TK2). However, the compartmentalization of this pathway and the transport of thymidine nucleotides are not well understood. We investigated the metabolism of [(3)H]thymidine or [(3)H]TMP as precursors of [(3)H]TTP in isolated intact or broken mitochondria from the rat heart. The results demonstrated that [(3)H]thymidine was readily metabolized by the mitochondrial salvage enzymes to TTP in intact mitochondria. The equivalent addition of [(3)H]TMP produced far less [(3)H]TTP than the amount observed with [(3)H]thymidine as the precursor. Using zidovudine to inhibit TK2, the synthesis of [(3)H]TTP from [(3)H]TMP was effectively blocked, demonstrating that synthesis of [(3)H]TTP from [(3)H]TMP arose solely from the dephosphorysynthase pathway that includes deoxyuridine triphosphatelation of [(3)H]TMP to [(3)H]thymidine. To determine the role of the membrane in TMP metabolism, mitochondrial membranes were disrupted by freezing and thawing. In broken mitochondria, [(3)H]thymidine was readily converted to [(3)H]TMP, but further phosphorylation was prevented even though the energy charge was well maintained by addition of oligomycin A, phosphocreatine, and creatine phosphokinase. The failure to synthesize TTP in broken mitochondria was not related to a loss of membrane potential or inhibition of the electron transport chain, as confirmed by addition of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone and potassium cyanide, respectively, in intact mitochondria. In summary, these data, taken together, suggest that the thymidine salvage pathway is compartmentalized so that TMP kinase prefers TMP synthesized by TK2 over medium TMP and that this is disrupted in broken mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2082273167,"Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels play a key role in initiating muscle excitation-contraction coupling, neurotransmitter release, gene expression, and hormone secretion. The association of CaV1.2 with a supramolecular complex impacts trafficking, localization, turnover, and, most importantly, multifaceted regulation of its function in the heart. Several studies hint at an important role for the C terminus of the α1C subunit as a hub for multidimensional regulation of CaV1.2 channel trafficking and function. Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for the four-residue PDZ binding motif at the C terminus of α1C in interacting with scaffold proteins containing PDZ domains, in the subcellular localization of CaV1.2 in neurons, and in the efficient signaling to cAMP-response element-binding protein in neurons. However, the role of the α1C PDZ ligand domain in the heart is not known. To determine whether the α1C PDZ motif is critical for CaV1.2 trafficking and function in cardiomyocytes, we generated transgenic mice with inducible expression of an N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged dihydropyridine-resistant α1C with the PDZ motif deleted (ΔPDZ). These mice were crossed with α-myosin heavy chain reverse transcriptional transactivator transgenic mice, and the double-transgenic mice were fed doxycycline. The ΔPDZ channels expressed, trafficked to the membrane, and supported robust excitation-contraction coupling in the presence of nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker, providing functional evidence that they appropriately target to dyads. The ΔPDZ Ca2+ channels were appropriately regulated by isoproterenol and forskolin. These data indicate that the α1C PDZ motif is not required for surface trafficking, localization to the dyad, or adrenergic stimulation of CaV1.2 in adult cardiomyocytes.The mechanisms responsible for CaV1.2 regulation by the α1C C terminus are unknown.ResultsTrafficking, basal function, and adrenergic modulation of CaV1.2 were not altered in cardiomyocytes of transgenic mice expressing PDZ-deleted α1C.ConclusionPDZ-mediated interactions are not required for CaV1.2 trafficking and function in the heart.SignificanceThe regulation of CaV1.2 by auxiliary proteins does not depend on the PDZ ligand motif in the heart.

https://openalex.org/W2033442200,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. It is the causative agent of the disease syndrome called West Nile fever. In some human cases, a WNV infection can be associated with severe neurological symptoms. The immune response to WNV is multifactorial and includes both humoral and cellular immunity. T-cell epitope mapping of the WNV envelope (E) protein has been performed in C57BL/6 mice, but not in BALB/c mice. Therefore, we performed in BALB/c mice a T-cell epitope mapping using a series of peptides spanning the WNV envelope (E) protein. To this end, the WNV-E specific T cell repertoire was first expanded by vaccinating BALB/c mice with a DNA vaccine that generates subviral particles that resemble West Nile virus. Furthermore, the WNV structural protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as a series of overlapping 20-mer peptides fused to a carrier-protein. Cytokine-based ELISPOT assays using these purified peptides revealed positive WNV-specific T cell responses to peptides within the different domains of the E-protein."

We investigated the planning study of FFF beams with their role for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp.One patient with squamous cell carcinoma which had involvement of entire scalp was subjected to VMAT using TrueBeam linear accelerator. As it was a rare skin malignancy, CT data of 7 patients with brain tumors were also included in this study, and their entire scalps were outlined as target volumes. Three VMAT plans were employed with RapidArc form: two half-field full-arcs VMAT using 6 MV standard beams (HFF-VMAT-FF), eight half-field quarter-arcs VMAT using 6 MV standard beams (HFQ-VMAT-FF), and HFQ-VMAT using FFF beams (HFQ-VMAT-FFF). Prescribed dose was 25 × 2 Gy (50 Gy). Plan quality and efficiency were assessed for all plans.There were no statistically significant differences among the three VMAT plans in target volume coverage, conformity, and homogeneity. For HFQ-VMAT-FF plans, there was a significant decrease by 12.6% in the mean dose to the brain compared with HFF-VMAT-FF. By the use of FFF beams, the mean dose to brain in HFQ-VMAT-FFF plans was further decreased by 7.4% compared with HFQ-VMAT-FF. Beam delivery times were similar for each technique.The HFQ-VMAT-FF plans showed the superiority in dose distributions compared with HFF-VMAT-FF. HFQ-VMAT-FFF plans might provide further normal tissue sparing, particularly in the brain, showing their potential for radiation therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp."
https://openalex.org/W2041864099,"All biomaterials initiate a tissue response when implanted in living tissues. Ultimately this reaction causes fibrous encapsulation and hence isolation of the material, leading to failure of the intended therapeutic effect of the implant. There has been extensive bioengineering research aimed at overcoming or delaying the onset of encapsulation. Nanotechnology has the potential to address this problem by virtue of the ability of some nanomaterials to modulate interactions with cells, thereby inducing specific biological responses to implanted foreign materials. To this effect in the present study, we have characterised the growth of fibroblasts on nano-structured sheets constituted by BaTiO3, a material extensively used in biomedical applications. We found that sheets of vertically aligned BaTiO3 nanotubes inhibit cell cycle progression - without impairing cell viability - of NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells. We postulate that the 3D organization of the material surface acts by increasing the availability of adhesion sites, promoting cell attachment and inhibition of cell proliferation. This finding could be of relevance for biomedical applications designed to prevent or minimize fibrous encasement by uncontrolled proliferation of fibroblastic cells with loss of material-tissue interface underpinning long-term function of implants."
https://openalex.org/W2082374456,"In the current age of commercial and financial openness, remote and poor local economies are becoming increasingly exposed to inflows of external capital. The new investors - enjoying lower credit constraints than local dwellers - might play a propulsive role in local development. At the same time, inflows of external capital can have negative impacts on local natural resource-dependent activities. We analyze a two-sector model where both sectors damage the environment, but only that of domestic producers relies on natural resources. We assess under which conditions the coexistence of the two sectors is compatible with sustainability, defined as convergence to a stationary state characterized by a positive stock of the natural resource. Moreover, we find that capital inflows can be stimulated by an increase in the pollution intensity of incoming activities, but also in the pollution intensity of the domestic sector; in both cases, capital inflows generate environmental degradation and a decrease in welfare for the local population. Finally, we show that a reduction in the cost of capital for external investors and the consequent capital inflows have the effect to increase wages, local investments and welfare of the local populations only if the environmental impact of the external sector is relatively low with respect to that of local activities. Otherwise, an unexpected scenario characterized by a reduction in domestic capital accumulation and the impoverishment of local agents can occur."
