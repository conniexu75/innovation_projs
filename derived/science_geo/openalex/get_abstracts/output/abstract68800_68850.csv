https://openalex.org/W1609008040,"Abstract The interaction between highly purified rabbit muscle phosphorylase kinase and Ca2+ has been investigated and this metal has been shown to be necessary for enzyme activity. Utilizing calcium-free reagents, apparent Km values for Ca2+ were determined for the activated kinase (2 x 10-7 m at pH 8.2, 5 x 10-7 m at pH 6.8) and for the nonactivated kinase (3 x 10-6 m at pH 8.2, indeterminate at pH 6.8). Direct binding of Ca2+ to phosphorylase kinase was studied by the method of gel filtration equilibrium using 45Ca and an approximate minimal molar binding weight of 55,000 g was assigned. The dissociation constants of the various Ca2+-kinase complexes were in the same range as the above listed Km values. Sr2+ and Ba2+ were found to substitute for Ca2+ in the phosphorylase kinase reaction; the enzyme-bound Ca2+ was totally exchangeable with Sr2+. A freshly isolated fraction of sarcoplasmic reticulum from rabbit skeletal muscle completely inhibited nonactivated phosphorylase kinase at pH 7.6; this inhibition was reversed by Ca2+. The activated kinase was inhibited 80% under the same conditions. A model system is proposed for the regulation of skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase by Ca2+ in vivo, and the consequent linking of the process of glycogenolysis to that of muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1518489158,"Among the most controversial hypotheses of aging are those which involve the progressive accumulation of error-bearing or altered macromolecules with advancing age. The effect of low levels of error or of alterations in only one or a small number of the many macromolecular mitochondrial components might be amplified by the highly integrated process of mitochondrial biosynthesis and observed as a change in turnover rates. The turnover rates of mitochondria from a variety of tissues of young adult (12-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) rats were measured by following the loss of radioactivity from proteins of purified mitochondrial preparations after initial labeling with 3H-leucine. Mitochondria from liver, brain, heart, and testes appeared to lose label as a homogeneous class with respect to rate. However, mitochondria from kidney, lung, and intestinal mucosa exhibited at least one additional exponential component. No significant differences were found for any tissue between the two age groups. Estimates for the half-lives in days obtained by combining both young and old sets of data are: liver, 9.3; testes, 12.6; heart, 17.5; brain 24.4; small intestine, 0.7 (first) and 17.6 (second); lung, 4 (first) and 16.6 (second); and kidney, 6 (first) and 10.9 (second). It is concluded that these data do not support the concept that errors in macromolecules are accumulated with age."

It appears as a unique disk-shaped particle with major axis measuring 400 to 600 angstroms and minor axis measuring about 100 angstroms. Chemical analysis, viscosity measurements, and x-ray diffraction analysis of purified preparations indicate that the particle, consisting of a one-to-one molar mixture of cholesterol and choline phosphatides associated with a small amount of protein, is a flattened vesicle, the wall of which is a continuous lipid bilayer."

Bilaterally symmetrical potentials were seen with analogous, nonspeech control gestures. These potentials began up to 1 second before word or gesture articulation. These results are the first demonstration of localization of language production in normal human brain."
https://openalex.org/W1973867465,"The degree of interaction of component waves making up a single electroencephalogram trace was strongly correlated with alpha activity, lead placement, and state of consciousness. Significant quadratic coupling of the waves was found only for awake subjects with high alpha activity. For these subjects about 50 percent of beta activity can be attributed to harmonic coupling with the alpha peak. During sleep, the degree of interaction was of borderline significance and did not follow a consistent pattern with respect to subject, frequency, state, or lead."
https://openalex.org/W1603357054,"Abstract Quantitative studies were carried out on the uptake and binding of 3H-estrogen in the cytoplasm of rat uterus and the subsequent appearance of the estrogen in the nuclear fraction. At high levels of estrogen (2 x 10-8m) the 8 S binding protein in the cytosol rapidly (within 5 min) became saturated with estrogen, and within 1 hour 90% had disappeared from the cytoplasm. Concomitantly, the estrogen appeared in the nucleus. Lower concentrations of estrogen result in peaks of cytoplasmic binding at 15 to 60 min. The estrogen-binding protein extracted from the nuclear fraction was unable to bind additional estrogen, indicating that its binding sites were saturated. Movement of estrogen into the nucleus showed a straight line relationship with concentration at all levels of saturation. This strongly suggests that the native state of the estrogen-binding protein has a single estrogen binding site."

https://openalex.org/W2009330496,"Dopamine, synthesized in rat brain slices from labeled L-tyrosine or L-dopa, can be released by electrical stimulation of a type known to induce neuronal depolarization. Pretreatment of the animals with 6-hydroxydopamine, which destroys central catecholamine-containing nerve terminals, substantially reduced the release of dopamine synthesized from [(14)C]tyrosine or from a low concentration of [(3)H]dopa, whereas the release of dopamine formed from a high concentration of [(3)H]dopa remained essentially unchanged. The observations that at high concentrations L-dopa may enter noncatecholaminergic cells, undergo decarboxylation to dopamine, and subsequently be liberated in response to depolarization suggest that dopamine may act as a substitute central transmitter, possibly in serotonergic neurons. This mechanism may contribute to L-dopa's clinical effects in parkinsonian patients."
https://openalex.org/W1505275687,"Crystalline bovine liver rhodanese, prepared by ammonium sulfate and pH precipitation, has been shown to be comprised of two fully active components present in approximately equal amounts which are separable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by ion exchange chromatography. The two rhodanese forms, designated A and B on the basis of their order of elution from columns of DEAE-Sephadex, are not in equilibrium nor do they represent free enzyme and an enzyme-substrate complex. Furthermore, the two rhodanese species are identical with respect to kinetic parameters, amino acid composition, NH2-terminal amino acid, sulfhydryl content, tryptic peptide maps, and molecular weight. Both forms exhibit equal activity toward β-mercaptopyruvate and utilize this sulfur donor at an efficiency of about 1% that of thiosulfate. Although no chemical or physical basis for the difference between the two rhodanese forms has been found as yet, a new, milder method for the preparation of the enzyme yields a preponderance of rhodanese A (85 to 90%). This, considered together with the elution characteristics of rhodaneses A and B, suggests that rhodanese B may arise during the course of the purification by deamidation of the A form."
https://openalex.org/W1552083732,"Abstract The stability to pH and denaturing agents of crystalline leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens) (EC 3.4.1.1) is reported. The native enzyme exhibited a molecular weight of 327,000. In 7 m urea below pH 3 and in ≥3.7 m guanidinium chloride below pH 8.5, both leucine aminopeptidase and its reduced and carboxamidomethylated derivative exhibited a molecular weight on equilibrium centrifugation of 54,000 ± 4000 in the presence or absence of mercaptoethanol. A similar value (57,000) for the subunit of the enzyme or its carboxamidomethylated derivative was found on gel electrophoresis after incubation in 0.1 to 1.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate in the presence of mercaptoethanol."

R., Biochemistry, 6, 730 (1967)), is shown to be essentially homogeneous by disc gel electrophoresis and sedimentation velocity analysis. The weight average molecular weight is 103,700, determined by both high speed and low speed sedimentation equilibrium techniques at pH 4.6, which is the approximate isoelectric point. The partial specific volume was determined to be 0.717 at this pH. The enzyme possesses an absorption spectrum showing a maximum at 280.5 nm with E280.50.1% = 1.15 and considerable fine structure in the region of 250 to 270 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1536572998,"Abstract The properties of d-glucose transport by isolated fat cell membrane preparations have been studied by measuring directly the rates of sugar accumulation and efflux. Observations are made under conditions in which zero order kinetics prevails and during which no detectable metabolic alteration of glucose occurs. The initial velocities measured are proportional to the amount of membrane material present. This is a relatively simple model system which permits direct study of glucose transport and insulin action. The rate of d-glucose accumulation is a temperature-dependent process. In contrast to l-glucose accumulation, d-glucose transport rapidly reaches a steady state, displays saturation kinetics with respect to substrate, is inhibited by 3-O-methyl glucose but not by l-glucose, is markedly suppressed by low concentrations of phloretin, and is enhanced by insulin. The transport process is not coupled to energy-producing metabolic processes, and no accumulation occurs against a chemical gradient. The unidirectional efflux of d-glucose from fat cell membranes has been studied separately. This process is also temperature-dependent, energy (metabolic)-independent, stereospecific, saturable with respect to the concentration of glucose inside the membrane, and sensitive to the presence of insulin or phloretin in the medium external to the membrane. The kinetic rate constants for efflux (Kt, 0.2 mm; Vmax, 3.8) differ from those calculated from the influx data (Kt, 3.3 mm; Vmax, 12.3). Although these differences may reflect differences in the biological function of the membrane surfaces, they do not constitute definitive proof of asymmetry of the transport structures or processes. Evidence for the operation of a mobile carrier mechanism of facilitated diffusion was obtained by detecting accelerated exchange diffusion. The unidirectional d-glucose flux from the inside of the membranes into a medium containing negligible glucose is accelerated by the presence of 3-O-methyl glucose in the medium. This suggests that the rate of transfer of free carrier from the outside to the inside phases of the membrane is a limiting process in the outward movement of the d-glucose-carrier complex."

https://openalex.org/W1561259756,"Abstract Cathepsin D was prepared from bovine uterus by homogenization, acid dialysis, (NH4)2SO4 concentration, dioxane fractionation, and chromatography on Sephadex G-100 and DEAE-Sephadex. A purification of 1000-fold has been achieved and the recovery exceeds 40%. The resulting product contains a large number of distinct forms of cathepsin D as shown by disc electrophoresis. The preparation appears to be free of contaminating acid proteases and peptidases as shown by the failure to digest 16 synthetic peptides commonly used as substrates for these enzymes. The specificity of the enzyme was studied with the B chain of insulin as a substrate. Major points of cleavage were found at Leu15-Tyr16, Phe24-Phe25, and Phe25-Tyr26. Additional points of cleavage included Phe1-Val2, Glu13-Ala14, Ala14-Leu15, Tyr16-Leu17. This specificity indicates that this enzyme from the bovine uterus belongs to the cathepsin D family of proteases. The enzyme showed maximum stability in the pH range 5 to 7. Activity was rapidly lost when the enzyme was heated to 60° at pH 6.3. The apparent molecular weight was estimated to be 43,000 based on molecular sieving on Sephadex G-100 and G-75 columns. The hydrolysis of denatured hemoglobin by cathepsin D is inhibited by high concentrations (0.01 m) of heavy metal ions and by high salt concentrations (ionic strength = 0.3). Dithiothreitol (1 mm), 3-p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (5 mm), and vitamin A (1 mm) are moderately inhibitory."

https://openalex.org/W2001539905,The topographical distribution of H-2 antigens on the surfaces of C57BL/6 mouse thymocytes and lymph-node lymphocytes was investigated by a new technique. Single cells were reacted with visually labeled antibody directed against H-2 antigen. Each cell was processed for electron microscopy individually and was serially sectioned. Models constructed from serial electron micrographs provided detailed views of the entire cell surface and showed that H-2 antigen occurs on thymocytes in small isolated regions and on lymphocytes in large interconnected regions.
https://openalex.org/W1549070022,"Erythropoietin induces the synthesis of 9 S RNA and hemoglobin by cultured bone marrow cells derived from polycythemic rats and mice in which hemoglobin synthesis has been suppressed. Synthesis of 9 S RNA starts within 1 hour (rat cells) and 4 hours (mouse cells) of addition of erythropoietin to the medium, while hemoglobin synthesis is not initiated until 8 to 10 hours later. These findings indicate that there is another regulatory step between transcription, initiated by erythropoietin, and translation. Under conditions in which no hemoglobin synthesis occurs, bone marrow cells still synthesize a very small amount of 9 S RNA which may be a messenger for a protein other than globin. Comparison of stimulated hemoglobin synthesis by cells from normal animals with cells from polycythemic animals indicates that erythropoietin has an effect on some differentiated cells in the former population as well as on the undifferentiated cells in the latter population."

https://openalex.org/W1572734510,"Abstract The molecular weight of Penicillium chrysogenum ATP-sulfurylase (ATP-sulfate adenylyl transferase, EC 2.7.7.4) has been shown to be between 425,000 and 440,000. Other physical parameters determined were: s20,w = 13.0, Stokes' radius = 72 A, D20,w = 2.94 x 10-7 cm3·sec-1, and v = 0.733 cm3·g-1. The carboxymethylated enzyme breaks down to subunits having a molecular weight of approximately 56,000 in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Titration of the enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reveals that there are eight reactive sulfhydryl equivalents per 440,000 g. This, together with the molecular weight of the subunit and amino acid analysis, suggests that the enzyme is an octamer containing one free sulfhydryl and four disulfides per protomer. Kinetic studies have shown that the actual substrate for the reaction is the ATP-Mg2- complex and that free ATP is a competitive inhibitor with respect to both ATP-Mg2- and MoO42- (Ki = 0.6 to 1.25 mm). The Km for ATP-Mg2- at saturating MoO42- is 4.6 x 10-5 m. The Km for MoO42- at saturating ATP-Mg2- is 1.5 x 10-4 m. In the reverse direction, the Km values for adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate and PPi are 7.1 x 10-6 and 7.7 x 10-5 m, respectively. Initial velocity studies and isotope exchange experiments show that the mechanism of the reaction is of the sequential type. The enzyme is inhibited by adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (Ki = 4 x 10-5 m) and by sulfide. The inhibition by sulfide is sigmoidal. Sulfide also changes the molybdate concentration dependence from a hyperbolic to a sigmoidal form. The changes in the level of ATP-sulfurylase when mycelia are grown on different sulfur sources suggest that the synthesis of the enzyme is repressed by methionine, or some close metabolite of methionine."
https://openalex.org/W1555152729,"Abstract The rate of turnover of rat liver fatty acid synthetase has been measured in animals tested under steady state conditions. The value obtained for the half-life varied from 71 to 108 hours. The exchange rate of the covalently bound prosthetic group, 4'-phosphopantotheine, with unbound pantothenate compounds was found to be more than an order of magnitude greater than the half-life of the enzyme complex. A model is proposed in which the prosthetic group, or some small portion of the enzyme complex containing the prosthetic group, is periodically removed from and replaced on the larger fatty acid synthetase moiety, such action taking place many times before an individual complex is catabolized. Moreover, this exchange is not part of the catalytic function of an enzyme complex, but may be a means of control of over all fatty acid synthetase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2084929367,"Rats assayed by the technique of conditional suppression were able to detect the presence of 12.25-centimeter microwaves at doses of power approximating 0.5 to 6.4 milliwatts per gram. The assay, which controlled for sensitization, for pseudo and temporal conditioning, and for several possible sources of artifactual cueing, revealed that irradiation by microwaves, although lacking the saliency of an auditory stimulus, can function as a highly reliable cue. Efficiency of detection was strongly and positively related to the amount of microwave energy to which the rats were exposed."
https://openalex.org/W1485416377,"Abstract The amount of λ exonuclease that binds to DNA is increased when single stranded interruptions are made in the DNA either by pancreatic DNase or by the decay of 3H label. Free ends of DNA are not required for binding, since λ exonuclease binds to the hydrogen-bonded circular form of λ DNA (Hershey circle) which has two intrinsic single stranded interruptions. The strength of binding to ends is greater than the binding to secondary sites: nicks introduced by pancreatic DNase provide neither new substrate nor sites that competitively inhibit the action of exonuclease at ends. The binding of λ exonuclease to DNA can also be shown by the trapping of DNA on nitrocellulose filters that is dependent on λ exonuclease. A preparation of β protein did not cause the trapping of DNA but appeared to augment the trapping caused by exonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W2064598870,"By means of electron microscopy of serial sections and three-dimensional reconstruction of the juxtaglomerular apparatus a quantitative study has been made of the distribution of the areas of contact between the tubular and vascular components. Of the two arterioles the efferent is the only one consistently in contact with the distal tubule. The extraglomerular mesangium is also in contact with the distal tubule in all the apparatuses examined. Two morphologically distinct types of contact are described; one is thought to be permanent and the other reversible. An analysis of the cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus for their position, granularity, and contact has revealed that the majority of granular cells are not in contact with the distal tubule. The anatomical findings are integrated in a model of the control of renin secretion based on variations in contact between the elements of the juxtaglomerular apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1562639579,"Abstract The nonspecific hexokinases of rat intestinal epithelium were isolated by diethylaminoethyl column chromatography. The major isoenzymes of hexokinase which were found were types I and II, but, in addition, the presence of types III and IV in small amounts was suggested. The nonspecific hexokinases were clearly separated from specific fructokinase and from N-acetylglucosamine kinase, an enzyme previously believed to be absent from intestine. Guinea pig intestine differed from rat intestine in three significant ways. (a) There was a relative increase of type II hexokinase compared to type I, and there was an absence of types III and IV; (b) guinea pig type II hexokinase was more sensitive to N-acetyl-glucosamine inhibition than was rat type II; and (c) hexokinase specific activity of guinea pig intestine was one-third that of the rat. Of the total hexokinase activity in both guinea pig and rat intestine, 50% was in a particulate form. Triton X-100 (0.5%) could solubilize 40% of this particulate hexokinase. The apparent solubilization of particulate hexokinase by 0.9 m KCl was counteracted by the marked inhibitory effect of KCl on both soluble and particulate hexokinases. KCl inhibition of hexokinase activity was proportional to KCl concentration and partly irreversible. The hexokinases of other rat organs were also inhibited by KCl. Purified intestinal epithelial microvilli had no demonstrable hexokinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2057517982,"Hybrids between two parental lines of somatic cells have been observed in various genomic multiplicities by ourselves and others. Possible explanations for the higher multiplicities include the fusion of cells in a 1:1 ratio with one genomic set undergoing an asynchronous replication either before or after fusion or the fusion of two or more cells. We now provide evidence for multiple genomic hybrids arising from the fusion of more than two cells in a mixture of three different cell lines. This proof is based on unique chromosomal and biochemical markers characteristic of the three parental cell lines. The distinctive phenotypes of all three lines are expressed in a clonally derived hybrid. Thus, we conclude that long-term, proliferating somatic cell hybrids can arise from the fusion of three or more cells."

https://openalex.org/W1670298691,"Abstract It is generally accepted that the C-20 cation or its stabilized equivalent is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of certain triterpenes and sterols. To evaluate this hypothesis the biosynthesis of the protosterol fusidic acid was investigated. Fusidic acid was biosynthesized by incubating the fungus Fusidium coccineum on a medium containing (3RS,4R)-(2-14C, 4-3H)-mevalonic acid (MVA). The obtained fusidic acid was shown to contain 6 14C atoms and 4 tritium atoms. It was proven that tritium atoms were located at the critically important 9β and 13α positions. Evidence was also adduced for the location of the remaining 2 tritium atoms at the 5α and 24 positions. The results show that the tritium atoms derived from 4-pro-R position of MVA are located at the theoretically predicted positions. Also this provides support for the view that fusidic acid is biosynthesized by stabilization of the C-20 cation (protosterol numbering) or its stabilized equivalent by elimination of the C-17 proton without backbone rearrangement. The retention of six 14C-atoms in the antibiotic confirms the view that in this fungus the transformation of the parent 4-gem dimethyl protosterol to fusidic acid involves the loss of the 4β-methyl derived from 3'-of MVA. The absence of isotopic hydrogen at C-3, proven by us, indicates that the removal of the 4β-methyl probably proceeds through a 3-keto intermediate. The possible modes of stabilization of the C-20 cation and the formation of the C-17—C-20 double bond are discussed."
