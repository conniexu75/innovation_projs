https://openalex.org/W2770319189,"Biased agonism has been proposed as a means to separate desirable and adverse drug responses downstream of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) targets. Herein, we describe structural features of a series of mu-opioid-receptor (MOR)-selective agonists that preferentially activate receptors to couple to G proteins or to recruit βarrestin proteins. By comparing relative bias for MOR-mediated signaling in each pathway, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the respiratory suppression/antinociception therapeutic window in a series of compounds spanning a wide range of signaling bias. We find that βarrestin-biased compounds, such as fentanyl, are more likely to induce respiratory suppression at weak analgesic doses, while G protein signaling bias broadens the therapeutic window, allowing for antinociception in the absence of respiratory suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2620827867,"The definition of neuronal type and how it relates to the transcriptome are open questions. Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) are among the best-characterized neuronal types: different PN classes target dendrites to distinct olfactory glomeruli, while PNs of the same class exhibit indistinguishable anatomical and physiological properties. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomes of most PN classes and unequivocally mapped transcriptomes to specific olfactory function for six classes. Transcriptomes of closely related PN classes exhibit the largest differences during circuit assembly but become indistinguishable in adults, suggesting that neuronal subtype diversity peaks during development. Transcription factors and cell-surface molecules are the most differentially expressed genes between classes and are highly informative in encoding cell identity, enabling us to identify a new lineage-specific transcription factor that instructs PN dendrite targeting. These findings establish that neuronal transcriptomic identity corresponds with anatomical and physiological identity defined by connectivity and function."
https://openalex.org/W2768617862,"Cholesterol is a critical nutrient requiring tight constraint in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to its uniquely challenging biophysical properties. While the mechanisms by which the ER defends against cholesterol insufficiency are well described, it remains unclear how the ER senses and effectively defends against cholesterol excess. Here, we identify the ER-bound transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor-1, Nrf1/Nfe2L1, as a critical mediator of this process. We show that Nrf1 directly binds to and specifically senses cholesterol in the ER through a defined domain and that cholesterol regulates Nrf1 turnover, processing, localization, and activity. In Nrf1 deficiency, in vivo cholesterol challenges induce massive hepatic cholesterol accumulation and damage, which is rescued by replacing Nrf1 exogenously. This Nrf1-mediated mechanism involves the suppression of CD36-driven inflammatory signaling and derepression of liver X receptor activity. These findings reveal Nrf1 as a guardian of cholesterol homeostasis and a core component of adaptive responses to excess cellular cholesterol."

Despite its critical role in both expression and replication of the mitochondrial genome, transcription initiation by mtRNAP remains poorly understood. Here, we report crystal structures of human mitochondrial transcription initiation complexes assembled on both light and heavy strand promoters. The structures reveal how transcription factors TFAM and TFB2M assist mtRNAP to achieve promoter-dependent initiation. TFAM tethers the N-terminal region of mtRNAP to recruit the polymerase to the promoter whereas TFB2M induces structural changes in mtRNAP to enable promoter opening and trapping of the DNA non-template strand. Structural comparisons demonstrate that the initiation mechanism in mitochondria is distinct from that in the well-studied nuclear, bacterial, or bacteriophage transcription systems but that similarities are found on the topological and conceptual level.

These results provide a framework for studying the regulation of gene expression and DNA replication in mitochondria. Transcription of the human mitochondrial genome is carried out by the single-subunit mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP), which initiates at the light-strand promoter (LSP) and the divergent heavy-strand promoter (HSP). In addition to its pivotal role in producing mitochondrial rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA, mtRNAP also generates the RNA primer required for replication of the mitochondrial genome (Agaronyan et al., 2015Agaronyan K.

Thus, transcription initiation is a key regulatory step for mitochondrial gene expression and for organelle biogenesis and maintenance. To achieve promoter-specific initiation, mtRNAP requires the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and the mitochondrial transcription factor B2 (TFB2M). Previous biochemical studies have established that TFAM functions in promoter recruitment (Gaspari et al., 2004Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. Larsson N.-G. Gustafsson C.M.

Thus, it remains elusive how TFAM and TFB2M cooperate with mtRNAP to enable transcription initiation. MtRNAP belongs to the polymerase A family of single-subunit (ss) DNA-dependent RNAPs, which also includes the well-studied RNAP from bacteriophage T7. All ssRNAPs share high sequence homology in their carboxy-terminal domains (CTDs) that form a fold resembling a right hand (Jeruzalmi and Steitz, 1998Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Structure of T7 RNA polymerase complexed to the transcriptional inhibitor T7 lysozyme.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4101-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, Kohlstaedt et al., 1992Kohlstaedt L.A.

Crystal structure at 3.5 A resolution of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase complexed with an inhibitor.Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). The CTD forms the catalytic core of these enzymes and comprises the conserved palm and the mobile fingers subdomains. The CTD also contains the “specificity loop”, a β-hairpin that binds the major groove of promoter DNA and forms base-specific contacts in T7 RNAP (Cheetham and Steitz, 1999Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Structure of a transcribing T7 RNA polymerase initiation complex.Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, Gleghorn et al., 2008Gleghorn M.L. Davydova E.K.

Cell. 2008; 32: 707-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite the conservation of the CTD, T7 RNAP does not require initiation factors and accomplishes DNA binding and opening independently (Cheetham et al., 1999Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Structural basis for initiation of transcription from an RNA polymerase-promoter complex.Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), in contrast to mtRNAP. This functional difference results mainly from distinct amino-terminal regions of ssRNAPs that show very limited homology and differ in size between these enzymes. In phage RNAPs, the amino-terminal regions contain a promoter-binding domain (PBD) (Durniak et al., 2008Durniak K.J. Bailey S. Steitz T.A. The structure of a transcribing T7 RNA polymerase in transition from initiation to elongation.Science. 2008; 322: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In T7 RNAP, the PBD forms a six-helix bundle that includes two DNA-binding elements, the intercalating hairpin, and the AT-rich recognition loop (Cheetham et al., 1999Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Structural basis for initiation of transcription from an RNA polymerase-promoter complex.Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Durniak et al., 2008Durniak K.J. Bailey S. Steitz T.A. The structure of a transcribing T7 RNA polymerase in transition from initiation to elongation.Science. 2008; 322: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The intercalating hairpin separates DNA strands during promoter opening and interacts with the DNA template strand (Cheetham and Steitz, 1999Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Structure of a transcribing T7 RNA polymerase initiation complex.Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, Gleghorn et al., 2008Gleghorn M.L. Davydova E.K.

Cell. 2008; 32: 707-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The AT-rich recognition loop binds the minor groove of upstream promoter DNA (Cheetham et al., 1999Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Structural basis for initiation of transcription from an RNA polymerase-promoter complex.Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Whereas the AT-rich recognition loop is reduced and appears to play no role in promoter binding, the specificity loop and intercalating hairpin of mtRNAP were suggested to be functional homologs of their T7 RNAP counterparts (Ringel et al., 2011Ringel R. Sologub M. Morozov Y.I. Litonin D. Cramer P. Temiakov D. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Nature. 2011; 478: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the positions observed for these elements in the apo structure of mtRNAP appear incompatible with promoter binding and opening, and hence, the structural basis for mtRNAP initiation and its dependency on transcription factors remains unknown. Here, we determine crystal structures of human TFB2M and mitochondrial ICs assembled on LSP and HSP DNA. The structures reveal the locations of TFAM and TFB2M on the mtRNAP surface and suggest how they enable recruitment of promoter DNA to mtRNAP and DNA opening. We also provide detailed comparisons of the IC structure with structures of functional complexes of T7 RNAP. Our results reveal the distinct nature of mitochondrial transcription initiation and its molecular basis. To investigate the mechanism of mitochondrial transcription initiation, we first completed the set of structures for the involved proteins by determining the structure of TFB2M. Extensive crystallization trials using full-length human TFB2M did not yield crystals. We therefore designed a variant lacking apparently flexible regions that may impair crystallization (STAR Methods). This variant, TFB2Mcryst, lacks 62 N-terminal residues and a predicted internal loop (residues 268–294) that was replaced by a short GSSG-linker. Functional characterization of this TFB2M variant shows that replacement of the internal loop does not affect the transcriptional activity (Figure S1C), whereas the N-terminal truncation of TFB2M reduces the activity due to its role in interactions with the priming nucleotide (Figure S1C) (Sologub et al., 2009Sologub M. Litonin D. Anikin M. Mustaev A. Temiakov D. TFB2 is a transient component of the catalytic site of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Cell. 2009; 139: 934-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). TFB2Mcryst yielded crystals that diffracted to 1.75 Å resolution, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement (Table S1). The refined model shows very good stereochemistry and contains residues 72–396 of TFB2M with the exception of a short flexible loop (residues 92–96). The structure (Figure 1) shows that TFB2M resembles the paralogous mitochondrial methyltransferase TFB1M (Guja et al., 2013Guja K.E. Venkataraman K. Yakubovskaya E. Shi H. Mejia E. Hambardjieva E. Karzai A.W. Garcia-Diaz M. Structural basis for S-adenosylmethionine binding and methyltransferase activity by mitochondrial transcription factor B1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 7947-7959Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the yeast mitochondrial transcription initiation factor Mtf1 (Schubot et al., 2001Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Crystal structure of the transcription factor sc-mtTFB offers insights into mitochondrial transcription.Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Figures S1A and S1B). As predicted from sequence homology, the N-terminal domain (NTD) (residues 72–305) adopts a fold-resembling S-adenosyl-methinonine-dependent methyltransferases with a central seven-stranded β sheet flanked on either side by three α helices (Martin and McMillan, 2002Martin J.L. McMillan F.M. SAM (dependent) I AM: the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase fold.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Similar to TFB1M and Mtf1, TFB2M deviates from the canonical methyltransferase fold by an insertion between β6 and β7, which corresponds to the region replaced with the GSSG linker in the crystallization construct (Guja et al., 2013Guja K.E. Venkataraman K. Yakubovskaya E. Shi H. Mejia E. Hambardjieva E. Karzai A.W. Garcia-Diaz M. Structural basis for S-adenosylmethionine binding and methyltransferase activity by mitochondrial transcription factor B1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 7947-7959Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Schubot et al., 2001Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Crystal structure of the transcription factor sc-mtTFB offers insights into mitochondrial transcription.Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, TFB2M displays a prominent loop insertion between β3 and α4 not found in either of the two other proteins. The CTD (residues 306–396) consists of four α helices and an extended C-terminal tail (residues 389–396), which is likely flexible in solution because density for this region was only observed for one of the two copies in asymmetric unit. The structure of TFB2M completes the set of high-resolution structures of proteins involved in mitochondrial transcription initiation. We then assembled a transcriptionally active IC consisting of TFAM, TFB2M, mtRNAP, and either LSP or HSP DNA containing a pre-melted region spanning register −4 to +3, which corresponds to the DNA region initially unwound around the transcription start site (TSS) +1 (Ramachandran et al., 2017Ramachandran A. Basu U. Sultana S. Nandakumar D. Patel S.S. Human mitochondrial transcription factors TFAM and TFB2M work synergistically in promoter melting during transcription initiation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 2: 861-874Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Figures S2A and S2B). After extensive optimization, crystals of the IC were obtained that diffracted to 4.5 Å resolution. The IC crystal structure was determined by a combination of molecular replacement and anomalous diffraction (Tables S2 and S3 and STAR Methods), which led to an interpretable electron density map (Figure S2E). The known structures of mtRNAP (Schwinghammer et al., 2013Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C.M. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and TFAM (Ngo et al., 2011Ngo H.B. Kaiser J.T. Chan D.C. The mitochondrial transcription and packaging factor Tfam imposes a U-turn on mitochondrial DNA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 1290-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were fitted into the electron density, and the newly obtained TFB2M structure could be unambiguously placed. Correct positioning of TFB2M was verified using an anomalous difference Fourier map that revealed selenium peaks for all nine methionine residues (Figure S2C). Most of the DNA, except for parts of the single-stranded region, could be built, and the correct sequence register was confirmed using anomalous diffraction from 5-bromouracil-labeled DNA scaffolds (Figure S2D and Table S3). This led to an atomic model for the IC refined to a free R factor of 31% (Table S2). We also solved a 4.5 Å resolution crystal structure of the IC assembled on the HSP promoter (Table S4). This structure was essentially identical to the LSP IC (root mean square deviation [rmsd] = 0.23 Å over 10,136 atoms) (Figure S2F), and in the following, we focus our discussion on the LSP IC. The IC structure (Figure 2B) reveals that mtRNAP is largely unchanged compared to the previously reported elongation complex (EC) structure (Schwinghammer et al., 2013Schwinghammer K. Cheung A.C.M. Morozov Y.I. Agaronyan K. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase elongation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the exception of the fingers domain, which adopts the “clenched” conformation observed in the apo enzyme (Ringel et al., 2011Ringel R. Sologub M. Morozov Y.I. Litonin D. Cramer P. Temiakov D. Structure of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Nature. 2011; 478: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Whereas the position of the downstream DNA duplex in the IC is identical to that observed in the EC, the upstream DNA occupies a different location, running along the NTD of mtRNAP. The conserved intercalating hairpin of mtRNAP separates the DNA strands at the upstream edge of the open DNA region observed in the active center cleft of the polymerase (Figures 2B and 3A ).Figure 3Promoter DNA Interactions in the IC and DNA BendingShow full caption(A) Schematic representation of protein-DNA interactions in the IC.

TFB2M contacts the intercalating hairpin and covers the junction between the upstream DNA duplex and the open DNA region (Figures 2B and 3A). TFAM binds DNA 16–39 nt upstream of the TSS and induces a ∼180° bend into DNA, resembling the free TFAM-DNA complex (Ngo et al., 2011Ngo H.B. Kaiser J.T. Chan D.C.

Temiakov D. A novel intermediate in transcription initiation by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3884-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), TFAM does not contact TFB2M but binds the NTD of mtRNAP at helix D. In addition to the severe upstream bend in the DNA induced by TFAM binding, the trajectory of the DNA is changed by ∼45° between mtRNAP and TFAM (Figure 3B). This is apparently caused by interactions of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain with the DNA backbone at register −10 to −15 (Figures 3B and 3C), where the DNA minor groove appears widened. In addition, the downstream DNA duplex in the IC encloses an angle of ∼135° relative to the upstream duplex at the point of DNA melting (Figure 3B). The IC structure explains how TFAM recruits mtRNAP to promoter DNA (Gaspari et al., 2004Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. Larsson N.-G. Gustafsson C.M.

The high-mobility group (HMG) Box B domain of TFAM interacts with a newly observed “tether” helix in the N-terminal extension of mtRNAP, thereby anchoring mtRNAP to the promoter (Figures 4 and S3A and Movie S1). The C-terminal tail of TFAM is located close to the PPR domain and residues 444–462 of mtRNAP (D-helix), consistent with published biochemical, genetic, and cross-linking data (Dairaghi et al., 1995aDairaghi D.J.

Here, we examined the effects of chronic stress on a prefrontal corticostriatal circuit that has been implicated in evaluation of cost, effort, and reward (Amemori and Graybiel, 2012Amemori K.

Paulus M.P. Neural systems underlying approach and avoidance in anxiety disorders.Dialogues Clin. Neurosci. 2010; 12: 517-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This circuit preferentially targets the neurochemically specialized striosomes in the rodent dorsomedial “associative” striatum, a striatal region affected by chronic stress along with the prefrontal cortex itself (Arnsten, 2015Arnsten A.F. Stress weakens prefrontal networks: molecular insults to higher cognition.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1376-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, Dias-Ferreira et al., 2009Dias-Ferreira E.

Chronic stress causes frontostriatal reorganization and affects decision-making.Science. 2009; 325: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). We earlier found that this prefronto-striosomal circuit selectively modulates decision-making under conditions of motivational conflict in which cost-benefit decisions must be made (Amemori and Graybiel, 2012Amemori K. Graybiel A.M. Localized microstimulation of primate pregenual cingulate cortex induces negative decision-making.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Friedman et al., 2015Friedman A. Homma D. Gibb L.G. Amemori K. Rubin S.J. Hood A.S. Riad M.H. Graybiel A.M. A corticostriatal path targeting striosomes controls decision-making under conflict.Cell. 2015; 161: 1320-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Optogenetic disconnection of the prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex (PFC-PL) from its putative striosomal targets in the dorsomedial striatum provoked rats to make abnormal choices in which they increased their choices of high-cost/high-reward options, mimicking abnormal decision-making and reflecting abnormal utility functions (Friedman et al., 2015Friedman A. Homma D. Gibb L.G. Amemori K. Rubin S.J. Hood A.S. Riad M.H. Graybiel A.M. A corticostriatal path targeting striosomes controls decision-making under conflict.Cell. 2015; 161: 1320-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Within the striatum, both projection neurons (SPNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) (Gage et al., 2010Gage G.J. Stoetzner C.R. Wiltschko A.B. Berke J.D. Selective activation of striatal fast-spiking interneurons during choice execution.Neuron. 2010; 67: 466-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, Tepper et al., 2004Tepper J.M. Koós T. Wilson C.J. GABAergic microcircuits in the neostriatum.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) were affected by this circuit disconnection. We trained rats and mice on the same cost-benefit conflict (CBC), benefit-benefit (BB), and cost-cost (CC) tasks and then exposed them to chronic stress and retested their performance. To our surprise, the behavioral effects of the chronic stress were nearly indistinguishable from those that we had found by optogenetically disconnecting the medial prefrontal cortex from its striosomal targets in the dorsomedial striatum (Friedman et al., 2015Friedman A. Homma D. Gibb L.G. Amemori K. Rubin S.J. Hood A.S. Riad M.H. Graybiel A.M. A corticostriatal path targeting striosomes controls decision-making under conflict.Cell. 2015; 161: 1320-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Behavioral performance was abnormal in the CBC task, but not in the other decision-making tasks. This striking similarity suggested that we might be able to identify specific prefronto-striatal circuit malfunctions induced by chronic stress. We therefore combined electrophysiological recording with optogenetic manipulations to compare cohorts of unstressed and chronically stressed rats and engineered mice in which we had preferential access to putative FSIs. We demonstrate that chronic stress radically alters the dynamic functioning of this prefronto-striosomal circuit by altering feed-forward inhibition in parallel with the induction of aberrant CBC decision-making. We show that we could block these effects of stress by optogenetically exciting striatal FSIs, that we could mimic these effects by optogenetically inhibiting striatal FSIs, and that we could model these effects in Hodgkin-Huxley models. These findings provide causal evidence that a prefronto-striatal circuit engaging striosomes is targeted specifically by chronic stress so as to produce a functional phenocopy of a prefronto-striosome disconnection syndrome. We compared groups of control and chronically stressed rats and mice for four different types of decision-making in T-maze tasks (Figure 1A; Method Details). The main CBC decision-making task presented a conflict between the choice of pure chocolate milk (high reward) paired with aversive strong light (high cost) and the choice of diluted chocolate milk (low reward) paired with dim light (low cost). We further introduced two BB decision-making tasks and a CC decision-making task. Animals were trained in stages and overtrained to minimize choice variability (Figure 1B). For each rat and mouse, we measured the psychometric function that related choice to concentration of chocolate milk and light intensity, and calibrated the concentration of diluted chocolate milk and strong light intensity to achieve similar decision-making boundaries for each rodent for each task (Figures 1C, S1A, and S1B). We then exposed cohorts of animals to 14 days of constraint or shock stress (Method Details), with control cohorts not exposed to stress, and then measured performance in the four decision-making tasks (n = 22 rats, n = 23 mice).Figure S1Effect of Chronic Stress on Behavior of Rats and Mice, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) An example of a psychometric function of a mouse performing CBC and BB tasks, with preference measured across concentrations, as in Figure 1C.

The effect of chronic stress on decision-making was strikingly selective. The stressed animals were significantly more likely to choose high-cost/high-reward options than matched controls in the CBC task (Figures 1D–1F and S1C–S1F), yet they performed like the control animals in the BB and CC tasks after restraint stress and differed from controls only in the CC task after foot-shock stress. The choice variability in the CBC sessions was also increased in the stressed animals (Figures S1E and S1F). The penetrance of the effects was high across gender, stress protocol, and mouse strain (Figure S1F). These effects coincided with marked shifts in the psychometric functions measured in the rats by incrementally changing the concentration of reward across sessions (Figures 1G, S1G, and S1H). We modeled these psychometric functions to parameterize the condition in which the choice behavior exhibited four- and two-parameter sigmoidal curves (Figures 1H–1J and S1I–S1L; Method Details). The range of options in which the choice behavior could be characterized by the psychometric curves was markedly different between control and stressed animals. As the concentration of the diluted chocolate milk of the low-cost side increased, the control rats began to choose that option, following a linear function paralleling the increasing utility (Train, 2002Train K.E. Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation.Volume 8. Cambridge University Press, 2002Google Scholar) of the low-cost/low-reward option. However, the stressed rats began responding to increases in utility only after large increases in chocolate concentration of the diluted chocolate milk, and when they did so, suddenly began to choose the low-cost/low-reward side, following a step function. These results indicate that the animals exposed to chronic stress failed to exhibit normal integration of cost and benefit over most of the large range of cost-benefit options. That we observed no clear effect of the chronic stress on decisions made in the BB and CC tasks was surprising, given evidence that links chronic stress with anxiety and anhedonia (Ampuero et al., 2015Ampuero E. Luarte A. Santibañez M. Varas-Godoy M. Toledo J. Diaz-Veliz G. Cavada G. Rubio F.J. Wyneken U. Two chronic stress models based on movement restriction in rats respond selectively to antidepressant drugs: aldolase c as a potential biomarker.Int. J.

In a two-bottle sucrose-preference test, the previously stressed rats exhibited diminished choices of sucrose over water, but in a test with chocolate milk, the pure chocolate milk preference was not affected (Figures S1M and S1N). We also found no difference in light avoidance behavior between the control and stressed groups (Figures S1O and S1P). We found no significant difference in run times or in previous choices on subsequent decisions across choice sequences for stressed and non-stressed rats (Figures S1Q–S1S). To examine the potential cellular effects of chronic stress on neurons in this prefronto-striatal circuit, we recorded the spike activity in the PFC-PL cortex (Figure S2A), and we also identified a sub-population of the PFC-PL neurons that project to the striatum (PFC-PLs neurons) (Figure 2A; Method Details). The average firing rates over the entire recording window were reduced for both PFC-PL and PFC-PLs units in the stressed animals (Figure 2B). Chronic stress affected activity in three sub-periods: activity during the pre-click baseline and click-to-turn periods was reduced after stress, whereas the lick sub-period had higher activity after stress (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2B–S2F). There was no change in PFC-PLs firing rate during the BB task with similar rewards (BBS) (Figure S2G).Figure 2Effect of Chronic Stress and Optogenetic Manipulation of the PFC-PLsShow full caption(A) Antidromic stimulation to identify PFC-PL neurons that project to the striatum (PFC-PLs neurons, left), and raster plot (top) and histogram (bottom) for an identified PFC-PLs neuron (right).(B) PFC-PL (left) and PFC-PLs (right) firing rates in control and stressed rats. ∗p < 0.01 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and t test).

Recent studies on abnormal repeat proteins, especially in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases caused by nucleotide repeat expansion, have highlighted or identified two forms of unconventional translation initiation: usage of AUG-like sites (near cognates) or repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. We discuss how repeat proteins may differ due to not just unconventional initiation, but also ribosomal frameshifting and/or imperfect repeat DNA replication, expansion, and repair, and we highlight how research on translation of repeats may uncover insights into the biology of translation and its contribution to disease.

In 1961, Marshall W. Nirenberg and his postdoctoral fellow Johann H. Matthaei at the National Institutes of Health found that mixing polyuridylic acid (poly-U) with cell-free extracts from E. coli resulted in the production of proteins made entirely of phenylalanine (Nirenberg and Matthaei, 1961Nirenberg M.W. Matthaei J.H. The dependence of cell-free protein synthesis in E. coli upon naturally occurring or synthetic polyribonucleotides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1961; 47: 1588-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Using additional synthetic RNAs, including those with repeating triplets, Nirenberg and H. Gobind Khorana produced different mono- and dipeptide proteins. Together, they deciphered the genetic code (Khorana, 1968Khorana H.G. Synthetic nucleic acids and the genetic code.JAMA. 1968; 206: 1978-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and, for this work, shared the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, along with Robert W. Holley, who first isolated tRNA. Today, translation in eukaryote cells is recognized to be a highly regulated process. Initiation is the rate-limiting step and thus is the phase of protein synthesis most subject to regulation (Richter and Sonenberg, 2005Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Regulation of cap-dependent translation by eIF4E inhibitory proteins.Nature. 2005; 433: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Although initiation itself is a multi-step process, it culminates in 5′ to 3′ “scanning” of a complex containing the 40S ribosome subunit—often referred to as a 43S preinitiation complex that includes a ternary complex (TC) of eIF2, GTP, and initiator methionine tRNA. Usually upon encountering the first AUG codon, which more often than not resides in a favorable context (the 5′ A/GCCAUGG 3′ Kozak sequence that promotes initiation [Kozak, 1986Kozak M. Point mutations define a sequence flanking the AUG initiator codon that modulates translation by eukaryotic ribosomes.Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar, Hinnebusch et al., 2016Hinnebusch A.G. Ivanov I.P. Sonenberg N. Translational control by 5′-untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs.Science. 2016; 352: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar]), the preinitiation complex stops and recruits the 60S subunit, and polypeptide elongation begins (Figure 1A ). 5′ to the classic AUG initiation codon, however, it is now clear that many RNAs have upstream open reading frames (uORFs), which can serve several different roles in translation. Some uORFs lack a stop codon and begin with a canonical AUG initiator codon in-frame with the downstream AUG. In these cases, “leaky” scanning may occur where peptide synthesis occurs at both the uORF and downstream open reading frames (ORFs), resulting in two peptides distinct only at the amino terminus (Hinnebusch et al., 2016Hinnebusch A.G. Ivanov I.P. Sonenberg N. Translational control by 5′-untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs.Science. 2016; 352: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Other uORFs can suppress or prevent translation at the downstream ORF when a stop codon is present between them because ribosome re-initiation is not robust (Figure 1B). Moreover, scanning 40S ribosomal subunits can sometimes bypass the uORF altogether and initiate translation at the downstream AUG codon, which can be particularly robust when the uORF acts as an enhancer of downstream initiation (Ivanov et al., 2010Ivanov I.P. Atkins J.F. Michael A.J. A profusion of upstream open reading frame mechanisms in polyamine-responsive translational regulation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). With the advent of next-generation sequencing and ribosome profiling, which together can map the positions and relative amounts of ribosomes on mRNA (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar), the following has become clear: (1) Most mRNAs have uORFs; and (2) These uORFs frequently use alternative (non-AUG) start codons. For example, Ingolia et al., 2011Ingolia N.T. Lareau L.F. Weissman J.S. Ribosome profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells reveals the complexity and dynamics of mammalian proteomes.Cell. 2011; 147: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar and Lee et al., 2012Lee S. Liu B. Lee S. Huang S.-X. Shen B. Qian S.-B. Global mapping of translation initiation sites in mammalian cells at single-nucleotide resolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2424-E2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar performed ribosome profiling in cultured cells in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, which binds both initiating and elongating ribosomes, or of other drugs such as harringtonine and lactimidomycin, which bind initiating ribosomes with an exit (E) site that is devoid of tRNA. These drugs allow elongating ribosomes to run off the mRNA while maintaining the initiating ribosome in place, thereby enabling start codon identification on a global basis following sequencing of the RNAs protected by this initiating ribosome (an approach called global translation initiation sequencing, or GTI-seq). These and related analyses (e.g., Bazzini et al., 2014Bazzini A.A. Johnstone T.G. Christiano R. Mackowiak S.D. Obermayer B. Fleming E.S. Vejnar C.E. Lee M.T. Rajewsky N. Walther T.C. Giraldez A.J.

Many lncRNAs, 5’UTRs, and pseudogenes are translated and some are likely to express functional proteins.eLife. 2015; 4: e08890Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) have revealed that > 50% of mRNAs contain uORFs that are occupied by ribosomes, in close agreement with a similar proportion estimated by an earlier RNA-seq effort (Calvo et al., 2009Calvo S.E. Pagliarini D.J. Mootha V.K. Upstream open reading frames cause widespread reduction of protein expression and are polymorphic among humans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 7507-7512Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Use of GTI-seq has also demonstrated remarkable variation in translation initiation sites (uORF and ORF), with only 51% beginning with AUG, 16% with CUG, and 24% with other sequences (UUG, CUG, AGG, ACG, AAG, AUC, AUA, AUU). For uORFs in particular, 75% begin with non-AUG codons, with CUG (encoding leucine) being the most prevalent. The preponderance of uORFs implies widespread regulation of downstream ORF translation (Morris and Geballe, 2000Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Upstream open reading frames as regulators of mRNA translation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), and it is the TC component eIF2α that is the key factor controlling uORF utilization. Phosphorylation of eIF2α serine 51 inhibits the activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, which in turn impedes formation of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) and consequently reduces general translation. However, some mRNAs escape this inhibition and are translated even though they have uORFs. This is caused by stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation and resulting TC limitation, which render uORF initiation unfavorable; it is thus bypassed, and initiation occurs at the downstream AUG. Examples of mRNAs under this type of regulation encode such proteins as the transcription factors CHOP (CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) and ATF4 and ATF5, the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD34, among many others (Baird et al., 2014Baird T.D. Palam L.R. Fusakio M.E. Willy J.A. Davis C.M. McClintick J.N. Anthony T.G. Wek R.C. Selective mRNA translation during eIF2 phosphorylation induces expression of IBTKα.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 1686-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Young and Wek, 2016Young S.K. Wek R.C. Upstream open reading frames differentially regulate gene-specific translation in the integrated stress response.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 16927-16935Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Added to this, a peptide encoded by the uORF in CHOP mRNA regulates translation of the downstream ORF (Jousse et al., 2001Jousse C. Bruhat A. Carraro V. Urano F. Ferrara M. Ron D. Fafournoux P. Inhibition of CHOP translation by a peptide encoded by an open reading frame localized in the chop 5’UTR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4341-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). uORF regulation of translation and eIF2α phosphorylation are central components of an integrated stress response (Young and Wek, 2016Young S.K. Wek R.C. Upstream open reading frames differentially regulate gene-specific translation in the integrated stress response.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 16927-16935Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Four kinases respond to different environmental stresses and phosphorylate eIF2α serine 51: PERK responds to ER stress; HRI responds to oxidative stress and heat shock; PKR responds to viral infection; and GCN2 is a nutrient sensor. Correspondingly, cellular stress, through any one of these kinases, can modulate uORF and downstream ORF translation, which may result in unique biological responses depending on the cell type. One highly specialized cell type is the neuron, which can live for decades without undergoing cell division. Although these cells can endure even when encountering various stresses, in some neurological diseases, they undergo a remarkable molecular reorganization. Repeat expansion disorders are a set of more than 30 genetic diseases, mostly of the nervous system, that are caused by expansion of short repeat sequences of 3–6 nucleotides in a host gene’s coding sequences, introns, or 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) (Zhang and Ashizawa, 2017Zhang N. Ashizawa T. RNA toxicity and foci formation in microsatellite expansion diseases.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2017; 44: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). During the last two decades, unconventional translation products from various expanded repeat sequences have been repeatedly detected in the nervous system of affected individuals. Three mechanisms have been proposed to account for the generation of these disease-specific proteins: (1) ribosomal frameshifting (Gaspar et al., 2000Gaspar C. Jannatipour M. Dion P. Laganière J. Sequeiros J. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. CAG tract of MJD-1 may be prone to frameshifts causing polyalanine accumulation.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), (2) repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation (Zu et al., 2011Zu T. Gibbens B. Doty N.S. Gomes-Pereira M. Huguet A. Stone M.D. Margolis J. Peterson M. Markowski T.W. Ingram M.A. et al.Non-ATG-initiated translation directed by microsatellite expansions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), and (3) near-cognate start codon initiated translation (Sellier et al., 2017Sellier C. Buijsen R.A. He F. Natla S. Jung L. Tropel P. Gaucherot A. Jacobs H. Meziane H. Vincent A. et al.Translation of expanded CGG repeats into FMRpolyG is pathogenic and may contribute to Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome.Neuron. 2017; 93: 331-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Beginning with the work of Jacks and Varmus (Mardon and Varmus, 1983Mardon G. Varmus H.E. Frameshift and intragenic suppressor mutations in a Rous sarcoma provirus suggest src encodes two proteins.Cell. 1983; 32: 871-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Jacks and Varmus, 1985Jacks T. Varmus H.E. Expression of the Rous sarcoma virus pol gene by ribosomal frameshifting.Science. 1985; 230: 1237-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, Jacks et al., 1988Jacks T. Power M.D. Masiarz F.R. Luciw P.A. Barr P.J. Varmus H.E. Characterization of ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1 gag-pol expression.Nature. 1988; 331: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), it has become clear that most retroviruses, including HIV, utilize ribosomal frameshifting as an obligatory component of their life cycle. Frameshifting can be highly efficient and driven by a combination of a 7-base “slippery” RNA sequence and an RNA pseudoknot 3′ to the site of frameshifting (Chamorro et al., 1992Chamorro M. Parkin N. Varmus H.E. An RNA pseudoknot and an optimal heptameric shift site are required for highly efficient ribosomal frameshifting on a retroviral messenger RNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Beyond viruses, frameshifting is also found frequently in bacteria and known for some eukaryotic mRNAs (Caliskan et al., 2015Caliskan N. Peske F. Rodnina M.V. Changed in translation: mRNA recoding by -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40: 265-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar frameshifting appears to be a component in some polyglutamine diseases in which polyglutamine tracts are synthesized from expanded CAG repeats in frame with the coding regions of respective host genes (Orr and Zoghbi, 2007Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Trinucleotide repeat disorders.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 575-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). For example, in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), ataxin 3 contains CAG repeats whose in-frame translation produces an expanded polyglutamine track; however, polyalanine-containing proteins are also generated in patient neurons (Gaspar et al., 2000Gaspar C. Jannatipour M. Dion P. Laganière J. Sequeiros J. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. CAG tract of MJD-1 may be prone to frameshifts causing polyalanine accumulation.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using reporter constructs in which different tags were engineered into separate reading frames, polyalanine synthesis was initially proposed to be caused by ribosomal slippage into the GCA frame in a repeat-length-dependent manner, although the slippage site was not identified (Toulouse et al., 2005Toulouse A. Au-Yeung F. Gaspar C. Roussel J. Dion P. Rouleau G.A. Ribosomal frameshifting on MJD-1 transcripts with long CAG tracts.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2649-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In both Drosophila and mammalian neurons, production of polyalanine may be a key component of CAG repeat toxicity (Stochmanski et al., 2012Stochmanski S.J. Therrien M. Laganière J. Rochefort D. Laurent S. Karemera L. Gaudet R. Vyboh K. Van Meyel D.J. Di Cristo G. et al.Expanded ATXN3 frameshifting events are toxic in Drosophila and mammalian neuron models.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In Huntington’s disease (HD), the most common CAG repeat disease, the repeats are in-frame with the huntingtin ORF, producing polyglutamine after codon number 17 in huntingtin (HTT). Nevertheless, both polyserine and polyalanine—encoded by the +1 and −1 frames of expanded CAG repeats, respectively—have been detected in autopsy samples of HD patients and in a transgenic mouse model of HD (Davies and Rubinsztein, 2006Davies J.E. Rubinsztein D.C. Polyalanine and polyserine frameshift products in Huntington’s disease.J. Med. Genet. 2006; 43: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Bañez-Coronel et al., 2015Bañez-Coronel M. Ayhan F. Tarabochia A.D. Zu T. Perez B.A. Tusi S.K. Pletnikova O. Borchelt D.R. Ross C.A. Margolis R.L. et al.RAN Translation in Huntington Disease.Neuron. 2015; 88: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Frameshifting has been established to account for production of polyserine or polyalanine linked to the amino terminal portion of huntingtin. This frameshifting can occur within the expanded CAG repeats and is enhanced by depletion of the charged glutaminyl-tRNA that pairs to the CAG codon (Girstmair et al., 2013Girstmair H. Saffert P. Rode S. Czech A. Holland G. Bannert N. Ignatova Z. Depletion of cognate charged transfer RNA causes translational frameshifting within the expanded CAG stretch in huntingtin.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 148-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Detailed mass spectrometry and molecular analysis revealed that a UUCC sequence at the 5′ end of CAG repeats in the Huntingtin coding region initiates the +1 frameshifting, and the effect of the UUCC sequence is enhanced by increased formation of stem-loop structures by expanded CAG repeats, providing a specific molecular mechanism for potential ribosomal frameshifting in HD patient cells (Saffert et al., 2016Saffert P. Adamla F. Schieweck R. Atkins J.F. Ignatova Z. An expanded CAG repeat in Huntingtin causes +1 frameshifting.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 18505-18513Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Polyalanine has also been detected in tissues of patients with another CAG repeat disease (SCA8) and in mouse models of the disease (Zu et al., 2011Zu T. Gibbens B. Doty N.S. Gomes-Pereira M. Huguet A. Stone M.D. Margolis J. Peterson M. Markowski T.W. Ingram M.A. et al.Non-ATG-initiated translation directed by microsatellite expansions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Here, CAG repeats are in-frame with the coding sequence of ataxin 8 (ATXN8). Rather than frameshifting, it has been proposed that polyalanine is produced by a different, unconventional translation mechanism, repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation, in which initiation in any of the three reading frames within expanded CAG (or other) repeats is thought to occur internally (Zu et al., 2011Zu T. Gibbens B. Doty N.S. Gomes-Pereira M. Huguet A. Stone M.D. Margolis J. Peterson M. Markowski T.W. Ingram M.A. et al.Non-ATG-initiated translation directed by microsatellite expansions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar; Figure 1C), seemingly consistent with the internal ribosome binding of mRNA observed by Nirenberg and Khorana decades ago using cell-free extracts primed with synthetic polyribonucleotides (Nirenberg and Matthaei, 1961Nirenberg M.W. Matthaei J.H. The dependence of cell-free protein synthesis in E. coli upon naturally occurring or synthetic polyribonucleotides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sci. USA. 1964; 52: 1494-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Expression of engineered repeat-containing ATXN8 or HTT mRNA with multiple stop codons 5′ to the CAG repeats in the +1 and +2 frames has shown that RAN translation certainly occurs under certain experimental conditions (Zu et al., 2011Zu T. Gibbens B. Doty N.S. Gomes-Pereira M. Huguet A. Stone M.D. Margolis J. Peterson M. Markowski T.W. Ingram M.A. et al.Non-ATG-initiated translation directed by microsatellite expansions.Proc. Natl.

Whether this process requires poly(A) tail or other cis-elements remains unknown. Abnormal disease-specific repeat proteins proposed to be synthesized from both sense and antisense transcripts through RAN translation have also been detected in brain tissues of patients with CTG repeat expansion in the 3′UTR of DMPK in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) (Zu et al., 2011Zu T.

Thus, RAN translation is posited to be a general phenomenon in various repeat expansion disorders (Cleary and Ranum, 2017Cleary J.D. Ranum L.P. New developments in RAN translation: insights from multiple diseases.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2017; 44: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Near-cognate start codon-initiated translation is a third mechanism that can yield mono- or di-peptide-containing proteins from translation of nucleotide repeats. The founding example of this came from fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), which is caused by CGG expansion (55–200 repeats) in the 5′UTR of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene (Hagerman and Hagerman, 2016Hagerman R.J. Hagerman P. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome - features, mechanisms and management.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2016; 12: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The GGC frame of these repeats encodes polyglycine (FMRpolyG), which is indeed detected in FXTAS patient brains (Todd et al., 2013Todd P.K. Oh S.Y. Krans A. He F. Sellier C. Frazer M. Renoux A.J.

The production of polyglycine does not seem to be mediated by RAN translation; rather, it requires a cap-dependent scanning mechanism for translation initiation (Kearse et al., 2016Kearse M.G.

The expanded CGG repeats create a large uORF 5′ to the FMR1 open reading frame. Cap-dependent ribosome scanning that initiates at the ACG codon produces a protein with an N-terminal methionine and a short polypeptide, followed by polyglycine, and then a 42-amino-acid C terminus, all encoded by the sequences in what is typically annotated as the FMR1 5′UTR (Kearse et al., 2016Kearse M.G.

Both polyglycine and the 42-amino-acid C terminus that follows it appear to be key components driving disease, with deletion of the ACG near-cognate start codon abolishing polyglycine production and neurotoxicity (Sellier et al., 2017Sellier C.

The complexity of atypical translation in repeat expansion diseases is most apparent in ALS, a fatal paralytic disease, and in FTD, the second-most common form of pre-senile dementia. The most frequent genetic cause of these diseases is GGGGCC repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72, with up to thousands of copies in the affected areas of the human nervous system (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011DeJesus-Hernandez M.

However, rs-fMRI in infants has universally been obtained during sleep to reduce participant motion artifact, raising the question of whether differences in functional organization between awake adults and sleeping infants that are commonly attributed to development may instead derive, at least in part, from sleep. This question is especially important as rs-fMRI differences in adult wake vs. sleep are well documented. To investigate this question, we compared functional connectivity and BOLD signal propagation patterns in 6, 12, and 24 month old sleeping infants with patterns in adult wakefulness and non-REM sleep. We find that important functional connectivity features seen during infant sleep closely resemble those seen during adult sleep, including reduced default mode network functional connectivity. However, we also find differences between infant and adult sleep, especially in thalamic BOLD signal propagation patterns. These findings highlight the importance of considering sleep state when drawing developmental inferences in infant rs-fMRI."
https://openalex.org/W2770086481,"Research on impact of publicly financed health insurance has paid relatively little attention to the nature of healthcare provision the schemes engage. India's National Health Insurance Scheme or RSBY was made universal by Chhattisgarh State in 2012. In the State, public and private sectors provide hospital services in a context of extensive gender, social, economic and geographical inequities. This study examined enrolment, utilization (public and private) and out of pocket (OOP) expenditure for the insured and uninsured, in Chhattisgarh. The Chhattisgarh State Central sample (n = 6026 members) of the 2014 National Sample Survey (71st Round) on Health was extracted and analyzed. Variables of enrolment, hospitalization, out of pocket (OOP) expenditure and catastrophic expenditure were descriptively analyzed. Multivariate analyses of factors associated with enrolment, hospitalization (by sector) and OOP expenditure were conducted, taking into account gender, socio-economic status, residence, type of facility and ailment. Insurance coverage was 38.8%. Rates of hospitalization were 33/1000 population among the insured and 29/1000 among the uninsured. Of those insured and hospitalized, 67.2% utilized the public sector. Women, rural residents, Scheduled Tribes and poorer groups were more likely to utilize the public sector for hospitalizations. Although the insured were less likely to incur out of pocket (OOP) expenditure, 95.1% of insured private sector users and 66.0% of insured public sector users, still incurred costs. Median OOP payments in the private sector were eight times those in the public sector. Of households with at least one member hospitalized, 35.5% experienced catastrophic health expenditures (>10% monthly household consumption expenditure). The study finds that despite insurance coverage, the majority still incurred OOP expenditure. The public sector was nevertheless less expensive, and catered to the more vulnerable groups. It suggests the need to further examine the roles of public and private sectors in financial risk protection through government health insurance."
https://openalex.org/W2769657723,"In criminal investigations, forensic scientists need to evaluate DNA mixtures. The estimation of the number of contributors and evaluation of the contribution of a person of interest (POI) from these samples are challenging. In this study, we developed a new open-source software “Kongoh” for interpreting DNA mixture based on a quantitative continuous model. The model uses quantitative information of peak heights in the DNA profile and considers the effect of artifacts and allelic drop-out. By using this software, the likelihoods of 1–4 persons’ contributions are calculated, and the most optimal number of contributors is automatically determined; this differs from other open-source software. Therefore, we can eliminate the need to manually determine the number of contributors before the analysis. Kongoh also considers allele- or locus-specific effects of biological parameters based on the experimental data. We then validated Kongoh by calculating the likelihood ratio (LR) of a POI’s contribution in true contributors and non-contributors by using 2–4 person mixtures analyzed through a 15 short tandem repeat typing system. Most LR values obtained from Kongoh during true-contributor testing strongly supported the POI’s contribution even for small amounts or degraded DNA samples. Kongoh correctly rejected a false hypothesis in the non-contributor testing, generated reproducible LR values, and demonstrated higher accuracy of the estimated number of contributors than another software based on the quantitative continuous model. Therefore, Kongoh is useful in accurately interpreting DNA evidence like mixtures and small amounts or degraded DNA samples."

The impact of sepsis-related deaths on all-cause hospital mortality is insufficiently described, in particular in Europe where data are non-existent. The objective of this study was to provide nationwide epidemiological results on sepsis hospitalizations in Norway and to estimate sepsis' contribution to overall hospital mortality in a European setting.We performed a retrospective study using data from the Norwegian Patient Registry and Statistics Norway. The occurrence, patient characteristics and outcomes of sepsis hospitalizations during the years 2011 and 2012 were estimated and compared with Norwegian population data. Sepsis was defined as organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection and identified with International Classification of Diseases 10th revision codes.We identified 18 460 sepsis admissions occurring in 13 582 individuals. The annual population incidence of hospitalized sepsis was 140 patients per 100 000 inhabitants; ranging from 10 to 2270 per 100 000 in different age groups and with statistically significant male predominance in all adult cohorts. Hospital mortality for sepsis admissions was 19.4% and overall, 26.4% of the included patients died while hospitalized for sepsis. Sepsis related deaths constituted 12.9% of all hospital fatalities, while hospitalizations with sepsis accounted for 1.0% of the total number of admissions and 3.5% of the total admission days during 2011 and 2012.This study confirms that hospitalized sepsis is frequent in Norway and a major contributor to hospital fatalities in a European setting. The incidence is higher among men than women. Sepsis is in particular a disease of the elderly, and its impact on health-care will assumingly continue to increase in parallel with an aging population. Improvements in treatment and survival of sepsis could influence population mortality, and sepsis should receive greater attention in official death statistics in the future."

Operationally, we found that the extreme C terminus of FOS renders it intrinsically susceptible to ubiquitin-independent degradation by the 20S proteasome, an essential mechanism bypassed by tumor FOS proteins. This is the first report of a module that directly mediates ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation (UIPD) and emphasizes the importance of UIPD in normal as well as tumor cells.

To determine whether mutations that disrupt the normal function of FOS might promote tumorigenesis, we investigated the role of a novel mutant FOS protein in epithelioid hemangioma (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B depicts schematically a FOS deletion mutant (hereafter termed FOSΔ) that resulted from a FOS-MBNL1 translocation (2van IJzendoorn D.G. de Jong D. Romagosa C. Picci P. Benassi M.S. Gambarotti M. Daugaard S. van de Sande M. Szuhai K. Bovée J.V. Fusion events lead to truncation of FOS in epithelioid hemangioma of bone.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2015; 54: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mutant transcript is predicted to encode a FOS isoform lacking the C-terminal 95 amino acids but including the bZIP domain. Western blot analysis of lysates prepared from patient tumor tissue revealed a truncated FOS protein of the expected size demonstrating that the mutant FOS gene is translated in vivo (Fig. 1C). Moreover, immunohistochemistry of tumor sections showed a significant enrichment of FOS in tumor blood vessel endothelial cells (Fig. 1C). In common with wild-type FOS, FOSΔ is localized to the nucleus, can heterodimerize both with JUN and JUNB, and is efficiently associated with a consensus AP-1 DNA-binding site (Fig. 1D). However, FOSΔ protein levels appear to be significantly higher than wild-type FOS protein levels in patient cells (see Fig. 1C) suggesting that the mutant protein may be aberrantly stable. To elucidate the mechanistic consequences of this deletion, we first assessed FOS protein stability in primary endothelial cells. Fig. 1E shows that wild-type FOS, as expected, has a relatively short half-life of ∼1–2 h. By contrast, the deleted version of FOS is highly stable (half-life in excess of 8 h) suggesting that wild-type FOS harbors a destabilizing element in its C terminus, which is absent in the patient FOSΔ protein. In support of this view, tethering the FOS C terminus to a GFP reporter construct, led to a striking destabilization of the GFP protein (Fig. 1F), whereas a truncated FOS C terminus did not substantially alter the stability of the GFP reporter (see Fig. 3G). This observation is consistent with previous reports relating to FOS stability (8Wilson T. Treisman R.

Additionally, blocking nuclear export had no effect either on rapid FOS degradation or the stability of FOSΔ indicating that FOS is degraded in the nucleus and that FOSΔ is resistant to this process (Fig. 1G). The above findings were confirmed in diploid HT1080 cell and HEK293T cells indicating that this mechanism is likely to be generic. To precisely delineate how FOS is degraded (and why FOSΔ is not), we monitored FOS protein degradation by the proteasome. Fig. 2A shows that pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome, using either the specific inhibitor epoxomicin or MG132, markedly stabilized the wild-type FOS protein such that its half-life was comparable with that of the mutant FOSΔ protein. The half-life of FOSΔ was refractory to proteasome inhibition indicating that this deletion essentially lacks the motif(s) responsible for this degradative process (Fig. 2A). It is established that degradation by the proteasome is either ubiquitin-dependent (15Collins G.A. Goldberg A.L.

We found that patient FOSΔ protein was not detectably ubiquitinated (Figs. 2B and 3C), and it fails to bind the E3 ligase, KDM2b, which has been demonstrated to stimulate FOS ubiquitination (see Fig. S1) (20Han X.-R.

These observations could suggest that patient FOSΔ stabilization results from the absence of FOSΔ ubiquitin-dependent degradation. However, several lines of evidence support the view that the tumor FOSΔ protein is intrinsically resistant to ubiquitin-independent proteasome degradation and that this is the principal cause of its substantially increased stability. First, pharmacological inhibition of ubiquitin-activating enzymes ablated FOS ubiquitination but had no detectable impact on FOS degradation (Fig. 2C). In the same experiment, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of an established substrate of the proteasome, MDM2, was completely abrogated (see Fig. 2C). Second, wild-type non-ubiquitinated FOS but strikingly not FOSΔ was efficiently degraded by the 20S proteasome in a cell-free in vitro system (Fig. 2D). By contrast, FOS was completely resistant to degradation by the 26S proteasome under identical conditions (Fig. 2E). Consistent with these findings, selective inhibition of the 26S proteasome, but not the 20S proteasome (through shRNA-mediated abolition of the 19S subunits PSMD2 and PSMD14), stabilized the ubiquitinated fraction of FOS but failed to conspicuously inhibit FOS protein degradation, in sharp contrast to inhibiting both the 20S and 26S proteasomes (see Fig. 2A), indicating that degradation is principally via the 20S and not the 26S proteasome (Fig. S2). These results show that the FOS C terminus is vital for both ubiquitin-independent and ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation and that both of these processes are lost by the mutant FOSΔ protein expressed in epithelioid hemangioma. These data show that the normal process of FOS degradation is severely corrupted in the tumor FOSΔ mutant protein and substantiate previous studies (21Adler J. et al.c-Fos proteasomal degradation is activated by a default mechanism and its regulation by NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreductase 1 determines c-Fos serum response kinetics.Mol.

Fig. 3A shows that deleting the C-terminal four amino acids was sufficient to strongly stabilize FOS and that lack of these amino acids might therefore cause the aberrant stability of the FOSΔ tumor protein. Ab initio modeling (24Baker D. Protein folding, structure prediction and design.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2014; 42: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) of the FOS tail revealed that the C terminus is composed of an intrinsically unstructured region terminating in a helix composed of the C-terminal four amino acids (LLAL), which is conserved in all metazoans sequenced to date (Fig. 3B). Unlike FOSΔ, eliminating this helical region, either through point mutation or deletion, had no effect upon FOS ubiquitination (Fig. 3C). The same mutations did, however, efficiently block FOS degradation to the same degree as the tumor FOSΔ protein (see Fig. 3, D and E). The integrity of the four C-terminal amino acids, but not residues immediately adjacent to this motif, is absolutely required for priming FOS labileness (Fig. 3F). Deletions or point mutations of adjacent amino acids, which include consensus phosphorylation sites for ERK and GSK, failed to augment FOS stability. Indeed, a subset of these, in agreement with others (25Okazaki K. Sagata N. The Mos/MAP kinase pathway stabilizes c-Fos by phosphorylation and augments its transforming activity in NIH 3T3 cells.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5048-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), served to enhance FOS instability suggesting they play a role in stabilizing but not destabilizing the FOS protein (correspondingly, chemical inhibitors of MEK or deletion of the consensus ERK-docking site had a comparable effect; data not shown). Three additional experiments further validated the importance of the C-terminal motif. One, deletion of the C-terminal four amino acids strongly attenuated the capacity of the FOS C terminus to destabilize GFP (Fig. 3G). Two, a deletion mutant lacking the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (which is highly stable) but retaining the C-terminal four amino acids was as unstable as wild-type FOS (Fig. 3H). Three, in common with tumor FOSΔ, a mutant FOS lacking the C-terminal four amino acids, was highly resistant to 20S proteasomal degradation in a cell-free in vitro assay (Fig. 3I). These data highlight a short helical region at the extreme C terminus of FOS as a crucial determinant of FOS stability and that perturbation of this motif leads to pronounced FOS stabilization. A block in ubiquitin-independent degradation, due to loss of the extreme C terminus, is sufficient to explain mutant FOSΔ stability. Experiments in cell-free systems indicate that this motif can orchestrate direct proteasomal degradation of FOS independently of accessory proteins. IDRs have been reported to strongly influence proteasomal degradation (26Prakashm S. Tian L. Ratliff K.S. Lehotzky R.E. Matouschek A. An unstructured initiation site is required for efficient proteasome-mediated degradation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), including the IDR found in the C terminus of FOS (27Campbell K.M. Terrell A.R. Laybourn P.J. Lumb K.J. Intrinsic structural disorder of the C-terminal activation domain from the bZIP transcription factor Fos.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our data show that the FOS IDR, by itself, does not stimulate FOS degradation. Rather, a highly conserved helical motif at the extreme C terminus of FOS is essential for triggering ubiquitin-independent degradation. Vascular neoplasms result from the dysregulated growth of endothelial cells or their precursors (1Rosenberg A.E. Bovée J.V. Fletcher C.D. Bridge J.A. Hogendoorn P.C. Mertens F. WHO Classification of Tumours of Soft Tissue and Bone. IARC Press, Lyon, France2013: 333-334Google Scholar) and represent a unique model for gaining insights into pathological as well as normal angiogenesis. To recapitulate the cell biological consequences of the mutant FOS stabilization observed in epithelioid hemangioma, we ectopically expressed wild-type and mutant FOS proteins in primary HUVECs and assessed their ability to sprout. Fig. 4A shows that whereas loss of FOS abolished sprouting, sustained expression of FOS strongly promoted endothelial sprouting and the formation of stable endothelial cell networks. Similarly, expression of tumor FOSΔ or FOS lacking an intact C-terminal four amino acids strongly stimulated endothelial sprouting of HUVECs (Fig. 4B). This phenomenon was independent of marked changes in cell proliferation (Fig. 4B). Fig. S3 shows that FOS and FOSΔ also stimulated sprouting of human lung microvascular endothelial cells. The endothelial cell networks produced by cells expressing FOS and FOSΔ were stable and persistent. In this assay, ordinarily the sprouting network is relatively short-lived and collapses after ∼24 h. By contrast, endothelial cell networks expressing elevated levels of FOS and FOSΔ were sustained for at least 2 weeks of culture (sprouting networks expressing FOSΔ were noticeably more robust than the wild-type FOS-expressing networks), which resembles the illicit vessel growth observed in human epithelioid hemangioma. To understand the mechanistic basis of FOS-driven sprouting, we performed global transcriptome analyses of sprouts formed by FOS or patient FOSΔ-expressing primary endothelial cells. Fig. 4C shows a confirmatory qPCR of a selection of angiogenesis-control genes, which were up-regulated, including MMPs and components of the Notch-signaling pathway that are known to facilitate both physiological and pathological angiogenesis (28Heo S.-H.

ChIP analyses showed that endogenous FOS bound to these promoters (Fig. S4), and complementary ChIP studies showed that FOSΔ directly interacts with these promoters (see Fig. 4C). Our experiments uncover a previously unreported role for FOS as an activator of endothelial sprouting and show that patient FOSΔ could stimulate illicit endothelial sprouting by activating the Notch signaling pathway and increasing the production of MMPs. In this regard, it is notable that inhibitors of either MMPs or Notch signaling significantly inhibited the sprouting of FOSΔ-expressing endothelial cells (Fig. 4D). The same inhibitors had relatively little effect on cells expressing wild-type FOS under these assay conditions. This could reflect the fact that both MMP production and Notch signaling (as well as other FOS target pathways, see under “Transcriptome profiling) were significantly more augmented in cells expressing wild-type FOS compared with cells expressing FOSΔ (presumably because FOSΔ lacks the C-terminal TAD). Accordingly, a recently reported small molecule inhibitor of FOS (34Ye N. Ding Y. Wild C. Shen Q. Zhou J. Small molecule inhibitors targeting activator protein 1 (AP-1).J. Med. Chem. 2014; 57: 6930-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which has advanced to human Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, efficiently inhibited FOS-driven endothelial sprouting (Fig. S5). In summary, our data have uncovered a previously unreported role for FOS in stimulating endothelial cell sprouting. We show that sustained expression of FOS, due to loss of the C terminus, could drive the formation of vascular neoplasms. By analyzing the C-terminal region of FOS, which is deleted in epithelioid hemangioma, we have discovered a highly conserved motif at the extreme C terminus of FOS that is critical for controlling its stability by rendering it intrinsically susceptible to ubiquitin-independent degradation by the 20S proteasome. Our work suggests that targeted inhibition of FOS or proteins whose expression is activated by FOS might represent a legitimate novel approach to treating these locally aggressive tumors. Epithelioid hemangioma case L3933 was acquired from the archives of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), Leiden, The Netherlands. The diagnosis of epithelioid hemangioma was established by a bone and soft tissue pathologist (J. V. M. G. B.). The study was approved by the LUMC Medical Ethical Commission under protocol B17006. Primary HUVECs (Lonza) were cultured in EGM2 medium (Lonza). Chondrosarcoma HT1080 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Transfections, lentivirus production and cell infections, Western blotting, and co-immunoprecipitations have been described previously (35Roukens M.G. Alloul-Ramdhani M. Baan B. Kobayashi K.

FOS stability assays were performed by incubating cells in the presence or absence of cycloheximide for a defined time course (hours). Protein levels were determined by Western blotting. Human FOS cDNAs fused in-frame with a FLAG or an HA epitope tag were cloned into the pLV lentiviral vector and pCS2 expression plasmid. Gene-specific shRNA-expressing lentiviruses were generated using the TRC2-pLKO lentiviral vector system. RNA was isolated from HUVECs stably expressing FOS or FOSΔ by treatment with TRIzol (Invitrogen) column purification (Direct-zol RNA isolation kit-Zymo Research). RNA quality was verified with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent), and sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Genome Scan). HUVEC transcript sequencing data have been deposited under GenBankTM accession no. PRJNA390521. RNA isolation, first strand cDNA synthesis, and analysis of expression of transcripts by quantitative PCR were performed as described previously (33Adams R.H. Alitalo K. Molecular regulation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. Proteasome degradation was blocked for 8 h with 10 μm MG132 (Sigma). HIS pulldowns were performed as described previously (36Roukens M.G. Alloul-Ramdhani M. Moghadasi S. Op den Brouw M. Baker D.A.

Biol. 2008; 28: 4394-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 96-well plates were coated with 60 μl of Matrigel/well 30 min prior to seeding HUVECs. EGM-2 medium was supplemented with 50 ng/ml recombinant human VEGF 165 (R & D Systems). Images were taken at multiple time points. Analysis of the sprouting was performed with Stacks (in-house software, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, LUMC). Staining was performed on 4-μm tissue sections. Paraffin was removed with xylene, and sections were rehydrated in a gradient of ethanol. Exogenous peroxidase was blocked using 0.3% H2O2. Microwave antigen retrieval was performed in Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0). FOS antibody was used at a 1:400 concentration. Antibody was detected with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, and counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (37Roukens M.G. Alloul-Ramdhani M.

HT1080 cells, stably expressing GFP-PSMD12, were lysed in buffer containing 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with prewashed Chromotek GFP-Trap® bead slurry. Beads were washed four times in wash buffer containing 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 10% glycerol. Activity of purified 26S proteasome and 20S proteasome (Enzo LifeSciences) was measured using 100 μm suc-LLVY-AMC substrate (Bachem) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT (0.5 mm ATP for the 26S proteasome) (absorbance/emission = 353/442 nm). In vitro-translated FOS proteins were prepared using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte in vitro translation system (Promega). Cell-free degradation assays were performed as described previously (38Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y.

In vitro-translated protein was made as above. 50 pmol of biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides harboring three contiguous AP-1 DNA-binding sites were coupled to MyOne streptavidin C1 beads (Invitrogen). Reactions were incubated at 4 °C with vigorous shaking for 30 min in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI/dC), 4 mm spermidine, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.05 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol. Beads were successively washed three times with the aforementioned buffer. Associated proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer, and protein–DNA interactions were determined by Western blotting. ChIP analyses were performed on confluent 10-cm tissue culture dishes of HUVECs as described previously (35Roukens M.G. Alloul-Ramdhani M. Baan B. Kobayashi K. Peterson-Maduro J. van Dam H.

https://openalex.org/W2770833723,"The objective of the study was to describe the views and experiences of participation in a high-intensity functional exercise (HIFE) program among older people with dementia in nursing homes. The study design was a qualitative interview study with 21 participants (15 women), aged 74-96, and with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 10-23 at study start. The HIFE-program comprises exercises performed in functional weight-bearing positions and including movements used in everyday tasks. The exercise was individually designed, supervised in small groups in the nursing homes and performed during four months. Interviews were performed directly after exercise sessions and field notes about the sessions were recorded. Qualitative content analysis was used for analyses. The analysis revealed four themes: Exercise is challenging but achievable; Exercise gives pleasure and strength; Exercise evokes body memories; and Togetherness gives comfort, joy, and encouragement. The intense and tailored exercise, adapted to each participant, was perceived as challenging but achievable, and gave pleasure and improvements in mental and bodily strength. Memories of previous physical activities aroused and participants rediscovered bodily capabilities. Importance of individualized and supervised exercise in small groups was emphasized and created feelings of encouragement, safety, and coherence. The findings from the interviews reinforces the positive meaning of intense exercise to older people with moderate to severe dementia in nursing homes. The participants were able to safely adhere to and understand the necessity of the exercise. Providers of exercise should consider the aspects valued by participants, e.g. supervision, individualization, small groups, encouragement, and that exercise involved joy and rediscovery of body competencies."

In this study improvements in the capture of Drosophila suzukii were not observed following the inclusion of different color stimuli with respect to a red-black stripe cup trap. This red-black stripe trap with a hemispherical dome-shaped lid had a significantly improved physical retention of flies compared to traps fitted with a flat lid. Retention was further improved when an additional tube device, which could be baited with a supplemental attractant, was introduced through the dome-shaped lid. Under laboratory conditions, this trap, in which apple cider vinegar + 10% ethanol was present as the drowning solution and the additional tube device was baited with a fermenting mixture of sugar and yeast, was significantly more effective in catching D. suzukii flies than other conventional attractants or a commercial lure. The capture rate of this trap-lure combination remained higher than that of a commercial lure, even after 20 days of use under laboratory conditions. In a guava orchard this trap was 15-fold more effective in catching D. suzukii flies than similar traps baited with apple cider vinegar alone, 4 to 7 fold more effective than similar traps baited with a commercial lure, and 1.7-fold more effective than a fermenting mixture of yeasts and wheat flour. In commercial blackberry orchards, this trap was 6-fold more effective in trapping D. suzukii flies than the clear trap baited with apple cider vinegar used by growers. The efficacy of this trap presents a promising line of future research for monitoring and control of D. suzukii and likely other drosophilid pests."
https://openalex.org/W2768129283,"ALC1/CHD1L is a member of the SNF2 superfamily of ATPases carrying a macrodomain that binds poly(ADP-ribose). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1 and 2 synthesize poly(ADP-ribose) at DNA-strand cleavage sites, promoting base excision repair (BER). Although depletion of ALC1 causes increased sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents (H2O2, UV, and phleomycin), the role played by ALC1 in BER has not yet been established. To explore this role, as well as the role of ALC1’s ATPase activity in BER, we disrupted the ALC1 gene and inserted the ATPase-dead (E165Q) mutation into the ALC1 gene in chicken DT40 cells, which do not express PARP2. The resulting ALC1-/- and ALC1-/E165Q cells displayed an indistinguishable hypersensitivity to methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), an alkylating agent, and to H2O2, indicating that ATPase plays an essential role in the DNA-damage response. PARP1-/- and ALC1-/-/PARP1-/- cells exhibited a very similar sensitivity to MMS, suggesting that ALC1 and PARP1 collaborate in BER. Following pulse-exposure to H2O2, PARP1-/- and ALC1-/-/PARP1-/- cells showed similarly delayed kinetics in the repair of single-strand breaks, which arise as BER intermediates. To ascertain ALC1’s role in BER in mammalian cells, we disrupted the ALC1 gene in human TK6 cells. Following exposure to MMS and to H2O2, the ALC1-/- TK6 cell line showed a delay in single-strand-break repair. We therefore conclude that ALC1 plays a role in BER. Following exposure to H2O2, ALC1-/- cells showed compromised chromatin relaxation. We thus propose that ALC1 is a unique BER factor that functions in a chromatin context, most likely as a chromatin-remodeling enzyme."

LPS decreased the systolic Ca2+ transient and myocyte contraction as well as SR Ca2+ content. Meanwhile, LPS increased Ca2+ spark–mediated SR Ca2+ leak. Preventing the SR leak with ryanodine receptor (RyR) blocker tetracaine restored SR load and increased myocyte contraction. Similar alterations in Ca2+ handling were observed in cardiomyocytes from CLP mice. Treatment with JTV-519, an anti-SR leak drug, restored Ca2+ handling and improved cardiac function. In the LPS-treated cardiomyocytes, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in RyR2 were increased, whereas the levels of the RyR2-associated FK506-binding protein 1B (FKBP12.6) were decreased. The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–specific inhibitor TAK-242 reduced the oxidative stress in LPS-treated cells, decreased the SR leak, and normalized Ca2+ handling and myocyte contraction. Consistently, TLR4 deletion significantly improved cardiac function and corrected abnormal Ca2+ handling in the CLP mice. This study provides evidence for the critical role of the SR Ca2+ leak in the development of septic cardiomyopathy and highlights the therapeutic potential of JTV-519 by preventing SR leak.

https://openalex.org/W2768707191,"Although the HVTN 505 DNA/recombinant adenovirus type 5 vector HIV-1 vaccine trial showed no overall efficacy, analysis of breakthrough HIV-1 sequences in participants can help determine whether vaccine-induced immune responses impacted viruses that caused infection. We analyzed 480 HIV-1 genomes sampled from 27 vaccine and 20 placebo recipients and found that intra-host HIV-1 diversity was significantly lower in vaccine recipients (P ≤ 0.04, Q-values ≤ 0.09) in Gag, Pol, Vif and envelope glycoprotein gp120 (Env-gp120). Furthermore, Env-gp120 sequences from vaccine recipients were significantly more distant from the subtype B vaccine insert than sequences from placebo recipients (P = 0.01, Q-value = 0.12). These vaccine effects were associated with signatures mapping to CD4 binding site and CD4-induced monoclonal antibody footprints. These results suggest either (i) no vaccine efficacy to block acquisition of any viral genotype but vaccine-accelerated Env evolution post-acquisition; or (ii) vaccine efficacy against HIV-1s with Env sequences closest to the vaccine insert combined with increased acquisition due to other factors, potentially including the vaccine vector."

Here, we investigated the effects of the fresh leaves of two magnoliophytes (Zostera noltei and Cymodocea nodosa) and thalli of the macroalgae Ulva rigida on three HAB-forming benthic dinoflagellates (Ostreopsis cf. ovata, Prorocentrum lima, and Coolia monotis). The effects of C. nodosa and U. rigida were also tested against the neurotoxic planktonic dinoflagellate Alexandrium pacificum Litaker sp. nov (former Alexandrium catenella). Co-culture experiments were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions and potential allelopathic effects of the macrophytes on the growth, photosynthesis and toxin production of the targeted dinoflagellates were evaluated. Results showed that U. rigida had the strongest algicidal effect and that the planktonic A. pacificum was the most vulnerable species. Benthic dinoflagellates seemed more tolerant to potential allelochemicals produced by macrophytes. Depending on the dinoflagellate/macrophyte pairs and the weight of leaves/thalli tested, the studied physiological processes were moderately to heavily altered. Our results suggest that the allelopathic activity of the macrophytes could influence the development of HAB species."
https://openalex.org/W2768554805,"Uncertainty remains regarding the magnitude of effectiveness of influenza vaccines for preventing serious outcomes, especially among young children. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations among children aged 6–59 months. We used the test-negative design in hospitalized children in Ontario, Canada during the 2010–11 to 2013–14 influenza seasons. We used logistic regression models adjusted for age, season, and time within season to calculate VE estimates by vaccination status (full vs. partial), age group, and influenza season. We also assessed VE incorporating prior history of influenza vaccination. We included specimens from 9,982 patient hospitalization episodes over four seasons, with 12.8% testing positive for influenza. We observed variation in VE by vaccination status, age group, and influenza season. For the four seasons combined, VE was 60% (95%CI, 44%-72%) for full vaccination and 39% (95%CI, 17%-56%) for partial vaccination. VE for full vaccination was 67% (95%CI, 48%-79%) for children aged 24–59 months, 48% (95%CI, 12%-69%) for children aged 6–23 months, 77% (95%CI, 47%-90%) for 2010–11, 59% (95%CI, 13%-81%) for 2011–12, 33% (95%CI, –18% to 62%) for 2012–13, and 72% (95%CI, 42%-86%) for 2013–14. VE in children aged 24–59 months appeared similar between those vaccinated in both the current and previous seasons and those vaccinated in the current season only, with the exception of 2012–13, when VE was lower for those vaccinated in the current season only. Influenza vaccination is effective in preventing pediatric laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations during most seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2768670984,"Transfer entropy (TE) provides a generalized and model-free framework to study Wiener-Granger causality between brain regions. Because of its nonparametric character, TE can infer directed information flow also from nonlinear systems. Despite its increasing number of applications in neuroscience, not much is known regarding the influence of common electrophysiological preprocessing on its estimation. We test the influence of filtering and downsampling on a recently proposed nearest neighborhood based TE estimator. Different filter settings and downsampling factors were tested in a simulation framework using a model with a linear coupling function and two nonlinear models with sigmoid and logistic coupling functions. For nonlinear coupling and progressively lower low-pass filter cut-off frequencies up to 72% false negative direct connections and up to 26% false positive connections were identified. In contrast, for the linear model, a monotonic increase was only observed for missed indirect connections (up to 86%). High-pass filtering (1 Hz, 2 Hz) had no impact on TE estimation. After low-pass filtering interaction delays were significantly underestimated. Downsampling the data by a factor greater than the assumed interaction delay erased most of the transmitted information and thus led to a very high percentage (67-100%) of false negative direct connections. Low-pass filtering increases the number of missed connections depending on the filters cut-off frequency. Downsampling should only be done if the sampling factor is smaller than the smallest assumed interaction delay of the analyzed network."

However more knowledge is needed to assess the impact of different protein sources on gut and animal health. Thirty-six wildtype male C57BL/6J mice of 35 d age (n = 6/group; mean ± SEM body weight 21.9 ± 0.25 g) were randomly assigned to groups fed for four weeks with semi synthetic diets prepared with one of the following protein sources containing (300 g/kg as fed basis): soybean meal (SBM), casein, partially delactosed whey powder, spray dried plasma protein, wheat gluten meal and yellow meal worm. At the end of the experiment, mice were sacrificed to collect ileal tissue to acquire gene expression data, and mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, ileal digesta to study changes in microbiota and serum to measure cytokines and chemokines. By genome-wide transcriptome analysis, we identified fourteen high level regulatory genes that are strongly affected in SBM-fed mice compared to the other experimental groups. They mostly related to the mTOR pathway. In addition, an increased (P < 0.05) concentration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was observed in serum of SBM-fed mice compared to other dietary groups. Moreover, by 16S rRNA sequencing, we observed that SBM-fed mice had higher (P < 0.05) abundances of Bacteroidales family S24-7, compared to the other dietary groups. We showed that measurements of genome-wide expression and microbiota composition in the mouse ileum reveal divergent responses to diets containing different protein sources, in particular for a diet based on SBM."

A self-test user with a positive test is required to visit a clinic to link into HIV care, yet little is known about patient preferences for linkage strategies. We examined the intention to link to care amongst potential HIVST users and the suitability of three linkage to care strategies in Lusaka Province, Zambia.We conducted a representative cross sectional survey of 1,617 individuals aged 16-49 years old in Lusaka Province. Participants were shown a video of the HIVST. Data on intention to link to care and preferred linkage to care strategies-text message, phone call and home visits were collected. Eight focus group discussions were held concurrently with survey respondents to understand their preferences between the three linkage to care strategies.Of 1617 enrolled, 60% were women, 40% were men, with an average age of 27years (IQR = 22, 35). More men than women had at least secondary education (84% vs 77%) and were either employed or self-employed (67% vs. 41%). 85% (95%CI = 83 to 86) of participants said they would link to care within the first week of a positive self-test. Income >2,000 Kwacha (USD 200) per month versus income < 2,000 Kwacha (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.59; 95%CI: 0.40 to 0.88; p = 0.009) and never versus prior HIV testers (AOR = 0.54; 95%CI: 0.32 to 0.91; p = 0.020) were associated with reduced odds of intention to link to care. 53% (95%CI = 50 to 55) preferred being prompted to link to care by home visits compared to phone call (30%) or SMS (17%).We found almost nine out of ten potential HIVST users in the general population intend to link to care shortly after a positive test, and preferred home visits or phone calls to facilitate linkage, rather than SMS. Also, higher income earners and those who never tested for HIV were associated with reduced odds of intention to link to care. Policy guidelines and implementation strategies for HIVST should be responsive to patient preferences for linkage to care strategies to achieve the continuum of HIV care."

Between September 2013 and December 2014, samples from 372 children aged between 1 month and 5 years were collected, and tested using multiplex real-time RT-PCR by a commercial assay for 21 respiratory pathogens. In addition, samples were screened for the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae 16S rDNA using real-time PCR. The viral distribution and its association with clinical symptoms were statistically analyzed. Viral pathogens were detected in 342 (91.93%) of the samples of which 28.76% were single positive and 63.17% had multiple infections. The most frequent detected viruses were rhinovirus (55.64%), respiratory syncytial virus A/B (33.06%), adenovirus (25.00%), coronavirus NL63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E (21.50%), and metapneumovirus A/B (16.12%). Children in the youngest age group (1–3 months) exhibited the highest frequencies of infection. Related to their frequency of detection, RSV A/B was the most associated pathogen with patient’s demographic situation and clinical manifestations (p<0.05). Parainfluenza virus 1–4 and parechovirus were found to increase the risk of death (p<0.05). Adenovirus was statistically associated to the manifestation of gastroenteritis (p = 0.004). Rhinovirus infection increases the duration of oxygen support (p = 0.042). Coronavirus group was statistically associated with the manifestation of bronchiolitis (p = 0.009) and laryngitis (p = 0.017). Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA was detected in 143 (38.44%) of tested samples. However, only 53 samples had a concentration of C-reactive protein from equal to higher than 20 milligrams per liter, and 6 of them were single positive for Streptocuccus pneumoniae. This study confirms the high incidence of respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections in the Sousse area, Tunisia."
https://openalex.org/W2770783362,"Background Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a highly specific signaling protein for vascular endothelial cells that plays a critical role in tumor growth and invasion through angiogenesis, and may contribute to cell migration and activation of pre-osteoclasts, osteoclasts and some tumor cells. Objectives We aimed to clarify the detailed roles of VEGF-Flt-1 signaling in bone invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Results Forty-two (42) of 54 cases with gingival SCC (77.8%) strongly expressed VEGF, and had a significantly increased number of Flt-1+ osteoclasts (p<0.01) and more aggressive bone invasion (p<0.05). PlGF, a ligand of Flt-1, induced osteoclastogenesis in single culture of bone marrow cells (BMCs), and inhibition of Flt-1-signaling by VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor and It’s down stream (Akt and ERK1/2) inhibitos reduced osteoclastogenesis in PlGF-stimulated BMCs (p<0.01). In molecular level, PlGF stimulation significantly upregulated RANKL expression in Flt-1-expressing HSC2 cells via phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. In the co-culture of VEGF-producing HSC2 cells and BMCs, number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts markedly increased (p<0.01). The osteoclastogenesis was significantly inhibited by RANKL-neutralizing antibody (p<0.01) as well as by VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (p<0.01) and it’s downstream (Akt and ERK1/2) inhibitors (p<0.01, p<0.05, respectively). Conclusion VEGF-Flt-1 signaling induces osteoclastogenesis in OSCC through two possible ways: 1) VEGF produced from OSCC cells can directly stimulate the Flt-1 pathway in preosteoclasts to induce migration to future bone resorbing area and differentiation into osteoclasts, and 2) VEGF-Flt-1 signaling upregulates RANKL expression in OSCC cells, which indirectly leads to osteoclast differentiation. Therefore, blocking of the VEGF-Flt-1 signaling may help inhibit bone invasion of OSCC."

These changes occurred without any changes in the protein expression of SERCA2a, PLN, and ryanodine receptor or in the PLN phosphorylation status. The enhanced calcium cycling in the HAX-1–depleted heart was mediated through increases in the calcium affinity of SERCA2a and reduced PLN–SERCA2a binding.

SR Ca2+ transport is mediated by the cardiac isoform of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a), which is one of the most abundant proteins in the heart. SERCA2a is regulated by a small integral membrane, phospholamban (PLN), phosphorylation of which during fight-or-flight responses relieves its inhibitory effects, enhancing cardiac function (3MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Phospholamban: a crucial regulator of cardiac contractility.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4 (12838339): 566-57710.1038/nrm1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Over the last several decades, PLN and SERCA2a have been characterized in great detail by an abundance of biochemical and biophysical studies (3MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G.

An elegant structure–function model has been generated in which PLN stabilizes a conformation of SERCA2a with a low Ca2+ affinity, thus decreasing enzymatic activity (4Traaseth N.J. Ha K.N.

From the physiological perspective, the role of PLN in cardiac function has been elucidated by the generation and characterization of genetically altered mouse models. Ablation of PLN was associated with enhanced Ca2+ cycling and contractile parameters, resulting in an overall hypercontractile cardiac function (5Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G.

Previous work has shown that HAX-1 overexpression increases inhibition of SERCA2a by PLN and depresses contractility, whereas decreased expression of HAX-1 had the opposite effects (13Zhao W.

In the mouse, global genetic deletion of HAX-1 associates with a short life span because of progressive loss of neuronal cells (14Fadeel B. Grzybowska E.

Thus, the impact of HAX-1 deficiency in the heart and specifically on SERCA2a/PLN activity is not currently clear. The present study was designed to delineate the role of endogenous HAX-1 on SR Ca2+ transport through the generation and characterization of a cardiac specific and inducible knock-out mouse model. We demonstrate for the first time that HAX-1 ablation relieves approximately 50% of the PLN inhibitory effects on SR Ca2+ transport, cardiomyocyte Ca2+ cycling, and contractile parameters. These findings suggest that endogenous HAX-1 is a critical regulator of PLN regulation and underline the significant function of this protein in the heart. Overexpression of HAX-1 in the heart has been shown to decrease Ca2+ cycling through increases in PLN inhibition, and these regulatory effects of HAX-1 are abrogated in the absence of PLN (13Zhao W. Waggoner J.R. Zhang Z.-G. Lam C.K. Han P. Qian J. Schroder P.M. Mitton B. Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Robia S.L. Kranias E.G.

Because global ablation of HAX-1 results in early lethality (17Chao J.-R. Parganas E. Boyd K. Hong C.Y. Opferman J.T. Ihle J.N. Hax1-mediated processing of HtrA2 by Parl allows survival of lymphocytes and neurons.Nature. 2008; 452 (18288109): 98-10210.1038/nature06604Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we generated a cardiac-specific and inducible HAX-1 knock-out model (HAXiKO) to delineate the full contribution of endogenous HAX-1 in the heart. This was achieved by crossing a mouse with a floxed HAX-1 gene (17Chao J.-R. Parganas E. Boyd K. Hong C.Y. Opferman J.T. Ihle J.N. Hax1-mediated processing of HtrA2 by Parl allows survival of lymphocytes and neurons.Nature. 2008; 452 (18288109): 98-10210.1038/nature06604Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) with an α-myosin heavy chain mer-cre-mer transgenic mouse, which produces a cardiac specific cre recombinase activity upon tamoxifen treatment. Tamoxifen treatment was initiated at 2 months of age, and full cardiac ablation of HAX-1 was achieved after 14 days of tamoxifen (Fig. 1A). 14 days after termination of this treatment, we assessed the expression levels of SERCA2a, PLN, and ryanodine receptor (RyR). There were no differences between HAXiKO and WT hearts (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, the levels of PLN phosphorylation at either Ser16 or Thr17 were similar (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicate that any functional changes associated with HAX-1 ablation are not due to alteration of these SR Ca2+-handling proteins. Overexpression of HAX-1 was previously shown to reduce cardiac contractility at the cellular level (13Zhao W. Waggoner J.R. Zhang Z.-G. Lam C.K. Han P. Qian J. Schroder P.M. Mitton B.

To examine the function of endogenous HAX-1, cardiomyocytes were isolated from HAXiKO and WT mice, and contractile parameters were assessed by video edge detection (Fig. 2, A–C). It was observed that the fractional shortening and the rates of contraction and relaxation (+dL/dt and −dL/dt) were significantly increased in HAX-1–deficient cells, compared with WT controls (Fig. 2, D–F). In parallel studies, we included the PLNKO as an additional control, representing full relief of PLN inhibition and maximal SERCA2a activity (Fig. 2, D–F). The relative increases in the HAXiKO parameters were approximately half of those achieved in PLNKO cells. In addition, isoproterenol stimulation eliminated the differences between WT, HAXiKO, and PLNKO, because the maximally stimulated contractile parameters were similar among these groups (Fig. 2, D–F), indicating that HAX-1 modulates function through PLN inhibition. Ca2+ transient kinetics, measured in Fura-2 AM–loaded cardiomyocytes, were also consistent with the contractile parameters (Fig. 3, A–C). The transient amplitude was increased, and the decay time (T50) and decay τ were shortened in HAXiKO cells, compared with WTs (Fig. 3, D–F). The observed changes in HAXiKO cardiomyocytes were approximately half of those achieved in PLNKO cells (Fig. 3, D–F). Isoproterenol stimulation also eliminated the differences between WT, HAXiKO, and PLNKO groups. The SR Ca2+ load, assessed by the caffeine-induced Ca2+-peak, was higher in the HAXiKO cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3G). However, the decay rate of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was not altered, reflecting no alterations in Na/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) activity (Fig. 3H). Furthermore, the increases in SR Ca2+ load by HAX-1 ablation were ∼50% of those observed in PLNKO cells (Fig. 3G) without any differences in the decay time of the caffeine-induced Ca2+-signal (Fig. 3H), indicating no alterations in NCX activity. These findings demonstrate that endogenous HAX-1 mediates ∼50% of the PLN inhibitory effects in Ca2+ cycling and contractility in the cardiac myocytes. To determine whether the alterations in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ kinetics reflect alterations in SR Ca2+ transport, we assessed the effects of HAX-1 ablation on the initial rates of oxalate-supported SR Ca2+ uptake over a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations, similar to those present in the cardiomyocyte during relaxation and contraction (Fig. 4A). HAX-1 ablation resulted in significant increases in Ca2+-transport rates but had no effect on the maximal velocity of the uptake system (WT, 80.1 ± 2.2 nmol/mg/min versus HAXiKO, 79.4 ± 2.8 nmol/mg/min, n = 4). Analysis of the EC50 value of Ca2+ transport for Ca2+ indicated that this parameter was decreased by 32% in the HAX-1 ablated hearts relative to WTs (Fig. 4B). In addition, PLN ablation resulted in 53% reduction of the EC50 (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that HAX-1 may mediate approximately half of the PLN inhibitory effects on SERCA2a activity. These alterations at the subcellular level reflect the increased functional parameters in cardiomyocytes (Figure 2, Figure 3). The observed decrease in EC50 of HAX-1 knock-out hearts was not associated with changes in PLN levels or PLN phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B). To test whether HAX-1 ablation may alter the interaction between SERCA2a and PLN, WT, and HAXiKO, cardiac homogenates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation experiments, using SERCA2a as bait. Indeed, HAX-1 ablation decreased the amount of PLN pulled down by SERCA2a (Fig. 4, C and D), consistent with reduced PLN inhibition and increased SR Ca2+-uptake rates (Fig. 4, A and B). The observed decreased interaction between PLN and SERCA2a in the HAX-1 ablated hearts (Fig. 4, C and D) could be also attributed to lower affinity between these two proteins in the absence of HAX-1. In this case, increased PLN expression should be able to overcome the reduced binding and diminish the effects of HAX-1 ablation on the hypercontractile phenotype. To test this hypothesis, isolated cardiomyocytes from WT and HAXiKO mice were infected with either adenoviral GFP (ad.GFP) or PLN (ad.PLN), and the contractile parameters were then assessed. Overexpression of PLN in WT cells depressed fractional shortening, +dL/dt, and −dL/dt compared with ad.GFP control (Fig. 5, A–C). Interestingly, the depressed parameters were similar to those observed in cardiomyocytes isolated from hearts with 2.5-fold overexpression of PLN (PLNOE), which we had previously observed to functionally saturate inhibition by PLN (9Brittsan A.G. Carr A.N. Schmidt A.G. Kranias E.G. Maximal inhibition of SERCA2 Ca2+ affinity by phospholamban in transgenic hearts overexpressing a non-phosphorylatable form of phospholamban.J. Biol.

However, PLN overexpression in HAXiKO cardiomyocytes had no effect on contractile parameters (Fig. 5, A–C). In parallel control experiments, PLN overexpression was also able to reduce function in HAXOE and PLNKO cells (Fig. 5, A–C). These results indicate that in the absence of HAX-1, endogenous levels of PLN have a functionally saturating effect on SR Ca2+ cycling and contractile parameters. This study presents the first evidence that endogenous HAX-1 mediates approximately half of the PLN inhibitory effects and serves as a gatekeeper for PLN activity in the heart. Elucidation of the functional role of HAX-1 is of paramount importance because human mutations have been identified that result in loss of this protein (8Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Cardiac-specific overexpression of phospholamban alters calcium kinetics and resultant cardiomyocyte mechanics in transgenic mice.J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97 (8567978): 533-53910.1172/JCI118446Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The human carriers present with severe neutropenia (14Fadeel B. Grzybowska E. HAX-1: a multifunctional protein with emerging roles in human disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790 (19524642): 1139-114810.1016/j.bbagen.2009.06.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but the effects of HAX-1 ablation in cardiac function have not been determined. Furthermore, ablation of HAX-1 in the mouse results in early death caused by neurological defects (17Chao J.-R. Parganas E. Boyd K. Hong C.Y. Opferman J.T. Ihle J.N. Hax1-mediated processing of HtrA2 by Parl allows survival of lymphocytes and neurons.Nature. 2008; 452 (18288109): 98-10210.1038/nature06604Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), precluding assessment of its role in the heart. Thus, we generated an inducible and cardiac specific knock-out model to explicitly assess the in vivo function of HAX-1. Ablation of HAX-1 in the adult heart resulted in increased SERCA2a Ca2+ affinity and enhanced cardiomyocyte Ca2+ cycling and contractility. Importantly, the regulatory effects of HAX-1 were mediated through controlling the binding of PLN to SERCA2a and modulating PLN inhibition (Fig. 4, C and D, and Ref. 13Zhao W. Waggoner J.R. Zhang Z.-G. Lam C.K. Han P. Qian J. Schroder P.M. Mitton B. Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Robia S.L. Kranias E.G. The anti-apoptotic protein HAX-1 is a regulator of cardiac function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106 (19920172): 20776-2078110.1073/pnas.0906998106Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In fact, we observed that endogenous HAX-1 contributes to approximately 50% of the PLN inhibitory effects. There were no alterations on the maximal velocity of SERCA2a in HAX-1–deficient hearts, further supporting regulation of the transport system through PLN. These findings, combined with previous results in HAX-1 overexpression and HAX-1 heterozygous hearts (7Slack J.P. Grupp I.L. Dash R. Holder D. Schmidt A. Gerst M.J. Tamura T. Tilgmann C. James P.F. Johnson R. Gerdes A.M. Kranias E.G. The enhanced contractility of the phospholamban-deficient mouse heart persists with aging.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33 (11343424): 1031-104010.1006/jmcc.2001.1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), indicate that there is a close linear correlation (Fig. 6) between the relative changes of cardiomyocyte contraction rate (−dL/dt), Ca2+ transient T50, and Ca2+ uptake EC50 against the HAX-1 expression levels (HAXiKO, HAXhet, WT, and HAXOE). Thus, HAX-1 is a critical component of the PLN·SERCA2a regulatory complex, and its levels have a significant impact in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ cycling and contractility. Decreased HAX-1 expression observed in disease states (15Lam C.K. Zhao W. Cai W. Vafiadaki E. Florea S.M. Ren X. Liu Y. Robbins N. Zhang Z. Zhou X. Jiang M. Rubinstein J. Jones W.K. Kranias E.G. Novel role of HAX-1 in ischemic injury protection involvement of heat shock protein 90.Circ. Res. 2013; 112 (22982986): 79-8910.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.279935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) may then represent a compensatory mechanism to boost cardiac function. Previous studies reported that maximal inhibition of SERCA2a and cardiac contractility is achieved by 2.5-fold overexpression of PLN, suggesting that ∼40% of SERCA2a activity is functionally inhibited by PLN in wild-type hearts (9Brittsan A.G. Carr A.N. Schmidt A.G. Kranias E.G. Maximal inhibition of SERCA2 Ca2+ affinity by phospholamban in transgenic hearts overexpressing a non-phosphorylatable form of phospholamban.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (10766848): 12129-1213510.1074/jbc.275.16.12129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consequently, the current results indicate that this fraction of inhibited SERCA2a by PLN could get further reduced to 20% in the absence of HAX-1 (Fig. 7A). In addition, our findings reveal that the previously reported maximal inhibition (PLNOE) of SERCA2a and contractility by PLN was restricted by endogenous levels of HAX-1. Indeed, dual overexpression of HAX-1 and PLN sets a new maximal “functional saturation level” of SERCA2a inhibition. Extrapolation from this new maximal inhibition to WT hearts suggests that ∼30% of SERCA2a is functionally inhibited by PLN/HAX-1 under basal conditions (Fig. 7B). However, we must acknowledge that this estimate is limited by current knowledge and could be further modified through identification of additional regulatory factors. The inability of PLN overexpression to diminish contractile parameters in the absence of HAX-1 (Fig. 5) demonstrates the nodal role of this protein in regulating the dynamic range of SERCA2a inhibition. This result also suggests that HAX-1 does not alter the binding affinity between PLN and SERCA2a. Further co-immunoprecipitation experiments would have provided additional information along these lines, but such studies are limited by the minimal lysate protein obtained from virally infected and cultured adult mouse cardiomyocytes. However, it is interesting to propose that our findings may reflect one or a combination of the following mechanisms: (a) HAX-1 may be necessary for displacing another unknown protein that modifies the PLN/SERCA2a interaction; (b) HAX-1 ablation may result in an unknown post-translational modification of SERCA2a, such that PLN regulation is functionally limited; and (c) PLN–SERCA2a regulation may involve functional units of either one PLN interacting with one SERCA2a molecule (18Mueller B. Karim C.B. Negrashov I.V. Kutchai H. Thomas D.D. Direct detection of phospholamban and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase interaction in membranes using fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15236584): 8754-876510.1021/bi049732kCrossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or one PLN interacting with a SERCA2a dimer (19Blackwell D.J. Zak T.J. Robia S.L. Cardiac calcium ATPase dimerization measured by cross-linking and fluorescence energy transfer.Biophys. J. 2016; 111 (27653478): 1192-120210.1016/j.bpj.2016.08.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, if HAX-1 modulates the balance between these functional units, then ablation of HAX-1 may favor the dimeric complex (2 SERCA2a: 1 PLN) and potentially saturate regulation of SERCA2a with a lower abundance of PLN. Interestingly, phosphorylation of PLN results in its dissociation from HAX-1 (11Vafiadaki E. Sanoudou D. Arvanitis D.A. Catino D.H. Kranias E.G. Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Phospholamban interacts with HAX-1, a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367 (17241641): 65-7910.1016/j.jmb.2006.10.057Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As such, the inotropic and lusitropic effects of isoproterenol in the present study could be partially facilitated by loss of HAX-1 binding to PLN. In addition, the stimulatory effects of HAX-1 ablation may be partially attributed to loss of its co-chaperone protein Hsp90. Hsp90 was previously shown to interact with HAX-1 and facilitate its inhibitory effects on SR Ca2+ uptake (15Lam C.K. Zhao W. Cai W. Vafiadaki E. Florea S.M. Ren X. Liu Y. Robbins N. Zhang Z. Zhou X. Jiang M. Rubinstein J. Jones W.K. Kranias E.G. Novel role of HAX-1 in ischemic injury protection involvement of heat shock protein 90.Circ. Res. 2013; 112 (22982986): 79-8910.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.279935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, removal of HAX-1 may disrupt the compartmentalization of the HAX-1·Hsp90 complex, resulting in overall disinhibition of SERCA2a activity. Furthermore, several homologs of PLN have been identified (sarcolipin (20Wawrzynow A. Theibert J.L. Murphy C. Jona I. Martonosi A. Collins J.H.

Signal. 2016; 9 (27923914): ra11910.1126/scisignal.aaj1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)) that regulate SERCA to varying degrees. However, these homologs do not contain AA residues 16–22 of PLN (11Vafiadaki E. Sanoudou D. Arvanitis D.A. Catino D.H. Kranias E.G. Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Phospholamban interacts with HAX-1, a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function.J. Mol.

Nevertheless, it is intriguing to speculate that these PLN homologs may have their own undiscovered HAX-1 counterparts that are critical to their function. In summary, the current study is the first to quantify the degree by which endogenous HAX-1 contributes to PLN inhibition and highlights HAX-1 as an important brake to control SERCA2a activity. Our findings also provide additional insights into the SERCA2a/PLN/HAX-1 regulatory axis and suggest that HAX-1 may be critical for amplification of the heart's responses to “flight or fight” situations as the heart strives to increase contractility and meet the demands of the periphery. HAX-1 inducible knock-out (HAXiKO) and their wild-type littermates were used in this study. HAXiKO mice were developed by crossing a floxed HAX-1 mouse (a gift from Dr. James Ihle, St. Jude, Memphis TN) with a transgenic mer/cre/mer containing the myosin heavy chain promoter (24Sohal D.S. Nghiem M. Crackower M.A. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Tymitz K.M. Penninger J.M. Molkentin J.D. Temporally regulated and tissue-specific gene manipulations in the adult and embryonic heart using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre protein.Circ. Res. 2001; 89 (11440973): 20-2510.1161/hh1301.092687Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To induce cre recombinase activity and HAX-1 ablation, 8-week-old male mice were treated with tamoxifen (40 mg/kg) for 14 days. Experiments were performed on 12–14-week-old male mice, which was 2–4 weeks after termination of tamoxifen treatment. The mice were bred and maintained in the animal facility at the University of Cincinnati according to the institutional and the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal care and use (publication no. 8523). The snap-frozen hearts were suspended in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitors I and II (Calbiochem) and homogenized. For immunoblotting, 5–120 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis using 6–12% polyacrylamide gels followed by electrotransfer to 0.1–0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked in 5% milk and then probed overnight at 4 °C using the following primary antibodies: monoclonal HAX-1 (1:1000; BD Biosciences), monoclonal PLN (1:5000; Thermo Fisher), monoclonal RyR2 (1:1000; Thermo Fisher), and polyclonal calsequestrin (1:5000; Thermo Fisher). Licor fluorescent mouse or rabbit specific secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:10,000 and visualized by using Licor Odyssey imager. All protein levels were quantified with the Licor Image Studio. For each protein, the densitometric values from WT controls were arbitrarily converted to 100%, and the values of samples from the other groups were normalized accordingly and expressed as a percentage of WT. Calsequestrin was used as an internal standard. Isolation of mouse left ventricular myocytes was carried out as described previously (16Lam C.K. Zhao W. Liu G.-S. Cai W.-F. Gardner G. Adly G. Kranias E.G. HAX-1 regulates cyclophilin-D levels and mitochondria permeability transition pore in the heart.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112 (26553996): E6466-E647510.1073/pnas.1508760112Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse hearts were excised from anesthetized (Euthasol, 200 mg/kg i.p.; Virbac AH, Inc.) adult mice, mounted in a Langendorff perfusion apparatus, and perfused with calcium-free Tyrode solution (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4.) at 37 °C for 3 min. Perfusion was then switched to the Tyrode solution containing liberase enzyme (0.25 mg/ml; Roche) for 8–15 min. The left ventricular tissue was excised, minced, pipette-dissociated, and filtered through a 240-μm screen. The cell suspension was then sequentially washed in 25, 100, and 200 μm and 1 mm Ca2+-Tyrode, and resuspended in 1.8 mm Ca2+-Tyrode for further experimentation. For viral infection, freshly isolated myocytes were plated on laminin-coated coverslips (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. After the attachment, cardiac myocytes were transduced with adenoviruses to express either ad.PLN or ad.GFP at a multiplicity of infection of 500 and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Then medium was replaced with culture medium (DMEM containing 5 mg/liter ITS (bovine insulin, human transferrin and sodium selenite; Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2% BSA, and 25 μm blebbistatin (Cayman Chemical)). Experiments were performed 24 h after infection. Cell contractility and Ca2+ transients were measured at room temperature (22–23 °C) in separate experiments as previously described (13Zhao W. Waggoner J.R. Zhang Z.-G. Lam C.K. Han P. Qian J. Schroder P.M. Mitton B. Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Robia S.L. Kranias E.G. The anti-apoptotic protein HAX-1 is a regulator of cardiac function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106 (19920172): 20776-2078110.1073/pnas.0906998106Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Myocytes were field-stimulated to contract by a Grass S5 stimulator through platinum electrodes placed alongside the bath (0.5 Hz, bipolar pulses with voltages 50% above myocyte voltage threshold). Contractions of myocytes from random fields were assessed by video edge detection. For Ca2+ transient measurements, the cells were loaded with Fura-2 (Fura-2 AM; 2 μm; Thermo Fisher) and alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm by a Delta Scan dual-beam spectrophotofluorometer (Photon Technology International) at baseline conditions and upon rapid application of 10 mm caffeine (Sigma). Calcium transients were expressed as the 340/380-nm ratio of the resulting 510-nm emissions. Rapid application of 10 mm caffeine was used to induce release of SR Ca2+ and assess the SR Ca2+ load, as well as obtain the participation of Na/Ca2+ exchange during [Ca2+]i decline. The cells were superfused with normal Tyrode solution and stimulated at 0.5 Hz until twitch characteristics stabilized before each caffeine application. The amplitude of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients can be used as an index of SR Ca2+ content. Decline of [Ca2+]i during a caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient in normal Tyrode was attributable to Na/Ca2+ exchange. Caffeine solution was introduced into the chamber and was continued for 20 s to study the kinetics of [Ca2+]i decline. Measurements of mechanics and Ca2+ kinetics were also performed in the presence of isoproterenol 100 nm at 0.5 Hz. Contractility and transient data were analyzed by Felix software (Photon Technology International). Ca2+ uptake assays were performed as previously described (12Bidwell P.A. Kranias E.G. Calcium uptake in crude tissue preparation.Methods Mol. Biol. 2016; 1377 (26695031): 161-17010.1007/978-1-4939-3179-8_16Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 13Zhao W. Waggoner J.R. Zhang Z.-G.

Frozen hearts were homogenized in 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Ca2+ uptake in whole-heart homogenates (0.1 mg/ml) was measured by a modification of the Millipore filtration technique. The reaction contained 40 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaN3, 5 mm potassium oxalate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1, μm ruthenium red, and various concentrations of CaCl2 to yield 0.02 to 5 μm free Ca2+. Homogenates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 min in the above buffer, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP (final concentration, 5 mm). The rates of Ca2+ uptake were calculated by least squares linear regression analysis of 30-, 60-, and 90-s time points. The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using ORIGIN (version 6.0) software. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (15Lam C.K. Zhao W. Cai W. Vafiadaki E. Florea S.M.

Briefly, hearts were homogenized with 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitor mixture and was diluted to 1 mg/ml and incubated with anti-SERCA2a (BD Biosciences) or IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Protein G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added into the mixture and incubated for an additional 5 h, sedimented, and washed six times with the cell lysis buffer. Bead-bound proteins were dissociated in 2× SDS and probed by Western blots. WT heart homogenate was used as positive control (input), and immunoprecipitate with anti-IgG Plus-agarose was used as negative control (IgG). The data were expressed as the means ± S.D. Comparisons between the means of two groups were performed by unpaired Student’s t test. Multiple groups were analyzed by using two-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons.

https://openalex.org/W2768505460,"In early multiple sclerosis, although brain T2 lesions accrual are hallmark of the disease, only weak correlations were found between T2 lesions accrual and EDSS progression, the disability scale commonly used in multiple sclerosis studies. This may be related to the very poor sensitivity of EDSS to cognitive dysfunctions that may occur and progress from the first stage of the disease. In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate that cognitive deficits progress during the first ten years of MS and are significantly impacted by new T2 lesions.EDSS and extensive neuropsychological battery (22 measures) exploring memory, attention/speed of information processing and executive functions were assessed at baseline, Year 1 and Year 10 in 26 patients enrolled after their first clinical attack. To limit the bias of test-retest effect, only measures obtained at Year 1 and Year 10 were reported in the analysis. Raw scores of patients were transformed into z-scores using published normative data when available or scores of matched controls. Lesion probability mapping was used to assess the potential relationships between T2 lesions accumulation, cognitive decline and EDSS progression (P<0.05, FWE-corrected).At Year 1, 27% of patients showed attention/speed of information processing deficits, 11.5% executive dysfunction and 11.5% memory impairment. During the follow-up, frequency and severity of executive dysfunction increased (from 11.5% of patients at Year 1 to 42% at Year 10, p<0.01) while no significant changes were evidenced for the other cognitive domains. Median EDSS increased from 0.5 [range: 0-3] at Year 1 to 2.5 [range: 0-6.5] at Year 10 (p<0.001). During the ten-year follow-up, lesions accumulation in the left cerebellum and semi-ovale centers was associated with EDSS progression. In contrast, most lesions accumulation in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes were associated with cognitive decline but had no effect on EDSS progression.The present study provides strong evidence that clinically silent T2 lesions impact cognition in early MS. In daily practice, early prevention of T2 lesions accrual may be useful to limit cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2768759182,"The western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is the most serious insect pest of corn (Zea mays L.) in the United States and parts of Europe, and arguably one of the world's most expensive pests to control. Several diet formulations are currently used by industry and public researchers to evaluate WCR larvae in diet-toxicity bioassays. However, a publicly available diet that produces normative insects that are physiologically similar to WCR larvae reared on corn roots will accelerate development of management technologies. We report a new diet formulation that supports improved weight gain, larval development and survival compared with the only public diet for WCR that is currently available in the refereed literature. The formulation was created by using response surface methods combined with n-dimensional mixture designs to identify and improve the formulation of key ingredients. Weight gain increased two-fold, and survival and molting rates increased from 93% and 90%, respectively when reared on the public diet, to approximately 99% for both survival and molting at 11 days when reared on our new formulation. This new formulation provides a standardized growth medium for WCR larvae that will facilitate comparison of research results from various working groups and compliance with regulatory requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2769556225,"Objective Plasma thermograms (thermal stability profiles of blood plasma) are being utilized as a new diagnostic approach for clinical assessment. In this study, we investigated the ability of plasma thermograms to classify systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients versus non SLE controls using a sample of 300 SLE and 300 control subjects from the Lupus Family Registry and Repository. Additionally, we evaluated the heterogeneity of thermograms along age, sex, ethnicity, concurrent health conditions and SLE diagnostic criteria. Methods Thermograms were visualized graphically for important differences between covariates and summarized using various measures. A modified linear discriminant analysis was used to segregate SLE versus control subjects on the basis of the thermograms. Classification accuracy was measured based on multiple training/test splits of the data and compared to classification based on SLE serological markers. Results Median sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy based on classification using plasma thermograms was 86%, 83%, and 84% compared to 78%, 95%, and 86% based on a combination of five antibody tests. Combining thermogram and serology information together improved sensitivity from 78% to 86% and overall accuracy from 86% to 89% relative to serology alone. Predictive accuracy of thermograms for distinguishing SLE and osteoarthritis / rheumatoid arthritis patients was comparable. Both gender and anemia significantly interacted with disease status for plasma thermograms (p<0.001), with greater separation between SLE and control thermograms for females relative to males and for patients with anemia relative to patients without anemia. Conclusion Plasma thermograms constitute an additional biomarker which may help improve diagnosis of SLE patients, particularly when coupled with standard diagnostic testing. Differences in thermograms according to patient sex, ethnicity, clinical and environmental factors are important considerations for application of thermograms in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2770379808,"In this paper, we present the design of an electromechanical above-knee active prosthesis with energy storage and regeneration. The system consists of geared knee and ankle motors, parallel springs for each motor, an ultracapacitor, and controllable four-quadrant power converters. The goal is to maximize the performance of the system by finding optimal controls and design parameters. A model of the system dynamics was developed, and used to solve a combined trajectory and design optimization problem. The objectives of the optimization were to minimize tracking error relative to human joint motions, as well as energy use. The optimization problem was solved by the method of direct collocation, based on joint torque and joint angle data from ten subjects walking at three speeds. After optimization of controls and design parameters, the simulated system could operate at zero energy cost while still closely emulating able-bodied gait. This was achieved by controlled energy transfer between knee and ankle, and by controlled storage and release of energy throughout the gait cycle. Optimal gear ratios and spring parameters were similar across subjects and walking speeds."
https://openalex.org/W2768641661,"The geographical origin of kimchi is of interest to consumers and producers because the prices of commercial kimchi products can vary significantly according to the geographical origin. Hence, social issues related to the geographical origin of kimchi in Korea have emerged as a major problem. In this study, the geographical origin of kimchi was determined by comparing the mass fingerprints obtained for Korean and Chinese kimchi samples by MALDI-TOF MS with multivariate analysis. The results obtained herein provide an accurate, powerful tool to clearly discriminate kimchi samples based on their geographical origin within a short time and to ensure food authenticity, which is of significance in the kimchi industry. Furthermore, our MALDI-TOF MS method could be applied to determining the geographical origin of other fermented-salted vegetables at a reduced cost in shorter times."
https://openalex.org/W2768957427,"The sodium-modified form of fluorohectorite nanoclay (NaFh) is introduced as a potential drug carrier, demonstrating its ability for the controlled release of the broad-spectrum antibiotic Ciprofloxacin through in vitro tests. The new clay-drug composite is designed to target the local infections in the large intestine, where it delivers most of the incorporated drug thanks to its pH-sensitive behavior. The composite has been conceived to avoid the use of coating technology and to decrease the side-effects commonly associated to the burst-release of the ciprofloxacin at the stomach level. NaFh was obtained from lithium-fluorohectorite by ion exchange, and its lack of toxicity was demonstrated by in vivo studies. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (Cipro) was encapsulated into the clay at different values of the pH, drug initial concentration, temperature and time. Systematic studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared and visible spectrophotometry (FT-IR and UV-vis), and thermal analysis (TGA) indicated that the NaFh host exhibits a high encapsulation efficiency for Cipro, which reaches a 90% of the initial Cipro in solution at 65 oC, with initial concentration of drug in solution of 1.36 x 10-2 mol L-1 at acid pH. XRD revealed that a true intercalation of Cipro takes place between clay layers. TG showed an increased thermal stability of the drug when intercalated into the clay, as compared to the ""free"" Cipro. IR suggested a strong clay-Cipro interaction via ketone group, as well as the establishment of hydrogen bonds between the two materials. In vitro drug release tests revealed that NaFh is a potentially efficient carrier to deliver Cipro in the large intestine, where the release process is mediated by more than just one mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2769761571,"Epithelial and stromal stem cells are required to maintain corneal transparency. The aim of the study was to develop a new method to isolate and grow both corneal stromal (SSC) and epithelial limbal (LSC) stem cells from small human limbal biopsies under culture conditions in accordance with safety requirements mandatory for clinical use in humans. Superficial limbal explants were retrieved from human donor corneo-scleral rims. Human limbal cells were dissociated by digestion with collagenase A, either after epithelial scraping or with no scraping. Isolated cells were cultured with Essential 8 medium (E8), E8 supplemented with EGF (E8+) or Green's medium with 3T3 feeder-layers. Cells were characterized by immunostaining, RT-qPCR, colony forming efficiency, sphere formation, population doubling, second harmonic generation microscopy and differentiation potentials. LSC were obtained from unscraped explants in E8, E8+ and Green's media and were characterized by colony formation and expression of PAX6, ΔNP63α, Bmi1, ABCG2, SOX9, CK14, CK15 and vimentin, with a few cells positive for CK3. LSC underwent 28 population doublings still forming colonies. SSC were obtained from both scraped and unscraped explants in E8 and E8+ media and were characterized by sphere formation, expression of PAX6, SOX2, BMI1, NESTIN, ABCG2, KERATOCAN, VIMENTIN, SOX9, SOX10 and HNK1, production of collagen fibrils and differentiation into keratocytes, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, neurons, adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes. SSC underwent 48 population doublings still forming spheres, Thus, this new method allows both SSC and LSC to be isolated from small superficial limbal biopsies and to be primary cultured in feeder-free and xeno-free conditions, which will be useful for clinical purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2770504961,"Climate change and land use change are two major elements of human-induced global environmental change. In temperate grasslands and woodlands, increasing frequency of extreme weather events like droughts and increasing severity of wildfires has altered the structure and dynamics of vegetation. In this paper, we studied the impact of wildfires and the year-to-year differences in precipitation on species composition changes in semi-arid grasslands of a forest-steppe complex ecosystem which has been partially disturbed by wildfires. Particularly, we investigated both how long-term compositional dissimilarity changes and species richness are affected by year-to-year precipitation differences on burnt and unburnt areas. Study sites were located in central Hungary, in protected areas characterized by partially-burnt, juniper-poplar forest-steppe complexes of high biodiversity. Data were used from two long-term monitoring sites in the Kiskunság National Park, both characterized by the same habitat complex. We investigated the variation in species composition as a function of time using distance decay methodology. In each sampling area, compositional dissimilarity increased with the time elapsed between the sampling events, and species richness differences increased with increasing precipitation differences between consecutive years. We found that both the long-term compositional dissimilarity, and the year-to-year changes in species richness were higher in the burnt areas than in the unburnt ones. The long-term compositional dissimilarities were mostly caused by perennial species, while the year-to-year changes of species richness were driven by annual and biennial species. As the effect of the year-to-year variation in precipitation was more pronounced in the burnt areas, we conclude that canopy removal by wildfires and extreme inter-annual variability of precipitation, two components of global environmental change, act in a synergistic way. They enhance the effect of one another, resulting in greater long-term and year-to-year changes in the composition of grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2770068739,"Subspecies relationships within the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) have been long debated because of the polytypic nature of melanin-based plumage characteristics used in subspecies designations and potential differentiation of local subpopulations due to philopatry. In North America, understanding the evolutionary relationships among subspecies may have been further complicated by the introduction of captive bred peregrines originating from non-native stock, as part of recovery efforts associated with mid 20th century population declines resulting from organochloride pollution. Alaska hosts all three nominal subspecies of North American peregrine falcons–F. p. tundrius, anatum, and pealei–for which distributions in Alaska are broadly associated with nesting locales within Arctic, boreal, and south coastal maritime habitats, respectively. Unlike elsewhere, populations of peregrine falcon in Alaska were not augmented by captive-bred birds during the late 20th century recovery efforts. Population genetic differentiation analyses of peregrine populations in Alaska, based on sequence data from the mitochondrial DNA control region and fragment data from microsatellite loci, failed to uncover genetic distinction between populations of peregrines occupying Arctic and boreal Alaskan locales. However, the maritime subspecies, pealei, was genetically differentiated from Arctic and boreal populations, and substructured into eastern and western populations. Levels of interpopulational gene flow between anatum and tundrius were generally higher than between pealei and either anatum or tundrius. Estimates based on both marker types revealed gene flow between augmented Canadian populations and unaugmented Alaskan populations. While we make no attempt at formal taxonomic revision, our data suggest that peregrine falcons occupying habitats in Alaska and the North Pacific coast of North America belong to two distinct regional groupings–a coastal grouping (pealei) and a boreal/Arctic grouping (currently anatum and tundrius)–each comprised of discrete populations that are variously intra-regionally connected."
https://openalex.org/W2769590546,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes over 800,000 deaths worldwide annually, mainly in low income countries, and incidence is rising rapidly in the developed world with the spread of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses. Natural Killer (NK) cells protect against viral infections and tumours by killing abnormal cells recognised by Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR). Thus genes and haplotypes encoding these receptors may be important in determining both outcome of initial hepatitis infection and subsequent chronic liver disease and tumour formation. HBV is highly prevalent in The Gambia and the commonest cause of liver disease. The Gambia Liver Cancer Study was a matched case-control study conducted between September 1997 and January 2001 where cases with liver disease were identified in three tertiary referral hospitals and matched with out-patient controls with no clinical evidence of liver disease. Methods We typed 15 KIR genes using the polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) in 279 adult Gambians, 136 with liver disease (HCC or Cirrhosis) and 143 matched controls. We investigated effects of KIR genotypes and haplotypes on HBV infection and associations with cirrhosis and HCC. Results Homozygosity for KIR group A gene-content haplotype was associated with HBsAg carriage (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.4–10.0) whilst telomeric A genotype (t-AA) was associated with reduced risk of e antigenaemia (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0–0.6) and lower viral loads (mean log viral load 5.2 vs. 6.9, pc = 0.022). One novel telomeric B genotype (t-ABx2) containing KIR3DS1 (which is rare in West Africa) was also linked to e antigenaemia (OR 8.8, 95% CI 1.3–60.5). There were no associations with cirrhosis or HCC. Conclusion Certain KIR profiles may promote clearance of hepatitis B surface antigen whilst others predispose to e antigen carriage and high viral load. Larger studies are necessary to quantify the effects of individual KIR genes, haplotypes and KIR/HLA combinations on long-term viral carriage and risk of liver cancer. KIR status could potentially inform antiviral therapy and identify those at increased risk of complications for enhanced surveillance."

Lack of structural information has precluded elucidation of the allosteric basis for the decreased DNA affinity in RcnR’s metal-bound states. Here, using hydrogen–deuterium exchange coupled with MS (HDX-MS), we probed the RcnR structure in the presence of DNA, the cognate metal ions Ni(II) and Co(II), or the noncognate metal ion Zn(II). We found that cognate metal binding altered flexibility from the N terminus through helix 1 and modulated the RcnR–DNA interaction. Apo–RcnR and RcnR–DNA complexes and the Zn(II)–RcnR complex exhibited similar 2H uptake kinetics, with fast-exchanging segments located in the N terminus, in helix 1 (residues 14–24), and at the C terminus. The largest difference in 2H incorporation between apo- and Ni(II)- and Co(II)-bound RcnR was observed in helix 1, which contains the N terminus and His-3, and has been associated with cognate metal binding. 2H uptake in helix 1 was suppressed in the Ni(II)- and Co(II)-bound RcnR complexes, in particular in the peptide corresponding to residues 14–24, containing Arg-14 and Lys-17. Substitution of these two residues drastically affected DNA-binding affinity, resulting in rcnA expression in the absence of metal. Our results suggest that cognate metal binding to RcnR orders its N terminus, decreases helix 1 flexibility, and induces conformational changes that restrict DNA interactions with the positively charged residues Arg-14 and Lys-17.

Models of the frmRAB promoter region with the apo-EcFrmR crystal structure suggested that Lys-10, Arg-14, Arg-16, and Arg-17 (Lys-10, Arg-14, Ser-16, and Lys-17 in RcnR sequence) interact with the major grooves of the DNA, and Lys-91 (Lys-90 in RcnR) is packed into the minor groove, and that these interactions are disrupted when Pro-2 is cross-linked to Cys-35 by formaldehyde in the N terminus (25Denby K.J.

In contrast to FrmR, there is a lack of detailed information regarding how EcRcnR interacts with DNA and the nature of the allostery induced by cognate metal binding that affects the protein–DNA interaction. Herein, we report the use of hydrogen–deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) 2The abbreviations used are: HDX-MShydrogen-deuterium exchange–mass spectrometryESIelectrospray ionizationRcnRresistance to cobalt and nickel repressorTEAtrimethylamineTEAAtrimethylamine with acetic acid. to probe the RcnR structure in the presence of DNA, cognate metal ions (Ni(II)/Co(II)), and the non-cognate metal ion, Zn(II). The results provide information regarding the effects on protein dynamics of the binding of cognate versus non-cognate metal ions and, coupled with a mutagenic study, lead to a proposed mechanism for how binding of cognate metals decrease DNA affinity in RcnR. This proposed mechanism is supported by the structure of FrmR and studies in CsoR and reveal how the allosteric response may be adapted from formaldehyde cross-linking to metal binding to evolve transcriptional regulators that respond to distinct chemical signals. hydrogen-deuterium exchange–mass spectrometry electrospray ionization resistance to cobalt and nickel repressor trimethylamine trimethylamine with acetic acid. The interaction of RcnR with DNA was investigated using a titration employing site 1 DNA, a 24-mer DNA molecule with a single TACT-G6-N-AGTA recognition site, coupled with native ESI-MS (28Kaltashov I.A. Bobst C.E. Abzalimov R.R. Mass spectrometry-based methods to study protein architecture and dynamics.Protein Sci. 2013; 22 (23436701): 530-54410.1002/pro.2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Native ESI-MS measurements allow for the unambiguous assignment of DNA:RcnR stoichiometry over a range of ligand concentrations, although differences in ionization efficiencies for the different complexes and potential gas phase artifacts make determination of binding constants difficult. As shown in Fig. 1, the data clearly reveal the formation of 1:1 and 2:1 DNA–RcnR tetramer complexes, with the latter favored by increasing DNA concentrations. The 2:1 complex is detectable at a molar ratio of 1:1, indicating a significant affinity for a second site 1 DNA molecule at the protein and DNA concentrations used in this experiment. This can be understood in terms of a homology model (24Musiani F. Zambelli B. Bazzani M. Mazzei L. Ciurli S. Nickel-responsive transcriptional regulators.Metallomics. 2015; 7 (26099858): 1305-131810.1039/C5MT00072FCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) that reveals a band of positive charge circumscribing the RcnR tetramer, and thus provides two surfaces for specific interactions with two site 1 DNA molecules. This result is also consistent with nonspecific binding of a second site 1 DNA, as would occur in DNA wrapping by RcnR (22Iwig J.S. Chivers P.T. DNA recognition and wrapping by Escherichia coli RcnR.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393 (19703465): 514-52610.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.038Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A comparison of RcnR complexes with site 1 DNA versus site 1 + 2 DNA, a 44-mer DNA molecule with the full core RcnR-binding site (22Iwig J.S. Chivers P.T. DNA recognition and wrapping by Escherichia coli RcnR.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393 (19703465): 514-52610.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.038Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), using HDX-MS showed that the two complexes have remarkably similar global exchange kinetics (Fig. 2). RcnR has 88 backbone amide hydrogen atoms, 20% of which are rapidly exchanged (within 30 s) in apo-RcnR. The exchange increases to 47% after 30 min of D2O exposure. Remarkably, the protection of protein amide protons afforded by DNA binding is minimal, suggesting that the DNA complexes are quite dynamic. The site 1 DNA–RcnR complex has a slightly slower rate of deuterium incorporation than apo-RcnR, suggesting that site 1 DNA provides some protection to the backbone amide protons, but the fastest exchanging group is still accessible. Similarly, for the site 1 + 2 DNA–RcnR complex, the overall exchange rate decreases only marginally from that of the site 1 DNA–RcnR complex, indicating a little more protection in the larger complex, but the rapidly exchanging protons are not affected. Among these faster exchanging complexes, all have the same initial amount of deuterium uptake at 30 s, but the uptake slows at longer exposure time compared with apo-RcnR. In contrast, cognate metal binding dramatically increases the protection of backbone amide protons (Fig. 2). The initial exchange of only ∼10% protons represents a ∼50% decrease relative to apo-RcnR or the DNA complexes, indicating that some of the protons in the fast-exchanging group are protected by cognate metal binding. Only 26% of protons were exchanged in 30 min, and the exchange rate is essentially identical for Ni(II) and Co(II). Given the small effect associated with DNA binding, the change in exchange rate indicates altered protein dynamics that reflect a more rigid structure in the cognate metal complexes. The global deuterium exchange kinetics for the Zn(II)–RcnR complex are similar to those of the apoprotein and DNA complexes, but feature a smaller number (16%) of rapidly exchanged protons and a smaller number of protons exchanged over 30 min. Thus, the non-cognate metal complex affords more protection and is consistent with a less dynamic RcnR structure than in the DNA complexes, but not nearly so much as observed in the cognate metal complexes. To identify specific regions of the protein that are protected in the DNA and metal complexes, localized HDX-MS was performed. Pepsin digestion following HDX was done online for 4.5 min and 44 peptides that provided 98.9% coverage of RcnR were selected. The proteolytic peptide map is shown in Fig. 3. The HDX kinetics for six peptides are shown in Fig. 4, with the remaining peptides shown in Fig. S1.Figure 4Deuterium uptake kinetics for selected peptides. Error bars are the mean ± S.D. from triplicate measurements. The location of each peptide in the tetramer is indicated in red on the homology model of RcnR from reference (24Musiani F. Zambelli B. Bazzani M. Mazzei L. Ciurli S. Nickel-responsive transcriptional regulators.Metallomics. 2015; 7 (26099858): 1305-131810.1039/C5MT00072FCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Missing data (e.g. for Zn (orange) in panel c and site 1 + 2 DNA (purple) in panels c and e) indicates that this particular peptide was not found in the specific experiment or that the data quality was not good. However, redundancies in the coverage means that the same information can be found from other peptides (e.g. for aa 26–37 and 25–36) in the Fig. S1. Color scheme for the different samples is indicated in panel d, and is the same as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In apo-RcnR, the largest change in deuterium incorporation is associated with the N terminus (residues 2–13), helix 1 (residues 14–24), and the C terminus (residues 80–87) (Fig. 5). The N-terminal region and helix 1 have distinct deuterium uptake kinetics (Fig. 4, a and b). The N terminus reaches the maximum deuterium uptake level, ∼35%, within 30 s and thus constitutes one fast-exchange group. The helix 1 peptide reaches 17% of its maximum exchange in 30 s, and continues to incorporate deuterium, reaching 40% after 1.5 h of D2O exposure, indicating that the N terminus is more dynamic. The deuterium uptake kinetics for the site 1 DNA–RcnR complex is very similar to those of apo-RcnR and features the same rapid deuterium uptake at N terminus (Fig. 4a). However, a small decrease in the deuterium incorporation rates in the peptides corresponding to residues 2–24, 37–52, and 80–87 is observed in the complex (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1). The site 1 + 2 DNA–RcnR complex shows more protection in these three regions, suggesting a potential DNA-binding site that aligns well with the location of positively charged residues (Arg-14, Arg-46, and Lys-17) identified by mutagenesis (see below). The data regarding the metal complexes reveal that cognate metal binding induces minor protection of amide protons for most of the peptides, and a significant level of protection in peptides corresponding to residues in the N terminus and helix 1 (residues 14–24) that is virtually identical for Ni(II) and Co(II) and not observed in the Zn(II)–RcnR complex (Fig. 4, a and b). There is <10% deuterium incorporation at the N terminus after 90 min of D2O exposure, indicating that the N terminus is much less flexible in either cognate metal complex. This result is supported by the overall deuterium incorporation heat map (Fig. 5). This analysis highlights a segment corresponding to residues 2–13 that shows low levels of protection in apo-RcnR, the DNA– and the Zn(II)–RcnR complexes, but is protected in the cognate metal complexes. The results are consistent with the use of the N-terminal amine as a ligand in the cognate metal-binding site (29Higgins K.A. Chivers P.T. Maroney M.J.

Other peptides, such as those containing residues 26–39, 53–72, and 53–78 also show some protection upon cognate metal binding, but the differences are relatively small compared with the N-terminal region, and mutations, including R74A, have little effect on DNA affinity (Figure 4, Figure 6 and Fig. S1) (18Iwig J.S.

However, it is worth noting that these peptides span loop regions in a homology model of RcnR and contain some of the other known metal ligands, including Cys-35 and His-64 (18Iwig J.S. Leitch S.

This is consistent with the metal-binding site being largely pre-formed in apo-RcnR and where the binding of the flexible N terminus acts as an allosteric “switch” (32Carr C.E. Musiani F. Huang H.-T.

Although most regions of RcnR have low deuterium exchange rates in the presence of the cognate metals, part of helix 2, particularly in peptides 45–53 and 40–55 (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1), show a slightly higher exchange rate compared with apo-RcnR. This is consistent with prior studies of CsoR and FrmR that show helix repacking upon binding of the signaling moiety (Cu(I) for CsoR and formaldehyde for FrmR) (25Denby K.J. Iwig J. Bisson C.

The HDX-MS results for the peptides corresponding to residues 14–24 and 2–24 show that about half of the backbone amide protons are protected in the cognate metal complexes relative to apo-RcnR (Fig. 4b and Fig. S1). This region contains two highly conserved residues, Arg-14 and Lys-17. Mutagenesis was used to assess the roles of specific Arg and Lys residues in binding DNA by preparing several RcnR variants that were subsequently assayed for repressor activity in vivo using a LacZ transcription reporter assay (Fig. 6) (18Iwig J.S. Leitch S. Herbst R.W. Maroney M.J. Chivers P.T. Ni(II) and Co(II) sensing by Escherichia coli RcnR.J. Am. Chem.

The R14A and K17A variants showed high levels of transcription in the absence of any added nickel (≥0.5 fractional activity of WT + nickel), suggesting DNA binding was strongly impaired. Other potential DNA-binding residues did not show a strong effect (Fig. 6). The R46A variant also showed some loss of repression in the absence of added metal (∼0.2 fractional activity of WT + nickel). This low level of de-repression is similar to what was observed previously for two variants in the C terminus, D77A and Y88F, in a study of RcnR variants that focused on nickel and cobalt responsiveness (18Iwig J.S. Leitch S. Herbst R.W. Maroney M.J. Chivers P.T. Ni(II) and Co(II) sensing by Escherichia coli RcnR.J. Am. Chem.

Arg-14, Gln-21, and Arg-46 are conserved between E. coli RcnR and FrmR, whereas a conservative replacement of Lys-17 to Arg is found in FrmR (Fig. 7).

Correlating these defects to the symptoms, mechanisms, and progression of disease requires unbiased, quantitative, and high-throughput means of quantifying nuclear morphology. To accomplish this, we developed a method of automatically segmenting fluorescently stained nuclei in 2D microscopy images and then classifying them as normal or dysmorphic based on three geometric features of the nucleus using a package of Matlab codes. As a test case, cultured skin-fibroblast nuclei of individuals possessing LMNA splice-site mutation (c.357-2A>G), LMNA nonsense mutation (c.736 C>T, pQ246X) in exon 4, LMNA missense mutation (c.1003C>T, pR335W) in exon 6, Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome, and no LMNA mutations were analyzed. For each cell type, the percentage of dysmorphic nuclei, and other morphological features such as average nuclear area and average eccentricity were obtained. Compared to blind observers, our procedure implemented in Matlab codes possessed similar accuracy to manual counting of dysmorphic nuclei while being significantly more consistent. The automatic quantification of nuclear defects revealed a correlation between in vitro results and age of patients for initial symptom onset. Our results demonstrate the method’s utility in experimental studies of diseases affecting nuclear shape through automated, unbiased, and accurate identification of dysmorphic nuclei."

Previous investigations indicated that a novel large-grit sand-blasted and acid-etched (SLA) titanium (denoted as SLAffinity-Ti) implant had better bone integration than that of a comparably shaped implant with a plasma-sprayed titanium surface. The purpose of the present investigation was to create a SLAffinity surface on pedicle screws and trauma screws and to compare it with the surfaces of a sand-blasted-only implant and commercial implants in terms of bone integration. The cortical bone and spine of twelve minipigs were implanted with 3 and 4 implants, respectively, and the bone integration was evaluated using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), mechanical tests (pull-out strength and stripping torque), and histological analysis (toluidine blue and hematoxylin and eosin staining) one and three months after implantation. The micro-CT images showed that the gap between the bone and implant was consistently higher in the sand-blasted-only and commercial groups compared to that in the SLAffinity group 1 and 3 months after implantation. Moreover, the bone volume of implant inserted into bone and the percentage of implant inside bone tissue were greater in the SLAffinity screws 1 and 3 months after implantation, as compared to the sand-blasted and commercial screws. In the mechanical tests, the removal torque and pull-out strength (p < 0.05) were higher in the SLAffinity group at 1 and 3 months. The histological results were consistent with mechanical testing, showing that the SLAffinity group had the most mineralized matrix, the most bone formation around the screws, and the most bone cells in bone tissue. These findings indicate that a SLAffinity surface can effectively enhance the holding strength and integration of pedicle screws and cortical screws, promoting early healing and improving outcomes, compared to sand-blasted-only and commercial implants."
https://openalex.org/W2768421260,"Background Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is common following cardiac surgery (CS). Body weight (BW) may be an amenable variable by representing the summation of the nutritional and the fluid status. However, the predictive role of perioperative BW changes in CS patients with severe postoperative AKI is never explored. This study aimed to evaluate this association. Methods This study was conducted using a prospectively collected multicenter cohort, NSARF (National Taiwan University Hospital Study Group on Acute Renal Failure) database. The adult CS patients with postoperative AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), who had clear initial consciousness, received CS within 14 days of hospitalization, and underwent RRT within seven days after CS in intensive care units from January 2001 to January 2014 were enrolled. With the endpoint of 30-day postoperative mortality, we evaluated the association between the clinical factors denoting fluid status and patients outcomes. Results A total of 188 patients (70 female, mean age 63.7 ± 15.2 years) were enrolled. Comparing with the survivors (n = 124), the non-survivors (n = 64) had a significantly higher perioperative BW change [3.6 ± 6.1% versus 0.1 ± 8.3%, p = 0.003] but not the postoperative and pre-RRT BW changes. By using multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, the independent indicators of 30-day postoperative mortality included perioperative BW change (p = 0.026) and packed red blood cells transfusion (p = 0.007), postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump (p = 0.001) and central venous pressure level (p = 0.005), as well as heart rate (p = 0.022), sequential organ failure assessment score (p < 0.001), logistic organ dysfunction score (p = 0.001), and blood total bilirubin level (p = 0.044) at RRT initiation. The generalized additive models further demonstrated, in a multivariate manner, that the mortality risk rose significantly during a perioperative BW change of 2% to 15%. Conclusions Perioperative BW change was independently associated with an increased risk for 30-day postoperative mortality in CS patients with RRT-requiring AKI."

Spontaneously breathing and MV untreated infected animals (n = 11 in each group), as well as uninfected animals (n = 5 in each group) were used as controls. Microbiological features and inflammation were evaluated. Data are presented as medians (interquartile range). Linezolid alone tended to reduce pulmonary MRSA load in both SB and MV rabbits, but failed to prevent bacteremia (59%) in the latter. Linezolid alone dampened TNF-α lung production in both SB and MV rabbits (e.g., 2226 [789] vs. 11478 [10251] pg/g; p = 0.022). Statins alone did the same in both SB and MV animals (e.g., 2040 [133]; p = 0.016), and dampened systemic inflammation in the latter, possibly through TLR2 down-regulation within the lung. However, the combination of LNZ and statin led to an increased rate of bacteremia in MV animals up to 75%. Statins provide an anti-inflammatory effect in rabbits with MRSA pneumonia, especially in MV ones. However, dampening the systemic inflammatory response with statins could impede blood defenses against MRSA."

In vivo μCT analysis of cortical bone at age 1 and 3 months confirmed increased thickness in Sost-/-mice, but revealed no cortical abnormalities in single Gja1+/-or Sost+/-mice. Double heterozygous Gja1+/-Sost+/-also showed no differences in mineral density, cortical thickness, width or geometry relative to wild type control mice. Likewise, 3-point bending measurement of bone strength revealed no significant differences between double Gja1+/-;Sost+/-or single heterozygous and wild type mice. Although these data do not exclude a contribution of reduced sclerostin in the cortical expansion seen in Gja1 deficient bones, they are not consistent with a strong genetic interaction between Sost and Gja1 dictating cortical modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2770338346,"Beedi also known as poor man's cigarette is manufactured in almost all major states of India. Beedi workers are exposed to various health risks. There is an increased risk of systemic absorption of tobacco through skin and mucous membrane. The optic nerve is susceptible to damage from several toxic substances including tobacco. This group of disorders is known as toxic optic neuropathy (TON). The association of TON with occupational exposure to unburnt tobacco in beedi rollers has not been explored.Among the beedi rollers in Mangaluru and Bantwal talukas of Dakshina Kannada District, Karnataka, India: to assess the magnitude of potential TON utilizing colour vision and contrast sensitivity as screening tools and to identify the demographic, biological and occupational factors associated with potential TON.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April-Sept 2016 in Mangaluru and Bantwal talukas, of Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka. Beedi rollers from twelve villages (six from each taluka) were included. In each of the selected villages, the investigators identified beedi collection centres and all the eligible beedi rollers were included in the study till the required number of beedi rollers for that village was achieved. Participants were screened at the study site for visual acuity, colour vision and contrast sensitivity and those with abnormal colour and contrast sensitivity in the presence of good visual acuity were considered to have potential TON.A total of 377 beedi rollers were approached; of which 365 consented to take part in the study (response rate: 96.81%). Women constituted the majority of the participants (n = 338, 92.6%). Based on the screening criteria, the prevalence of potential TON was 17.5% (n = 64, 95% CI: 13.5-21.9). On multiple logistic regression analysis, duration of beedi rolling (Adj OR: 1.061; 95% CI 1.015-1.109, p = 0.009), advancing age (Adj OR: 1.096; 95% CI 1.058-1.136, p<0.001) and presence of diabetes (Adj OR: 6.315; 95% CI 1.4572-27.376, p = 0.014) were independent correlates of potential TON.In the present study, almost one out of six beedi rollers displayed clinical signs of potential TON. Increased duration of beedi rolling, advancing age and presence of diabetes were the independent correlates of potential TON. However, with this cross-sectional study it is not possible to conclude if these factors play a role individually or collectively or are a serendipitous association, for which large scale analytical studies are required."
https://openalex.org/W2769777733,"Web of Things (WoT) platforms are growing fast so as the needs for composing WoT apps more easily and efficiently. We have recently commenced the campaign to develop an interface where users can issue requests for WoT apps entirely in natural language. This requires an effort to build a system that can learn to identify relevant WoT functions that fulfill user's requests. In our preceding work, we trained a supervised learning system with thousands of publicly-available IFTTT app recipes based on conditional random fields (CRF). However, the sub-par accuracy and excessive training time motivated us to devise a better approach. In this paper, we present a novel solution that creates a separate learning engine for each trigger service. With this approach, parallel and incremental learning becomes possible. For inference, our system first identifies the most relevant trigger service for a given user request by using an information retrieval technique. Then, the learning engine associated with the trigger service predicts the most likely pair of trigger and action functions. We expect that such two-phase inference method given parallel learning engines would improve the accuracy of identifying related WoT functions. We verify our new solution through the empirical evaluation with training and test sets sampled from a pool of refined IFTTT app recipes. We also meticulously analyze the characteristics of the recipes to find future research directions."
https://openalex.org/W2770554216,"We therefore sought to identify the exposures associated with lung surface in long-term residents of São Paulo, Brazil.Lung surface carbon were analyzed in 72 autopsy specimens by image analysis. Smoking history, measured PM10 nearest to the home, distance to main road, and distance-weighted traffic density were used as exposure variables. Data are summarized as median (IQR), and compared by Mann Whitney Test, with correlations done by Spearman's correlation.There was no association between lung surface and age or gender. There was no statistically significant association in lung surface between smokers and non-smokers 6.74 cm2 (3.47 to 10.02) versus 5.20cm2 (2.29 to 7.54), and there was no significant association between lung surface carbon and exposure to environmental PM and markers of traffic exposure.We did not find a statistically significant association between lung surface and smokers and non-smokers, and no statistically significant association between lung surface carbon and environmental exposure variables. These results suggest that lung surface carbon in long-term residents of São Paulo may predominately be from environmental PM, but the most appropriate environmental exposure marker remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2768455327,"We used NMR-based metabolomics to test two hypotheses-(i) there will be evolved differences in the metabolome of selected and control populations even under un-infected conditions and (ii) post infection, the metabolomes of the selected and control populations will respond differently. We selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for increased survivorship (I) against a gram-negative pathogen. We subjected the selected (I) and their control populations (S) to three different treatments: (1) infected with heat-killed bacteria (i), (2) sham infected (s), and (3) untreated (u). We performed 1D and 2D NMR experiments to identify the metabolic differences. Multivariate analysis of the metabolic profiles of the untreated (Iu and Su) flies yielded higher concentrations of lipids, organic acids, sugars, amino acids, NAD and AMP in the Iu treatment as compared to the Su treatment, showing that even in the absence of infection, the metabolome of the I and S regimes was different. In the S and I regimes, post infection/injury, concentration of metabolites directly or indirectly associated with energy related pathways (lipids, organic acids, sugars) declined while the concentration of metabolites that are probably associated with immune response (amino acids) increased. However, in most cases, the I regime flies had a higher concentration of such metabolites even under un-infected conditions. The change in the metabolite concentration upon infection/injury was not always comparable between I and S regimes (in case of lactate, alanine, leucine, lysine, threonine) indicating that the I and S regimes had evolved to respond differentially to infection and to injury."
https://openalex.org/W2762547056,"In this paper, we present an automatic system for the analysis and labeling of structural scenes, floor plan drawings in Computer-aided Design (CAD) format. The proposed system applies a fusion strategy to detect and recognize various components of CAD floor plans, such as walls, doors, windows and other ambiguous assets. Technically, a general rule-based filter parsing method is fist adopted to extract effective information from the original floor plan. Then, an image-processing based recovery method is employed to correct information extracted in the first step. Our proposed method is fully automatic and real-time. Such analysis system provides high accuracy and is also evaluated on a public website that, on average, archives more than ten thousands effective uses per day and reaches a relatively high satisfaction rate."
