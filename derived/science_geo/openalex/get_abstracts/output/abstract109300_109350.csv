https://openalex.org/W1573531091,"Abstract The 26 S proteolytic complex (26 S is a macromolecular assembly thought to be involved in ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in the cytoplasm of higher eukaryotic cells. This complex is composed of one 20 S cylinder particle (multicatalytic proteinase, 20 S proteasome) and two cap-shaped 19 S particles comprising a set of polypeptides in the M(r) range of 35,000-110,000. Here we show that cell supernatant fractions contain both these two subunit complexes as distinct particles as well as assembled to 26 S proteasomes. We have separated and purified all three forms from Xenopus laevis oocytes and have determined their peptidase and protease activities. Using various antibodies specific for either a constitutive p52 polypeptide of the 19 S cap complex or for proteins of the 20 S cylinder particle, we have immunolocalized these complexes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of diverse species and cell types. The occurrence of all three forms, the 26 S proteasome, the 20 S cylinder particle, and the 19 S cap complex in the nucleoplasm has also been demonstrated in analyses of isolated giant nuclei from Xenopus oocytes. In addition, we show that the 19 S and 20 S subcomplexes can be released from 26 S proteasomes by ATP depletion and that readdition of ATP to 19 S and 20 S particles in cell extracts leads to the reformation of 26 S proteasomes. We discuss that all three particles (19 S, 20 S, and 26 S) exist in a dynamic equilibrium in both cell compartments and serve cytoplasmic as well as nucleus-specific functions."

https://openalex.org/W1668858601,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase is a soluble matrix protein that does not end in a consensus peroxisomal targeting signal-1. The amino terminus of S. cerevisiae peroxisomal thiolase is conserved in 6 of 11 residues with the amino terminus of rat thiolase B, shown to act as a peroxisomal targeting signal-2 (Swinkels, B.W., Gould, S.J., Bodnar, A.G., Rachubinski, R.A., and Subramani, S. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 3255-3262). Unlike mammalian peroxisomal thiolases, there is no extensive cleavage of S. cerevisiae thiolase upon import into peroxisomes. We demonstrate by in vivo expression that the amino-terminal 16 amino acids of S. cerevisiae thiolase are necessary and sufficient for targeting to peroxisomes. This result implies that yeast, like mammalian cells, can target proteins to the peroxisomal matrix by at least two different routes. We also demonstrate by targeted mutagenesis and in vivo expression of mutated thiolase genes that three amino acids conserved in the amino termini of all known thiolases are critical for efficient targeting of S. cerevisiae thiolase to peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W2118426007,"Voltage-gated Na+ channels are heteromeric proteins consisting of alpha and beta subunits. Although alpha subunits alone are sufficient to encode functional channels, beta 1 subunits appear to modulate the kinetics of inactivation. We have used a cross-species reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction approach to isolate cDNAs encoding a Na+ channel beta 1 subunit from human heart and skeletal muscle. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human beta 1 subunit exhibits 96% identity with the rat brain beta 1 subunit. Human beta 1 mRNA transcripts are abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. Genomic Southern blot hybridization experiments suggest that a single gene located on chromosome 19 encodes the human beta 1 subunit that is expressed in all three of these tissues. Co-expression of the human beta 1 subunit with the recombinant human skeletal muscle alpha subunit (hSkM1) in Xenopus oocytes results in Na+ currents that inactivate rapidly. In contrast, the human beta 1 subunit has no effect on the function of the tetrodotoxin-insensitive human heart Na+ channel (hH1). These findings indicate that the human beta 1 subunit is widely expressed but does not functionally modify all Na+ channel isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1535540127,"Evidence is presented that the radical observed upon reaction of myoglobin with hydrogen peroxide is a peroxyl radical. Simulation of this spectrum gives principal values for the g tensor of gx = 2.0357, gy = 2.0082, and gz = 2.0016, which are consistent with those of a peroxyl radical. Use of molecular oxygen isotopically labeled with 17O confirmed that the radical observed was a peroxyl radical. Removal of oxygen from the incubation by use of glucose and glucose oxidase revealed two radicals, one at giso = 2.0028 and the other at giso = 2.0073. Addition of various amounts of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide revealed that the spin trap and oxygen compete for the same radical site. Four model substrates, glutathione, styrene, arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, were individually added to both the aerobic and anoxic systems. Glutathione reacted with the peroxyl radical, reducing its intensity by 98%, and entirely eliminated the giso = 2.0028 line from the spectrum of the anoxic incubation. Styrene, arachidonic acid and linoleic acid reacted with the peroxyl radical, reducing its amplitude by 84, 57, and 35%, respectively, but did not decrease the amplitude of either radical species in the anoxic incubation. The giso = 2.0028 species detected in the anoxic incubation appears to be the original radical site to which molecular oxygen binds to form the peroxyl radical. This myoglobin-derived peroxyl radical species is responsible for the advent of lipid peroxidation as proposed in ischemia/reperfusion injury, as well as other reactions, as exemplified by the O2-dependent epoxidation of styrene."
https://openalex.org/W130078892,"The subcellular location of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is dictated by the interaction of the regulatory subunit (RII) with A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs). Using an interaction cloning strategy with RII alpha as a probe, we have isolated cDNAs encoding a novel 761-amino acid protein (named AKAP 95) that contains both RII- and DNA-binding domains. Deletion analysis and peptide studies revealed that the RII-binding domain of AKAP 95 is located between residues 642 and 659 and includes a predicted amphipathic helix. Zinc overlay and DNA binding studies suggest that the DNA-binding domain is composed of two CC/HH-type zinc fingers between residues 464 and 486 and residues 553 and 576. The AKAP was detected in a nuclear matrix fraction, and immunofluorescence using purified anti-AKAP 95 antibodies revealed a distinct nuclear staining in a variety of cell types. Direct overlay of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled RII alpha onto fixed rat embryo fibroblasts showed that high-affinity binding sites for RII exist in the nucleus and that these sites are blocked by an anchoring inhibitor peptide. Furthermore, AKAP 95 was detected in preparations of RII that were purified from cellular extracts using cAMP-agarose. The results suggest that AKAP 95 could play a role in targeting type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase for cAMP-responsive nuclear events."
https://openalex.org/W1577458365,"During mammalian spermatogenesis, many specific molecules are expressed. We have recently identified a 93-kDa male meiotic germ cell-specific antigen (Meg 1) exclusively expressed in germ cells from the pachytene spermatocyte to the spermatid stage using the monoclonal antibody TRA 369 (Watanabe, D., Sawada, K., Koshimizu, U., Kagawa, T., and Nishimune, Y. (1992) Mol. Reprod. Dev. 33, 307-312). In this study, we cloned a cDNA representing this antigen from a mouse testis cDNA expression library, using the monoclonal antibody TRA 369. Northern blotting showed that this transcript was 2.3 kilobases in length and was expressed only in the testis and not in other somatic tissues or in the ovary. The expression of the mRNA was first detected at the pachytene spermatocyte stage of male germ cell development, and this expression was correlated with the expression of the protein. Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that the predicted protein consists of 611 amino acids, including a hydrophobic NH2 terminus characteristic of a signal peptide, two sets of internal repetitive sequences (four repeats of IPDPSAVKPEDWDD and GEWXPPMIPNPXYQ), and a hydrophilic COOH terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence has 58% homology with dog calnexin (the ER membrane phosphoprotein of pancreatic cells) and significant partial homology with calreticulin (high affinity Ca(2+)-binding protein of the ER membrane) at the repetitive sequence. Furthermore, we demonstrated the 45Ca2+ binding ability of this antigen by a 45Ca2+ overlay assay, and the name calmegin is proposed for this antigen. Calmegin is a novel Ca(2+)-binding protein that is specifically expressed in spermatogenesis. The highly regulated, specific, and abundant expression of calmegin suggests that it has important roles in spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1552319209,"The naturally occurring nullHong Kong variant of human alpha 1-antitrypsin is truncated at its carboxyl terminus, and is retained and degraded in a pre-Golgi compartment of stably transfected murine hepatoma cells (Le, A., Graham, K. S., and Sifers, R. N. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14001-14007). Long-term metabolic radiolabeling with [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate in combination with low stringency immunoprecipitation of the nullHong Kong variant has resulted in the co-precipitation of a radiolabeled 90-kDa protein designated p90. Several criteria, including mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, absence of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, and immunoreactivity with peptide-specific antiserum, have indicated that co-precipitating p90 is identical to calnexin, a calcium-binding phosphoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Wada, I. W., Rindress, P. H., Ou, W.-J., Doherty, J. J., Louvard, D., Bell, A. W., Dignard, D., Thomas, D. Y., and Bergeron, J. J. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19599-19610). Finally, results from co-immunoprecipitation analyses and velocity sedimentation experiments have verified that approximately 30% of the retained nullHong Kong variant polypeptides are associated with calnexin in a 1:1 molar ratio and can be dissociated with either deoxycholate or chelation of calcium ions at 37 degrees C. Overall, these findings may extend our current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of serum alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1599894891,"Transient transfection assays were used to determine how the activity of phospholipase C beta 4, which is preferentially expressed in retina, was regulated. An expression vector carrying the full-length cDNA corresponding to phospholipase C beta 4 was constructed and co- transfected into COS-7 cells together with cDNA encoding the alpha subunits of the Gq class and various beta and gamma subunits corresponding to the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. We found that all the alpha subunits of the Gq class, including G alpha q, G alpha 11, G alpha 14, G alpha 15, and G alpha 16 could activate PLC beta 4 and that none of the G beta gamma subunits that we tested including G beta 1 gamma 1, G beta 1 gamma 2, G beta 1 gamma 3, or G beta 2 gamma 2 activated phospholipase C beta 4. In control experiments, cotransfection with cDNA encoding the alpha subunit of transducin or Gi2 gave no activation of PLC beta 4. These results indicate that phospholipase C beta 4 is activated by G alpha subunits that are members of the Gq class, and, like the phospholipase C beta 1 isoform, it is refractory to activation in the transfection assay by many of the combinations of beta and gamma subunits found in the heterotrimeric G- proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1595767711,"The constitutive transcription factor Sp1 plays a role in the transcription of numerous viral and cellular genes including constitutive housekeeping genes and inducible genes. Sp1 has also been implicated in the formation of a nucleosome-free region in Simian virus 40 (SV40) minichromosomes. To investigate the potential functions of Sp1 in remodeling chromatin structures, Sp1 was analyzed for the ability to bind its recognition sites (GC boxes) in DNA fragments reconstituted into nucleosome cores. Sp1 was found to bind to the GC boxes of the SV40 early promoter when this element was reconstituted into nucleosome cores. The affinity of Sp1 for the nucleosomal SV40 early promoter DNA was reduced approximately 10-20-fold relative to naked DNA. A peptide containing only the zinc fingers of Sp1 was also capable of binding nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the glutamine-rich and serine/threonine-rich domains of Sp1 are not required for nucleosome binding. The binding of Sp1 to nucleosome cores resulted in the formation of a ternary Sp1-nucleosome complex."
https://openalex.org/W1486944682,"Lymphocyte antigen receptor variable regions are encoded by gene segments that are assembled by the site-specific variable (diversity) joining (V(D)J) recombination process. We have assayed the V-3 Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which has a double-strand DNA break repair (dsbr) defect, for the ability to carry out V(D)J recombination following transfection of constructs that encode the RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins necessary to confer V(D)J recombination activity to non-lymphoid cells. The V-3 cells had substantially impaired ability to undergo V(D)J recombination of transiently introduced test substrates. Although these cells can initiate V(D)J recombination by introducing endonucleolytic scissions at the junctions of V(D)J recombination signal sequences and the flanking coding sequences, they have a greatly impaired ability to rejoin the coding sequences. Detailed characterization of attempted coding joins recovered from these cells indicated that the V(D)J recombination defect in V-3 is similar in phenotype to the murine severe combined immunodeficient (scid) defect and quite distinct from that found in other Chinese hamster ovary dsbr mutant cell lines. Somatic cell complementation analyses between homozygous scid mutant fibroblasts and V-3 cells confirmed that these mutations fall into the same genetic complementation group."
https://openalex.org/W1817697242,"The polychlorobiphenyl-degrading bacterium Rhodococcus globerulus P6 contains three bphC genes encoding 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenases. One of them, bphC1, is clustered with the bphB gene which encodes 2,3-dihydroxy-4-phenylhexa-4,6-diene dehydrogenase and constitutes part of the bph operon specifying the degradation of biphenyl. The nucleotide sequence of bphB and the three bphC genes has been determined. The protein products of the bphBC1 gene cluster were found to exhibit significant homology with the corresponding proteins of analogous degradative pathways in Gram-negative bacteria; the highest homology was in those of the toluene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas putida strain F1. No homology was found between bphC2 and bphC3 and any other sequence in the database. At least two of the three meta cleavage enzymes are inducible by biphenyl. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase II, encoded by the bphC2 gene, was purified to apparent homogeneity from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. The enzyme differed from other extradiol dioxygenases in having a subunit molecular mass of 21 kDa and a hexameric structure. The enzyme contains one tightly bound iron per subunit. These characteristics demonstrate that the 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenases encoded by bphC2 and bphC3 belong to a new class of extradiol dioxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W1501581564,"To date, five distinct alpha chains have been identified in basement membrane collagen IV. We have cloned a gene encoding a new alpha chain belonging to basement membrane collagen IV by cDNA isolation under low stringency conditions. Isolation of overlapping clones and the technique of 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends enabled us to derive the primary structure of the entire polypeptide. The deduced collagen polypeptide contained 1678 amino acid residues, including a 21-residue signal peptide, a 24-residue amino-terminal NC domain, a central 1405-residue collagenous (COL1) domain, and a 228-residue carboxyl-terminal NC1 domain. We have designated this newly found alpha chain as the alpha 6(IV) chain. The gene was mapped to chromosome Xq22 by in situ hybridization of metaphase lymphocytes. This is the same region of chromosome X where the gene coding for the alpha 5(IV) collagen chain (COL4A5) resides. Mutations in COL4A5 have been characterized in more than 50 patients with Alport syndrome. However, some of the X-linked cases of Alport syndrome are not apparently caused by COL4A5 mutations. The gene we describe in this paper therefore seems to be a candidate for mutations in this group of Alport syndrome patients."
https://openalex.org/W1526937427,"To search for a possible role for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) during erythroid differentiation, we cloned the PBR isoquinoline carboxamide-binding protein (PBR/IBP), an 18-kDa protein on PBR, from a mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that PBR/IBP comprises 169 amino acid residues (M(r) 18,828), and has a high homology with PBR/IBP from other sources. The cDNA allows for the expression of active PBR/IBP, exhibiting a high affinity for isoquinoline carboxamide, [3H]PK11195, with Kd of 0.80 and 1.56 nM. RNA blot analysis revealed that treatment of MEL cells with dimethyl sulfoxide led to an increase in PBR/IBP mRNA (delta 1.0 kilobases) for up to 72 h, with a concomitant induction of mRNAs for heme biosynthetic enzymes, coproporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase. The induction of PBR/IBP mRNA was also observed in MEL cells induced with diazepam. The binding activity of [3H]PK11195 in MEL cells showed a high affinity with Kd of 0.69-2.13 nM, and increased during erythroid differentiation. The order of potency of different ligands to compete against [3H]PK11195 binding in induced MEL cells was PK11195 > protoporphyrin IX > diazepam > coproporphyrinogen III > coproporphyrin III > estazolam. In contrast to the induction of PBR/IBP in induced MEL cells, the voltage-dependent anion channel (mitochondrial porin) associated with PBR remained unchanged. These results suggest that PBR/IBP on PBR may be involved in porphyrin transport and may even be a critical factor in erythroid-specific induction of heme biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1499020433,"To further define the nucleic acid determinants that govern the recognition of DNA by topoisomerase II, the ability of the enzyme to cleave a 51-base oligonucleotide that contained a centrally located 19-base hairpin was characterized. Topoisomerase II cleaved the 51-mer in a site-specific fashion, within the hairpin, one nucleotide from the 3'-base of the stem. Protein denaturants were not required to trap cleavage products. Although the sequence of the oligonucleotide influenced levels of enzyme-mediated DNA scission, it did not affect the spatial location of cleavage. DNA scission required a double-stranded/single-stranded junction at the 3'-base of the hairpin and a tail (either single- or double-stranded) at least 8 bases in length on the 5'-side. Cleavage was not observed when base-pairing within the oligonucleotide was eliminated or when the hairpin was extended to produce a completely double-stranded substrate. Finally, the enzyme displayed a size constraint for both the stem and loop structures of the hairpin. These results indicate that topoisomerase II is capable of recognizing secondary structure within nucleic acids and identifies the first secondary structure-specific DNA recognition/cleavage site for the type II enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1575109982,"The mechanism by which mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is activated in human B cells following cross-linking of the antigen receptor was investigated. Following anti-IgM antibody and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, we demonstrate the activation of Ras, Raf-1, and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), all of which are thought to participate in an important signaling cascade that leads to MAPK activation. We detected the kinase activities of Raf-1 and MEK toward purified recombinant substrates for each in this pathway (MEK for Raf-1 and MAPK for MEK). Following stimulation with either anti-IgM or PMA, Ras activation was observed, and the ability of Raf-1 to phosphorylate recombinant kinase-inactive MEK was increased by approximately 10-fold. Similarly, MEK activity toward kinase-active or -inactive recombinant MAPK also increased upon anti-IgM or PMA treatment. Furthermore, the activation of both MAPK and p90rsk was demonstrated under identical conditions in the B cells. We conclude that activation of B lymphocytes through the antigen receptor stimulates distinct members of the Ras/Raf-1/MEK cascade and this mechanism is likely to be responsible for MAPK and p90rsk activation in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1559179380,"The functional role of human tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) p75 was studied by the use of TNFR p75-specific agonistic antibodies. Human SW480T adenocarcinoma cells, stably transfected with a reporter construct containing beta-galactosidase under the control of human cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer, were stimulated with anti-TNFR p75 polyclonal antiserum or monoclonal antibodies followed by measurement of beta-galactosidase activity and analysis by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. It was found that cross-linking of TNFR p75 led to strong induction of the human cytomegalovirus enhancer as well as activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). Stimulation of TNFR p75 also mediated activation of NF-kappa B in human KYM-1 rhabdomyosarcoma cells but not in other cell types such as U937 and HL-60 monocytic cells or in Eahy 926 endothelial cells. NF-kappa B activation induced by TNFR p75 was delayed approximately 15 min compared with NF-kappa B activation induced by TNFR p55, indicating that the two TNFRs activate NF-kappa B through different signaling pathways. The data presented in this study identify intracellular responses mediated by TNFR p75 which have not been reported previously and suggest that TNFR p75-induced activation of NF-kappa B is strictly cell type-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1502542469,"Acidic water stress polypeptides (Wsp) with molecular masses of 33, 37 and 39 kDa are the most abundant soluble proteins in the cyanobacterium Nostoc commune. Wsp polypeptides and UV-A/B-absorbing pigments are secreted by cells, accumulate in the extracellular glycan sheath, and are released from desiccated colonies upon rehydration. No evidence was obtained for either glycosylation, phosphorylation, or acylation of Wsp polypeptides. NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the 33-, 37-, and 39-kDa polypeptides were identical: Ala-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-Thr-Ile-Gly-Glu-Gln-X-Ile-Gln-Asn-Pro-Ser-Asn- Pro-Ser-Asn-Gly-Lys-Gln. This consensus NH2-terminal sequence and an internal sequence (Glu-Ala-Arg-Val-Thr-Gly-Pro-Thr-Thr-Pro-Ile-Asp) showed homologies with the sequences of carbohydrate-modifying enzymes. Purified Wsp polypeptides associate with a 1,4-beta-D-xylanxylanohydrolase activity that was inhibited specifically by Wsp antiserum. In the absence of salt, Wsp polypeptides, and the water-soluble UV-A/B-absorbing pigments, form multimeric complexes through strong ionic interactions. A possible role is suggested for Wsp polypeptides in the synthesis and/or modification of a xylose-containing UV-A/B-absorbing pigment."
https://openalex.org/W1514090801,"The mode of membrane attachment of five subunits from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cytochrome b6f complex has been studied using biochemical approaches. Antisera specific for cytochrome f, cytochrome b6, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, subunit IV, and a 4-kDa subunit (product of the petG gene) were used to quantify the degree of extraction of each of these polypeptides following various treatments. In contrast to the other four subunits, the Rieske protein was extracted to extents varying between 50 and 100% following two cycles of freezing and thawing in the presence of chaotropic agents (KSCN, urea, or NaI). The Rieske protein was not extracted by 2 M NaCl and was rather resistant to alkaline treatments, being extracted by 20 mM 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid buffer only at pH > 11.5. The hydrodynamic behavior of the isolated Rieske protein was examined in the absence and presence of detergent by ultracentrifugation and by molecular sieving. The extracted protein bound neither to laurylmaltoside nor to C12E8 micelles. Its sedimentation coefficient (D20,w = 9.6 x 10(-11) m2 x s-1), diffusion coefficient (s20,w = 2S), an deduced molecular mass (20.0 +/- 1.7 kDa) are those expected for the monomeric protein. We conclude that the Rieske protein is extrinsic and therefore does not cross the membrane, although its association with the rest of the complex involves primarily hydrophobic interactions, and that the other four subunits analyzed are intrinsic."
https://openalex.org/W1592254226,"The sequence of the reversible phosphorylation and activation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase was investigated. Treatment of primary rat hepatocytes with oleic acid or phospholipase C caused a significant increase in the activity and amount of particulate cytidylyltransferase which correlated with decreased cytidylyltransferase activity and protein in the cytosol. The increase in membrane-associated cytidylyltransferase is accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation of the enzyme. Reversal of membrane association resulted in an increased amount of phosphorylated cytidylyltransferase in the cytosol. We wished to determine if dephosphorylation of the enzyme were a prerequisite for its translocation from the cytosol to the membranes. In vitro studies with membranes from oleic acid- or phospholipase C-treated cells showed that phosphorylated cytosolic cytidylyltransferase associated with these membranes with negligible dephosphorylation. Incubation of hepatocytes with oleic acid for different periods of time demonstrated that cytidylyltransferase associated with membranes in an active, phosphorylated form and was subsequently dephosphorylated. This result was supported by comparison of phosphopeptide maps of 32P-labeled cytidylyltransferase obtained from cytosolic, as well as membrane fractions of control, oleic acid-treated, or phospholipase C-treated cells. These studies revealed dephosphorylation on some sites and phosphorylation on other sites. Our data strengthen the hypothesis that a change in the lipid composition of membranes can mediate the initial binding of cytidylyltransferase to the membrane and that subsequently the enzyme becomes dephosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W1485413088,"To date, it has not been possible to determine whether the single phosphorylation of the cyclic AMP response element binding factor (CREB) at Ser-133 is sufficient for the transcriptional activation by cAMP-mediated pathways. Previous in vivo studies investigating this point have relied upon transfection of cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (cAPK) or its activation by treatment of cells with cell-permeable cAMP analogs. However, as numerous cellular proteins, including CREB, are substrates for activated cAPK, the possibility remains that cAPK substrates other than CREB are required for the transcriptional activity of CRE-containing promoters. To further address this, we compared the activity of recombinant CREB phosphorylated on Ser-133 in both cell-free transcription assays and in vivo after introduction of the same preparations into fibroblasts by microinjection. The activity of phosphorylated CREB, nonphosphorylated CREB, and a mutant form of CREB, containing Ala substituted for Ser at position 133, was found to be nearly identical in cell-free in vitro transcription assays. In contrast, we found that only the phosphorylated CREB microinjected into fibroblasts resulted in the stimulation of expression of CRE-regulated genes. These results suggest that phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-133 directly stimulates its ability to transactivate gene expression in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1498563943,"The association of a 94,000-Da viral polypeptide, called Rap94, with 30-40% of the multisubunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase molecules purified from infectious vaccinia virus particles was established by immunoaffinity chromatography. The submolar amount of Rap94, relative to RNA polymerase, was confirmed by quantitative immunoblotting of total virion extracts. Only the RNA polymerase molecules containing Rap94 could functionally interact with VETF, the vaccinia virus early transcription factor, to transcribe a double-stranded DNA template regulated by a viral early stage promoter. Rap94 was required for the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides and for the formation of stable ternary transcription complexes. With a nonspecific single-stranded DNA template, however, the Rap94-deficient polymerase had greater catalytic activity than the Rap94-containing polymerase. These data support a model in which Rap94 confers specificity to the RNA polymerase for promoters of early stage genes."
https://openalex.org/W1809723721,"An analysis of the base pair doublet geometries in available crystal structures indicates that the often reported intrinsic curvature of DNA containing oligo-(d(A).d(T)) tracts may also depend on the nature of the flanking sequences. The presence of CA/TG doublet in particular at the 5' end of these tracts is expected to enhance their intrinsic bending property. To test this proposition, three oligonucleotides, d(GAAAAACCCCCC), d(CCCCCCAAAAAG), d(GAAAAATTTTTC), and their complementary sequences were synthesized to study the effect of various flanking sequences, at the 5' and 3' ends of the A-tracts, on the curvature of DNA in solution. An analysis of the polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobilities of these sequences under different conditions of salts and temperatures (below their melting points) clearly showed that the oligomer with CA/TG sequence in the center was always more retarded than the oligomer with AC/GT sequence, as well as the oligomer with AT/AT sequence. Hydroxyl radical probing of the sequences with AC/GT and CA/TG doublet junctions gives a similar cutting pattern in the A-tracts, which is quite different from that in the C-tracts, indicating that the oligo(A)-tracts have similar structures in the two oligomers. KMnO4 probing shows that the oligomer with a CA/TG doublet junction forms a kink that is responsible for its inherent curvature and unusual electrophoretic mobility. UV melting shows a reduced thermal stability of the duplex with CA/TG doublet junction, and circular dichroism (CD) studies indicate that a premelting transition occurs in the oligomer with CA/TG doublet step before global melting but not in the oligomer with AC/GT doublet step, which may correspond to thermally induced unbending of the oligomer. These observations indicate that the CA/TG doublet junction at the 5' end of the oligo(A)-tract has a crucial role in modulating the overall curvature in DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1565051919,"ETB type endothelin receptor (ETBR) forms a stable complex with its ligand endothelin-1 (ET-1). The ligand-receptor complex can survive in the presence of 2% SDS and migrate in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at reduced temperature. This is not the case for the ETA type endothelin receptor (ETAR). Most of ETBR from various animals, except rat, can form such a stable complex. Examination of stability in the ligand-receptor complex which was formed by chimeric receptors constructed from human ETBR and rat ETBR demonstrated that the region containing 29 amino acids in the N-terminal extracellular domain is responsible for the formation of such a stable complex. Site-directed mutagenesis focused on this particular region revealed that Asp75 and Pro93 are involved in the formation of the stable complex. This unique observation contributes to the elucidation of the structure of the stable ETBR.ET-1 complex at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W1563275776,"The nuclear matrix is thought to play a fundamental role in the nuclear structure and functions relating to cell proliferation and regulation of gene activity. Phosphorylation of nuclear matrix proteins has been observed, and multiple protein kinases may be involved in this process. Casein kinase 2 is a ubiquitous messenger-independent serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in cellular growth and proliferation. The presence of immunoreactive casein kinase 2 in purified nuclear matrix preparations was demonstrated in rat liver and prostate tissues by employing specific antibodies. The enzyme was active toward the specific decapeptide substrate Arg-Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu and exhibited other properties characteristic of casein kinase 2. Phosphorylation of nuclear matrix proteins catalyzed by intrinsic protein kinase activity in intact nuclei was also observed, and the results suggested that this reaction was at least in part catalyzed by casein kinase 2. The profile of nuclear matrix proteins labeled with 32Pi in situ in intact liver cells was similar to that observed in nuclear matrix proteins isolated from nuclei labeled with [gamma-32P]ATP in vitro. Association of casein kinase 2 with the nuclear matrix may be of significance in the post-translational modification of certain proteins in this fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1487360117,"Two substitutions were made for Arg41 in the polar loop of subunit c of the Escherichia coli F1F0 H(+)-transporting ATP synthase. The R41K and R41H mutants were initially studied by use of a plasmid carrying the complete c R41K or c R41H unc (F1F0) operon in a chromosomal strain deleted for the unc operon. The extent of F0 incorporation into membranes of these cells was quite variable, and the system was concluded to be unsuitable for biochemical characterization. Ultimately, the mutant genes were recombined into the chromosome using a novel method for the unc system. The biochemical phenotype of the chromosomally expressed mutants proved to be reproducible. The c R41H mutation causes a specific defect in assembly of F0, i.e. subunit a was not incorporated into the membrane despite near normal incorporation of subunits b and c. On the other hand, c R41K mutant F0 assembled normally in one of two background strains studied. (In the second genetic background, subunit a was inefficiently incorporated into the c R41K membrane.) In membranes prepared from a c R41K strain assembling a complete F0, R41K F0 was found to bind F1 with near normal affinity and to transport H+ at near normal rates. Although R41K F0 binds F1, F1-ATPase activity and H+ transport remained uncoupled. The uncoupling was indicated by a lack of ATP-driven H+ translocation and by the high proton permeability of membranes with F1 bound to F0. The uncoupled phenotype of the R41K mutant closely resembles that previously reported for the c Q42E mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1573940404,"While previous studies have implicated the tyrosine protein kinase p60fyn in antigenic activation of T lymphocytes, it is clear that signal transduction initiated through the antigen receptor requires the concerted actions of several proteins. Here, we report our finding that the activation of p60fyn following TcR cross-linking results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of two Fyn-associated proteins of 82 and 116 kDa. In the cells analyzed, p116 appears to represent one of the major substrates of T-cell antigen receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. In activated T-cells, the interaction of these proteins is specific for p60fyn since neither p56lck nor p62c-yes were found to detectably associate with p82 or p116. Furthermore, the p60fyn-p82/p116 complex could be dissociated and then reconstituted in vitro using purified recombinant Fyn. Using this technique we demonstrated that both p82 and p116 were capable of binding to the Fyn SH2 domain while p82 was to some extent capable of independent binding to the Fyn SH3 domain. An association between p60fyn and phosphoproteins possibly related to the T-cell p82 and p116 was also observed in other hematopoietic cells. Thus, the activation-induced phosphorylation of the p60fyn-associated proteins p116 and p82 and the wide distribution of potentially similar p60fyn-associated proteins in hematopoietic cells suggest that p116 and p82 may play a role as physiological substrates and/or regulators of p60fyn."
https://openalex.org/W1573097600,"Channel-forming colicins are Escherichia coli proteins that form voltage-dependent channels in lipid bilayer membranes and are lethal to sensitive strains of E. coli. Experiments with colicin E1 have led to a model of voltage dependence based on the insertion of alpha-helical segments of the protein into the membrane in response to cis-positive voltages. This model was tested on the partly homologous colicin Ia protein, which offers certain advantages over colicin E1 as a model channel, it is active at neutral pH and exhibits comparatively well-defined single channel conductance. We describe here the creation of a specific probe for locating a particular amino acid residue on one side or the other of a planar lipid bilayer membrane, by using the biotin-streptavidin system. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change lysine 544 of colicin Ia to cysteine. This placed a unique cysteine at a site expected, by homology to colicin E1, to cross the membrane from the cis to the trans side in association with the opening of the channel. This unique cysteine was biotinylated chemically, so that it could serve as a target for streptavidin. Incubation of the biotinylated mutant colicin with streptavidin blocked its killing activity, in vivo; incubation of wild-type colicin, which lacks cysteine, with streptavidin, did not affect its activity. Channels formed by the biotinylated mutant protein in planar lipid bilayers were abolished by streptavidin added to the cis side of the membrane, if the channels were closed, but not if they were open. Trans streptavidin had no effect on either open or closed channels. Thus, when the channel is closed, residue 544 of colicin Ia is accessible to cis streptavidin in the closed state, but the opening of the channel eliminates this accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W1634224068,"The sequence of the nuclear gene encoding the Rieske iron-sulfur protein of the cytochrome b6f complex of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been established. Comparison of genomic clones and amplified cDNA indicates that the petC gene is interrupted by four introns within the coding sequence of the mature protein. The nucleotide sequence predicts a precursor protein of 206 amino acid residues with a transit peptide of 29 amino acids. The transit peptide is shorter than that of higher plants and has a basic region typical for the transfer through the chloroplast envelope, but no hydrophobic segment at the C-terminal end as is found in proteins transferred through the thylakoid membrane. The mature protein shows a high degree of homology with that of higher plants and has an N-terminal hydrophobic segment as in other Rieske proteins. Biochemical data (Breyton, C., de Vitry, C., and Popot, J.-L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7597-7602) indicate that the chloroplast Rieske protein of C. reinhardtii is an extrinsic membrane protein. Therefore, this N-terminal hydrophobic segment is not a transmembrane segment but may act as an uncleaved N-terminal thylakoid membrane transfer signal sequence. There are other examples of uncleaved hydrophobic membrane transfer signal in secreted proteins, although these are rare."
https://openalex.org/W1571520344,"The complement receptor CR1 (CD35) is a transmembrane protein composed in its extracellular portion of short consensus repeats (SCR 1-30) organized into four long homologous repeats (LHR-A, LHR-B, LHR-C, and LHR-D). Each LHR, except LHR-D, contains a binding site for C3b and/or C4b within its first four SCR. The binding reaction between CR1 and soluble dimers of C4b (C4b2) was analyzed using the native receptor on human erythrocytes and full-length recombinant CR1 expressed in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CR1 mutants expressed similarly were used to determine the SCR of LHR-A required for C4b2 binding and the potential of C3b binding sites in CR1 to bind C4b2. Erythrocyte CR1, CHO cells expressing full-length recombinant CR1 (ABCD), constructs ACD, and SCR(1-4)D each bound C4b2 with similar affinities (Kd, approximately 4 x 10(-7) M). Construct SCR(1-2)D bound C4b2 with lower affinity (Kd, 1.4 x 10(-6) M) indicating that SCR(1-4) are required for a fully functional C4b2 binding site. Construct SCR(15-18)D, which contains a C3b site, also bound C4b2 with lower affinity (Kd 1.2 x 10(-6) M) than its binding to C3b dimers. Constructs SCR(15-16)D and D did not bind C4b2. Each CR1 construct that bound C4b2 functioned as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage to C4d."

https://openalex.org/W1514047580,"We constructed a recombinant plasmid carrying a chimeric cDNA that encodes a fusion protein, ER:MGMT, composed of the ligand-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor and the human O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. By introducing this plasmid into the methyltransferase-deficient human cell line HeLa MR, a system was established in which nuclear translocation of the ER:MGMT fusion protein can be controlled by estrogen. On in situ immunostaining using anti-MGMT, the cytoplasm of ER:MGMT-carrying cells was preferentially stained and nuclear staining occurred only when the cells were exposed to estrogen. The estrogen-dependent nuclear translocation of ER:MGMT was confirmed by Western blotting analysis of fractionated cell extracts. The fusion protein was translocated into the nucleus within 1 h after estrogen treatment and remained there unless estrogen was removed. The methyltransferase activity of the fusion protein was as active as the authentic methyltransferase enzyme, regardless of the presence or absence of estrogen. The ER:MGMT-producing cells were sensitive to 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea (ACNU) in the absence of estrogen, and estrogen treatment rendered the cells as resistant to ACNU as the ordinary Mer+ cell line, HeLa S3, thereby indicating that translocation of the methyltransferase into the nucleus is a prerequisite for repair of the chromosomal DNA damaged by alkylating agents. Taking advantage of the artificial control of cellular localization of the fusion protein, we examined the timing of the nuclear translocation required to execute efficient DNA repair. We obtained evidence that the methyltransferase must repair the DNA damage as soon as the DNA is exposed to ACNU, in order to avoid cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase."
https://openalex.org/W1506082716,"Myoblast surface proteins with binding activity toward the N-terminal 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin were identified by two different experimental techniques: one involves radioiodination of the cell surface proteins, followed by solubilization with Triton X-100 and affinity purification on a Sepharose column conjugated with the 29-kDa fragment, and the other involves cross-linking of the 29-kDa fragment to the cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-29-kDa IgG. Both approaches revealed that primary cultures of chick myoblasts contain the 66- and 48-kDa proteins that bind to the 29-kDa fragment. These binding proteins were then purified to apparent homogeneity by two successive chromatographies of the solubilized extracts of 12-day-old embryonic muscle on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and 29-kDa fragment-Sepharose columns. However, the 48-kDa protein was found to be derived from contaminating fibroblasts upon immunoblot analysis of the myogenic cell lines, rat L8E63 and mouse C2A3, and cultured fibroblasts using the antibody raised against the 66-kDa protein. Anti-66-kDa IgG inhibited the binding of the 125I-29-kDa protein to the primary culture of myoblasts in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, the same antibody showed little or no effect on the initial binding of 125I-fibronectin to the cell surface, but dramatically inhibited its incorporation into deoxycholate-insoluble matrices. Furthermore, Fab fragments of anti-66-kDa IgG completely blocked the incorporation of fluoresceinated fibronectin into matrices but not its binding to the cell surface. These results suggest that fibronectin matrix assembly is mediated at least in part by the interaction of the 66-kDa protein with the N-terminal type I domain of fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1595055920,"A 21.3-kDa subunit of the peripheral arm of complex I from Neurospora is encoded by a single chromosomal gene, nuo-21.3b. It is located on linkage group V of the fungal genome, linked to inl. We have isolated and characterized a genomic clone containing this nuclear gene. A DNA fragment containing a portion of the coding region of the gene and upstream flanking sequences was introduced by transformation into a wild-type strain of Neurospora crassa. A single copy transformant was selected and crossed with another strain, leading to inactivation of nuo-21.3b through repeat-induced point mutations. We have analyzed random progeny from this cross and isolated two mutant strains lacking the 21.3-kDa subunit of complex I. One of them was further characterized. Our results suggest that most, if not all, other subunits of complex I are present in the mitochondria of the mutant and assembled in a structure similar to complex I, representing delta 25% of the amounts of enzyme found in the wild type. Nevertheless, a major intermediate, containing proteins of the peripheral arm of complex I, accumulates in the mutant mitochondria. This indicates that the absence of the 21.3-kDa polypeptide results in a disturbed assembly of the enzyme complex, suggesting a role for this polypeptide. We observed similar rates of rotenone-sensitive NADH:ubiquinone oxido-reductase activity in mitochondrial membranes from the mutant and wild-type strains and discuss the possibility that this electron transfer is independent of the more hydrophobic part of complex I. Transformation of the mutant with the intact gene and flanking sequences restored the wild-type phenotype."

Fourteen protease mutants had a temperature-sensitive phenotype, and approximately half resulted from conservative amino acid substitutions. Of the 14 substitutions that conferred a temperature-sensitive phenotype, 11 substitutions occurred at 6 positions that represent 3 pairs of residues in the protease that contact each other in the three-dimensional structure. These mutants assist in pinpointing regions of the protease that are important for enzyme activity and stability."
https://openalex.org/W1496089939,"A M(r) 100,000 phosphoprotein in the corpus luteum was identified as elongation factor 2 (EF-2). Since prolactin (PRL) is necessary for optimal luteal development and protein synthesis, we determined whether this hormone affects the content and/or phosphorylation of EF-2 in the corpus luteum. PRL treatment enhanced the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous EF-2 in luteal cytoplasmic extracts. Immunoblot analysis revealed that PRL had no effect on EF-2 levels, but examination of luteal EF-2 by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that PRL increased the relative amount of the most basic dephosphorylated forms of EF-2. This suggests that PRL induces net dephosphorylation of the protein in vivo. Since EF-2 phosphorylation is regulated by both Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase III (CaM kinase III) and protein phosphatase 2A, we examined the effect of PRL on both enzymes. Paradoxically, PRL enhanced the in vitro activity of CaM kinase III, possibly reflecting increased kinase levels, but had no effect on phosphatase activity. These results suggest that PRL maintains luteal EF-2 in a relatively dephosphorylated state in vivo by limiting the availability of Ca2+ and/or CaM to CaM kinase III. These data provide strong evidence for a role of the EF-2/CaM kinase III system in PRL action in the corpus luteum."
https://openalex.org/W1499302926,"A blood group type A disaccharide (GalNAc alpha 1-3Gal)-binding lectin has been purified from Dutch Iris (Iris x hollandica) bulbs to electrophoretic homogeneity by consecutive affinity chromatography on columns of immobilized asialofetuin-Sepharose 4B and Synsorb A disaccharide (GalNAc alpha 1-3Gal beta-O-(CH2)8CONH-Synsorb). This lectin agglutinates both native and trypsin-treated rabbit erythrocytes, but not human erythrocytes, irrespective of blood group type. Gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 HR column and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the lectin to be a heterodimer consisting of two peptide chains (27 and 34 kDa) linked by disulfide bonds. The carbohydrate binding specificity of the lectin was investigated by quantitative precipitation, hemagglutination inhibition, and precipitation inhibition assays. It is a Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin, with an extended carbohydrate combining site, which appears to be most complementary to GalNAc linked to the C-3 or C-6 hydroxyl group of galactose. As inhibitors, these disaccharides are approximately 30-60 times more potent than galactose and 4-8-fold more active than N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, whereas both the blood type A trisaccharide (GalNAc alpha 1-3[L-Fuc alpha 1-2]Gal) and the Forssman disaccharide (GalNAc alpha 1-3GalNAc) are noninhibitory, suggesting the importance of a free equatorial hydroxyl group at the C-2 position of the penultimate galactose for lectin binding; either an acetamido group or a fucosyl group at this position appears to cause steric hindrance, thus abolishing binding to the lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1542086719,"Insulin initiates its biological response by binding to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor. The N-terminal half of the alpha-subunit contains several repeats of a loosely conserved motif consisting of a central glycine plus several hydrophobic amino acid residues upstream from the glycine, Hy phi-Xaa-Xaa-Hy phi-Xaa-Hy phi-Hy phi-Xaa-Gly (where Hy phi represents a hydrophobic amino acid residue). This structural motif has been proposed to be important in determining the three-dimensional structure of the insulin binding domain. We have identified two naturally occurring mutant alleles of the insulin receptor gene in an insulin-resistant patient, substitution of Ala for Val28 and Arg for Gly366. The mutations alter conserved amino acid residues in two distinct repeats of the structural motif described above. When mutant cDNAs were expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, both mutations severely impaired proteolytic processing of the proreceptor to mature alpha- and beta-subunits. Transport of mutant receptors to the plasma membrane was also impaired. However, the minority (< 10%) of receptors that were eventually transported to the plasma membrane retained the ability to bind insulin with normal affinity and to undergo insulin-stimulated phosphorylation. In conclusion, the effects of these naturally occurring mutations provide experimental support for the importance of the conserved glycine-containing structural motifs described above. By interrupting these structural motifs, the Ala28 and Arg366 mutations prevent normal folding of the insulin receptor alpha-subunit, thereby inhibiting post-translational processing and intracellular transport of the mutant receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1586225177,"Signal, stop transfer, and signal-anchor sequences direct a nascent polypeptide to a single topology with respect to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. However, other types of sequences direct nascent proteins, either transiently or permanently, to more than one topologic form. Pause transfer sequences direct nascent apolipoprotein B to pause during its translocation, resulting in nonintegrated, transmembrane intermediates that become fully translocated over time. The stop transfer effector sequence (STE) directs the nascent prion protein either to integrate at the hydrophobic domain which immediately follows (TM1) or to become fully translocated, in a manner dependent on cytosolic factors. Although the action of pause transfer sequences has been dissected into stop and restart steps, the mechanism of STE action is unknown. Using chimeric proteins expressed in vitro, we show that STE, independent of TM1, acts as a pause transfer sequence. We also demonstrate that translocational pausing at STE is a common step preceding either complete translocation or integration into the membrane of a chimeric protein containing STE and TM1. These findings have implications for the role of pausing in the biogenesis of both secretory and membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W65560089,"The lima bean lectin recognizes terminal alpha-D-GalNAc groups and agglutinates human type A erythrocytes. We have cloned a portion of the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the lima bean lectin. The clone was obtained using the polymerase chain reaction and verified from a genomic clone encoding the mature protein of 253 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence has significant overall homology with other leguminous plant lectins and contains all of the known peptide sequences isolated from lima bean lectin (LBL). Southern blot analysis reveals the presence of several genes which hybridize to the cloned gene and which we propose are genes included in the lima bean lectin gene family. We report here the sequence, expression, and characterization of LBL 2, the second member of this gene family. Milligram quantities of soluble active recombinant lima bean lectin (rLBL) were obtained from Escherichia coli, using the T7 RNA polymerase expression system. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis indicate expression of one protein band of about 27 kDa in induced E. coli cells. This protein cross-reacts with polyclonal antibodies raised against seed lectin (sLBL) and gave a reaction of identity with seed lectin by Ouchterlony double diffusion, specifically agglutinates type A blood cells, and is specifically inhibited by D-GalNAc. The isoelectric point of rLBL is 5.86, whereas those of the seed lectin subunits were determined to be 5.86, 5.58, and 5.20 (previously designated alpha, beta, alpha', respectively). rLBL binds to hydrophobic ligands independent of sugar binding, an observation similar to results obtained with sLBL. However, despite the similar activities described, several significant differences between recombinant and native lima bean lectin were found, including mobility on gel filtration, aggregation in solution, and its CD spectrum. These differences may be due to a number of factors, which will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1658338900,"The chloroplast mRNAs from Euglena gracilis fall into two classes. One group of mRNs from this organelle contains a Shine-Dalgarno sequence 5' to the start codon, while the other group of mRNAs does not have a conserved sequence signal in the 5'-untranslated region. To investigate the start signals for E. gracilis chloroplast mRNAs that do not carry a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, 30 S initiation complex formation has been studied using a series of transcripts carrying the wild-type translational start site of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) or mutated derivatives of this site. Mutation of the start codon of the rbcL gene indicates that the chloroplast 30 S subunit is recognizing only the correct AUG codon. The analysis of the messages from a series of deletion mutants shows that a minimum of delta 20 residues 5' to the AUG codon is required for activity. Maximal activity requires the full 55-base leader sequence. Surprisingly, a transcript carrying the inverse complement of 48 bases in the leader is delta 60% as active as the wild-type message in promoting initiation complex formation. Introduction of a Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the 5'-leader increases the activity of the mRNA only delta 1.4-2-fold. The presence of an oligodeoxynucleotide containing a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence does not significantly inhibit the formation of initiation complexes at the rbcL start site. Similar results are obtained when initiation complexes are formed with initiation factors from either E. gracilis chloroplasts or Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1482982398,"Abstract The results reported in the previous paper indicate that the translational start site of the Euglena gracilis chloroplast mRNA for the large subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) is not defined by primary sequence elements (Koo, J.S., and Spremulli, L.L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7494-7500). In the work presented here, the effects of secondary structure in the 5'-untranslated leader of the rbcL mRNA have been examined. Only weak secondary structure can be detected in the 5'-untranslated leader of the rbcL message by enzymatic and computer analysis. Further reduction of the weak secondary structure of this message by site-directed mutagenesis does not significantly affect the ability of this message to participate in initiation complex formation. The secondary structure near the translational start site was increased by the introduction of an inverted repeat sequence and by site-directed mutagenesis. Messages with increased secondary structure are much less active in initiation complex formation if the structural element introduced is within approximately 10 nucleotides of the start codon. These results suggest that the translational start site in this chloroplast mRNA is specified by the presence of an AUG codon in an unstructured or weakly structured region of the mRNA. No specific sequences around the start codon, either upstream or immediately downstream, were found to have important information directing the chloroplast ribosome to the start site of this mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W29407805,"The anionic hydrophobic (amphipathic) fluorescent probe 2-(p-toluidinyl)-naphthalene-6-sulfonate was used to investigate the surface hydrophobic properties of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent enzymes as follows: calcineurin, myosin light chain kinase, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, CaM-dependent protein kinase II, and the gamma-subunit of phosphorylase kinase. We found that certain domains of these enzymes that interacted with 2-(p-toluidinyl)-naphthalene-6-sulfonate were exposed by a transient proton (H+) increase within the neutral pH range. This H(+)-induced exposure, which could be caused either by direct addition of H+ or by the release of H+ from metal chelators upon their binding of Ca2+, seemed to be more closely linked with a change in pH value (i.e. transient H+ increase) than with the actual equilibrium pH value of the system. Unlike the case with CaM-dependent enzymes, the H(+)-induced conformational change was uncommon in CaM-independent enzymes. When CaM-binding domains were removed from calcineurin and smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, the resultant enzymes no longer exposed new domains in response to H+ increase. Using dansylated CaM to monitor the formation of CaM-enzyme complexes, we found that complex formation occurred with an uptake of H+ from solution. When CaM-dependent enzymes were evaluated at suboptimal concentrations of Ca2+, addition of H+ enhanced both the formation of CaM-enzyme complexes and the CaM-dependent catalytic activities, but this synergistic H+ effect occurred within only a narrow range of Ca2+ concentrations. These findings suggest that the H(+)-exposed domains in CaM-dependent enzymes are involved in the binding of CaM and that both conformational changes in CaM and its enzyme targets are necessary for complex formation. Further, the findings are consistent with the notion that CaM-binding domains are masked in the nonactivated (uncomplexed) conformations of CaM-dependent enzymes. The interplay between H+ and Ca2+ is discussed in relation to other systems that display interdependent effects of these two ions."

We isolated cDNA of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase alpha from tsFT20 cells. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA from tsFT20 has a single mutation, a cytosine to thymine substitution that changes amino acid 1180 from serine to phenylalanine. We have also shown that tsFT20 cells could be rescued by transfection with the wild-type cDNA. These results demonstrate that the point mutation in the gene of DNA polymerase alpha causes the temperature-sensitive phenotype of tsFT20 cells and provide additional evidence that DNA polymerase alpha is essential for chromosomal replication in mammalian cells. We also detected mutation sites in one spontaneous and six N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced growth revertants of tsFT20 cells by single strand conformation polymorphism analyses and direct sequencing. All revertant cell lines had a second point mutation adjacent to the first mutation site in tsFT20 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1529127577,"The p107 protein is related to the Rb protein by a 60-kDa region of homology called the pocket domain that binds cellular proteins such as E2F and cyclins A and E as well as the viral oncoproteins E1A, E7, and SV40 T antigen. The p107 and Rb proteins have both been implicated as negative regulators of cell growth. We have examined the effect of the unphosphorylated pocket domain of p107 on specific stages of the T antigen-mediated replication of SV40 DNA in vitro. The pocket domain inhibited replication by preventing the assembly of T antigen at the SV40 core origin DNA containing binding site II. However, both proteins formed a ternary complex with DNA containing T antigen-binding site I. The pocket domain of p107 did not inhibit the oligomerization of T antigen in the absence of DNA, and the p107 derivative is bound to the intermediates of this reaction. In the unwinding assay, once T antigen was preassembled as hexamers at the core origin, the pocket domain bound to and stabilized the complex, resulting in an increase in the yield of unwound product. Preformed T antigen hexamers complexed with the pocket domain bind to a synthetic replication fork, and this complex supported unwinding. Consistent with this, the p107 pocket domain had no effect on the helicase activity of T antigen in an assay using a partial duplex substrate. However, a complex containing p107 and T antigen assembled at the core origin did not support SV40 DNA replication in HeLa cell crude extracts or in the monopolymerase reaction. This inhibition is due to the inability of the complex to bind to DNA polymerase alpha, which is required for the initiation of DNA synthesis. The data suggest pathways by which the pocket domain of p107 can negatively regulate T antigen-mediated replication in vitro. The binding of T antigen to p107 is discussed with respect to its role in mitigating negative cell growth control, resulting in viral mediated transformation."

This S6 kinase was resolved from the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase only by the seventh and final column chromatography step. The purified S6 kinase migrated as a tight doublet of approximately 31 kDa on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and it was eluted from gel filtration columns with a similar apparent M(r), which indicated that the enzyme exists as a monomer. This S6 kinase was immunologically distinct from the other known insulin-activated S6 kinases, i.e. p70S6K and p90rsk. It was inhibited by [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid and beta-glycerophosphate at concentrations routinely used to stabilize p70S6K and p90rsk. In addition to S6, phosvitin was also a substrate, whereas myelin basic protein, casein, protamine, and histones were poorly phosphorylated if at all by the purified S6 kinase. The purified enzyme was inactivated upon incubation with serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase 2A, which indicated that it may be an intermediary component in a cascade of insulin-activated protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1512420440,"Abstract In the present study, we have investigated the subcellular localization of pp65, a synaptosomal phosphoprotein of apparent M(r) 65,000. The results obtained strongly support that pp65 is localized to synaptic vesicles. The solubility properties of pp65, especially its partitioning into the detergent phase of Triton X-114, indicated that it is tightly associated with the membrane of synaptic vesicles. pp65 is multiply phosphorylated exclusively on serine. By studying the decay of labeled phosphate following incubation of 32P-prelabeled synaptosomes in the presence of cold inorganic phosphate, we have found that pp65 shows an unusually high turnover of phosphate. Exposure of synaptosomes to 1 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate prior to prelabeling with 32P(i) led to a reduction in the steady state phosphorylation of pp65, and tryptic/chymotryptic mapping was shown to selectively affect phosphopeptide 4. Identical results were obtained following incubation of synaptosomes with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF 109203 X. These results indicated that one of the protein kinases involved in steady state phosphorylation of pp65 is PKC-dependent or is PKC itself. Several characteristics of pp65 reported in the present study suggest a regulatory role in nerve terminal function."
