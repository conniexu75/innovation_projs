Activated protein C (APC), a serine protease critically involved in the regulation of coagulation and inflammatory processes, improves sepsis survival through an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized a direct effect of APC to both prevent increased EC permeability and to restore vascular integrity after edemagenic agonists. We measured changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) and observed that APC produced concentration-dependent attenuation of TER reductions evoked by thrombin. We next explored known EC barrier-protective signaling pathways and observed dose-dependent APC-mediated increases in cortical myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in concert with cortically distributed actin polymerization, findings highly suggestive of Rac GTPase involvement. We next determined that APC directly increases Rac1 activity, with inhibition of Rac1 activity significantly attenuating APC-mediated barrier protection to thrombin challenge. Finally, as these signaling events were similar to those evoked by the potent EC barrier-enhancing agonist, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), we explored potential cross-talk between endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and S1P1, the receptors for APC and S1P, respectively. EPCR-blocking antibody (RCR-252) significantly attenuated both APC-mediated barrier protection and increased MLC phosphorylation. We next observed rapid, EPCR and PI 3-kinase-dependent, APC-mediated phosphorylation of S1P1 on threonine residues consistent with S1P1 receptor activation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate an interaction between EPCR and S1P1 upon APC treatment. Targeted silencing of S1P1 expression using siRNA significantly reduced APC-mediated barrier protection against thrombin. These data suggest that novel EPCR ligation and S1P1 transactivation results in EC cytoskeletal rearrangement and barrier protection, components potentially critical to the improved survival of APC-treated patients with severe sepsis.

Essential and defining pathophysiological features of sepsis include the activation of the coagulation cascade and marked increases in vascular permeability, processes that result in tissue and organ dysfunction (2Vervloet M.G.

Haemost. 1996; 75: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The coagulation system, long recognized as an integral aspect of inflammation, contributes to enhanced vascular permeability via generation of procoagulant proteins, which directly perturb the integrity of the endothelial cell (EC) monolayer. For example, both thrombin, the central bioregulatory molecule of hemostasis, and fibrin, which is rapidly generated by thrombin-mediated fibrinogen cleavage, directly increase EC permeability in vivo and in vitro (4Garcia J.G.

Once generated from its circulating zymogen, thrombin exerts potent edemagenic responses catalyzed by cleavage of the thrombin receptor known as PAR1 (7Garcia J.G. Patterson C. Bahler C. Aschner J.

The prognosis of severe sepsis remains dismal and whereas therapies aimed at reducing coagulation in sepsis and ALI, such as anti-thrombin III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, were successful in animal models, human trials failed to demonstrate improved survival (9Harada N.

In contrast, in the landmark, multicenter Prowess trial, the anticoagulant serine protease, activated protein C (APC) reduced levels of the inflammatory marker interleukin-6 and improved survival in severely septic patients (13Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J.S. Garber G.E. Helterbrand J.D. Ely E.W. Fisher Jr., C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (5015) Google Scholar). Protein C circulates as an inactive zymogen and is activated by the newly formed thrombomodulin/thrombin complex allowing down-regulation of the thrombin-generating cascade. Both APC and non-activated protein C bind to the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), a receptor structurally similar to the major histocompatibility class I/CDI family of molecules. EPCR is a crucial participant in the protein C pathway (14Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as EPCR ligation increases the activation of protein C by ∼20-fold (15Taylor Jr., F.B. Peer G.T. Lockhart M.S. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Blood. 2001; 97: 1685-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the prosurvival effects of APC in sepsis is currently unknown but presumed to be related to beneficial APC effects on coagulation and inflammation. Whereas the anticoagulant properties of protein C and APC are evident in patients with inherited protein C deficiency (16Branson H.E. Katz J. Marble R. Griffin J.H. Lancet. 1983; 2: 1165-1168Abstract PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 17Griffin J.H. Evatt B. Zimmerman T.S. Kleiss A.J. Wideman C. J. Clin.

Med. 1984; 310: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), APC binding to EPCR results in the loss of anticoagulant activity by the bound APC (19Oganesyan V. Oganesyan N. Terzyan S. Qu D. Dauter Z. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24851-24854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Similarly, the anti-inflammatory properties of the protein C pathway have been implicated in APC survival benefit, as APC inhibits NF-kB activation in monocytes exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as decreases LPS-induced TNF-α production in mice (20Murakami K. Okajima K. Uchiba M. Johno M. Nakagaki T. Okabe H. Takatsuki K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L197-L202PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yuksel M. Okajima K. Uchiba M. Horiuchi S. Okabe H. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). APC infusion in humans given endotoxin-improved hemodynamics, but failed to alter inflammatory, thrombotic, or fibrinolytic indices, suggesting an alternate mechanism of APC-mediated protection (22Kalil A.C. Coyle S.M. Um J.Y. LaRosa S.P. Turlo M.A. Calvano S.E. Sundin D.P. Nelson D.R. Lowry S.F. Shock. 2004; 21: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of APC survival benefit, therefore, remains enigmatic. In this report, we have hypothesized that one mechanism of APC benefit may be related to inhibition of the widespread increases in vascular permeability, characteristic of severe sepsis, with accelerated recovery from the untoward effects of edemagenic agonists. We recently reported that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the major barrier-protective agent released from platelets (23Schaphorst K.L. Chiang E. Jacobs K.N. Zaiman A. Natarajan V. Wigley F. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L258-L267Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) via its specific receptor S1P1 (also known as Edg1), represents a novel anti-edemagenic strategy both in vitro (24Garcia J.G.

Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) as well as in animal models of sepsis (25Peng X. Hassoun P.M. Sammani S. McVerry B.J. Burne M.J. Rabb H. Pearse D. Tuder R.M.

Med. 2004; 170: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). S1P1 signaling induces barrier-protective cell-cell and cell-matrix tethering to the EC cytoskeleton (24Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 27Dudek S.M. Jacobson J.R. Chiang E.T.

These edemagenic agonists induce EC barrier disruption via alterations in cytoskeletal proteins actin and myosin that result in transcellular actin stress fibers causing cellular contraction and paracellular gap formation (4Garcia J.G.

Given the central role of increased vascular permeability in inflammatory syndromes such as sepsis, therapies that reverse vascular permeability via targeting of the EC cytoskeleton would have obvious clinical utility. We explored whether APC-mediated survival benefit in sepsis may involve APC-induced EC barrier regulation. Our studies indicate that APC evokes human lung EC signaling paradigms, which target the Rho family GTPase, Rac1, with subsequent Rac1-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement and profound EC barrier protection. Finally, we demonstrate that APC-mediated protection from the edemagenic effects of thrombin occurs via novel transactivation of S1P1, the potent barrier-enhancing receptor for S1P. Reagents—Unless otherwise specified, reagents were obtained from Sigma. LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Rabbit anti-diphosphorylated and pan-MLC antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). PAR1 rabbit polyclonal IgG and normal rat monoclonal IgG antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), rat monoclonal anti-EPCR (RCR-252) antibody (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody and Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), rabbit anti-S1P1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), and rabbit antiphosphoserine and rabbit antiphosphothreonine antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) were commercially obtained. APC was generously supplied by Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). Human Lung Endothelial Cell Cultures—Human pulmonary artery EC (HPAEC) were obtained from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD) used at passages 3–8 and maintained in the manufacturer's recommended EGM-2 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum as we have previously reported (24Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 27Dudek S.M. Jacobson J.R.

Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Two hours prior to all experimentation, cells were incubated in serum-free, endothelial basal medium. Measurement of Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TER)—Human EC were grown to confluence over evaporated gold microelectrodes connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier as we previously described (24Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 31Garcia J.G. Schaphorst K.L. Shi S. Verin A.D. Hart C.M. Callahan K.S. Patterson C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L172-L184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TER was measured using an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system (ECIS; Applied BioPhysics Inc., Troy, NY). As cells adhere and spread out on the microelectrode, TER increases, whereas cell retraction, rounding, or loss of junctional adhesion is reflected by a decrease in TER. These measurements provide a sensitive biophysical assay that indicates the state of cell shape and focal adhesion reflective of changes in paracellular permeability. All comparisons of TER were made using normalized resistances, with actual starting resistances ranging between 1200 and 1800 ohms. Comparisons of TER between thrombin and APC with thrombin were made at maximal barrier disruption and expressed as a percentage of barrier protection versus thrombin, i.e. percent difference in nadir resistance between thrombin alone and APC + thrombin. MLC Phosphorylation in Intact Endothelium—Human EC were analyzed for MLC phosphorylation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western immunoblotting with antibody specific for di-phosphorylated MLC as previously described (27Dudek S.M.

Blots were scanned and quantitatively analyzed using Image-Quant software (v5.2; Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Confluent EC grown on coverslips were exposed to experimental conditions, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, cells were exposed to primary antibodies for 60 min. Anti-rabbit Alexa-488 secondary antibodies were applied for 60 min in the dark. F-actin was detected by staining with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (60 min). Cells were imaged using a Nikon video imaging system as we have previously described (27Dudek S.M. Jacobson J.R. Chiang E.T. Birukov K.G. Wang P. Zhan X. Garcia J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24692-24700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Rac1 GTPase Activity Assay—Determination of Rac1 activation (Rac-GTP) was performed as we previously described using a commercially available kit (Upstate Biotechnology) (24Garcia J.G. Liu F.

Infection of Dominant Negative Rac1 Adenovirus—HPAEC plated at 50% confluency were infected for 48 h (multiplicity of infection = 40 plaque-forming units/cell) with adenovirus overexpressing a dominant form of Rac1 (obtained as a gift from Dr. C. Waters, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN), which significantly inhibited Rac1 activation as previously described (27Dudek S.M. Jacobson J.R. Chiang E.T. Birukov K.G. Wang P. Zhan X. Garcia J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24692-24700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Construction and Transfection of siRNA against the S1P1 Receptor— The siRNA sequence targeting human Rac1 was generated using mRNA sequences from GenBank™ (gi:29792301). Sequences containing less than 50% G/C content were chosen if available. To generate a siRNA for S1P1, S1P1-specific target sequences were then aligned to the human genome data base in a BLAST search to eliminate sequences with significant homology to other human genes. Scramble sequences were also aligned to the human genome data base in a BLAST search to determine no significant homology to any known human gene. For each mRNA (or scramble), two targets were identified. Specifically, S1P1 receptor target sequence 1 (5′-AAGCTACACAAAAAGCCTGGA-3′), S1P1 receptor target sequence 2 (5′-AAAAAGCCTGGATCACTCATC-3′), scramble sequence 1 (5′-AAGAGAAATCGAAACCGAAAA-3′), and scramble sequence 2 (5′-AAGAACCCAATTAAGCGCAAG-3′) were used. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were provided by the Johns Hopkins University, DNA Analysis Facility. For construction of the siRNA, a transcription-based kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) was used (Silencer™ siRNA construction kit). EC cells were then transfected with siRNA using siPORTamine™ as transfection reagent according to the protocol provided by Ambion. Cells (∼40% confluent) were serum-starved for 2 h followed by incubated with 3 μm (1.5 μm of each siRNA) target siRNA (or scramble siRNA or no siRNA) for 6 h in serum-free medium. Then medium with serum was added (1% serum final concentration) for 42 h before biochemical experiments and/or functional assays were conducted. Determination of Serine/Threonine Phosphorylation of the S1P1 Receptor—EC monolayers were serum-starved for 1 h followed by either vehicle (methanol, control) or 1 μm S1P challenge for 5 min or pretreated with control IgG, anti-EPCR or anti-PAR1 blocking antibody (20 μg/ml) for 1 h followed by APC (1 μg/ml) or thrombin (0.2 units/ml) exposure (5 min) or pretreated with vehicle (Me2SO, control) or 10 μm LY294002 for 1 h followed by APC treatment (1 μg/ml, 5 min). Cells were subsequently solubilized in extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 50 nm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1:250 dilution of Calbiochem protease inhibitor mixture 3). The samples were then immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-S1P1 antibody followed by SDS-PAGE in 4–15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon™ membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking nonspecific sites with 5% bovine serum albumin, the blots were incubated with either rabbit anti-S1P1 antibody, rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody, or rabbit anti-phosphothreonine antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Visualization of immunoreactive bands was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of Complex Formation between EPCR and S1P1 Receptor—EC monolayers were serum-starved for 1 h followed by treatment with control IgG or anti-EPCR blocking antibody (20 μg/ml) for 1 h followed by APC (1 μg/ml) exposure (5 min). Cells were subsequently solubilized in complex buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 50 nm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1:250 dilution of Calbiochem protease inhibitor mixture. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-EPCR antibody followed by SDS-PAGE in 4–15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon™ membranes (Millipore Corp.). After blocking nonspecific sites with 5% bovine serum albumin, the blots were incubated with either rabbit anti-S1P1 antibody or rabbit anti-EPCR antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Visualization of immunoreactive bands was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence. Statistics—Either Student's t test or analysis of variance with a Neuman-Keul posthoc test was used to compare the means of data from two or more different experimental groups as indicated in the individual figure legends. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. Effect of APC on Thrombin-mediated Reductions in TER— Our initial experiments characterized the time-dependent effect of APC on human lung EC barrier function utilizing measurements of TER, a sensitive measure of barrier integrity (24Garcia J.G.

Gilbert-McClain L.I. Gallagher P.J. Verin A.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A demonstrates that EC pretreatment with APC (0.1–50 μg/ml, 1 h) attenuates thrombin-mediated (0.2 units/ml) TER decreases in a concentration-dependent manner. All measurements of electrical resistance were made at maximal barrier disruption, i.e. nadir resistance, regardless of time. Of note, nadir resistance occurs consistently at ∼30 min (±5 min) after thrombin challenge in all experiments. APC has minimal effect on the timing of thrombin-induced barrier disruption. Pretreatment of human lung EC with APC (1 μg/ml) for durations of 1–4 h significantly reduced the thrombin-induced EC barrier-disrupting response (Fig. 1B), although this protective effect was not observed after 20 h of APC exposure (data not shown). Importantly, EC with established thrombin-mediated barrier dysfunction and subsequently challenged with APC (1 μg/ml, 5 min), demonstrated significant reversal of the thrombin-induced decline in TER (Fig. 1B). Effect of APC on EC Cytoskeletal Rearrangement and MLC Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of MLC results in increased actin-myosin cross-bridge formation and plays a central role in the barrier-regulatory properties of agents such as S1P, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as well as edemagenic agents such as TNF and thrombin (24Garcia J.G.

Given the barrier protection observed with APC treatment, we next investigated the effect of APC on MLC phosphorylation via Western blotting using an antibody specific for MLC phosphorylated on serine 19, threonine 18 residues (phospho-MLC) in confluent EC. Fig. 2 demonstrates the concentration- and time-dependent effect of APC on MLC phosphorylation. Peak MLC phosphorylation occurred with brief (5 min, 1 μg/ml) durations of APC exposure. Thrombin (0.2 units/ml), an agonist well known to increase levels of phospho-MLC via coordinate Rho kinase and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activation (37Garcia J.G. Davis H.W. Patterson C.E. J.

We next explored the spatially defined effects of APC on the actin cytoskeleton, a key participant in maintaining intercellular adhesion- and barrier-regulatory properties of the confluent EC monolayer. EC barrier-disruptive agents such as thrombin cause the formation of transcellular actin stress fibers resulting in increased tension, cellular contraction, and paracellular gap formation (Fig. 3), whereas in contrast, APC (1.0 μg/ml, 5 min) stimulates strong actin-phospho-MLC rearrangement at the cell periphery and reduced central stress fiber formation (Fig. 3). Finally, APC (1.0 μg/ml) treatment 5 min after thrombin (0.2 μ/ml) exposure results in marked attenuation of stress fiber formation and peripheral cortical actin-phospho-MLC arrangement (Fig. 3).Fig. 3APC rapidly increases EC cytoskeletal rearrangement and MLC phosphorylation in a spatially restricted manner.

https://openalex.org/W2081703144,"Structural allograft healing is limited because of a lack of vascularization and remodeling. To study this we developed a mouse model that recapitulates the clinical aspects of live autograft and processed allograft healing. Gene expression analyses showed that there is a substantial decrease in the genes encoding RANKL and VEGF during allograft healing. Loss-of-function studies showed that both factors are required for autograft healing. To determine whether addition of these signals could stimulate allograft vascularization and remodeling, we developed a new approach in which rAAV can be freeze-dried onto the cortical surface without losing infectivity. We show that combination rAAV-RANKL- and rAAV-VEGF-coated allografts show marked remodeling and vascularization, which leads to a new bone collar around the graft. In conclusion, we find that RANKL and VEGF are necessary and sufficient for efficient autograft remodeling and can be transferred using rAAV to revitalize structural allografts."

Overexpression of cyclin D1 promotes cellular proliferation and normal physiological levels of cyclin D1 function to inhibit adipocyte differentiation in vivo. We have previously shown that cyclin D1 inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ-dependent activity through a cyclin-dependent kinase- and retinoblastoma protein-binding-independent mechanism. In this study, we determined the molecular mechanism by which cyclin D1 regulated PPARγ function. Herein, murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) differentiation by PPARγ ligand was associated with a reduction in histone deacetylase (HDAC1) activity. Cyclin D1–/– MEFs showed an increased propensity to undergo differentiation into adipocytes. Genetic deletion of cyclin D1 reduced HDAC1 activity. Reconstitution of cyclin D1 into the cyclin D1–/– MEFs increased HDAC1 activity and blocked PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis. PPARγ activity was enhanced in cyclin D1–/– cells. Reintroduction of cyclin D1 inhibited basal and ligand-induced PPARγ activity and enhanced HDAC repression of PPARγ activity. Cyclin D1 bound HDAC in vivo and preferentially physically associated with HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that cyclin D1 enhanced recruitment of HDAC1 and HDAC3 and histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 to the PPAR response element of the lipoprotein lipase promoter and decreased acetylation of total histone H3 and histone H3 lysine 9.

HDAC1/mSin3A has been shown to be recruited to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein promoter with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β and promoted the deacetylation of histone H4. HDAC3, another member of the HDAC family, associates with PPARγ and Rb to form a PPARγ·Rb·HDAC3 repressor complex and attenuated PPARγ-mediated adipocyte differentiation (17Fajas L. Egler V.

The coding region of the murine cyclin D1 cDNA (GenBank™ S78355) was inserted into the MSCV-IRESGFP vector at the EcoRI site upstream of the IRES driving expression of GFP. MSCV retroviruses were prepared by transient co-transfection with helper virus into 293T cells, using calcium phosphate precipitation. The retroviral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection (23Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell.

Cyclin D1+/+ and cyclin D1–/– MEFs were incubated with fresh retroviral supernatants in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h, cultured for 6 days, and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACSVantage SE, BD Biosciences) for GFP-positive cells. HDAC Assays—HDAC assays were performed using [3H]acetate-incorporated histones isolated from HeLa cells treated with sodium butyrate exactly as described previously (24Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Iaavarone A. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Pestell R.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4531-4537PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic extracts (600 μg) were immunoprecipitated with saturating amounts of anti-HDAC1 antibodies (10 μg, Santa Cruz) and then incubated with 1 ml of [3H]acetate-labeled HeLa histones (10,000 dpm) for 2 h at 37 °C, and acetylase activity was determined as described previously (24Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Iaavarone A. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Pestell R.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4531-4537PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, HDAC1 assay was performed using the HDAC assay kit (Fluorometric Detection, Upstate, NY, catalog number 17-356) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, hepatic extracts (600 μg dissolved in 600 μl of cell lysate buffer) from cyclin D1+/+, and cyclin D1–/– mice were immunoprecipitated with saturating amounts of anti-HDAC1 antibodies (10 μg) mixed with 30 μl of protein A beads (50% slurry) at 4 °C for 3–6 h. The immunoprecipitate and the protein A beads were collected by centrifugation (30 s in a microfuge at 8,000 × g) and washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and once with 200 μlof ice cold HDAC assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2). The beads were resuspended with 60 μl of HDAC assay buffer containing 100 μm HDAC assay substrate and then incubated at 30 °C for 30–60 min. After brief centrifugation, 40 μl of the supernatant was transferred to 96-well plate and incubated with 20 μl of the diluted activator solution at room temperature for 10–15 min. The immunoprecipitated HDAC1 activity was measured in a fluorescence plate reader (excitation = 350 nm, emission = 460 nm) within 60 min.

Primary MEFs were isolated from 14-day-postcoitus mouse embryos and were maintained at confluence for 1 day before being switched to basal differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum and 10 mg of insulin/liter). Differentiation was induced by serum supplemented with 0.2 mm methylisobutylxanthine (Sigma), 5 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma) for 3 days. Subsequently, cells were maintained in basal differentiation medium supplemented with troglitazone (5 μm) (Calbiochem) or vehicle as indicated.

For Oil Red-O staining, cells were fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and rinsed briefly with water and ethanol. Cells were then stained with freshly prepared Oil Red-O solution (6 parts saturated Oil Red-O dye in isopropanol plus 4 parts water) at 37 °C for 15 min, washed with 70% ethanol, and then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were inspected by microscopy. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—293T cells were transfected with an expression vector for cyclin D1. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells lysates were prepared in 600 μl of cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with proteinase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, catalog number 1836145). 600 μg of cellular lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 10 μl of anti-HDAC1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight. Normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. The beads were washed with 800 μl of cell lysis buffer five times, resuspended in 30 μl of cell lysis buffer plus 6 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were dissolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. The membrane was blotted with either anti-HDAC1 or anti-cyclin D1 antibody (Ab-3, Neomarker) at room temperature for 1 h, then washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 phosphate-buffered saline. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation of cyclin D1 with HDAC1–HDAC5, the expression vectors for cyclin D1 and HDAC1–HDAC5 were transfected into 293T cells. The cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with the antibody (M2, Sigma), and Western blotting was conducted with an anti-cyclin D1 antibody (Ab-3). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay—ChIP analysis was performed as previously described (25Hulit J. Wang C. Li Z. Albanese C. Rao M. Di Vizio D. Shah S. Byers S.W. Mahmood R. Augenlicht L.H.

Upon treatment, the cells were cross-linked by adding 1.0% formaldehyde buffer containing 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA-Na, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EGTA-Na, Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, directly to culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C. The medium was aspirated, and the cells washed twice using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. The cells were then lysed with 1% SDS lysis buffer and incubated for 10 min on ice. The cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 500 bp, and the samples were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). To reduce nonspecific background, the cell pellet suspension was precleared with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein-A-agarose-50% slurry (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. Chromatin solutions were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with rotation using 4 μg of antibodies to either cyclin D1 (HD-11, Santa Cruz), PPARγ (H-100, Santa Cruz), FLAG (Sigma), acetyl histone H3, acetyl histone H3 (lysine 9), methyl histone H3 (lysine 4), HDAC1 (2E10) (Upstate Biotechnology), SUV39H1, or HP1α (Upstate Technology). For a negative control, rabbit or mouse IgG was incubated with the supernatant fraction for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry was added for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation to collect the antibody/histone complex and washed extensively following the manufacturer's protocol. Input and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-linking. After proteinase K digestion for 1 h, DNA was extracted using a Qiagen spin column kit. Precipitated DNAs were analyzed by PCR of 30 cycles. The following oligonucleotides were used for PCR to identify the PPARE in the mouse LPL promoter 5′-AAACCCCTCCTCTCTGCCTC-3′ and 5′-CCTCGGAGGAGGAGTAGGAG-3′ or human LPL promoter, 5′-GGGCCCCCGGGTAGAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CACGCCAAGGCTGCTTATGTGACT-3′. The oligonucleotides to identify the PPARE in the mouse adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2) promoter are 5′-CAAGCCATGCGACAAAGGCA-3′ and 5′-TAGAAGTCGCTCAGGCCACA-3′ (26Tang Q.Q. Zhang J.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 Inhibits Adipocyte Differentiation of MEFs and Regulates HDAC1 Activity—In our previous studies, cyclin D1–/– MEFs exhibited enhanced differentiation in response to PPARγ ligands (5Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Li Z. Wu K. Hulit J. Neumeister P. Novikoff P.M. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Jones J.G. Whitney K.D. Donehower L.A. Harris E.L. Rohan T. Johns D.C. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6159-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) indicating that cyclin D1 repression of PPARγ is an important physiological function of cyclin D1 in vivo. Several distinct HDAC inhibitors induce differentiation of MEFs into Oil Red-O-positive adipocytes (16Wiper-Bergeron N. Wu D. Pope L. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Fajas L. Egler V. Reiter R. Hansen J. Kristiansen K. Debril M.B. Miard S. Auwerx J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 903-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the role of cyclin D1 in regulating cellular HDAC activity during adipocyte differentiation of MEFs. MEFs derived from either cyclin D1 wild type or cyclin D1–/– mice were treated with differentiation medium and troglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, as described previously (5Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Li Z. Wu K. Hulit J. Neumeister P. Novikoff P.M. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Jones J.G. Whitney K.D. Donehower L.A. Harris E.L. Rohan T. Johns D.C. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6159-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The differentiation medium increased the abundance of Oil Red-O-positive lipid droplets in the cyclin D1–/– MEFs compared with wild type cells (Fig. 1A). This result is consistent with previous observations demonstrating that there is enhanced induction of adipogenesis in cyclin D1–/– MEFs with differentiation medium and PPARγ ligand (5Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Li Z. Wu K. Hulit J. Neumeister P. Novikoff P.M. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Jones J.G. Whitney K.D. Donehower L.A. Harris E.L. Rohan T. Johns D.C. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6159-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). HDAC1 activity assays of these cellular extracts were conducted (Fig. 1C). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were used as a positive control (Fig. 1B). HDAC1 activity decreased during differentiation. Cyclin D1-deficient cells showed reduced HDAC activity, compared with cyclin D1 wild type cells (Fig. 1C, lane 1 versus 3), with a further reduction upon differentiation (Fig. 1C, lane 2 versus 4). Next, we examined whether cyclin D1 regulated HDAC activity. HDAC1 assays of cyclin D1–/– and littermate cyclin D1+/+ mice hepatocellular extracts were conducted. Equal amounts of HDAC1 were confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). The relative HDAC1 activity, assessed either by fluorometric assay (Fig. 2B) or by [3H]acetate incorporation (Fig. 2C), demonstrated a reduction in HDAC1 activity in cyclin D1–/– cells, suggesting that the abundance of cyclin D1 regulates endogenous HDAC1 enzyme activity. Reconstitution of Cyclin D1 into cyclin D1–/–MEFs Increases HDAC Activity and Blocks Adipocyte Differentiation—As reduced cyclin D1 levels correlated with reduced HDAC1 enzyme activities, further experiments were conducted to determine whether reintroduction of cyclin D1 in turn was capable of increasing HDAC1 activity in cyclin D1–/– MEFs. Cyclin D1–/– MEFs were infected with either an expression vector for cyclin D1 (MSCV-cyclin D1-IRESGFP) or equal amounts of empty expression vector cassette (MSCV-IRESGFP). GFP-positive cells were selected through GFP fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described previously (8Neumeister P. Pixley F.J. Xiong Y. Xie H. Wu K. Ashton A. Cammer M. Chan A. Symons M. Stanley E.R. Pestell R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, right panel). MEFs infected with the cyclin D1 expression vector showed increased relative HDAC1 activity compared with vector control (Fig. 3B). In addition, reintroduction of cyclin D1 into cyclin D1–/– MEFs blocked adipocyte differentiation induced by differentiation medium and PPARγ ligand (Fig. 3A). Together, these studies suggest cyclin D1 contributes to cellular HDAC1 activity and regulation of HDAC activity by cyclin D1 plays a role in adipocyte differentiation. Cyclin D1 Augments HDAC1 Repression—We next examined whether cyclin D1 was capable of augmenting HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression of PPARγ. To this end, gene reporter assays were conducted in cyclin D1-deficient cells. A synthetic PPARγ-responsive reporter gene (AOX)3LUC was used, as cyclin D1 is known to inhibit both basal and ligand-induced PPARγ reporter activity. Co-transfection of the expression vectors for FLAG-HDAC1–HDAC5 with PPARγ in cyclin D1–/– 3T3 cells demonstrated that HDAC1, -2, -3 and -5 repressed PPARγ-liganded transactivity (Fig. 4A). Co-transfection of cyclin D1 inhibited ligand-induced reporter activity by 63% (Fig. 4, A versus B, lane 14 versus 2). HDAC1–HDAC3 co-transfection with cyclin D1 repressed ligand-induced PPARγ activity even further (Fig. 4B, lanes 16, 18, and 20 versus lane 14). The repressive effect of cyclin D1 was most pronounced with HDAC1 and HDAC3 (Fig. 4B, lanes 16 and 20 versus lane 14). HDAC1 and HDAC3 co-transfection repressed both basal and liganded PPARE gene activity. Cyclin D1 Associates with HDACs in Vivo—We have previously shown that PPARγ transactivation induced by ligand was inhibited by cyclin D1 through a Rb- and Cdk-independent mechanism, requiring a region predicted to form a helix-loop-helix structure (5Wang C. Pattabiraman N. Zhou J.N. Fu M. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Li Z. Wu K. Hulit J. Neumeister P. Novikoff P.M. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Jones J.G. Whitney K.D. Donehower L.A. Harris E.L. Rohan T. Johns D.C. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6159-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). As HDAC1 is a known inhibitor for adipocyte differentiation, we hypothesized that cyclin D1 might confer repression of PPARγ through association with HDACs. Cyclin D1 may regulate HDAC activity either indirectly or through co-association with HDACs. To determine whether cyclin D1 co-associated with HDACs, immunoprecipitation/Western blotting was conducted. A cyclin D1 expression plasmid was transfected into 293T cells."

Here we reported the subcellular localization of InsP3R2 to the cardiomyocyte nuclear envelope (NE). The other major known endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-release channel (ryanodine receptor) was not localized to the NE, indicating functional segregation of these channels and possibly a unique role for InsP3R2 in regulating nuclear calcium dynamics. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the NE InsP3R2 associates with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIδ (CaMKIIδ), the major isoform expressed in cardiac myocytes. Recombinant InsP3R2 and CaMKIIδB also co-immunoprecipitated after co-expression in COS-1 cells. Additionally, the amino-terminal 1078 amino acids of the InsP3R2 were sufficient for interaction with CaMKIIδB and associated upon mixing following separate expression. CaMKII can also phosphorylate InsP3R2, as demonstrated by 32P labeling. Incorporation of CaMKII-treated InsP3R2 into planar lipid bilayers revealed that InsP3-mediated channel open probability is significantly reduced (∼11 times) by phosphorylation via CaMKII. We concluded that the InsP3R2 and CaMKIIδ likely represent two central components of a multiprotein signaling complex, and this raises the possibility that calcium release via InsP3R2 in the myocyte NE may activate local CaMKII signaling, which may feedback on InsP3R2 function.

Characterization of InsP3R2 channels from ventricular myocytes in planar lipid bilayers revealed that the permeation properties are very similar to the type 1 receptor (InsP3R1) from cerebellum but appear to be regulated differently. The InsP3R2 channel is more sensitive to InsP3 compared with InsP3R1, and although calcium-dependent, the channel can be fully activated by InsP3 at a [Ca2+] above 100 nm (5Südhof T.C. Newton C.L.

InsP3R2 does not play a major regulatory role in global [Ca2+] homeostasis in ventricular myocytes, and its functional significance is unclear (9Marks A.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 8-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, in atrial myocytes InsP3R2 has been reported to be localized to junctional SR and may participate in arrhythmogenesis (10Mackenzie L. Bootman M.D. Laine M. Berridge M.J. Thuring J. Holmes A. Wen-Hong L. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 541: 395-409Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Zima A.V. Blatter L.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 555: 607-615Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For example, calcium released by atrial InsP3 may trigger calcium-induced calcium release via RyR, thereby accentuating calcium oscillations (11Zima A.V. Blatter L.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 555: 607-615Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A role for InsP3R in cardiac dysfunction has been suggested by alterations in expression levels of the failing heart in which there appears to be an up-regulation of InsP3R while RyR2 levels decrease (12Go L.O. Moschella M.C. Watras J. Handa K.K. Fyfe B.S. Marks A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 888-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, significant evidence has been presented for the involvement of InsP3R in pathologies leading to calcium overload and apoptotic cardiomyocyte death, as well as implications in the pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmia (10Mackenzie L.

In this study, we have identified the nuclear envelope as the primary site for subcellular localization of the type 2 InsP3Rin ventricular myocytes. This highly localized expression may support the functional encoding of InsP3-mediated calcium release in calcium-dependent nuclear specific signaling. Consistent with this view, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the type 2 InsP3R in isolated cardiac nuclei associates with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Co-expression of CaMKIIδB and InsP3R2 followed by immunoprecipitation verifies the interaction and that the InsP3R2 is phosphorylated by CaMKII. Additionally, CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of InsP3R2 results in a dramatic decline in channel open probability, suggesting a feedback mechanism. Whole Heart Subcellular Fractionation—The heart fractionation procedure used was a modified procedure of Kapiloff et al. (14Kapiloff M.S. Jackson N. Airhart N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3167-3176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen adult rat hearts (Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) were homogenized in Buffer A (10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.2, 320 mmol/liter sucrose, 3 mmol/liter MgCl2, 25 mmol/liter disodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mmol/liter EGTA, 1.0 mmol/liter phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μmol/liter leupeptin and pepstatin) with a Polytron PT10 –35 tissue grinder and filtered sequentially through polypropylene mesh (0.84 and 0.30 mm). The filtrate was centrifuged for 20 min at 3,800 × gmax, and the pellet (P1) was retained for the isolation of nuclei. The supernatant was subjected to a 15-min 6,000 × gmax centrifugation followed by a 30-min 257,320 × gmax sedimentation. The resulting pellet (P2) was resuspended and fractionated on a 24–50% (w/v) sucrose step gradient for 90 min at 100,000 × gmax. The crude SR-enriched microsomes (SR) were recovered at the 24–40% sucrose interface and resuspended in Buffer A. P1 from above was resuspended in Buffer A1 containing 2.4 mol/liter sucrose without disodium pyrophosphate. Myocyte nuclei were sedimented at ∼50,000 × gmax for 90 min. The nuclei pellets were resuspended in nuclei storage (NS) buffer (50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.6, 320 mmol/liter sucrose, 5 mmol/liter magnesium acetate, 0.1 mmol/liter Na3EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter DTT, 0.1 mmol/liter PMSF, 1 μmol/liter leupeptin and pepstatin), washed, and stored at –80 °C. After the initial fractionation, the majority of RyR-immunoreactive SR membranes remained in the low speed pellet (P2), and an alternative SR microsome isolation strategy was used. Following the separation of the nuclei, the overlying gradient material was recovered and processed with 0.65 mol/liter KCl, and the SR-enriched microsomes were isolated via sedimentation for 20 min at 257,320 × gmax. The pellet containing SR-enriched microsomes was washed 3–4 times and resuspended in NS buffer. Protein concentration was determined by using BCA (Pierce).

DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and RNase A (Sigma) were added to 250 μg/ml, mixed for 1.0 h, and then pelleted. The nuclei were lysed in NS buffer containing 1.0 mol/liter NaCl. Nuclear envelopes were separated from nucleoplasm by centrifugation (16,000 × gmax). The nucleoplasmic fraction was recovered, and the nuclear envelopes were resuspended in NS buffer and frozen at –80 °C.

Briefly, COS-1 cells were harvested in homogenization buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 5 mmol/liter sodium azide, 0.25 mmol/liter PMSF, 10 μmol/liter leupeptin, 10 μmol/liter pepstatin, 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) and lysed with a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. An equal volume of buffer containing 0.5 mol/liter of sucrose was added, and the material was re-homogenized and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,200 × gmax. The supernatant containing the microsomes was recovered, and KCl and disodium pyrophosphate were added to a final concentration of 0.6 mol/liter and 20 mmol/liter, respectively. The material was homogenized and mixed for 30 min at 4 °C. Following a final homogenization, the microsomes were centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × gmax, and the supernatant was recovered. Finally, the microsomes were pelleted at 100,000 × gmax for 10 min, resuspended in storage buffer containing 10% sucrose, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunofluorescence—Rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated as described by Bassani et al. (20Bassani R.A. Bassani J.W.M. Bers D.M. J. Physiol.

Either anti-rabbit Oregon Green-488 or Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated goat IgG were used (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Imaging of the stained cells was accomplished using a Nikon Diaphot-300 inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence and a Diagnostic Instruments Spot-II digital camera and software (Sterling Heights, MI). Immunoprecipitation of InsP3R2/CaMKII—Nuclei from rat heart, microsomes, and cytosol from COS-1 cells were homogenized and solubilized in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1.0% bovine serum albumin, 10 mmol/liter magnesium acetate, 50 mmol/liter NaCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μmol/liter leupeptin, and 10 μmol/liter pepstatin) followed by removal of insoluble material by centrifugation at 135,000 × gmax. The supernatant was divided, and primary antibodies were added and incubated overnight. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and immune complexes were washed three times with IP buffer and in buffer without detergent and bovine serum albumin. The IP complexes were analyzed by Western blotting. Antibodies—The InsP3R-specific antibodies (T1C, T2NH, and T2C) used in this study have been described previously (7Ramos-Franco J. Fill M.

Immune complexes were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C with or without exogenous CaMKII (250 units) preactivated by autophosphorylation (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) either in the presence or absence of the specific CaMKII-inhibitor KN-93 (50 μmol/liter; Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Immunoprecipitated InsP3R2·CaMKII complexes from isolated cardiac nuclei were used as a substrate in the in vitro phosphorylation reactions either with or without KN-93 (50 μmol/liter) and no exogenously supplied CaMKII. The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, exposed to film, and then immunoblotted with T2NH. CaMKII Treatment of InsP3R2 Overexpressing Microsomes—COS-1 cells were transfected with recombinant InsP3R2, and microsomes were prepared as described for planar lipid bilayers. Microsomes were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C in the presence of preactivated CaMKII (250 units) with or without KN-93 (50 μmol/liter) as well as no added kinase as a control. The specific CaMKII inhibitor (KN-93) when used was also present during the preactivation of the kinase. Phosphorylation incubation conditions were as described for the in vitro phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated InsP3R2 without the inclusion of [γ-P32]ATP. Microsomes pretreated with phosphatase prior to exposure to CaMKII were incubated in CaMKII phosphorylation buffer (New England Biolabs) with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (1:100 enzyme to protein) and protease inhibitors (0.1 mmol/liter PMSF, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μmol/liter leupeptin, and 10 μmol/liter pepstatin) at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphatase-pretreated microsomes were washed four times by pelleting at 100,000 × g and resuspended in the same buffer prior to incubation at 30 °C for 45 min with either preactivated CaMKII (250 units), KN-93 (50 μmol/liter) alone, or no additions (control). In all reaction contexts, the microsomal protein concentration was 1.0 μg/μl in CaMKII phosphorylation reaction buffer. Following treatment, the microsomes were washed once in both CaMKII and storage buffer. The microsomes were resuspended in storage buffer, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored for later incorporation into planar lipid bilayers. Planar Lipid Bilayers—Single channel recordings of recombinant InsP3R type 2 activities were performed by fusing microsomes into planar lipid bilayers. Bilayers were formed across a 150-μm diameter hole in the wall of a Delrin cup using a 7:3 lipid mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine (50 mg/ml decane, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). The bilayer separated two pools (cis and trans). The microsomes were added to the cis-side of the bilayer. Standard solution contained 20 mmol/liter HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmol/liter EGTA [Ca2+]FREE = 250 ηmol/liter and 220 mmol/liter CsCH3SO3 in the cis-chamber (20 mmol/liter, trans). Free calcium concentration was calculated using MaxChelator software and verified with a calcium-specific microelectrode. 2 μmol/liter InsP3 and 10 μmol/liter ryanodine were used. The trans pool was held at virtual ground. The channels were positively identified by their sensitivity to InsP3 and heparin. Open probability was determined by using the half-threshold crossing criteria from 3-min records at 0 mV. Unitary currents were recorded using a conventional patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The current signal was digitized at 10 kHz with a 32-bit AD/DA converter (Digidata 1322A, Axon Instruments) and filtered at 1 kHz with a low pass eight pole Bessel filter. Data acquisition, unitary current measurement, statistical analysis, and data processing were performed using commercially available software packages (pClamp V8.2, pClamp V9.0, Axon Instruments and Origin, Microcal). Subcellular Localization of the Type 2 InsP3R to the Cardiomyocyte Nuclear Envelope—Our previous investigation of InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) isoform expression in cardiac tissues demonstrated that the predominant isoform expressed in the ventricular cardiomyocyte is InsP3R2 (3Perez P.J.

Mignery G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1388-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To investigate further the role of InsP3R2 in the cardiomyocyte, we carried out a subcellular fractionation of rat heart using a modified procedure of Kapiloff et al. (14Kapiloff M.S. Jackson N. Airhart N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3167-3176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heart homogenates were subjected to low speed centrifugation to separate microsomes, including SR, from heavier components such as myofibrils and nuclei (P1). The resulting supernatant was removed and pelleted by ultracentrifugation (P2). The nuclei were then purified from the (P1) fraction by sedimentation. SR-enriched microsomes were isolated from the (P2) fraction by sucrose gradient centrifugation. These fractions (75 μg of protein each) were immunoblotted with antibodies directed against amino- and carboxyl-terminal residues of both the type 1 (T1NH and T1C) and -2 InsP3R (T2NH and T2C). Additionally, an antibody against the NE-localized structural proteins lamin A and C was used. As shown in Fig. 1, the lane containing the purified nuclei was the only fraction demonstrating significant immunoreactivity to the NH2- and COOH-terminal InsP3R20-specific antibodies (panels A (T2NH) and B (T2C), Nuc). This band co-migrated with the full-length recombinant InsP3R2 in the adjacent lane containing transfected microsomal proteins (1 μg) (Fig. 1, panels A and B, InsP3R2). No type 1 receptor was detected in the nuclei sample using the InsP3R1 antibodies (T1NH and T1C) when probing identically prepared blots (data not shown). The isolation of nuclei was assessed by the enrichment of the nucleus-specific type A lamins (lamin A and C). This antibody detected primarily a 74-kDa band (lamin A) in the total homogenate and (P1) fraction and to a lesser degree a 64-kDa band (lamin B) (Fig. 1, panel C, arrowheads). The enrichment of lamins A/C was demonstrated in the isolated nuclei (Fig. 1, panel C, Nuc). The P2 microsome and SR-enriched fractions revealed a minimal lamin signal following significantly longer exposure times (not shown), suggesting only a small amount of contamination resulting from disrupted nuclei. This fractionation scheme produced results suggesting that the primary subcellular site for InsP3R2 localization appears to be the nucleus with little if any distribution to other cardiomyocyte membrane compartments. As reported by Kapiloff et al. (14Kapiloff M.S. Jackson N. Airhart N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3167-3176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their fractionation protocol was intended to avoid significant nuclear destruction during the homogenization step and therefore prevent the mixing of NE and SR membranes. In our hands, a minimal amount of nuclear disruption and SR contamination was suggested by the minor immunoreactive signal seen with the lamin antibody in the P2 fraction. However, Western blotting using RyR-specific antibody revealed that a majority of SR membrane remained sequestered with the myofibrils in the low speed pellet (P1). In order to recover SR efficiently, once the nuclei were isolated via sedimentation, the nuclei-depleted overlying material was recovered and treated with 0.6 mol/liter KCl, and the dissociated SR membranes were recovered by sedimentation. A comparison of equivalent amounts of the SR with NE (25 μg each) was made via Western blotting using the InsP3R2 (T2NH) and RyR antibodies. As predicted from the initial fractionation, T2NH resulted in a prominent InsP3R2-immunoreactive band in the NE fraction (Fig. 2, panel A) and a barely detectable signal in the SR. This faint SR signal could be attributed to a contribution of low levels of InsP3R2 expressed in SR as reported by Lipp et al. (4Lipp P. Laine M. Tovey S.C. Burrell K.M. Berridge M.J. Li W. Bootman M.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 939-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) for atrial myocytes and contamination from disrupted nuclear envelopes as a consequence of homogenization or perhaps other cell types. The RyR antibody detected a prominent band in the SR microsomes and only a faint signal in the NE lane consistent with only minor SR contamination (Fig. 2, panel B). Rat brain (minus cerebellum) microsomes were used as a positive control in each blot (100 μg). Immunolocalization of the InsP3R2 in Ventricular Myocytes—Recent reports (23Sugiyama T. Matsuda Y.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) describe the immunohistochemical localization of InsP3R2 in several cell types as having a nuclear distribution that appears to be diffusely localized throughout the nucleoplasm within heterochromatin and euchromatin. Given our biochemical results demonstrating the enrichment of InsP3R2 in the nuclear envelope of cardiomyocytes, we performed immunofluorescence on isolated rat ventricular myocytes. Myocytes were permeabilized and immunostained with type 2-specific amino-terminal antibody (T2NH). As shown in Fig. 3, a very faint fluorescent ring surrounding the nucleus is observed (Fig. 3, panels A and A1). Although a compartmental membrane enrichment of InsP3R2 clearly exists in the cardiomyocyte NE as indicated by the Western blotting data, the density of receptors appears to be low. Consistent with this are the results of Lipp et al. (4Lipp P. Laine M. Tovey S.C. Burrell K.M. Berridge M.J. Li W. Bootman M.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 939-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), in which the type 2 receptor was detected only at low levels in the junctional SR of atrial myocytes that were also shown to express ∼6-fold more receptor than ventricular myocytes. In order to document the faint NE immunostaining, long exposure intervals were required, which resulted in the detection of autofluorescence typical of longitudinal mitochondrial arrays and nonspecific secondary antibody absorption (27Zima A.V. Kockskämper J. Mejia-Alvarez R. Blatter L.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 550: 765-783Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). No immunoreactive shell encompassing the myocyte nuclei was observed in control cells using secondary antibody alone (Fig. 3, panel C and C1). We were not able to identify type 2 immunoreactivity in the SR of the ventricular myocytes. Myocytes reacted with the InsP3R T2C antibody, and these cells revealed a diffuse nucleoplasmic immunoreactivity similar to those described previously for the type 2 receptor. The T2C antibody was shown to cross-react with an unidentified nucleoplasmic protein (Mr ∼105, Fig. 4B) and was not used further for immunolocalization studies. Immunostaining of ventricular myocytes for the ryanodine receptor resulted in robust signals from SR components and was not observed in the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3, panels B and B1). This localization pattern is consistent with the immunocytochemical data of Kockskämper et al. (28Kockskämper J. Sheehan K.A. Bare D.J. Lipsius S.L. Mignery G.A. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2590-2605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) where no observable signals were detected in the nuclear envelope of atrial myocytes. These results suggest that the two intracellular release channels are differentially targeted in the myocyte and raise the possibility that the InsP3R2 is involved in local nuclear signaling events. Fractionation of Nuclei—To analyze the disparate immunostaining results observed in cardiac cells with the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal InsP3R2 antibodies, we fractionated isolated nuclei into NE and NP and examined the fractions for InsP3R2 expression. Equivalent amounts (25 μgof protein) of intact nuclei, NE, and NP were resolved on 5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the T2C and T2NH antibodies. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the results show that InsP3R2 is targeted to the fraction enriched in nuclear envelopes consistent with the InsP3R being a multipass integral membrane protein. This is d"

Preadipocytes mainly express the LPA1 receptor subtype, and LPA increases their proliferation. In monocytes and CV1 cells LPA was recently reported to bind and activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a transcription factor also known to play a pivotal role in adipogenesis. Here we show that, unlike the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone, LPA was unable to increase transcription of PPARγ-sensitive genes (PEPCK and ALBP) in the mouse preadipose cell line 3T3F442A. In contrast, treatment with LPA decreased PPARγ2 expression, impaired the response of PPARγ-sensitive genes to rosiglitazone, reduced triglyceride accumulation, and reduced the expression of adipocyte mRNA markers. The anti-adipogenic activity of LPA was also observed in the human SGBS (Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome) preadipocyte cell line, as well as in primary preadipocytes isolated from wild type mice. Conversely, the anti-adipogenic activity of LPA was not observed in primary preadipocytes from LPA1 receptor knock-out mice, which, in parallel, exhibited a higher adiposity than wild type mice. In conclusion, LPA does not behave as a potent PPARγ agonist in adipocytes but, conversely, inhibits PPARγ expression and adipogenesis via LPA1 receptor activation. The local production of LPA may exert a tonic inhibitory effect on the development of adipose tissue.

The local production of LPA may exert a tonic inhibitory effect on the development of adipose tissue. Enlargement of adipose tissue is conditioned by the ability of adipocytes to store triglycerides as well as by the ability of preadipocytes to differentiate into adipocytes (adipogenesis). The genetic program set up for adipogenesis is tightly controlled by the coordinated interplay of several transcription factors, the most important being peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) 1The abbreviations used are: PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; ALBP, adipocyte lipid-binding protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; KO, knock-out; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; SGBS, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; ALBP, adipocyte lipid-binding protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; KO, knock-out; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; SGBS, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome; WT, wild type. (mainly the isoform PPARγ2) (11Kersten S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 440: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Identifying the factors that control and/or regulate PPARγ activity and adipogenesis is of major interest for understanding the normal growth and the pathologic growth of adipose tissue. Many circulating factors (insulin, insulin growth factor I, growth hormone, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, etc.) are known to promote proliferation and/or differentiation of preadipocytes (see Ref. 1Grégoire F. Genart C. Hauser N. Remacle C. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar for review). In addition, the production of paracrine and autocrine factors within adipose tissue could also play an important role in its development. Adipocytes release several peptides (leptin, adipsin, adiponectin, angiotensinogen, etc.), proteins (lipoprotein lipase, autotaxin, etc.), and lipids (fatty acids, prostaglandins, lysophosphatidic acid, etc.) involved in preadipocyte growth and/or differentiation (see Ref. 2Jazet I.M. Pijl H. Meinders A.E. Neth J. Med. 2003; 61: 194-212PubMed Google Scholar for review). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a potent bioactive phospholipid able to regulate several cellular responses via activation of specific G protein-coupled receptors. Four LPA receptor subtypes have been identified, namely LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, and LPA4 (3Anliker B. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20555-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). LPA1 (edg-2 in the former nomenclature) was the first identified LPA receptor subtype. It is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system but is also present in numerous peripheral tissues. Invalidation of LPA1 receptor in mouse is associated with impaired suckling behavior in neonate pups and reduced body size and weight of the adults (4Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13384-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Our group has demonstrated that LPA is produced in the extracellular medium of adipocytes (5Valet P. Pages C. Jeanneton O. Daviaud D. Barbe P. Record M. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Lafontan M. J. Clin.

Extracellular LPA activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 and increases the proliferation of growing 3T3F442A preadipocytes, which mainly express the LPA1 receptor subtype (5Valet P.

Because preadipocytes are known to be present in adipose tissue in the close environment of adipocytes, extracellular LPA produced by adipocytes could be involved in paracrine control of the number of preadipocytes in adipose tissue. However, the possible influence of this regulation on in vivo enlargement of adipose tissue is conditioned by the ability of preadipocytes to differentiate into adipocytes. Interestingly, LPA was recently proposed to behave as a PPARγ agonist (9McIntyre T.M. Pontsler A.V. Silva A.R. St Hilaire A. Xu Y. Hinshaw J.C. Zimmerman G.A. Hama K. Aoki J. Arai H. Prestwich G.D.

Prestwich G.D. Byun H.S. Bittman R. Tigyi G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Such a conclusion was based on the ability of LPA to compete the binding of the classical PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone on the purified PPARγ protein as well as on its ability to increase the transcription of a peroxisome proliferator response element reporter gene after transfection in RAW 264.7 monocytes and CV1 cells. Knowing the pivotal role of PPARγ in adipogenesis, the initial objective of the present study was to determine whether LPA could regulate PPARγ activity in adipocytes and whether this could influence adipogenesis. We observed that LPA does not activate PPARγ in adipocytes but, conversely, down-regulates PPARγ2 expression and impairs adipogenesis via LPA1 receptor activation. Therefore, the local production of LPA by adipocytes may exert a tonic inhibitory effect on the recruitment of new adipocytes into adipose tissue. Animals—LPA1 receptor null male mice (LPA1-KO) and their wild type (WT) litter mates (4Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13384-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) were handled in accordance with the principles and guidelines established by the National Institute of Medical Research (INSERM). They were housed conventionally in an animal room with constant temperature (20–22 °C) and humidity (50–60%) and with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights on at 8:00 am). All mice had free access to food from UAR, Epinay, France (energy contents in percentage of kilocalories: 20% protein, 70% carbohydrate, and 15% fat) and water throughout the experiment. On the day of sacrifice the blood was collected on heparin, and glucose was immediately measured with a glucose meter. Plasma concentrations of insulin (Diagnostics Pasteur, Paris, France) and leptin (Linco) were determined with a radioimmunoassay kit. Plasma concentrations of triglycerides and free fatty acids were determined using a colorimetric kit (Wako). Separation of Adipocytes and Stroma-vascular Cells from Adipose Tissue—Adipose tissue was dissected out and weighed before separating adipocytes from stroma-vascular cells as described previously (12Deslex S. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue was minced and incubated in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 mg/ml collagenase and 1% bovine serum albumin for 30–45 min at 37 °C under shaking. The digestate was filtrated through a 100-μm screen and centrifuged at 2100 rpm for 10 min to separate adipocytes as a floating fat cake and stroma-vascular cells in a pellet. Pelleted cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes in primary culture as described in the next section. Adipocyte Differentiation in Culture—Mouse 3T3F442A preadipocytes (13Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) were grown and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (14Bétuing S. Valet P. Lapalu S.

The preadipocytes were grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (Invitrogen) and then cultured in an adipogenic medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus 50 nm insulin for 4 or 7 days (the medium was changed every 2 days). Triglyceride content was quantified using a colorimetric kit (Wako Chemicals) Proteins were quantified with a Bradford assay kit (Protassay, Bio-Rad). LPA present in adipogenic medium was quantified using a radioenzymatic assay as described previously (15Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A. Simon M.F. Lafontan M. Valet P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1947-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For LPA treatments, 1-oleoyl-LPA (18:1) solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was used. Adipocyte differentiation of primary preadipocytes from adipose tissue was induced in serum-free medium as described previously (12Deslex S. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, stroma-vascular cells were prepared (see previous section) from 4-week-old mice. Pelleted cells were suspended in 1 ml of erythrocyte lysis buffer (16 mm Tris-HCl and 0.08% NH4Cl, pH 7.65) for 2 min and then diluted in 50 ml of DMEM before centrifugation. Pelleted cells were filtrated through a 100-μm screen, seeded in 12-well plates (150,000 cells/well), and cultured in a serum-free adipogenic medium (DMEM/Ham's F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 10 mg/ml transferrin, 33 mm biotin, 66 mm insulin, 1 nm triiodothyronine, and 17 mm pantothenate) for 7 days. After 7 days of culture under these conditions, the proportion of newly differentiated adipocytes was evaluated by counting the number of lipid-laden (light-refringent) cells under the microscope. Preadipocytes from Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) were grown and differentiated as described previously (16Wabitsch M. Brenner R.E. Melzner I. Braun M. Moller P. Heinze E. Debatin K.M. Hauner H. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). They were grown to confluence in DMEM/Ham's F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and then transferred into a serum-free adipogenic medium (DMEM/Ham's F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 10 mg/ml transferrin, 15 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 33 mm biotin, 17 mm pantothenate, 10 nm insulin, 200 pm triiodothyronine, 2 μm rosiglitazone, and 1 mm cortisol) for 4 days and then in the same medium without rosiglitazone for 6 more days. Gene Expression—Total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Gene expression was analyzed using real time PCR as described previously (7Ferry G. Tellier E. Try A. Grès S. Naime I. Simon M. Rodriguez M. Boucher J. Tack I. Gesta S. Chomarat P. Dieu M. Raes M. Galizzi J. Valet P. Boutin J. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18162-18169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed for 60 min at 37 °C using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of a random hexamer. A minus reverse transcriptase reaction was performed in parallel to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. Real time PCR was performed starting with 25 ng of cDNA and a 900 nm concentration of both sense and antisense primers in a final volume of 25 μl using the SYBR Green TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence was monitored and analyzed in a GeneAmp 5700 detection system instrument (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of 18 S ribosomal RNA was performed in parallel using the ribosomal RNA control TaqMan assay kit (Applied Biosystem) to normalize gene expression. Results are expressed as 2(Ct18 S – Ctgene) × 10,000, where Ct corresponds to the number of cycles needed to generate a fluorescent signal above a predefined threshold (Table I). Oligonucleotide primers were designed using the Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Table IExpression of LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, and LPA4 receptor subtype genes in preadipocytesLPA1LPA2LPA3LPA43T3F442A preadipocytes27 ± 3UndUnd0.3 ± 0.1SGBS preadipocytes45 ± 30.3 ± 0.1UndUndWT SVC117 ± 121.4 ± 0.4Und2.8 ± 0.1LPA1-KO SVCUnd1.7 ± 0.5Und2.5 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Oligonucleotides for mouse gene expression studies were as follows: LPA1 receptor, 5′-CATGGTGGCAATCTACGTCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGCCAATCCAGCGAAGAA-3′ (antisense); LPA2 receptor, 5′-TGTCTGACTGCACAGCTTGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCATGGAGTTTTCTGGTGCC-3′ (antisense); LPA3 receptor, 5′-TGGGCCATCGCCATTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGCAGGCAGAGATGTTGCA-3′ (antisense); LPA4 receptor (also known as p2y9/GPR23), 5′-CCTTACCAACATCTATGGGAGCAT-3′ (antisense) and 5′-TGGCCAGGAAACGATCCA-3′ (antisense); adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP), 5′-TTCGATGAAATCACCGCAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTCGACTTTCCATCCCACTT-3′ (antisense); PPARγ2, 5′-CTGTTTTATGCTGTTATGGGTGAAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCACCATGCTCTGGGTCAA-3′ (antisense); hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), 5′-GGCTTACTGGGCACAGATACCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGAAGGCTCTGAGTTGCTCAA-3′ (antisense); and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), 5′-ATGTTCGGGCGGATTGAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAGGTTCAAGGCGTTTTCC-3′ (antisense).

Western Blot Analysis—Cells were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), and 40 μg of protein were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was pre-incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (1%) containing 10% dry milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (0.5%) containing 1% dry milk supplemented (1:5000 dilution) with a rabbit polyclonal PPARγ antibody raised against an N-terminal PPAR peptide (amino acids 20–104) as described previously (25Fajas L.

After washing in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween (0.5%), PPARγ was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) using an anti rabbit-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Sigma). Expression of LPA Receptor Subtypes and PPARγ2 in 3T3F442A Cells—Experiments were carried out in the mouse 3T3F442A cell line characterized previously for its ability to differentiate into adipocytes when cultured in an appropriate adipogenic medium (see “Materials and Methods”). Confluent cells expressed PPARγ2, LPA1 receptor, and LPA4 receptor mRNAs. LPA2 and LPA3 were not detected (Fig. 1 and Table I). The PPARγ2 mRNA level increased 4-fold between confluence and 8-day post-confluence adipocytes (Fig. 1). In contrast, the LPA1 receptor mRNA level decreased by 14-fold (Fig. 1). The LPA4 receptor mRNA level did not change during the course of adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1). LPA Inhibits Agonist-mediated Activation of PPARγ2 in 3T3F442A Cells—LPA was reported for its ability to bind and activate the nuclear receptor PPARγ in monocytes and CV1 cells (9McIntyre T.M. Pontsler A.V. Silva A.R. St Hilaire A. Xu Y. Hinshaw J.C. Zimmerman G.A. Hama K. Aoki J. Arai H. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bittman R. Tigyi G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PPARγ is a transcription factor known for its pivotal role in adipogenesis (17Lee C.H. Olson P. Evans R.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Our initial objective was to determine whether LPA could activate endogenously expressed PPARγ in 3T3F442A cells. One way to evaluate PPARγ activation was to measure the ability of a PPARγ-agonist such as rosiglitazone to increase the transcription of endogenously expressed genes containing a peroxisome proliferator response element in their promoters. As demonstrated previously (18Glorian M. Duplus E. Beale E.G. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), PEPCK is one of the most sensitive PPARγ-sensitive genes in 3T3F442A adipocytes. PPARγ activity was studied in 3T3F442A cells cultured in an adipogenic medium for 4 days (see “Materials and Methods”). At that stage the cells exhibited maximal expression of PPARγ2 mRNA and minimal expression of LPA1 receptor (Fig. 1). As a positive control of PPARγ activation, the influence of rosiglitazone on PEPCK mRNA was tested. Rosiglitazone led to a dose-dependent increase in PEPCK mRNA level with an EC50 of 10 nm and a maximal effect of up to 17-fold when compared with control (Fig. 2A). In contrast, LPA (10 μm in 1% bovine serum albumin as vehicle) did not significantly modify the PEPCK mRNA level (Fig. 2, curve labeled +LPA, rosiglitazone at 0). When using other vehicles (ethanol, methanol, Me2SO, or translocase-3) (9McIntyre T.M. Pontsler A.V. Silva A.R. St Hilaire A. Xu Y. Hinshaw J.C. Zimmerman G.A. Hama K. Aoki J. Arai H. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 100: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), LPA alone still had no significant effect on PEPCK mRNA (data not shown). Interestingly, when LPA was used in co-treatment with rosiglitazone, the dose-response of rosiglitazone was significantly shifted to the right, leading to an EC50 of up to 20 nm without modification of the maximal effect (Fig. 2A). When the adipogenic medium was supplemented with 10 μm LPA from confluence to day 4, the dose-response of rosiglitazone on the PEPCK mRNA level was almost completely annealed (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained when analyzing the ALBP mRNA level as another PPARγ-sensitive gene (not shown). These results suggested that LPA was not able to activate PPARγ in 3T3F442A cells but, conversely, inhibited agonist-dependent activation of PPARγ. LPA Inhibits PPARγ2 Expression in 3T3F442A Cells—To test whether LPA-inhibition of agonist-mediated activation of PPARγ could result from a down-regulation of PPARγ2 expression, the PPARγ2 mRNA level was measured. In 4-day post-confluent 3T3F442A cells, 24 h of treatment with 10 μm LPA led to a significant reduction (38%) in PPARγ2 mRNA level when compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). When LPA was chronically present in the culture medium from confluence to day 4, PPARγ2 mRNA level was further down-regulated (74%) when compared with control (Fig. 3A). In parallel, the PPARγ protein level was reduced after 4 days of treatment with LPA (Fig. 3B). No alteration of PPARγ protein level was observed after 24 h of LPA treatment. These results suggested that LPA-mediated inhibition of agonist-mediated activation of PPARγ resulted from down-regulation of PPARγ2 expression. LPA Inhibits Adipocyte Differentiation of 3T3F442A Cells— With PPARγ2 playing a pivotal role in adipocyte differentiation, the influence of LPA on adipocyte differentiation of 3T3F442A cells was studied. When 3T3F442A cells were differentiated for 7 days in the presence of increasing concentration of LPA in the adipogenic medium, a dose-dependent reduction in triglyceride accumulation was observed (Fig. 4A). The effect of LPA was significantly detected at 4 μm and was maximal at 8 μm. LPA treatment also led to a significant reduction in the level of PPARγ2, ALBP, and HSL mRNAs (Fig. 4B). These results revealed the anti-adipogenic activity of LPA. LPA Normally Present in Serum Restrains Adipocyte Differentiation of 3T3F442A Cells—As described under “Materials and Methods,” the adipogenic medium used to allow differentiation of 3T3F442A cells contains 10% fetal calf serum, and this serum is known to contain LPA (15Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A. Simon M.F. Lafontan M. Valet P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1947-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether LPA brought by serum could influence adipogenesis. As shown in Fig. 5A, LPA concentration in fresh adipogenic medium measured using a radioenzymatic assay (15Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A. Simon M.F. Lafontan M. Valet P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1947-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was 0.45 μm. As demonstrated previously, LPA can be hydrolyzed and inactivated by treatment with the lysophospholipase called phospholipase B (5Valet P. Pages C. Jeanneton O. Daviaud D. Barbe P. Record M. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Lafontan M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Ferry G. Tellier E. Try A. Grès S. Naime I. Simon M. Rodriguez M. Boucher J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18162-18169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, 30 min of treatment with 0.5 units/ml phospholipase B led to a >90% reduction in LPA content of the adipogenic medium. When 3T3F442A cells were differentiated for 7 days in an adipogenic medium supplemented with 0.5 units/ml phospholipase B, the amount of triglycerides stored in the cells was significantly increased when compared with that for a control adipogenic medium (Fig. 5B). This was accompanied by a significant increase in the level of PPARγ2, ALBP, and HSL mRNAs (Fig. 5C). These results showed that LPA brought by serum in the adipogenic medium restrains adipocyte differentiation of 3T3F442A preadipocytes. Most of the adipogenic medium used to differentiate preadipose cell lines contains serum. Our observations could help to optimize the composition of serum-containing adipogenic medium. The Anti-adipogenic Activity of LPA Is Mediated by the LPA1 Receptor Subtype—To determine whether the LPA1 receptor was involved in the anti-adipogenic activity of LPA, adipocyte differentiation was analyzed in primary preadipocytes from LPA1-KO mice and their WT litter mates (4Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13384-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Preadipocytes are present in the stroma-vascular fraction of the adipose tissue and were isolated from adipocytes after collagenase dissociation (see “Materials and Methods”). When prepared from WT mice, the stroma-vascular fraction expressed LPA1, LPA2, and LPA4 receptor mRNAs, with the LPA1 receptor subtype being predominantly expressed (Table I). LPA3 receptor mRNAs were undetectable. When the stroma-vascular fraction was prepared from LPA1-KO mice, LPA1 mRNAs were undetectable, and LPA2 and LPA4 mRNA levels were not different from those in WT mice (Table I). The stroma-vascular fraction of adipose tissue is not only composed of preadipocytes but also of endothelial cells and macrophages. To evaluate the proportion of preadipocytes present, the stroma-vascular fraction was cultured in an adipogenic medium (see “Materials and Methods”) for 7 days. Under these conditions a certain proportion of cells became light-refringent as the result of triglyceride droplet accumulation (Fig. 6A) and the expression of adipocyte-specific genes (ALBP, PPARγ2, and HSL) (not shown). Interestingly, the proportion of lipid-laden cells obtained with WT mice (24%) was significantly lower than that obtained with LPA1-KO mice (Fig. 6B). This finding was associated with a lower expression of adipocyte-specific genes (not shown). This observation suggested that the proportion of preadipocytes present in the stroma-vascular fraction from WT mice was lower than that from LPA1-KO mice. When starting with WT mice, supplementation of the adipogenic medium with increasing concentrations of LPA during the 7 days of culture led to a dose-dependent decrease (maximal inhibition of 50% at 0.1 μm LPA) in the proportion of lipid-laden cells when compared with control cells (Fig. 7). When starting with LPA1-KO mice, no changes in the proportion of lipid-laden cells (Fig. 7) were observed after LPA treatment. These data showed that the absence of an LPA1 receptor in preadipocytes led to the suppression of the anti-adipogenic activity of LPA. Adipose Tissue Phenotype of LPA1-KO Mice—To determine the possible consequences of LPA1 invalidation on adipose tissue development, LPA1-KO mice were analyzed and compared with WT mice. Data presented were obtained with males, but similar results were obtained with females (not shown). LPA1-KO mice exhibited lower body weight than WT mice, whatever the age of the animals (Fig. 8A). This was accompanied by no differences in the mean daily food intake measured over 10 weeks, i.e. 1.0 ± 0.2 and 0.8 ± 0.1 gram of food per gram of body weight per day for WT (n = 6) and LPA1-KO (n = 3) mice, respectively. At 15 weeks of age and despite the lower body weight, perigonadic adipose tissue weight was significantly higher in LPA1-KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 8B). Inguinal adipose tissue weight also tended to be higher in LPA1-KO mice than in WT mice, but this was not significant (Fig. 8B). At the plasma level, LPA1-KO mice exhibited a significantly higher (2-fold) concentration of leptin when compared with WT mice (Table II). In contrast, no differences in plasma concentration of insulin, glucose, triglycerides, and free-fatty acids were observed (Table II). Taken together, these observations showed that, despite their lower body weight, LPA1-KO mice exhibited higher adiposity than WT mice.Table IIBlood parameters of WT and LPA1-KO miceWT miceLPA1-KO miceTriglycerides (g/l)0.36 ± 0.030.33 ± 0.03Free-fatty acids (nm)0.65 ± 0.060.77 ± 0.06Glucose (g/l)1.73 ± 0.132.02 ± 0.15Insulin (μg/ml)0.72 ± 0.170.65 ± 0.24Leptin (ng/ml)2.21 ± 0.224.57 ± 0.83 Open table in a new tab LPA Inhibits Adipocyte Differentiation of Human Preadipocytes—The possible anti-adipogenic activity of LPA was tested in human preadipocytes. This was tested in the human preadipocyte cell strain from SGBS (16Wabitsch M. Brenner R.E. Melzner I. Braun M. Moller P. Heinze E. Debatin K.M. Hauner H. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). These cells have previously been described for their ability to differentiate into adipocytes in a serum-free medium (see “Materials and Methods”). Confluent SGBS preadipocytes expressed both LPA1 and LPA2 receptor mRNAs (Table I), with the LPA1 receptor RNAs being 150-fold more expressed than LPA2 receptor RNAs (Table I). In contrast, LPA3 receptor and LPA4 receptor RNAs remained undetectable. After 10 days of culture in an appropriate serum-free adipogenic medium, SGBS cells accumulated triglyceride droplets (Fig. 9A) and expressed adipocyte-specific genes such as ALBP and HSL (Fig. 9B). Supplementation of the adipogenic medium with LPA led to a striking reduction in triglyceride droplet accumulation (Fig. 9A) accompanied by a dose-dependent reduction in ALBP and HSL gene expression (Fig. 9B). These results showed that LPA was anti-adipogenic in human preadipocytes. The recruitment of new fat cells in adipose tissue requires the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes (adipogenesis), a process tightly controlled by the transcription factor PPARγ2. Factors locally produced in adipose tissue by adipocytes could contribute to the regulation of adipogenesis by exerting paracrine actions on preadipocytes. Among those paracrine factors LPA could play an important role, because it is produced at the extracellular face of adipocytes by autotaxin (7Ferry G. Tellier E. Try A. Grès S. Naime I. Simon M. Rodriguez M. Boucher J. Tack I. Gesta S. Chomarat P. Dieu M. Raes M. Galizzi J. Valet P. Boutin J. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Biol.

We demonstrated previously that, in 3T3F442A preadipocytes, LPA was able to increase phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 and to increases proliferation (8Pagès C.

Sci. 2000; 905: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the influence of LPA on adipogenesis was not studied until the present work. Such study was further motivated by recent reports showing that LPA could, in parallel to its ability to activate G protein-coupled membrane receptors, behave as an agonist to the nuclear transcription factor PPARγ in monocytes and CV1 cells (9McIntyre T.M. Pontsler A.V. Silva A.R. St Hilaire A. Xu Y. Hinshaw J.C. Zimmerman G.A. Hama K. Aoki J. Arai H. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 100: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 10Zhang C. Baker D.L. Yasuda S. Makarova N. Balazs L. Johnson L.R. Marathe G.K. McIntyre T.M. Xu Y. Prestwich G.D. Byun H.S. Bittman R. Tigyi G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because PPARγ is known to play a pivotal role in the control of adipogenesis (17Lee C.H. Olson P. Evans R.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), determining whether LPA could activate PPARγ in adipocytes was of main interest in the context of adipose tissue. The first part of the present study shows that, unlike the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone, LPA was unable to activate PPARγ activity in adipocytes evaluated by measuring the induction of PPARγ-sensitive genes (PEPCK and ALBP). These results lead us to conclude that LPA does not behave as a potent activator of PPARγ in adipocytes. This conclusion is not in agreement with that drawn previously from experiments performed in monocytes and CV1 cells (9McIntyre T.M. Pontsler A.V. Silva A.R. St Hilaire A. Xu Y. Hinshaw J.C. Zimmerman G.A. Hama K. Aoki J. Arai H. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 100: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 10Zhang C. Baker D.L. Yasuda S. Makarova N. Balazs L. Johnson L.R. Marathe G.K. McIntyre T.M. Xu Y. Prestwich G.D. Byun H.S. Bittman R. Tigyi G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although LPA was demonstrated to bind to PPARγ in an in vitro assay (9McIntyre T.M. Pontsler A.V. Silva A.R. St Hilaire A. Xu Y. Hinshaw J.C. Zimmerman G.A. Hama K. Aoki J. Arai H. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 100: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), the ability of LPA to activate PPARγ obviously appears to be dependent on the cell type. Possible activation of a nuclear receptor such as PPARγ by exogenous LPA would require that a high enough amount of LPA penetrated into the cell and reached the nucleus. As demonstrated previously by our group, when preadipocytes are exposed to radiolabeled LPA virtually no radiolabeled LPA can be detected in the cells because of the presence of a high ecto-lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase activity, which dephosphorylates and inactivates LPA (20Simon M.F. Rey A. Castan-Laurel I. Gres S. Sibrac D. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23131-23136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This could explain why we observed no activation of PPARγ by LPA in adipocytes. This finding also suggests that ecto-lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase activity could be weaker in monocytes and CV1 cells than in adipocytes, allowing a higher amount of LPA to enter into the cells and activate PPARγ. The most important result of the present study was the finding that chronic exposure of preadipocytes to LPA inhibits their differentiation into adipocytes, as attested by a reduction in triglyceride accumulation and a reduction in the expression of adipocyte specific genes. Therefore, LPA clearly behaves as an anti-adipogenic compound. In addition, the anti-adipogenic effect of LPA was not found in primary preadipocytes from LPA1 knock-out mice, indicating that the LPA1 receptor is fully responsible for the anti-adipogenic activity of LPA. These observations clearly support the concept that LPA is an anti-adipogenic mediator acting via a specific receptor. PPARγ2 clearly plays a pivotal positive role in adipogenesis (17Lee C.H. Olson P. Evans R.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Our data show that treatment with LPA leads to down-regulation of PPARγ2 expression and activity, as expected for an anti-adipogenic factor. It is therefore very likely that the anti-adipogenic activity of LPA is due to its negative impact on PPARγ2. This conclusion is supported by previous reports showing that LPA is able to inhibit PPARγ activity in THP-1 monocytes and IMR-32 neuroblastomas (21Ruiz-Velasco N. Dominguez A. Vega M.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Rodway H.A. Hunt A.N. Kohler J.A. Postle A.D. Lillycrop K.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this last cell line, LPA inhibits the capacity of PGJ2 to activate the transcription of a PPARγ responsive element-dependent reporter gene, and by using specific pharmacological inhibitors it was shown that the effect of LPA involves activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway as well as activation of the Rho kinase (22Rodway H.A. Hunt A.N. Kohler J.A. Postle A.D. Lillycrop K.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, it has previously been shown that increasing Rho-GTPase activity decreases adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ expression in mouse embryo-derived fibroblasts (23Sordella R. Jiang W. Chen G.C. Curto M. Settleman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In preadipocytes, LPA activates the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinases and activates the small G-protein Rho (19Pagès C. Girard A. Jeanneton O. Barbe P. Wolf C. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It can therefore be proposed that LPA-mediated inhibition of PPARγ2 activity and expression may result from the LPA1 receptor-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and/or the Rho kinase. What could be the physiological relevance of the anti-adipogenic activity of LPA? Because the LPA1 receptor was responsible for the anti-adipogenic activity of LPA in preadipocytes, phenotypic analysis of LPA1-KO mice presented an excellent opportunity for determining the possible involvement of LPA on adipose tissue development. As demonstrated previously, LPA1-KO mice exhibit reduced the size and weight of their bodies (4Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13384-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that despite their lower body weight, LPA1-KO mice exhibited higher adiposity than WT mice. This was associated with a higher plasma concentration of leptin, a cytokine known to be tightly associated with adipose tissue mass (24Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar). Because LPA1-KO mice exhibited the same food intake as WT mice, the higher adiposity of LPA1-KO mice cannot be explained by an alteration of their feeding behavior. Enlargement of adipose tissue not only results from increased accumulation of triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes but can also be influenced by the recruitment of new adipocytes resulting from adipogenesis. Interestingly, the proportion of preadipocytes present in adipose tissue from LPA1-KO mice was higher than that of WT mice (Fig. 6). It is therefore possible that increased adiposity of LPA1-KO mice may result from the suppression of the anti-adipogenic activity of LPA normally existing in WT mice. In conclusion, LPA is produced in the extracellular medium of adipocytes as the result of the lysophospholipase D activity of autotaxin (6Gesta S. Simon M. Rey A. Sibrac D. Girard A. Lafontan M.

Because preadipocytes express LPA1 receptor and are sensitive to LPA, it is likely that local production of LPA by adipocytes could exert a paracrine anti-adipogenic activity on surrounding preadipocytes and therefore exert a negative paracrine effect on adipose tissue development.

Protein interaction with EGCG is a critical step in the effects of EGCG on the regulation of various key proteins involved in signal transduction. We have identified a novel molecular target of EGCG using affinity chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry for protein identification. Spots of interest were identified as the intermediate filament, vimentin. The identification was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-vimentin antibody. Experiments using a pull-down assay with [3H]EGCG demonstrate binding of EGCG to vimentin with a Kd of 3.3 nm. EGCG inhibited phosphorylation of vimentin at serines 50 and 55 and phosphorylation of vimentin by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. EGCG specifically inhibits cell proliferation by binding to vimentin. Because vimentin is important for maintaining cellular functions and is essential in maintaining the structure and mechanical integration of the cellular space, the inhibitory effect of EGCG on vimentin may further explain its anti-tumor-promoting effect.

A number of epidemiological studies have shown that the consumption of green tea may protect against many cancer types, including lung, prostate, and breast (1Kelloff G.J. Crowell J.A. Steele V.E.

(–)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (–)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), and (–)-epicatechin (EC), are shown in Fig. 1. EGCG is the major polyphenol in green tea and may account for 50–80% of the total catechins in tea (4Yang C.S. Maliakal P. Meng X. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 25-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 6Yang C.S. Wang Z.Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1038-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 7Dong Z. Biofactors. 2000; 12: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of EGCG against tumorigenesis has been demonstrated. The mechanisms responsible for these cancer-preventive effects of tea are not very well understood but are being intensively investigated. Searching for the EGCG “receptor” or high affinity proteins that bind to EGCG is the first step to understanding the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of the anticancer effects of tea polyphenols. A few proteins that can directly bind with EGCG have been identified, including plasma proteins: fibronectin, fibrinogen, and histidine-rich glycoprotein (8Sazuka M. Isemura M. Isemura S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1031-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); also fatty acid synthase (Fas) (9Hayakawa S. Saeki K. Sazuka M. Suzuki Y. Shoji Y. Ohta T. Kaji K. Yuo A. Isemura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 1102-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), laminin, and the 67-kDa laminin receptor (10Suzuki Y. Isemura M. Cancer Lett. 2001; 173: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Tachibana H. Koga K. Fujimura Y. Yamada K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Plasma proteins may act as carrier proteins for EGCG. Fas might trigger the cascade of Fas-mediated apoptosis, and the fact that EGCG can bind and regulate biological functions of the 67 laminin receptor has possible implications for prion-related diseases. However, the biologic and physiologic significance for the anticancer effects of tea polyphenols is not clear. Identification of new proteins binding with EGCG should help in the design of new strategies to prevent cancer. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis is a powerful tool to identify proteins binding with EGCG. We used the JB6 mouse epidermal cell line, a system that has been used extensively as an in vitro model for tumor promotion studies (12Cheng T.J. Tseng Y.F. Chang W.M. Chang M.D. Lai Y.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 589-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), to identify novel proteins that bind with EGCG. The results indicated that EGCG binds with the intermediate filament (IF) protein, vimentin with high affinity (Kd = 3.3 nm). Vimentin, one of the type III IF proteins, is a major component of IFs and is expressed during development in a wide range of cells, including mesenchymal cells and in a variety of cultured cell lines and tumors (13Matsuzawa K. Kosako H. Inagaki N. Shibata H. Mukai H. Ono Y. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Matsuura Y. Azuma I. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2000; 36: 228-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IFs are essential for structure and mechanical integration of the cellular space and a variety of cellular functions such as mitosis, locomotion, and organizational cell architecture, and vimentin is readily phosphorylated by numerous protein kinases, thereby regulating their function (15Chou Y.H. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F101-F106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Helfand B.T. Chang L. Goldman R.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The proteolytic derivatives indicate that the amino-terminal domain, but not the carboxyl-terminal domain, has a direct effect on filament stability and polymerization (18Ando S. Tanabe K. Gonda Y. Sato C. Inagaki M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2974-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We used the Swiss-Prot program and a program from the National Genomic Information center to search the MALDI-TOF data base for peptides important in binding with EGCG. The peptide (SLYSSSPGGAYVTR) contains two phosphorylation sites of vimentin, serine 50 and serine 55. Our results in vivo demonstrated that EGCG inhibited the phosphorylation of vimentin at serines 50 and 55 in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro studies revealed that the phosphorylation of IF proteins by various types of serine/threonine protein kinases induces disassembly of the filament structure (19Yasui Y. Goto H. Matsui S. Manser E. Lim L. Nagata K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2868-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Vimentin is an excellent substrate for Cdc2 and PKA. Cdc2 phosphorylates vimentin at serine 55, and serine 50 is a phosphorylation site of PKA. In this study, we provide evidence that EGCG inhibited phosphorylation of vimentin by Cdc2 and PKA. EGCG is known to inhibit cell proliferation of various cancer cell lines (20Chen A. Zhang L. J. Biol.

Our data show that inhibition of vimentin phosphorylation by EGCG was directly associated with a decrease in cell proliferation. We hypothesize that the binding of EGCG to vimentin could be very important in a cascade of vimentin-mediated cell proliferation. Materials—Eagle's minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and gentamicin were from Whittaker Biosciences (Walkersville, MD); RPMI 1640 modified medium (2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 1mm sodium pyruvate, 4500 mg/liter glucose, and 1500 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate) and human insulin were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); l-glutamine was from Invitrogen; Kodak MS film was obtained from Sigma; CNBr-Sepharose 4B, ECL plus kit, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences; and rec-Protein G-Sepharose 4B was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.

PKA protein kinase and kemptide were from Upstate (Waltham, MA). EGCG, EC, ECG, and EGC were generous gifts from Dr. Chi-Tang Ho (Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ). Cell Culture—The JB6 Cl41 mouse epidermal cell line was grown in monolayers with minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin. The cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Affinity Chromatography—EGCG was first coupled to the CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B matrix, and the binding between vimentin and EGCG was examined by affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell lysates from JB6 Cl41 cells cultured in 10-cm dishes were disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.02 mm PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). The lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 15000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fraction (10 mg/8 ml) was applied to the EGCG-Sepharose 4B column (12 × 8 mm) at 4 °C. The mobile phase was T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, and 1 mm EDTA) running at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The bound proteins were then eluted with T1 buffer (4 m urea, 1 m NaCl in T buffer). Protein elution was monitored in fractions using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the ReadyPrep two-dimensional Starter kit was used as outlined in the instruction manual. The samples were then applied onto the IPG nonlinear strips, pH 5–8, for the first dimension separation. The second-dimensional separation of eluted proteins was performed by 10–20% SDS-PAGE. The gels and proteins were stained with SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain or transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. MALDI-TOF Analysis—The protein spot was excised from a polyacrylamide gel and digested overnight with trypsin. The extracted peptides were mixed with the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid (Aldrich), spotted onto a MALDI plate, and analyzed with a Voyager DePro mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Birmingham, AL). The peptide masses were entered into Mascot (www.matrixscience.com/), and the NCBI data base was searched to identify the protein. In Vitro Pull-down Assay—Recombinant vimentin (2 μg) or a JB6 Cl41 cellular supernatant fraction (600 μg) was incubated with the EGCG-Sepharose 4B (or Sepharose 4B as control) beads (100 μl, 50% slurry) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02 mm PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). After incubation with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times with buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.02 mm PMSF), and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation—JB6 Cl41 cells were disrupted in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% NP-40, 0.02 mm PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor), and cell lysate (600 μg) was used for immunoprecipitation as described (26He Z. Ma W.Y. Hashimoto T. Bode A.M. Yang C.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4396-4401PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) and Western blotting as described (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar) with some modification as described previously (26He Z. Ma W.Y. Hashimoto T. Bode A.M. Yang C.S. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4396-4401PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Vimentin Plasmids—A cDNA fragment encoding vimentin was inserted in-frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) or pGEX5X1 (Amersham Biosciences) to produce the V5 epitope-tagged construct, pcDNA3.1/V5-vimentin, or pGEX5X1-vimentin. All of the positive clones containing cDNA inserts were identified by restriction enzyme mapping and sequenced at Genewiz, Inc. (North Brunswick, NJ). Bacterial Expression and Purification of the GST-Vimentin Fusion Protein—The GST-vimentin fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified as described (12Cheng T.J. Tseng Y.F. Chang W.M. Chang M.D. Lai Y.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 589-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The GST-vimentin was used for affinity binding and in vitro kinase assays. GST-Vimentin Affinity Binding Assay Estimation for Kd—For the GST-vimentin affinity binding assay, expressed GST fusion proteins were incubated for immobilization with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at room temperature. The affinity binding assay was carried out overnight at 4 °C in a 500-μl reaction mixture containing reaction buffer (see “In Vitro Pull-down Assay”) with 1 μg of GST-vimentin-Sepharose 4B or GST-Sepharose 4B and 0.5 μCi of [3H]EGCG. For analyzing concentration-dependent uptake, 39 pm to 50 μm concentrations of EGCG were applied. The Kd value was determined through nonlinear regression analysis using the Prizm 4.0 software program (Graphpad Inc., San Diego, CA). Assay of Phosphorylation of Vimentin at Serine 50 and Serine 55— JB6 Cl41 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes (4 × 105). After culturing at 37 °C (5% FBS) for 12 h, the cells were treated with different concentrations of EGCG (1, 5, 10, or 20 μm). 72 h following treatment, the cells were lysed, and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. The blots were probed with phospho-specific antibodies to vimentin. Kinase Assay—The Cdc2 kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 1 h in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol and 0.01% Brij), 1 μl (20 units) of enzyme, 10 μm of the kinase substrates (histone H1) or 4 μg of GST-vimentin, EGCG (1–20 μm) or EC/ECG/EGC (20 μm), 10 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The PKA kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 1 h in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing kinase buffer, 0.5 μl (1 ng) of enzyme, 250 μm of the kinase substrates (kemptide), or 4 μg of GST-vimentin and EGCG (1–20 μm). The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 5× SDS sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, one-half of the sample was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized by x-ray film. siRNA Preparation and Vector Construction—Two pairs of hairpin siRNA oligonucleotides containing BamHI and HindIII sites were designed as described before (29Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8107) Google Scholar). To design target-specific siRNA templates, we selected sequences of the type AA(N19)NN or AA(N19)UU from the open reading frame of the targeted mRNA to obtain 19-nucleotide sense and antisense strands. This strategy for choosing siRNA target sites is based on the previous observation by Elbashir et al. (30Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) that siRNA with 3′ overhanging UU dinucleotides are the most effective. Hairpin siRNA template oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized using a DNA synthesizer and deprotected and gel-purified as purchased from Sigma Genosys. Selected siRNA target sequences were aligned to the genome data base in a BLAST search to ensure sequences without significant homology to other genes. The sense siRNA template sequence for vimentin was 5′-GATCCGTACCAAGATCTGCTCAATGTTCAAGAGACATTGAGCAGATCTTGGTATTTTTTGGAAA-3′, and the antisense siRNA template sequence was 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAATACCAAGATCTGCTCAATGTCTCTTGAACATTGAGCAGATCTTGGTACG-3′. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the pSilencer 3.1-H1 neo vector (Ambion) at the BamHI and HindIII sites as described in the manufacturer's instructions. The siRNA sequence targeting vimentin (NM_011701) was from positions 1147–1165 relative to the start codon. As a negative siRNA control, we used two kinds of circular plasmids encoding a hairpin siRNA sequence targeting the green fluorescent protein (siRNA GFP) and a scrambled siRNA, the sequence of which lacks significant sequence homology to the mouse, human, or rat genome data base. The resulting siRNA-expressing plasmids were used for both transient and stable transfections. Transfection and Stable Cell Lines—JB6 Cl41 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Stable cell lines were obtained by transfecting 2 × 105 cells in 6-cm dishes with 4 μg of the expression plasmids. The cell lines were selected and subsequently maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence—Transfected cells grown on glass chambers were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and extracted in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature to allow subsequent antibody penetration. After extensive washing in PBS, the fixed and extracted cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 37 °C in a humidified chamber for 1 h, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for an additional hour at 37 °C. The cells on coverslips were viewed using an LEI-750D CE microscope (Leica, Bannockburn, IL) equipped with epifluorescence optics. Cell Proliferation Assay—To assess proliferation, control (GFP siRNA) or vimentin siRNA cells (3 × 103) were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cellular proliferation was then estimated at 24, 48, and 72 h using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assay solution is added to each well, and absorbance (492 nm and 690 nm background) is read with a 96-well plate reader. Absorbance at 492 nm is directly proportional to the number of living cells. Then to test whether EGCG had an effect on proliferation of control (GFP siRNA) or vimentin siRNA cells (3 × 103), the cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates for 12 h and then treated with different concentrations of EGCG (1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 μm). The cells were cultured for an additional 72 h, and then 20 μlof the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution were added to each well. The cells were incubated for an additional hour, and then absorbance (492 nm and 690 nm background) was measured using a 96-well plate reader as above. Data Analysis—The figures shown in this paper are representative of at least three independent experiments with similar results. The statistical differences were evaluated using Student's t test and considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Identification of Vimentin as an EGCG-binding Protein— Proteins from JB6 Cl41 cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography using EGCG-Sepharose 4B (Fig. 2). Fractions containing proteins binding with EGCG were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS to identify proteins that directly bind with EGCG. Experimental conditions were first established to obtain a reproducible pattern of spots by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Two-dimensional electrophoresis of proteins captured from EGCG-Sepharose 4B beads. Cell lysates were applied to an EGCG-Sepharose 4B column, and ECGG-binding proteins were used for analysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Spots pertaining to vimentin are indicated in the dotted ring and enlarged in the inset. The numbered protein spots were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry (Table I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed with different quantities of protein from the affinity column (data not shown) to determine optimal conditions for two-dimensional electrophoresis, and each protein fraction was run in triplicate.

Analysis was done using JB6 cell lysates and EGCG-Sepharose 4B. To create a two-dimensional image of vimentin binding with EGCG, samples subjected to the affinity column were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis under the same conditions as described above, and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The spots were confirmed to be vimentin by Western analysis using a mouse monoclonal (VI-01) vimentin antibody (Fig. 4A). These results strongly indicate that vimentin binds with EGCG. To directly test this possibility, we used a combination of a pull-down assay with EGCG-Sepharose 4B and an immunoprecipitation assay with protein G-Sepharose 4B and the vimentin antibody. The lysate from JB6 Cl41 cells was directly applied to the EGCG-Sepharose 4B column, and following elution, Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a 54-kDa protein that was reactive with the vimentin antibody (VI-01) (Fig. 4B, lane 2), confirming the presence of vimentin in the EGCG-bound fraction. Lane 1 shows vimentin from lysate as the control. The lysates were applied to protein G-Sepharose 4B beads and immunoprecipitated with the vimentin antibody (Fig. 4C, lane 2) or were applied to the EGCG-Sepharose 4B column and Sepharose 4B column and eluted (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). The results clearly indicate that vimentin is present in mouse cells and that EGCG binds with vimentin in vivo. To characterize the binding interaction, we measured the binding affinity of GST-vimentin and [3H]EGCG using a pull-down assay. The results indicate that vimentin displayed a high affinity for binding with [3H]EGCG (Fig. 4D). GST-Sepharose 4B alone was used only as a negative control, and no binding occurred (data not shown). The Kd value for the binding of EGCG to vimentin was 3.3 nm. EGCG Inhibits Phosphorylation of Vimentin at Ser50 and Ser55 in a Dose-dependent Manner—JB6 Cl41 cells were employed to analyze the EGCG inhibition of phosphorylation of vimentin at serine 50 and serine 55 (Fig. 5A). The dose course study shows that phosphorylation of vimentin gradually decreases following 72 h of treatment with increasing amounts of EGCG (1, 5, 10, or 20 μm) (Fig. 5B), with no effect on total vimentin protein levels (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that phosphorylation of vimentin at serine 50 and serine 55 is inhibited by EGCG in a dose-dependent manner. EGCG Specifically Inhibits the Phosphorylation of Vimentin by Cdc2—Cdc2 kinase activity was analyzed by in vitro kinase assays using GST-vimentin and histone H1 as substrates. First we determined the effect of EGCG on the total phosphorylation of vimentin by Cdc2. As shown in Fig. 5C (top panel), up to 5 μm EGCG did not affect Cdc2 kinase activity, whereas 10 or 20 μm induced a gradual decrease in kinase activity. The results indicate that increasing concentrations of EGCG inhibit Cdc2 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of vimentin. The next question to be answered was whether the inhibition was due to an interference of EGCG with the phosphorylation of vimentin directly or indirectly via Cdc2 kinase. In a second series of experiments, the kinase assay was carried out using GST-vimentin or histone H1 as a substrate for Cdc2 kinase. The results confirm that the addition of EGCG to the k"

We examined the subcellular distribution of flotillin-1 in different cell types and found that localization is cell type-specific. Flotillin-1 relocates from a cytoplasmic compartment to the plasma membrane upon the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To delineate the structural determinants necessary for its localization, we generated a series of truncation mutants of flotillin-1. Wild type flotillin-1 has two putative hydrophobic domains and is localized to lipid raft microdomains at the plasma membrane. Flotillin-1 fragments lacking the N-terminal hydrophobic stretch are excluded from the lipid raft compartments but remain at the plasma membrane. On the other hand, mutants with the second hydrophobic region deleted fail to traffic to the plasma membrane but are instead found in intracellular granule-like structures. Flotillin-1 specifically interacts with the adaptor protein CAP, the Src family kinase Fyn, and cortical F-actin in lipid raft microdomains in adipocytes. Furthermore, CAP and Fyn associate with different regions in the N-terminal sequences of flotillin-1. These results furthered our understanding for how flotillin-1 can function as a molecular link between lipid rafts of the plasma membrane and a multimeric signaling complex at the actin cytoskeleton."

The protein-linked glycans are immediately trimmed, and the resulting structures subsequently serve as ligands for the luminal lectin chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin, which act in conjunction with other chaperones and thiol disulfide oxidoreductases to help facilitate protein folding, oligomerization, and disulfide bond formation (2Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Release from the chaperones and packaging into anteriograde transport vesicles is generally accomplished only upon completion of the folding process. In contrast, proteins that fail to fold continually re-engage the chaperone machinery either until folding is achieved or until the nascent glycoproteins acquire a signal for disposal through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (3Cabral C.M. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 619-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Many normal proteins, as well as many “defective” proteins in loss-of-function human genetic diseases, have delayed rather than defective folding kinetics that result in the premature disposal of the newly synthesized polypeptides (2Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Thus, the percentage of transported functional protein is defined by a competition between the kinetics of conformational maturation versus the rate of acquiring the targeting signal for protein disposal. The present model for ERAD invokes the specific cleavage of a single mannose residue from the Man9GlcNAc2 glycan processing intermediate by the slow acting enzyme, ER mannosidase I (ERManI), as a rate-limiting initiation step for targeting incompletely folded glycoproteins for disposal (4Wu Y.

The trimmed oligosaccharide, in the context of an unfolded polypeptide, is subsequently recognized by a collection of luminal ER lectins, termed EDEMs, which are nonhydrolytic homologs of ERManI (2Helenius A.

Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the complex interactions between misfolded glycoproteins, EDEMs, and other ER-associated components has still not been entirely resolved, but present models envisage a “handing off” of the ERAD substrate to the Sec61 translocon pore complex for retrotranslocation and subsequent proteasomal degradation (2Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). ERManI, EDEMs, and a collection of Golgi processing hydrolases, termed Golgi α-mannosidases IA, IB, and IC, are all members of glycosylhydrolase (GH) family 47 (9Moremen K. Ernst B. Hart G. Sinay P.

J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic members of this family have unique branch specificities that are required for the complete trimming to the key Man5GlcNAc2 intermediate structures necessary for maturation into complex type glycans on cell surface and secreted glycoproteins (9Moremen K.

Despite sequence similarities with family 47 hydrolases, EDEM family members appear to lack hydrolase activity, but they are proposed to accomplish their lectin function in ERAD by a mechanism analogous to glycan recognition during catalysis by the true hydrolases (2Helenius A.

Thus, understanding how this family of enzymes and lectins accomplish their functions will provide insights into the rate-limiting decision between glycoprotein maturation and disposal in the secretory pathway. The two standard mechanisms for glycosidase-mediated bond hydrolysis both involve the direct protonation of the glycosidic oxygen by an enzyme-associated catalytic acid and the attack of the anomeric carbon atom by a nucleophile (12Rye C.S. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Glycosidases with retaining mechanisms generally employ an enzyme-associated nucleophile, usually a Glu or Asp carboxylate side chain, resulting in the transient formation of an enzyme-linked intermediate that is subsequently cleaved by an incoming general base-activated water molecule to result in a released glycone that retains the configuration of the original glycosidic linkage. In contrast, glycosidases with inverting mechanisms employ the direct nucleophilic attack by a general base-activated water molecule to result in inversion of configuration of the released glycone. Both mechanisms require the formation of a transition state carrying a considerable positive charge delocalized between the anomeric center (C-1) and the ring oxygen (O-5) (12Rye C.S. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 13Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem.

The resulting partial double bond character of the C-1–O-5 bond requires co-planarity of C-5, O-5, C-1, and C-2 at or near the transition state. Among the potential pseudorotational conformational itineraries for sugar pyranose ring interconversions, there are four potential conformations where the planarity of C-5, O-5, C-1, and C-2 is satisfied (Fig. 1, 2,5B, B2,5, 4H3, and 3H4) (14Davies G.J. Ducros V.M. Varrot A. Zechel D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data have suggested that three of these potential transition state conformations (2,5B, B2,5, and 4H3) are employed among the known GH families (14Davies G.J. Ducros V.M. Varrot A. Zechel D.L.

Two classes of α-mannosidase co-complexes have been characterized by x-ray diffraction. Putative enzyme-glycan product co-complexes have been isolated for both ER and Golgi family 47 hydrolases, revealing the structural basis for branch specificity by these enzymes (19Tempel W.

In addition, co-complexes between ER-ManI and the inhibitors, kifunensine and 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMNJ), have revealed several unprecedented aspects of glycone binding and hydrolysis by this family of enzymes (20Vallee F.

Both inhibitors were found to bind in the –1 subsite at the core of the enzyme (αα)7 barrel catalytic domain (Fig. 2) in the equivalent of an unusual high free energy 1C4 conformation facilitated both by a direct coordination of the inhibitor O-2′ and O-3′ hydroxyls with an enzyme-associated Ca2+ ion and by a matrix of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. A novel inverting glycosidase mechanism was proposed where the water nucleophile was one of the ligands directly coordinated with the enzyme-bound Ca2+ ion, and the catalytic acid was proposed to act indirectly in a through-water protonation of the glycosidic oxygen (20Vallee F.

The unusual nature of this proposed mechanism precluded an unambiguous identification of the catalytic acid and base residues. We describe here the kinetics and binding characteristics of potential catalytic mutants as well as a co-complex of ERManI with a nonhydrolyzable thiodisaccharide pseudosubstrate. These data demonstrate the roles of various active site residues as well as the novel conformational itinerary during glycoside bond hydrolysis.

ERManI was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-human ERManI antibody generated to the recombinant wild type enzyme, and the antibody was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Mutant enzymes were expressed in 1-liter shake flask cultures by induction in BMMY media, and the enzyme was purified from the conditioned media as previously described (20Vallee F. Karaveg K.

Man9GlcNAc2-PA and Glycopeptide Preparation—Crude soybean agglutinin was extracted from soy flour by acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation (27Evers D.L. Hung R.L. Thomas V.H. Rice K.G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and was subsequently denatured, reduced, and carboxyamidomethylated in 8 m guanidine HCl containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and 100 mm iodoacetamide (28Rice K.G. Rao N.B. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) prior to proceeding to elastase digestion (29Deras I.L. Sano M. Kato I. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The Man9GlcNAc2-glycopeptide was recovered by affinity chromatography using concanavalin A-Sepharose and further purified by HPLC on a Cosmosil C18 column (30Deras I.L. Kawasaki N. Lee Y.C. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 306: 469-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) for SPR studies. For enzyme assays, Man9GlcNAc2 was liberated from the peptide by peptide:N-glycosidase F digestion (31Sutton C.W. O'Neill J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 64: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar) and derivatized with pyridylamine (32Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—The purified wild type and mutant enzymes were assayed for α1,2-mannosidase activity using pyridylamine-tagged Man9GlcNAc2 (Man9GlcNAc2-PA) as substrate (32Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The enzyme reactions (20 μl) were carried out in 96-well plates by adding 10 μl of enzyme in 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 to a mixture of 5 μl of 4× universal buffer (80 mm succinic acid, 80 mm MES, 80 mm HEPBS, 80 mm HEPES, and 80 mm CHES adjusted to pH with 5 m NaOH) and 5 μl of substrate. The reactions were performed at 37 °C for the indicated times and stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) to the reaction mixture. The enzymatic products were resolved and quantitated using a Hypersil APS-2 NH2-HPLC column (32Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Initial rates (v) for the enzymes were determined at various substrate concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 μm. The catalytic coefficient (kcat) and Michaelis constant (Km) values were determined by fitting initial rates to a Michaelis-Menten function by nonlinear regression analysis using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA)). kcat/Km values were derived from reciprocal plots of v and [S] where needed. pH Rate Dependence Analysis—Values for kcat and Km were determined from initial rates of enzyme reactions in the pH range from 4 to 10 using the 1× universal buffer described above. Plots of log(kcat/Km) versus pH were used to estimate values of the macroscopic enzyme ionization constants (pKE1 and pKE2) by linear extrapolation of the acidic and basic limbs of the curve (Fig. 3). Binding Studies by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—SPR analyses were conducted using a Biacore 3000 apparatus (Biacore AB, Piscataway, NJ). Recombinant ERManI was immobilized on the SPR chip surfaces at 25 °C by the amine coupling method (34O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Peck K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The flow cells were activated by injecting a mixture of 50 mmN-hydroxysuccinimide and 200 mm 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide over the CM5 sensor chip surface for 7 min at 5 μl/min. The recombinant proteins (30 μg/ml) prepared in 10 mm sodium succinic acid (pH 6.0) were passed through a 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore Corp.) and diluted in the same buffer to obtain a concentration of 5 μg/ml prior to injection onto the activated surface. The desired immobilization level was achieved by specific contact time. The remaining reactive groups were blocked by injection of 1 m ethanolamine-HCl at pH 8.5 for 7 min at 5 μl/min. The immobilization efficiency for ERManI was about 2500 RU/min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in HPB-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.01% polysorbate P20) at 25 °C. Mock derivatized flow cells served as reference surfaces. The binding analyses were performed at 10 °C with a continuous flow (30 μl/min) of running buffer (10 mm MES, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2). Analytes were prepared in running buffer by 2-fold serial dilution to obtain an appropriate concentration range. A concentration series of Man9GlcNAc2-glycopeptide (0.4–400 μm) was analyzed over a low density immobilization surface of recombinant protein (3000 RU), whereas disaccharides (16–1000 μm) and dMNJ (2–1000 μm) were analyzed over a high density immobilization surface of recombinant protein (10,000 RU). Samples were injected for 1 min followed by at least 3 min of dissociation phase. The base line returned to the original response level in 5 min for all analytes described here without a further regeneration of the chip surface. SPR data for each concentration of analyte were collected in duplicate and globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding algorithm model to calculate the on-rate (ka), the off-rate (kd), and the equilibrium dissociation constant (kd/ka = KD) using Biaevaluation version 3.1 software (35Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the maximal equilibrium sensorgram values were used to plot a saturation binding curve and calculate values for the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) directly. Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction—In an effort to obtain higher resolution crystal structure data than was previously obtained for human ERManI (20Vallee F. Karaveg K. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41287-41298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a sparse matrix screen (36Jancarik J. Kim S-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) was performed with the Crystal Screen HT™ from Hampton Research, carried out using an Oryx 6 crystallization robot (Douglas Instruments) in Nunc HLA plates. The crystallization drop was prepared by mixing equal volumes (0.5 μl) of the protein and the screening solutions (final protein concentration 10 mg/ml) and sealed with paraffin oil (15 μl). The plate was then overlaid with a mixture of silicone and paraffin oils (30:70) (37Chayen N.E. Shaw Stewart P.D. Maeder D.L. Blow D.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 297-302Crossref Google Scholar, 38D'Arcy A. Elmore C. Stihle M. Johnston J.E. J. Cryst. Growth. 1996; 168: 175-180Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and kept at 18 °C. Crystal formation was monitored after 3 days. Additive screening was carried out by mixing equal volumes (0.5 μl) of the protein solution, the optimized crystallization solution (24% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, and 50 mm ammonium sulfate), and 3× additive screen components (Hampton Research, catalog number HR2-428). The addition of 1,4-butanediol was found to produce the best crystals and improved diffraction to beyond 1.35 Å for the native enzyme (data not shown). Since we had a limited supply of the thiodisaccharide substrate analogue, direct co-crystallization was attempted using the above conditions without further optimization. For co-crystallization, the thiodisaccharide (100 mm in H2O) was added to the protein solution to yield 10 mg/ml recombinant protein, 20 mm MES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 750 mm NDSB 201, and 50 mm thiodisaccharide and incubated for 2 h at room temperature prior to crystallization. A hanging drop was prepared over 1 ml of mother liquor containing 24% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, 50 mm ammonium sulfate, and 10% (v/v) 1,4-butanediol. The crystallization drop contained 1.5 μl of protein/ligand solution and 1 μl of mother liquor. Crystals formed within 4 h at 25 °C and were mounted and flash-frozen 1 day later using 10% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Although the single co-crystals grown by this method were considerably smaller in size than that of the native crystals, one of the crystals produced diffraction data that could be scaled to 1.41 Å with good statistics and completeness (Table III).Table IIIData collection and refinement statisticsParameterValueaValues in parentheses refer to data from the high resolution shell.Data resolution (Å)48.80 to 1.41 (1.45 to 1.41)Unique observed reflections84,600 (8,225)Completeness (%)95.4 (92.6)〈I〉/〈(σI)〉41.8 (13.0)Average redundancy4.0 (3.5)Space groupP1Unit cell lengths a, b, c (Å)50.7, 53.9, 56.2Unit cell angles α, β, γ (degrees)89.5, 63.6, 62.6Matthews coefficient (Å3·Da-1)2.4Solvent content (%, v/w)47Mosaicity (degrees)0.1-0.3No. of unique reflections used in refinement76,092 (5,417)No. of reflection in free set8,507 (631)Rcryst (%)14.4 (15.8)Rfree (%)16.2 (19.3)No. of nonhydrogen atoms refined4,097Root mean square deviation (Å) bonds0.014Root mean square deviation (degrees) angles1.34Mean temperature factor (Å2)8.4Wilson temperature factor (Å2)9.3a Values in parentheses refer to data from the high resolution shell.

Presenilin 1 (PS1) is known to be essential for the stability, interaction, and trafficking of the other PS1/γ-secretase components. However, the precise functions of the other components remain elusive. Here, we investigated the functions of Nct within the PS1/γ-secretase complex. We demonstrated that the loss of Nct expression in the embryonic fibroblast cells (Nct KO cells) results in dramatically decreased levels of APH-1, PEN-2, and PS1 fragments accompanied by a significant accumulation of full-length PS1. In the absence of Nct, PEN-2 and full-length PS1 are subjected to proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas the degradation of APH-1 is mediated by both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Unlike the case of wild type cells in which the γ-secretase complex mainly locates in the trans-Golgi network, the majority of residual PEN-2, APH-1, and the uncleaved full-length PS1 in Nct KO cells reside in the endoplasmic reticulum, which remain associated with each other in the absence of Nct. Interestingly, significant amounts of full-length PS1 and PEN-2, but not APH-1, are detected on the plasma membrane in Nct KO cells, suggesting the Nct-independent cell surface delivery of the PEN-2·PS1. Finally, the diminished PEN-2 protein level in Nct-deficient cells can be partially restored by overexpression of exogenous PS1, APH-1, or PEN-2 individually or collectively, indicating a dispensable role for Nct in controlling PEN-2 level. Taken together, our study demonstrates a critical role of Nct in the stability and proper intracellular trafficking of other components of the PS1/ γ-secretase complex but not in maintaining the association of PEN-2, APH-1, and full-length PS1. γ-Secretase, which is responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of Alzheimer β-amyloid precursor protein and the signaling receptor Notch, is a multiprotein complex consisting of at least four components: presenilin (PS); nicastrin (Nct); APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective-1); and presenilin enhancer-2 (PEN-2).

These results suggest that, in addition to its critical role in the γ-secretase activity, PS1 may regulate intracellular trafficking/maturation of other γ-secretase components as well as the substrate APP (33Cai D.

In fact, immature Nct remains stable when other components are disrupted (12Prokop S. Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol.

Given the fact that Nct forms a subcomplex with APH-1 independent of PS1 and PEN-2 (14Morais V.A. Crystal A.S. Pijak D.S. Carlin D. Costa J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol.

Since earlier published studies on the function of Nct within the γ-secretase complex utilized the RNAi approach, which allows the residual Nct molecules to still exert their functions, the data as obtained require further validation using cells completely lacking Nct expression. For example, fibroblast cells isolated from two independently generated Nct KO mouse strains (36Li J. Fici G.J. Mao C.A. Myers R.L. Shuang R. Donoho G.P. Pauley A.M. Himes C.S. Qin W. Kola I.

An equal amount of total proteins from various cell lysates was loaded on the same gel for SDS-PAGE/Western blot. After exposure, the film was scanned as grayscale with a resolution of 300 pixels/inch. Protein bands of interest on the image were measured for the mean gray value after subtracting background using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). Three independent samples were measured for each protein. After normalizing to the wild type control, protein expression levels in various cell systems were statistically compared using Student's t test.Pharmacological Treatment and RNA Interference—In the presence of 500 μm cycloheximide (CHX), Nct KO cells were treated with lactacystin (2.5, 10, and 20 μm) or imipramine (10, 40, and 80 μm) to inhibit the proteasomal or lysosomal activity, respectively. Alternatively, both Nct WT and Nct KO cells were treated with 100 μm CHX for different time periods (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 h). After incubation, cells were harvested and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate supplemented with protease inhibitors). Equal amounts of proteins then were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Down-regulation of PEN-2 levels in both Nct WT and Nct KO cells using siRNA was described by Luo et al. (8Luo W.J.

Cell lysate was prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After affinity precipitation with streptavidin beads (Pierce), the biotinylated proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) and loaded directly on gels for electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis with antibodies specific to APH-1, PEN-2, and PS1.Deconvolution Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized as previously published (42Lin P.

P-TEFb activity has been shown to be negatively regulated by association with the small nuclear RNA 7SK and the HEXIM1 protein. Here, we characterize HEXIM2, a previously predicted protein with sequence similarity to HEXIM1. HEXIM2 is expressed in HeLa and Jurkat cells, and glycerol gradient analysis and immunoprecipitations indicate that HEXIM2, like HEXIM1, has a regulated association with P-TEFb. As HEXIM1 is knocked down, HEXIM2 functionally compensates for its association with P-TEFb. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vitro kinase assays demonstrate that HEXIM2 forms complexes containing 7SK and P-TEFb and, in conjunction with 7SK, inhibits P-TEFb kinase activity. Our results provide strong evidence that HEXIM2 is a regulator of P-TEFb function. Furthermore, our results support the idea that the utilization of HEXIM1 or HEXIM2 to bind and inhibit P-TEFb can be differentially regulated in vivo.

The dissociation of P-TEFb from 7SK and HEXIM1 is rapid and reversible. Treatment of cells with UV irradiation, actinomycin D, or DRB results in the dissociation of large P-TEFb complexes, and when cells are allowed to recover from DRB treatment, large P-TEFb complexes reform (18Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Physiological signals leading to cardiac hypertrophy converge on the activation of P-TEFb, through dissociation of 7SK, resulting in increased transcription and, ultimately, increased cell size (33Sano M.

A gene encoding a predicted HEXIM1 paralog, HEXIM2, is located less than 10,000 bp downstream of the HEXIM1 gene on chromosome 17 (23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F.

Whereas HEXIM1 has been shown to be involved in controlling P-TEFb, no studies on the role of HEXIM2 in this process have been described. The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether HEXIM2 is expressed and determine whether it plays a functional role in controlling P-TEFb. Cloning of HEXIM Proteins—The HEXIM2 coding sequence present in the IMAGE cDNA clone 4559410 (Invitrogen) was amplified with Easy A DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using primers containing a NheI site (5′-GCTAGCATGATGGCCACTCCGAACCA-3′) and a XhoI site (5′-CTCGAGGGTACCCGGCTCCTCATCAC-3′) and cloned into pET21a (Novagen) in-frame with the His6 tag, utilizing the NheI and XhoI sties. Site-directed mutagenesis of pET21a-HEXIM2 of Thr143 to Ala or Asp was carried out with Pfu Ultra HF DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using the primers 5′-GCCCCCTACAACGCCACCCAGTTCCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAACTGGTGGCGTTGTAGGGGGC-3′ or 5′-CCGTGGCCCCCTACAACGATACCCAGTTCCTGATGAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTCAGGAACTGGGTATCGTTGTAGGGGGCCACGG-3′, respectively. Thr205 in HEXIM1 was also mutated to Ala with 5′-GCGCCCTATAACGCCACGCAGTTCCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGGAACTGCGTGGCGTTATAGGGCGC-3′. Expression and Purification of HEXIM Proteins—His-tagged wild type, T205A, and T205D HEXIM1 and wild type, T143A, and T143D HEXIM2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and growth overnight at 18 °C. The cell lysates were prepared as previously described (25Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H. Lania L. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2608-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and the salt was brought up to 750 mm NaCl, followed by incubation with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h. The unbound material was allowed to flow through the column, and the resin was washed with 10 volumes of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% of a saturated PMSF isopropanol solution, 10 mm imidazole, and 10 volumes of Buffer B (10 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% of a saturated PMSF isopropanol solution, and 10 mm imidazole). The column was eluted with Buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole. HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 proteins were further purified by loading onto a 1-ml Mono Q column and eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 600 HGKEDP. Generation and Affinity Purification of HEXIM2 Antibodies—Recombinant histidine-tagged HEXIM2 was injected into a sheep to produce antibodies (Elmira Biologicals). 10 ml of the crude antisera was incubated at 54 °C for 20 min and then passed over 5 mg of recombinant HEXIM2 covalently attached to 1 ml of Actigel ADL resin (Sterogene). After washing with 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, ∼3 mg of affinity-purified HEXIM2 antibody was eluted with 2 ml of 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5) and then neutralized with 1 m Tris base. The antibody was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Quantitative Western Blotting—Samples were resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The antibodies used in Western blotting were goat anti-cyclin T1 (T-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Cdk9 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), affinity-purified sheep anti-HEXIM2, and affinity-purified sheep anti-HEXIM1 or HEXIM1 antisera as indicated. Following incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma), the blot was treated with Super Signal Dura West (Pierce). The Western blots were imaged with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (UVP) and quantitated with Lab Works 4.0, and curve fitting and calculations were carried out with Table Curve (Jandel Scientific). Immunoprecipitations—HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-Cdk9 (37Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin and streptomycin, and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin under standard conditions (37 °C in 5% CO2). The cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in Buffer A (10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% of a saturated PMSF isopropanol solution, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The lysates were fractionated on a 12-ml, 5–45% glycerol gradient in Buffer A in a SW-41Ti rotor for 16 h at 40,000 rpm. Glycerol gradient fraction 7 (of 10 fractions) was brought up to 100 mm NaCl and incubated with M2-FLAG Redi-view-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 10 volumes of Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 prior to suspension in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Knockdown of HEXIM1 using siRNA—HEXIM1 annealed siRNA was purchased from Ambion (5′-GGAUCCGAGCCGAGAUGUU-3′). HeLaS3 cells, at 50% confluence in a T-75 flask, were transfected with 2 nmol of HEXIM1 siRNA using 90 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Control cells were treated with Lipofectamine 2000 alone. After 8 h, the medium containing the transfection reagent and siRNA was removed, and the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum under standard conditions for 36, 48, or 60 h. Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm prior to fractionation on 5-ml, 5–45% glycerol gradients in Buffer A with 150 mm NaCl run at 45,000 rpm for 16 h in a SW-Ti55 rotor. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—12-μl reactions were carried out in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 15% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 300 ng of poly(I) poly(C) (Amersham Biosciences) and included 500 pg of radiolabeled 7SK RNA and recombinant P-TEFb composed of Cdk9 and cyclin T2a, unless otherwise noted to contain cyclin T1 and recombinant HEXIM1 or HEXIM2 as indicated. 7SK and poly(I) poly(C) were heated for 5 min at 75 °C and cooled on ice for another 5 min prior to addition. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and resolved on a 3.5% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio) gel in 0.5× Tris/glycine at 4 °C for 1.5 h at 6 watts. The dried gel was subjected to autoradiography. Kinase Assay—20-μl kinase reactions containing recombinant purified P-TEFb (Cdk9/cyclin T2a) with Drosophila RNA polymerase II as the substrate were carried out in 34 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 7 mm MgCl2, 30 μm ATP, 1.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin per reaction and the indicated amounts of wild type or mutant HEXIM1 or HEXIM2 proteins. T7-transcribed 7SK RNA was added last to the pre-incubation after it was heated for 5 min at 75 °C and then cooled on ice for another 5 min. All reactions were incubated for 10 min at 23 °C prior to the addition of ATP. The kinase reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C and then stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Reactions were resolved by 9% SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was subjected to autoradiography and quantified with a Packard Instant Imager. Purification of P-TEFb—Baculoviruses expressing human Cdk9 and cyclin T1 were generated using the BaculoDirect Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cdk9 was tagged with six histidines at its carboxyl terminus, and cyclin T1 was untagged. Sf9 cells were maintained suspended in Sf-900 II SFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at concentrations between 5 × 105 and 2 × 106 cells/ml. 1 ml of a third amplification stock of each virus was added to 100 ml of cells (at 1 × 106 cells/ml) in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, and the cells were shaken at 140 rpm at 28 °C for 72 h. Cells were spun down at 1000 × g, and the cell pellet was sonicated (three 10-s bursts) in 1 ml of Buffer L (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton, 0.1% of a saturated PMSF isopropanol solution, 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 10 μg/ml E-64 protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). The cell lysate was spun for 15 min at 192,000 × gav in a Beckman table top centrifuge. The supernatant was then incubated with 0.1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for 45 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed once with 1 ml of Buffer L, followed by a wash with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.1% of a saturated PMSF isopropanol solution, and 40 mm imidazole and with 1 ml of 100 mm HGKEP. P-TEFb was eluted with 0.25 ml of 100 mm HGKEP with 300 mm imidazole and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column. P-TEFb was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 m HGKEDP. Sequence analysis reveals that HEXIM proteins are highly conserved throughout vertebrates. Mammals encode two HEXIM proteins, and in genomes that have been mapped, HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 are located close to each other on the same chromosome. The HEXIM2 gene contains 3 introns, whereas the HEXIM1 gene is unusual in that it does not have any introns. It is possible that HEXIM1 arose in mammals from the insertion of a cDNA copy of HEXIM2 into genomic DNA. Other vertebrates, such as Xenopus laevis, Danio rio, Fugu rubripes, and Gallus gallus, contain only one HEXIM protein, and comprehensive sequence comparison shows similarity with both HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 (supplemental Fig. 1S). All HEXIM proteins exhibit conserved domains that include a positively charged RNA binding domain (25Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H.

Biol. 2004; 24: 5094-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a nuclear localization signal (32Ouchida R. Kusuhara M. Shimizu N. Hisada T. Makino Y. Morimoto C. Handa H. Ohsuzu F. Tanaka H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the PYNT domain involved in P-TEFb binding (25Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H. Lania L. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2608-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and a potential leucine zipper at the carboxyl terminus that could allow dimerization of the protein through a coiled-coil interaction. Relative Expression of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 in Vivo—To examine the function of HEXIM2, recombinant proteins and an affinity-purified anti-HEXIM2 antibody were generated. Histidine-tagged HEXIM2 was expressed in E. coli DE3 cells and purified using nickel resin and ion exchange chromatography. HEXIM2 has a predicted molecular mass of 32 kDa but has an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa (Fig. 1A). A similar altered mobility was found for HEXIM1, which has a predicted molecular mass of 41 kDa but an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa (32Ouchida R. Kusuhara M. Shimizu N. Hisada T. Makino Y. Morimoto C. Handa H. Ohsuzu F. Tanaka H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The PYNT domain of HEXIM1 (amino acids 202–205) has been found to be necessary for high affinity binding of P-TEFb to a HEXIM1 ·7SK complex (25Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H. Lania L. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2608-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To determine whether this domain has a similar function in HEXIM2, mutants with Thr143 in the PYNT domain changed to Ala (T143A) or Asp (T143D) were produced (Fig. 1A). They also displayed altered mobilities on SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 46 kDa, respectively, compared with their predicted molecular mass of 32 kDa (Fig. 1A). To examine the relative expression of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 in vivo, quantitative Western blotting of HeLa and Jurkat whole cell lysates was performed. The signals for HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 obtained with increasing amounts of HeLa and Jurkat whole cell lysates were compared with the signals from a range of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 recombinant proteins from 0.3 to 10 ng. The signals from equal amounts of recombinant HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 were similar under the conditions used (Fig. 1, B and C). However, the signals from whole cell lysates indicated that HEXIM1 is more highly expressed in HeLa and Jurkat cells than HEXIM2 (Fig. 1, B and C). The amount of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 at each concentration of cell extract was calculated from standard curves obtained with the recombinant proteins. HEXIM2 was calculated to account for 10% of the HEXIM protein in both cell lines. HEXIM2 Is in the Large Form of P-TEFb—To further characterize HEXIM2, glycerol gradient sedimentation analyses of Jurkat cell lysates were carried out. HEXIM1 has been shown to sediment in two peaks on a glycerol gradient, with a small, free form near the top of the gradient and a larger form associated with P-TEFb (23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with inhibitors of transcription elongation causes a dissociation of the large P-TEFb complex, shifting all HEXIM1 to the free form (23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells, with or without a 1-h treatment with 50 μm DRB, were lysed to extract all P-TEFb complexes from the cell (18Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and subjected to glycerol gradient sedimentation. Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for cyclin T1, HEXIM1, HEXIM2, and Cdk9. In control cells, both cyclin T1 and Cdk9 were found predominately in large complexes in fractions 8–11, with the remainder as free P-TEFb in fractions 4–7 (Fig. 2A). Two peaks of sedimentation were seen for HEXIM1. The free form of HEXIM1 was found in fractions 4–6, and the P-TEFb-associated form was found in fractions 8–11 (Fig. 2A). HEXIM2 exhibited a similar, but not identical, sedimentation pattern to that of HEXIM1, with a small amount co-sedimenting with Cdk9 and cyclin T1 and more of the HEXIM2 than HEXIM1 in their respective free forms (Fig. 2A). HEXIM2 that co-sedimented with large P-TEFb exhibited a higher apparent molecular mass during SDS-PAGE compared with free HEXIM2, perhaps due to phosphorylation or another modification. As has been found in studies with HeLa cells (18Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 23Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), in Jurkat cells the sedimentation of P-TEFb subunits and HEXIM1 changes in response to DRB treatment, with P-TEFb and HEXIM1 in their respective free forms (Fig. 2B). The sedimentation pattern of HEXIM2 also changed, such that most of HEXIM2 was found in its free form (fractions 3–7), and little or no HEXIM2 remained in fractions 8–11 (Fig. 2B). To determine whether HEXIM2 that co-sediments with the large P-TEFb complex is actually associated with P-TEFb, an immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged Cdk9 (37Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were lysed under conditions that extract the large form of P-TEFb from the nucleus, 2A. Michels and O. Bensaude, personal communication. and the lysate was resolved on a 5–45% 12-ml glycerol gradient. A glycerol gradient fraction containing large, inactive P-TEFb complexes was used as the starting material for M2-FLAG immunoprecipitations. The onput contained cyclin T1, HEXIM1, HEXIM2, FLAG-Cdk9, and endogenous Cdk9 (Fig. 3, lane 1). The unbound fraction contained most of the endogenous Cdk9 (Fig. 3, lane 2). About half of the cyclin T1, HEXIM1, and HEXIM2 were not pulled down, presumably because of association to the endogenous Cdk9 (Fig. 3, lane 2). Cyclin T1, HEXIM1, HEXIM2, and a small amount of endogenous Cdk9 were found bound to the M2 FLAG antibody beads in addition to FLAG-Cdk9 (Fig. 3, lane 3), indicating that HEXIM2, like HEXIM1, can be found in a large P-TEFb complex. HEXIM2 Can Replace HEXIM1 in the Large P-TEFb Complex in Vivo—To examine the function of HEXIM2 in the absence of HEXIM1, siRNA was used to knockdown HEXIM1 in HeLa cells. The effectiveness of HEXIM1 knockdown was examined 36 and 60 h after transfection in cells treated with HEXIM1 siRNA. Western blotting was used to quantitate the amount of HEXIM1 relative to actin (Fig. 4A). 36 h after the transfection, HEXIM1 was knocked down to ∼10% of the level seen in control cells and was further knocked down to 5% of the level seen in control cells after 60 h (Fig. 4A). 48 h after transfection with HEXIM1 siRNA, the cells were lysed to extract all P-TEFb complexes and analyzed by glycerol gradient sedimentation. Gradient fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for cyclin T1, HEXIM1, HEXIM2, and Cd"

A genetically modified mouse model lacking muscle glycogen was used to examine whether the absence of the polysaccharide affects the ability of mice to run on a treadmill. The MGSKO mouse has the GYS1 gene, encoding the muscle isoform of glycogen synthase, disrupted so that skeletal muscle totally lacks glycogen. The morphology of the soleus and quadriceps muscles from MGSKO mice appeared normal. MGSKO-null mice, along with wild type littermates, were exercised to exhaustion. There were no significant differences in the work performed by MGSKO mice as compared with their wild type littermates. The amount of liver glycogen consumed during exercise was similar for MGSKO and wild type animals. Fasting reduced exercise endurance, and after overnight fasting, there was a trend to reduced exercise endurance for the MGSKO mice. These studies provide genetic evidence that in mice muscle glycogen is not essential for strenuous exercise and has relatively little effect on endurance.

Fasting reduced exercise endurance, and after overnight fasting, there was a trend to reduced exercise endurance for the MGSKO mice. These studies provide genetic evidence that in mice muscle glycogen is not essential for strenuous exercise and has relatively little effect on endurance. The two major repositories of glycogen, the polymeric storage form of glucose, are in the liver and skeletal muscle (1Roach P.J. Skurat A.V. Harris R.A. Cherrington A.D. Jefferson L.S. The Endocrine Pancreas and Regulation of Metabolism. Oxford University Press, New York2001Google Scholar). In humans, these carbohydrate reserves are an important determinant of endurance upon sustained exercise, and muscle glycogen has long been viewed as a critical energy source during muscular activity (2Bergstrom J. Hermansen L. Hultman E. Saltin B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1967; 71: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 3Holloszy J.O. Kohrt W.M. Hansen P.A. Front.

Depletion of muscle glycogen results in fatigue and impaired muscle performance and is a major determinant of endurance (2Bergstrom J. Hermansen L. Hultman E. Saltin B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1967; 71: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 3Holloszy J.O. Kohrt W.M. Hansen P.A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1011-D1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ivy J.L. Clin.

Physiol. 1971; 31: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Likewise, the ineffective utilization of muscle glycogen, as in patients with McArdle disease, leads to impaired exercise tolerance (6McArdle B. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1951; 10: 13-33PubMed Google Scholar). In their “glycogen shunt” hypothesis, Shulman and Rothman (7Shulman R.G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) propose that glycogenolysis is the predominant source of energy for muscle contraction with glycogen acting essentially as an intermediate for blood glucose to enter glycolysis. Increasing muscle glycogen by manipulating diet and exercise regimens, a procedure termed “carbohydrate loading” or “glycogen supercompensation” (8Bergstrom J. Hultman E. Nature. 1966; 210: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), is adopted by endurance athletes to delay the onset of fatigue (4Ivy J.L. Clin. Sports Med. 1999; 18: 469-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Sherman W.M. Costill D.L. Fink W.J. Miller J.M. Int. J.

Although the importance of adequate muscle glycogen to sustain exercise in humans has been well documented, caution is needed in extrapolating findings in rodents to humans. For instance, the amount of muscle glycogen, expressed as a fraction of body mass, is ∼10-fold lower in mice than in humans (12Kasuga M. Ogawa W. Ohara T. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1282-1284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hribal M.L. Oriente F. Accili D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E977-E981Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding values for liver glycogen are comparable (14Orho M. Bosshard N.U. Buist N.R. Gitzelmann R. Aynsley-Green A. Blumel P. Gannon M.C. Nuttall F.Q. Groop L.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, the relative role of these two glycogen storage depots may be different between the two species. The relative importance of muscle and liver glycogen stores as fuel sources for exercise has been studied extensively in rats (15Reitman J. Baldwin K.M. Holloszy J.O. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1973; 142: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Terjung R.L. Baldwin K.M. Mole P.A. Klinkerfuss G.H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J.

Physiol. 1973; 225: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Exhaustive exercise either by treadmill running or swimming resulted in a reduction of muscle glycogen by 70 or >90%, respectively (15Reitman J. Baldwin K.M. Holloszy J.O. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1973; 142: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Terjung R.L. Baldwin K.M. Mole P.A. Klinkerfuss G.H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1972; 223: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both exercise methods reduced liver glycogen >90%. Using less strenuous exercise regimens, muscle glycogen stores were depleted 40–70%, depending on muscle type, whereas liver glycogen stores were reduced ∼85% (17Baldwin K.M. Reitman J.S. Terjung R.L. Winder W.W. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although significant amounts of muscle glycogen were consumed, the authors suggest that, in contrast to humans, rats may be more dependent on liver glycogen stores for exercise (17Baldwin K.M. Reitman J.S. Terjung R.L. Winder W.W. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Several genetically modified mouse lines with altered muscle metabolism have been analyzed for exercise endurance. Mice lacking the type 1 protein phosphatase glycogen-targeting subunit, RGL (GM) (18Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C.B. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have ∼10% of wild type muscle glycogen levels and exhibit a 60% decrease in work capacity (19Aschenbach W.G. Suzuki Y. Breeden K. Prats C. Hirshman M.F. Dufresne S.D. Sakamoto K. Vilardo P.G. Steele M. Kim J.H. Jing S.L. Goodyear L.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39959-39967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Overexpression of RGL resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in skeletal muscle glycogen but had no effect on exercise tolerance (19Aschenbach W.G. Suzuki Y. Breeden K. Prats C. Hirshman M.F. Dufresne S.D. Sakamoto K. Vilardo P.G. Steele M. Kim J.H. Jing S.L. Goodyear L.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39959-39967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mice with muscle-specific disruption of the gene encoding the GLUT4 glucose transporter have normal muscle glycogen levels but are impaired in their ability to exercise (20Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, mouse models have been described in which genetic manipulation affected the oxidative capacity of muscles and physical endurance (21Mason S.D. Howlett R.A. Kim M.J. Olfert I.M. Hogan M.C. McNulty W. Hickey R.P. Wagner P.D. Kahn C.R. Giordano F.J. Johnson R.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E288Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E294Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PPARδ 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; WT, wild type; IL-6, interleukin-6. 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; WT, wild type; IL-6, interleukin-6. caused a significant switch to more oxidative muscle fibers and increased exercise endurance (22Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E294Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Conversely, disruption of the PPARδ gene led to a significant reduction in run time (22Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E294Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). In a different model, mice lacking PPARα deplete liver but not muscle glycogen more rapidly than wild type littermates when subjected to exhaustive exercise (23Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This liver glycogen depletion correlates with reduced exercise performance in the null animals (23Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Loss of muscle HIF-1α suppressed exercise-induced expression of a number of genes and caused a change to more oxidative muscle metabolism in the null animals (21Mason S.D. Howlett R.A. Kim M.J. Olfert I.M. Hogan M.C. McNulty W. Hickey R.P. Wagner P.D. Kahn C.R. Giordano F.J. Johnson R.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E288Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This metabolic modification correlated with increased exercise capacity, but repeated bouts of activity ultimately led to increased muscle damage compared with controls. Bulk synthesis and degradation of glycogen are catalyzed by glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, respectively, in concert with branching and debranching enzymes. The enzymology of glycogen metabolism is tissue-specific. For example, glycogen synthase (EC 2.4.1.11), the enzyme responsible for forming the basic α-1,4 polymeric linkages of glycogen, is encoded by the GYS2 gene in liver and the GYS1 gene in skeletal muscle and most other tissues. We recently obtained from Lexicon Genetics Incorporated a genetically modified mouse (MGSKO) in which the GYS1 gene is disrupted (24Pederson B.A. Chen H. Schroeder J.M. Shou W. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7179-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The homozygous null animals are devoid of glycogen in skeletal muscle, heart, and several other tissues (24Pederson B.A. Chen H. Schroeder J.M. Shou W. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7179-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The MGSKO mouse model provides an interesting genetic model with which to assess the role of muscle glycogen in exercise endurance. We hypothesized that MGSKO mice might be impaired in their ability to perform exhaustive exercise. In addition, the inability to synthesize glycogen in the muscle allows us to test the notion that glucose is first converted to glycogen and subsequently degraded before entering glycolysis (7Shulman R.G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mouse Background and Husbandry—MGSKO heterozygous mice were generated from the Lexicon Genetics Omnibank library of gene-trapped ES cells (24Pederson B.A. Chen H. Schroeder J.M. Shou W. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7179-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Breeders, generated by mating these heterozygotes with C57BL/6J animals, were then mated to produce the null animals (75% C57BL/6J) utilized in this study. All mice were maintained in temperature- and humidity-controlled conditions with a 12-h light,12-h dark cycle and were allowed food and water ad libitum. Animals were maintained in the Association for Assessment of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-approved animal facility at Indiana University. All procedures were approved by the Indiana University Animal Care and Use Committee. Exercise Protocol—For exercise studies, mice were trained for 4 days (3 min/day) on a treadmill (Exer6M, Columbus Instruments). On the first day, the treadmill incline was set to 5°, and the speed was set at 8 m/min and was increased by 1 m/min during the training session. For each successive training bout, the incline was increased by 5°. The initial speed was also increased to 10, 11, and 12 m/min on successive training days. For the experimental run, fed mice were run at 9:30 a.m. on a treadmill set at a 20° incline with an initial belt speed of 12 m/min. The speed was increased by 1 m/min at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min after the initiation of the exercise. For mice fasted for 6 h, food was removed at 8 a.m., and mice were exercised at 2 p.m. For 16-h overnight fasting, food was removed at 5:30 p.m., and mice were run the following morning at 9:30 a.m. A mild electrical stimulus (16–28 V) was applied to mice that stepped off of the treadmill belt. Mice were run to exhaustion, as judged by refusal of mice to remain on the treadmill belt. Work performed (J) = body weight (kg) × running speed (m/min) × running time (min) × grade × 9.8 (J/kg × m). Locomotor Activity—Ambulatory movement of mice was monitored in the X and Y (horizontal) planes in cages equipped with infrared beams (Columbus Instruments). Data presented represent the sum of double beam interruptions in both planes for the 12-h dark cycle and 10 h of the light cycle. Blood Metabolite Levels—Blood glucose and lactate were measured before and immediately after exercise from tail vein blood with a DEX glucometer (Bayer, Mishiwaka, IN) and Lactate Pro (Arkray, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), respectively. Preparation of Samples for Biochemical Analyses—Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation decapitation. Hind limb skeletal muscle and liver were rapidly excised, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Glycogen content in tissue was determined in samples of frozen tissue (∼30 mg) by measuring amyloglucosidase-released glucose from glycogen by the method of Bergmeyer et al. (25Bergmeyer H.U. Berndt E. Schmidt F. Stork H. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1974Google Scholar) as described previously by Suzuki et al. (18Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C.B. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined with the unpaired Student's t test. Microscopy—Soleus and quadriceps muscles were isolated from 10-month-old MGSKO and wild type littermates. Muscles were rapidly cut into 1-mm cubes and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 mol/liter sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, followed by post-fixation in osmium tetroxide in 0.2 mol/liter sodium cacodylate buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). The tissues were infiltrated overnight and embedded in epon-araldite. 1-micron sections were stained with periodic acid-Schiff procedure and counterstained with Richardson's solution. This results in high resolution light microscopy in which abnormal pools of glycogen are well preserved and appear purple against a blue tissue counterstain of myocyte cytoplasm. Images were collected with a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera and acquired with the Nikon Act 1 photo image capture software for the DXM1200 digital camera, version 1.12 (Nikon Inc. Instrument Group, Melville, NY). Serial sections were cut from these same blocks for electron microscopy. Epon blocks were sectioned at 7 nm, and sections were mounted onto 200-mesh copper grids. Each grid was stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate solution for 20 min followed by 0.4% lead citrate/NaOH solution for 30 s. The grids were examined in a Philips EM 300 electron microscope (Philips Manufacturing). Images were collected onto Kodak electron microscope film 4489 and printed on Kodabromide photographic paper. MGSKO Mice—The MGSKO mouse has the GYS1 gene disrupted and hence lacks glycogen synthase and glycogen in several tissues including skeletal muscle, heart, brain, kidney, and lung. The lack of cardiac glycogen appears to cause a developmental problem, and only ∼10% of the null mice survive birth (24Pederson B.A. Chen H. Schroeder J.M. Shou W. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7179-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Surviving mice, however, are ostensibly normal with hearts that are functional as judged by echocardiography and that are not grossly abnormal (24Pederson B.A. Chen H. Schroeder J.M. Shou W. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7179-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We also examined skeletal muscle by microscopy to see whether the absence of glycogen had any gross morphological consequences. Examination of soleus and quadricep muscle sections from the MGSKO mice by high resolution light microscopy did not reveal any abnormalities as compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 1). The same was true at the level of electron microscopy for the quadriceps (Fig. 1). Activity and Exercise of MGSKO Mice—From observation of MGSKO animals, there was no obvious difference in movements compared with wild type littermates. To test whether there were more subtle differences in locomotor activity, mice were monitored for an extended period in cages outfitted with infrared beams in the X and Y dimensions. Activity was gauged by the frequency with which the photobeams were interrupted (Fig. 2). Over a period of 22 h, there was no significant difference in total activity between MGSKO and wild type mice. MGSKO mice tended to be more active during the light cycle and less active during the dark cycle (Fig. 2), but the differences were small. Because of the potential importance of glycogen for sustained strenuous exercise, fed male and female mice were subjected to treadmill running until exhaustion using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures” whereby the treadmill speed was progressively increased (Fig. 3, Tables I and II). There was no significant difference in the running time (48 ± 4 min for WT versus 56 ± 6 min for MGSKO, n = 9–13) or the work performed by male mice (Fig. 3a). Female MGSKO mice ran ∼25% longer than wild type littermates (48 ± 5 min for WT versus 63 ± 4 min for MGSKO, n = 9, p = 0.041). Both female and male MGSKO mice have lower body weights (∼10% reduction for males and ∼5% reduction for females) as compared with age-matched wild type littermates. 2B. A. Pederson, M. W. Smith, and P. J. Roach, unpublished observations. When this difference in body weight is taken into account in the calculation of work performed, the difference between genotypes was not significant (Fig. 3b). Sex differences in running appear to depend strongly on the mouse strain studied (26Lightfoot J.T. Turner M.J. Daves M. Vordermark A. Kleeberger S.R. Physiol Genomics. 2004; 19: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Resting blood glucose was not significantly different between MGSKO and wild type mice (Fig. 4, a and b), and exercise caused a similar decrease in both genotypes (Fig. 4, a and b). Blood lactate during exercise reflects anaerobic glycolysis and can be a contributory factor for exercise tolerance. Basal blood lactate levels were lower in the MGSKO mice (Fig. 4, c and d) and were increased by exercise. However, the increase was much smaller in the MGSKO animals (Fig. 4, c and d). The exercise regimen decreased muscle glycogen in wild type mice from 5.6 ± 1.1 to 0.4 ± 0.1 μmol of glucose/g (n = 4, p = 0.004). Previous work in rats (16Terjung R.L. Baldwin K.M. Mole P.A. Klinkerfuss G.H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1972; 223: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Baldwin K.M. Reitman J.S. Terjung R.L. Winder W.W. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) has shown that to reach such low levels of muscle glycogen, glycogen must be depleted from red, intermediate, and white fibers. Glycogen depletion in white muscle only occurs when the workload exceeds the capacity of red and intermediate fibers (16Terjung R.L. Baldwin K.M. Mole P.A. Klinkerfuss G.H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1972; 223: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Baldwin K.M. Reitman J.S. Terjung R.L. Winder W.W. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that our treadmill protocol subjected the mice to a relatively intense exercise bout. In these fed animals, liver glycogen did not compensate for the absence of muscle glycogen in the MGSKO mice because it decreased by the same amount in both genotypes (Fig. 5).Table ITreadmill exercise of 6-h day fasted wild type and MGSKO miceMale (n = 9-13)Female (n = 11-13)Wild typeMGSKOWild typeMGSKOBasalExerciseBasalExerciseBasalExerciseBasalExerciseBody weight (g)29.0 ± 0.528.4 ± 0.427.7 ± 0.526.8 ± 0.6ap = 0.04 versus WT exercise.24.1 ± 0.623.6 ± 0.522.9 ± 0.722.4 ± 0.7Blood glucose (mg/dl)138 ± 654 ± 5bp < 0.0001 versus WT basal.156 ± 5cp = 0.043 versus WT basal.73 ± 7dp < 0.0001 versus MGSKO basal.,ep = 0.027 versus WT exercise.122 ± 465 ± 5bp < 0.0001 versus WT basal.123 ± 465 ± 6dp < 0.0001 versus MGSKO basal.Blood lactate (mm)2.2 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.3fp = 0.003 versus WT basal.1.7 ± 0.1gp = 0.034 versus WT basal.2.4 ± 0.2hp = 0.008 versus MGSKO.,ip = 0.016 versus WT exercise.2.0 ± 0.15.5 ± 0.52.0 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.3jp = 0.0048 versus MGSKO basal.,kp = 0.0005 versus WT exercise.Run Time (min)39 ± 239 ± 645 ± 538 ± 4a p = 0.04 versus WT exercise.b p < 0.0001 versus WT basal.c p = 0.043 versus WT basal.d p < 0.0001 versus MGSKO basal.e p = 0.027 versus WT exercise.f p = 0.003 versus WT basal.g p = 0.034 versus WT basal.h p = 0.008 versus MGSKO.i p = 0.016 versus WT exercise.j p = 0.0048 versus MGSKO basal.k p = 0.0005 versus WT exercise.

To deplete liver glycogen, mice were “day-fasted” for 6 h, i.e. 8 a.m.–2 p.m., to elicit a modest decrease or fasted 16 h overnight to elicit a large decrease in glycogen levels in this organ. In contrast to liver, muscle glycogen stores of the wild type mice are not affected by a 16-h overnight fast (5.6 ± 1.1 fed versus 7.4 ± 1.2 μmol of glucose/g fasted; n = 4–7). After a 6-h fast, the work performed by both wild type and MGSKO animals was decreased compared with fed animals (Fig. 3), reaching statistical significance for both male and female MGSKO mice (∼35%, p <0.05). An overnight fast reduced liver glycogen to ∼10% of the levels in fed mice (32 ± 6, WT fasted, 40 ± 9, MGSKO fasted, versus 373 ± 33, WT fed, 297 ± 29 μmol of glucose/g of tissue, MGSKO fed; n = 5–8) and correlated with a significant reduction in the exercise capacity of the animals (Fig. 3). Wild type mice performed ∼65% of the work achieved in the fed state, whereas MGSKO mice were capable of only ∼40% of their fed work performance (Fig. 3). Post-exercise blood glucose levels were lower in all fasted mice compared with fed mice, but there were no differences between genotypes (Tables I and II, Fig. 4). Overnight fasting reduced basal lactate levels in both genotypes such that there was now no difference between wild type and MGSKO animals (Table II). Lactate levels at the completion of exercise were reduced with both 6 and 16 h of fasting to a greater extent in wild type than MGSKO mice (Tables I and II). Although the prevailing view is that muscle glycogen is an important determinant for exercise capacity in humans (3Holloszy J.O. Kohrt W.M. Hansen P.A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1011-D1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ivy J.L. Clin. Sports Med. 1999; 18: 469-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), such may not be true for rodents. Studies with rats suggest that quantitatively liver glycogen may be more important than muscle glycogen for sustaining exercise (15Reitman J. Baldwin K.M. Holloszy J.O. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1973; 142: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Terjung R.L. Baldwin K.M. Mole P.A. Klinkerfuss G.H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J.

Physiol. 1973; 225: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Work with several mouse models with genetically manipulated muscle glucose metabolism has not given a definitive answer on the significance of muscle glycogen as discussed in the Introduction. However, in both rats and mice, muscle glycogen is utilized during exercise and thus contributes as a source of fuel for contraction. The MGSKO mice, which have no skeletal muscle glycogen, offer a robust genetic model with which to test the importance of muscle glycogen. In fact, these animals exhibited normal physical activity and were not significantly impaired in their performance of exhaustive exercise. Only after overnight starvation to deplete the liver glycogen pool did a trend to lesser endurance in the MGSKO animals emerge. It is possible that lack of muscle glycogen might have a greater impact on performance under other exercise conditions, such as those forcing anaerobic muscular activity, as in the case of sprinting for humans. However, arranging such an experimental protocol with mice is difficult. Because 90% of MGSKO pups die shortly after birth, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the subset of animals studied here is able to exercise normally because of the presence of some factor that allowed for their survival in the first place. Indeed, we have found evidence for adaptive responses as discussed below. However, the fact remains that normal exercise performance is maintained in the absence of muscle glycogen. It will be of interest to analyze in vitro measures of muscle function. The only other measured parameter that differed between wild type and MGSKO mice was blood lactate both before and after exercise. The reduced blood lactate in MGSKO mice is likely due to reduced anaerobic glycolysis in the absence of muscle glycogen although we cannot formally exclude increased hepatic uptake of lactate to be used as a gluconeogenic precursor by the liver. Glucose equivalents normally provided by muscle glycogen could have been replaced by the breakdown of liver glycogen in MGSKO animals, simply based on considerations of major energy deposits in the body. However, there is also the possibility that impaired muscle glycogen metabolism affects liver deposits indirectly via interleukin-6 (IL-6). It has been reported that exercise causes muscle to increase secretion of IL-6, which in turn signals to the liver to increase glycogen breakdown (27Pedersen B.K. Steensberg A. Fischer C. Keller C. Keller P. Plomgaard P. Febbraio M. Saltin B. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 2003; 24: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 28Febbraio M.A. Hiscock N. Sacchetti M. Fischer C.P. Pedersen B.K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-6 production by the muscle is increased as glycogen is depleted (29Gleeson M. Bishop N.C. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 554-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Steensberg A. Febbraio M.A. Osada T. Schjerling P. van Hall G. Saltin B. Pedersen B.K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 633-639Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We therefore examined IL-6 levels in MGSKO mice and found no significant effects of the loss of muscle glycogen on either basal or exercise-induced serum IL-6 levels. 3B. A. Pederson, M. W. Smith, C. R. Cope, J. M. Schroeder, and P. J. Roach, unpublished results. In fact liver glycogen usage during exercise was the same in wild type and MGSKO mice, indicating that the short-fall in energy due to the lack of muscle glycogen must come from an alternative source. Possibilities are increased oxidation of glucose (correlating with lowered blood lactate) from liver glycogen or the oxidation of fatty acids. Elevated ATPase and increased phosphorylation of AMP kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in skeletal muscle from MGSKO animals is consistent with this latter hypothesis. 4G. E. Parker, B. A. Pederson, and P. J. Roach, unpublished observations. Another mouse model with increased oxidative capacity, PPARδ-overexpressing animals, has increased exercise performance compared with wild type littermates. This suggests that a switch to more oxidative metabolism has the potential to overcome the loss of muscle glycogen as a fuel in MGSKO mice. The observation that MGSKO animals are using glucose provided by liver glycogen to fuel exercise also argues against the necessity of glucose being converted to glycogen in muscle prior to entering glycolysis as proposed by Shulman and Rothman (7Shulman R.G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Making the assumption that 30% (31Tamashiro K.L. Wakayama T. Akutsu H. Yamazaki Y. Lachey J.L. Wortman M.D. Seeley R.J. D'Alessio D.A. Woods S.C. Yanagimachi R. Sakai R.R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) of the body weight of a mouse is muscle and knowing the weight of the liver, one can estimate the amount of glycogen used during the exhaustive exercise bout. Wild type mice used ∼350 μmol of glucose equivalents, 70 μmol from muscle and 280 μmol from liver glycogen, whereas MGSKO mice utilized ∼250 μmol of glucose equivalents from liver. In a fed normal mouse weighing ∼30 g, total glucose equivalents of glycogen are 50–80 μmol and 400–500 μmol in muscle and liver, respectively. Therefore, in mice there is 5–10-fold more glycogen in the liver of a fed animal than in skeletal muscle. A similar ratio of liver to muscle glycogen has been reported in rats (17Baldwin K.M. Reitman J.S. Terjung R.L. Winder W.W. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, humans store 3–8-fold more glycogen in skeletal muscle than in liver (4Ivy J.L. Clin. Sports Med. 1999; 18: 469-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There is, therefore, a fundamental difference in the distribution of glycogen in mice and rats versus humans, a fact that may help explain why the manipulation of muscle glycogen had little impact on the ability of mice to exercise, whereas in humans the importance of glycogen is well established as, for example, by McArdle patients. The incremental reduction of liver glycogen with increasing time of fasting correlated with a decreased ability to perform work. This effect was greatest in MGSKO mice, and after a 16-h fast there was a strong trend (p = 0.057) for null mice to perform less work than wild type littermates. Thus, liver, rather than muscle, glycogen content at the onset of exercise may be a better determinant of the exercise capacity of mice. Muoio et al. (23Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) also noted that when mice were run to exhaustion on a treadmill under low intensity exercise conditions, fatigue correlated with liver rather than muscle glycogen depletion. Consistent with this observation, the rate of liver glycogen depletion in PPARα-null mice was increased as compared with wild type littermates and correlated with earlier fatigue upon exhaustive treadmill exercise (23Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the suggestion by Reitman et al. (15Reitman J. Baldwin K.M. Holloszy J.O. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1973; 142: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that liver glycogen may be more important than muscle glycogen for exercise in rats. In conclusion, the MGSKO mouse provides genetic evidence that there is no obligate requirement of glycogen for even quite demanding muscular activity in mice. Furthermore, in mice the synthesis of muscle glycogen is not a necessary step for glucose to enter glycolysis. Only under conditions where liver glycogen is low may lack of muscle glycogen possibly become limiting for exercise capacity.

However, no studies have addressed the microdomains in which such interaction takes place nor the effect of gangliosides and tetraspanins (TSPs) on such interaction. Growth of human embryonal WI38 fibroblasts is highly dependent on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its receptor (FGFR), stably associated with ganglioside GM3 and TSPs CD9 and CD81 in the ganglioside-enriched microdomain.

Types and intensity of signaling during the time course differed significantly depending on the type of integrin stimulated (α3β1 versus α5β1), and on cell type (WI38 versus VA13). Such effect of cross-talk between integrins and FGFR was influenced strongly by the change of GM3 and TSPs. (i) GM3 depletion by P4 caused enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR and Akt followed by MAPK activation, without significant change of ceramide level. GM3 depletion also caused enhanced co-immunoprecipitation of FGFR with α3/α5/β1 and of these integrins with CD9/CD81. (ii) LN5- or FN-dependent proliferation of both WI38 and VA13 was strongly enhanced by GM3 depletion and by CD9/CD81 knockdown by siRNA.

Petersen O.W. Larabell C.A. Dedhar S. Briand P. Lupu R. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the possible effect on such cross-talk of gangliosides, TSPs, or other membrane components in microdomains has not yet been studied. We previously observed that the GEM fraction of WI38 cells prepared in 1% Brij 98 contains stably associated FGFR and high levels of TSPs CD9 and CD81, in addition to c-Src, Csk (C-terminal Src kinase), and Lyn (19Toledo M.S. Suzuki E. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34655-34664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similar GEM components were found in VA13, although their proportions differed greatly; i.e. the VA13 GEM fraction contained much higher (4–5-fold) levels of FGFR and c-Src, a much lower level of TSP (only 15–20%) than WI38 GEM, and an undetectable level of Csk. In the present study we found integrins α3β1 and α5β1 in WI38 and VA13 GEM prepared in 1% Brij 98, in addition to the above components. We also found a striking functional interaction between integrins and FGFR and studied the effects of ganglioside GM3, TSPs CD9/CD81, and receptor N-glycosylation on such interaction. Applying P4 (to deplete GM3), RNA interference (to knock down CD9/CD81), and N-glycosylation processing inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ), we found that GM3 and/or CD9/CD81 strongly affect the functional interaction between integrins and FGFR and, consequently, affect FGF-independent proliferation in both WI38 and VA13 cells. GM3, associated with CD9/CD81 or with FGFR, may inhibit integrin-induced signaling through Akt, c-Src, and MAPK to activate FGFR. The exact mechanism of this signaling pathway remains to be studied, but ceramide may not be involved, since GM3 depletion by P4 does not significantly change ceramide level.

Trypsin activity in plates and in cell suspension was inhibited by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen) at 100 μg/ml in PBS. Plates were washed twice with PBS, blocked with serum-free MEM containing 1% heat-inactivated (10 min at 60 °C) BSA (MEM-BSA), stored at 4 °C, and used within 2 days. FN—5 μg/ml FN in PBS was coated in bacterial plates (Fisher) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS, blocked with MEM-BSA, stored at 4 °C, and used within 2 days. Poly-l-lysine—0.1% poly-l-lysine in PBS was coated in bacterial plates (Fisher) for 5 min at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBS, blocked with MEM-BSA, stored at 4 °C, and used within 2 days. Cells were grown in culture medium to ∼95% confluence, washed with and starved overnight in serum-free MEM, and harvested with trypsin/EDTA. Trypsin activity was inhibited with soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 μg/ml). Cells were centrifuged and suspended in serum-free MEM at 5 × 105 cells/ml. To decrease basal phosphorylation of signaling molecules, cells were rotated for 1 h at 37 °C.A portion of this cell suspension was used as control cells without adhesion. The rest of the cells were added (2 ml suspension; 4 × 104 cells/cm2) on 6-cm plates precoated with LN5, FN, or poly-l-lysine as described above and incubated for various durations at 37 °C, to study the changes induced in FGFR activation and other signal transduction. Cells were harvested by rubber scraper in ice-cold PBS containing sodium vanadate, centrifuged, and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO4,50mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 75 units/ml aprotinin). Lysate was collected after centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. After protein quantification, ∼30 μg of protein was loaded per well, and the degree of phosphorylation of standard signaling molecules was analyzed by Western blot using anti-P-FGFR, anti-P-Src, anti-P-Akt, and anti-P-MAPK antibodies. LN5-, FN-, and poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates were prepared as described above. WI38 and VA13 cells were treated for 72 h by incubation with 1000 nm P4 (19Toledo M.S. Suzuki E. Handa K.

Nontreated cells adhered to LN5 or FN were used as control. For negative control of CD9/CD81 siRNA transfectant, Silencer™ Negative Control #1 siRNA (Ambion; proprietary sequence) was transfected. All cells were starved overnight in serum-free MEM. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, and trypsin was neutralized by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were centrifuged, suspended in MEM-BSA (2 × 104 cells/50 μl), rotated at 37 °C for 1 h, and transferred (50 μl suspension) to the coated plates. After 30 min, 1.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added per well. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed five times with PBS, harvested with trypsin/EDTA, collected in Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged at 3000 rpm, and suspended in scintillation liquid. Incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured by scintillation counter. Four independent experiments were conducted. WI38 and VA13 (2 × 106 cells) were grown in culture medium in 150-mm plates. After 16 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced by fresh complete medium with or without 1000 nm P4, 7500 nm DMJ, or 7500 nm swainsonine for 72 h. Cells were starved in serum-free MEM overnight and processed further as described under “Activation of FGFR and Other Signal Transducers (c-Src, Akt, MAPK) following Stimulation of Integrin Receptors.” FGFR-Integrin Receptor Interaction Studied by Co-immunoprecipitation—1% Brij lysate (postnuclear fraction) (15Kawakami Y. Kawakami K. Steelant W.F.A. Ono M. Baek R.C. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34349-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was subjected to co-immunoprecipitation, using a ProFound™ Mammalian Co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 μg of antibody (anti-FGFR, anti-α3, or anti-α5) was immobilized with 100 μl of antibody-coupling gel. Lysate containing ∼1.5 mg of protein was incubated at 4 °C overnight with antibody-affixed gel, washed three times with co-immunoprecipitation buffer, and eluted four times with elution buffer (50 μl). Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Normal mouse IgG was used as control. WI38 and VA13 siRNA Transfection—WI38 and VA13 cells were cultured at a density of 9 × 105 (for 100-mm dish) or 2 × 106 (for 150-mm dish). One day later, cells were co-transfected with 20 nm siRNA each for CD9 (sense, 5′-GGAGUCUAUAUUCUGAUCG-3′; antisense, 5′-CGAUCAGAAUAUAGACUCC-3′) and CD81 (sense, 5′-GGACCAGAUCGCCAAGGAU-3′; antisense, 5′-AUCCUUGGCGAUCUGGUCC-3′), using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The gene-silencing effect was analyzed 3 days after transfection by Western blot. To decide the best sequence for CD9 knockdown, we also tested the sequence (sense, 5′-GGAUGAGGUGAUUAAGGAA-3′; antisense, 5′-UUCCUUAAUCACCUAAUCC-3′), which was less effective. The sequence for CD81 knockdown was taken from Zhang et al. (31Zhang J. Randall G. Higginbottom A. Monk P. Rice C.M. McKeating J.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1448-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The degree of expression of CD9 and CD81 in original WI38 and VA13 and in those co-transfected with siRNA was determined by Western blot with 10 μg of protein. Silencer™ Negative Control #1 siRNA (Ambion) was used as negative control, under the same conditions as for CD9 and CD81 siRNA. Cells were grown as described under “Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents.” Different groups were treated with P4 for 24, 48, or 72 h. For the 24-h treatment, subconfluent cells were cultured in serum-free MEM containing P4. For the 48-h treatment, cells were cultured in medium with serum and then in medium without serum, both containing P4 and both for 24 h. For the 72-h treatment, cells were cultured in medium with serum for 48 h and then without serum for 24 h, with both media containing P4. Within each group, subgroups were treated with 0, 100, or 1000 nm P4. All subgroups were subjected to a determination of ceramide quantity, as described in the following section. Subgroups from the 48-h- and 72-h-treated cells were subjected to determination of integrin-induced FGFR tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with antibodies to tyrosine-phosphorylated (Tyr653–Tyr654) FGFR as described above. The protein content applied in each Western blot was ∼10 μg, rather than 30 μg. This condition was required to distinguish the occurrence of FGFR activation under different P4 treatments. Cultured cells treated with P4 at various concentrations and durations (see above) were subjected to determination of relative ceramide quantity compared with nontreated cells. Cells (3 × 106) were extracted in chloroform/methanol/water (2:1:0.8, v/v/v) by vigorous agitation. Chloroform and water (1 ml each) were added, mixed, and centrifuged (3000 rpm, 5 min) to separate the upper from the lower phase (32Signorelli P. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 275-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Total phospholipids in the lower phase were determined by Scion densitometric analysis of blot from Dittmer-Lester reagent (33Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Sigma) as described previously (34Suzuki E. Handa K. Toledo M.S. Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14788-14793Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Quantity of ceramide in the lower phase was determined as ceramide-1-[32P]phosphate following 32P-phosphorylation by diacylglycerol kinase (Calbiochem), precisely following the method of Bektas et al. (35Bektas M. Jolly P.S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). C16-ceramide (Matreya) was used as control. Ceramide-1-[32P]phosphate was separated on high performance TLC developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4: 3:2:1,v/v/v/v). The relative amount of ceramide-1-[32P]phosphate from P4-treated versus nontreated cells, using aliquots with the same quantity (30 nmol) of total phospholipid, was quantified as digital light units (DLU) using a phosphorimaging device (Cyclone Storage Phosphor Screen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and expressed as the ratio of DLU value (value in nontreated cells defined as 1.0). The relative ceramide level was also determined in cells treated with the ceramidase inhibitor d-erythro-MAPP (36Bielawska A. Greenberg M.S. Perry D. Jayadev S. Shayman J.A. McKay C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) for 24 h and expressed as pmol/nmol phospholipid. WI38 or VA13 cells treated with 100 or 1000 nm P4 for 48 or 72 h were harvested. The postnuclear fraction was prepared and separated into 12 fractions by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described above. Lipids present in each fraction were adsorbed on C18 silica gel column (Varian), separated from sucrose and other water-soluble components, eluted in chloroform/methanol 2:1, separated on TLC under conditions similar to those for ceramide, and detected by primulin spray. Fluorescence intensity corresponding to standard P4 was estimated as % of total P4 applied to cells. WI38 Cell Adhesion to LN5- or FN-coated Plates Induces Activation of FGFR and Other Signal Transducers—When WI38 cells were adhered to LN5- or FN-coated plates, FGFR was activated, as indicated by its tyrosine phosphorylation (at Tyr653–Tyr654) (Fig. 1A, columns a and b, row 1). FGFR activation occurred within 10 min to 1 h. FGFR activation was not observed in cell suspension without cell adhesion (Fig. 1A, column S, row 1) or in cells adhered on poly-l-lysine-coated plates (data not shown). In close association with FGFR activation, strong c-Src activation also occurred during the early stage (10 min to 1 h) of cell adhesion to LN5 or FN (Fig. 1A, columns a and b, row 3); Akt activation after adhesion to FN also occurred at the early stage (10 min to 1 h), whereas Akt activation after adhesion to LN5 occurred at a later stage (1–24 h) (Fig. 1A, row 5). In contrast, MAPK activation (P-MAPK) occurred at the later stage (1–24 h) regardless of adhesion to FN or LN5 (Fig. 1A, columns a and b, row 7). Only minimal activation was observed upon adhesion to poly-l-lysine (data not shown). VA13 Cell Adhesion to LN5-or FN-coated Plates Induces Activation of FGFR and Other Signal Transducers—Adhesion of VA13 cells to LN5- or FN-coated plates induced activation of FGFR by tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, columns a and b, row 1) similar to that in WI38 cells. However, the pattern of associated signal transducer changes differed from that in WI38. c-Src activation occurred strongly at a later stage, i.e. 24 h after adhesion to both LN5 and FN (Fig. 1B, columns a and b, row 3). Akt activation was stronger when cells were adhered to FN than to LN5 and was higher at the early stage (10 min to 1 h) (Fig. 1B, column b, row 5). In contrast, MAPK activation was stronger when cells were adhered to LN5 than to FN and in both cases was higher at the later stage (4–24 h) (Fig. 1B, columns a and b, row 7). Quantitative Time Course Change of FGFR Phosphorylation Induced by Integrin-dependent Adhesion by WI38 or VA13 Cells on LN5 of FN—Because FGFR activation in terms of Tyr653–Tyr654 phosphorylation induced by LN5- or FN-dependent adhesion is of primary importance, the time course process was determined quantitatively as described in the legend for Fig. 1, C and D. The results indicate that FGFR activation occurred consistently at the early stage (10 min to 1 h) after cell adhesion to LN5 or FN in both WI38 and VA13 cells. Change of GM3 Level Alters Functional Interaction of Integrin with FGFR in WI38 and VA13 Cells—Ganglioside GM3 is the sole GSL present in low-density microdomain fraction of WI38 cells. ∼95% of total GM3 was depleted upon preincubation of cells with P4 (1000 nm, 72 h) (19Toledo M.S. Suzuki E. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34655-34664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Depletion of gangliosides by P4, at similar concentration and duration, had been observed previously in other types of cells (30Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A lower concentration of P4 or a shorter incubation time resulted in a lesser depletion of GM3 (see below). GM3 suppressed the process of LN5-induced FGFR activation, because depletion of GM3 by P4 significantly enhanced FGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Such differential effect on FGFR phosphorylation in the presence versus absence of GM3 was more clear in LN5-induced than in FN-induced adhesion of WI38 cells (Fig. 2A, row 1 versus 3). A similar differential effect in the presence versus absence of GM3 was observed for Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, row 5 versus 7). In contrast, in transformed VA13 cells, the presence of GM3 versus its depletion by P4 made no clear difference in the effect of integrin-induced activation on FGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, row 1 versus 3) or on Akt phosphorylation (row 5 versus 7). However, VA13 showed much higher MAPK phosphoryl"

The HEXIM1 protein, aided by the 7SK snRNA, sequesters P-TEFb into an inactive 7SK·HEXIM1·P-TEFb small nuclear ribonucleic acid particle for inhibition of transcription and, consequently, cell proliferation. Here we show that, like HEXIM1, a highly homologous protein named HEXIM2 also possesses the ability to inactivate P-TEFb to suppress transcription through a 7SK-mediated interaction with P-TEFb. Furthermore, HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 can form stable homo- and hetero-oligomers (most likely dimers), which may nucleate the formation of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleic acid particle. Despite their similar functions, HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 exhibit distinct expression patterns in various human tissues and established cell lines. In HEXIM1-knocked down cells, HEXIM2 can functionally and quantitatively compensate for the loss of HEXIM1 to maintain a constant level of the 7SK/HEXIM-bound P-TEFb. Our results demonstrate that there is a tightly regulated cellular process to maintain the balance between active and inactive P-TEFb complexes, which controls global transcription as well as cell growth and differentiation.

RNA polymerase II mediates transcription of all class II protein-coding genes in a tightly regulated process that can be divided into five stages: preinitiation, initiation, promoter clearance, elongation, and termination (1Sims R.J. II I Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). It is during the elongation phase that the positive transcriptional elongation factor b (P-TEFb) 1The abbreviations used are: P-TEFb, positive transcription elongation factor b; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CycT1, cyclin T1; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; HMBA, hexamethylene bisacetamide; NE, nuclear extract; NLS, nuclear localization signal; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleic acid particle; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: P-TEFb, positive transcription elongation factor b; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CycT1, cyclin T1; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; HMBA, hexamethylene bisacetamide; NE, nuclear extract; NLS, nuclear localization signal; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleic acid particle; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HA, hemagglutinin. phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. This event is crucial for the transition from the abortive to the productive phase of transcriptional elongation, leading to the generation of full-length RNA transcripts (for reviews, see Refs. 2Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 3Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Not only is P-TEFb essential for the expression of most protein-encoding genes (4Chao S-H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31793-31799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 5Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it is also indispensable for the replication of HIV-1. P-TEFb is a specific host cellular cofactor for the viral Tat protein, which recruits P-TEFb to the HIV-1 promoter to greatly enhance viral gene transcription (2Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar).

The kinase inactive form contains core P-TEFb in association with its inhibitors 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1 in a single 7SK snRNP, whereas the active form is 7SK/HEXIM1-free (6Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q.

Although P-TEFb is the primary binding partner and target of HEXIM1, the association of P-TEFb with HEXIM1 itself is very weak. This interaction is greatly enhanced in the presence of the non-coding 7SK snRNA (7Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol.

Chen R. Pezda A.C. Samford C.S. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5094-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Once associated with HEXIM1, P-TEFb loses it kinase activity and is unable to phosphorylate the RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain and stimulate transcriptional elongation (7Yik J.H. Chen R.

The association of 7SK/HEXIM1 with P-TEFb is a dynamic process and can be disrupted by certain stress-inducing agents, such as the global transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D, kinase/transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), DNA-damaging agent UV irradiation, as well as cardiac hypertrophic signals (6Yang Z.

A shift in the balance between active P-TEFb and the inactive, 7SK/HEXIM1-bound P-TEFb can have serious physiological consequences. For example, disruption of the 7SK ribonucleic acid particle by hypertrophic signals has been shown to activate P-TEFb in cardiac myocytes, leading to an increase in phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II that results in a global elevation of RNA and protein contents (12Sano M. Abdellatif M. Oh H. Xie M. Bagella L. Giordano A. Michael L.H. DeMayo F.J. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This chain of events eventually causes the enlargement of heart cells that leads to cardiac hypertrophy. This observation has been confirmed independently by ablation of the mouse HEXIM1 (CLP-1) gene, which leads to cardiac hypertrophy and embryonic lethality (13Huang F. Wagner M. Siddiqui M.A. Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HEXIM1 has previously been identified as a nuclear protein whose expression is rapidly induced in human smooth muscle cells as well as in many other cell types that are treated with hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) (14Ouchida R.

On the other hand, HEXIM1 has also been identified as an inhibitor of breast cell proliferation, and HEXIM1 expression is down-regulated by estrogens and decreased in breast tumors (16Wittmann B.M. Wang N. Montano M.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5151-5158PubMed Google Scholar). The observed anti-growth function of HEXIM1 in many cell types suggests that regulation of the activity of P-TEFb through changes in HEXIM1 expression or its P-TEFb-targeting capability could potentially play a key role in directing the cells toward either proliferation or differentiation. Sequence analysis has indicated that a hypothetical protein (GenBank™ accession number AK056946), hereby renamed as HEXIM2, showed a high degree of homology with HEXIM1 (10Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T.

However, the expression of the HEXIM2 protein has not been confirmed, and whether it possesses a function similar to that of HEXIM1 has yet to be established. In this study, we examined the expression patterns of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 in various human tissues and compared the inhibitory effects of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 on P-TEFb activity in order to gain insights into the physiological function of HEXIM2. Materials—HeLa and 293T cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). U373, SK-Hep-1, IMR-90, TK6, and CaCo-2 cells were a generous gift from the University of California, Berkeley tissue culture facility. Rabbit anti-CDK4, -CDK9, and -CycT1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). FLAG peptide, mouse anti-FLAG antibody, and anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody conjugated to agarose beads were obtained from Sigma. Mouse anti-tubulin antibody was from Oncogene. The generation of rabbit anti-HEXIM1 antibody was described previously (7Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-HEXIM2 antibody was generated against its amino-terminal sequence TSGAPGSPQTPPERHDSG. Rabbit anti-HEXIM antibody that recognizes both HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 was generated against a highly conserved peptide DFSETYERFHTESLQ shared by the two proteins, except that HEXIM1 has a single Phe to Tyr substitution at position 9 (see Fig. 1A). Buffer D contained 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and various concentrations of KCl as indicated below. RNase A was obtained from Roche Applied Science. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. To generate the H2C5 cell line stably expressing FLAG-HEXIM2, HeLa cells were transduced with the pBabe-puro-based retrovirus (17Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) that expressed FLAG-tagged HEXIM2. The puromycin-resistant cell line H2C5 was selected and propagated as described previously (6Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—FLAG-tagged HEXIM2 expression construct was generated by insertion of the PCR fragment amplified from HEXIM2 cDNA (clone 4559410; Invitrogen) into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma) at the EcoRI and SalI sites. FLAG-tagged HEXIM1 in pFLAG-CMV2 was a generous gift from Dr. H. Tanaka (University of Tokyo). HA-tagged HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 constructs were generated by PCR fusion of the HA sequence amino-terminally to the HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 open reading frames and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Affinity Purification of HEXIM Proteins and Their Associated Factors—For Western and Northern analyses, FLAG- or HA-tagged HEXIM proteins were expressed from cDNA constructs in HeLa cells transfected with the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Nuclear extract (NE) was prepared from the transfected cells 48 h later, as described previously (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). The HEXIM complexes were affinity-purified from the extracts by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-FLAG- or anti-HA-agarose beads, followed by extensive washes with Buffer D containing 0.3 m KCl and elution with the FLAG or HA peptide dissolved in Buffer D containing 0.1 m KCl. The eluted materials were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG, anti-CDK9, anti-CycT1, and anti-HEXIM antibodies and Northern hybridization using the fulllength 7SK antisense RNA as a probe as described previously (6Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). For in vitro kinase and transcription assays, individually transfected FLAG-tagged HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 proteins were affinity-purified by anti-FLAG-agarose beads from NE of transiently transfected 293T cells. After extensive washes with Buffer D containing 1.0 m KCl (to remove the associated 7SK and core P-TEFb) followed by washes with Buffer D containing 0.05 m KCl, the immobilized FLAG-HEXIM proteins were eluted with 0.5 mm FLAG peptide in Buffer D containing 0.05 m KCl and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. In Vitro Kinase and Transcription Assays—In vitro kinase reactions were performed essentially as described previously (7Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription reactions containing normal or CDK9-depleted HeLa NE (dialyzed in Buffer D containing 0.1 m KCl) and a pair of HIV-1 transcription templates were performed essentially as described previously (19Zhou Q. Chen D. Pierstorff E. Luo K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3681-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. NE was first pre-incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with the affinity-purified FLAG-HEXIM proteins in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2. This step facilitated the phosphorylation of the endogenous 7SK/HEXIM-free P-TEFb in NE and thus facilitated the subsequent binding of the exogenously added HEXIM proteins to 7SK/P-TEFb (20Chen R. Yang Z. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4153-4160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The core P-TEFb was generated by immunoprecipitation from F1C2 NE containing CDK9-FLAG, treatment with RNase A and high salt to remove HEXIM/7SK from P-TEFb, and then elution with the FLAG peptide. The HEXIM2/7SK-bound P-TEFb was affinity-purified from H2C5 NE harboring FLAG-HEXIM2. Luciferase Assay—HeLa cells (70–80% confluence) grown in 6-well plates were co-transfected with 100 ng of a luciferase reporter construct driven by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and with increasing concentrations of plasmids expressing either FLAG-tagged HEXIM1 or HEXIM2. The total amount of plasmids (1.3 μg) was kept constant for each transfection by adjusting with the empty vector. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h later with a luciferase assay kit from Promega. Treatment of Cells with Stress-inducing Agents—H2C5 cells (3 × 106) were seeded in 15-cm dishes 1 day before the treatment with actinomycin D (100 μm) and DRB (1 μg/ml). NE was prepared from the treated cells 1 h later. Northern Tissue Blots—The mRNA levels of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 in various human tissues were determined by Northern analysis using a FirstChoice™ Human Blot 2 (Ambion). Full-length cDNA fragments of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 were amplified by PCR and subsequently used with the Stip-EZ™ DNA Kit (Ambion) to generate random-primed 32P-radiolabeled DNA probes. The Northern blot was hybridized overnight and then washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glycerol Gradient Analysis—HeLa cells were co-transfected in a 1:10 ratio with the pBabe-puro empty vector and the pSuper-based vector harboring siRNA562 that target HEXIM1 (7Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). After 24 h, untransfected cells were killed by the addition of 1.5 μg/ml puromycin into the culturing media. NE was prepared 48 h later and subjected to ultracentrifugation in a Sorvall SW41 rotor at 38,000 rpm and 4 °C for 21 h, in a 10-ml glycerol gradient solution (10–30%) containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.3 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Ten fractions were collected, and the proteins in each fraction were precipitated by 70% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blot as described above. HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 Share Extensive Sequence Homology at Their Central 7SK-binding/NLS and Carboxyl-terminal Domains—Given the important physiological role of HEXIM1 in controlling transcriptional elongation, it is essential to determine whether other HEXIM1-related protein(s) may possess functions that are either complementary to or distinct from that of HEXIM1. Homology search of existing cDNA data bases using the 359-amino acid human HEXIM1 sequence revealed that only one predicted human protein of 286 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number AK056946), now renamed HEXIM2, shared extensive homology with HEXIM1. Sequence alignment between HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 showed that the area of homology (>50% identical) begins at the amino-terminal boundary of the central arginine-rich 7SK-binding/NLS domain (amino acids 150–177 of HEXIM1) (11Yik J.H. Chen R. Pezda A.C. Samford C.S. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5094-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and extends into the carboxyl-terminal domain of HEXIM1 until position 343 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, sequences in their amino-terminal regions are mostly unrelated. The unique amino-terminal half of HEXIM1 has been shown to play a regulatory role because the deletion of this region results in a mutant HEXIM1 that targets and inactivates P-TEFb with higher efficiency than the wild-type protein (7Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that whereas the two homologous HEXIM proteins are likely to have similar physiological functions and/or mechanisms of action, they may be regulated differently through their regions of unique sequences. HEXIM2 Is a Novel Component of the Endogenous 7SK snRNP—To determine whether HEXIM2, like HEXIM1, is also an integral component of the 7SK·P-TEFb snRNP, endogenous CDK9 and its associated factors were affinity-purified from HeLa NE by anti-CDK9 immunoprecipitation and analyzed by Western and Northern blotting. As expected, 7SK, CDK9, CycT1, and HEXIM1 were detected in the anti-CDK9 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, lane 4), but not in the control precipitates using anti-CDK4 antibody (lane 3). In addition, using an antibody generated against a unique amino-terminal peptide derived from HEXIM2 (Fig. 1A), a protein matching the predicted ∼50-kDa size of HEXIM2 was also detected (Fig. 1B, lane 2). This same band also reacted to a second antibody that was raised against a highly conserved peptide (Fig. 1A; also see “Experimental Procedures”) shared by both HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 (see Fig. 6C), confirming its identity as HEXIM2. Similar to the 7SK-dependent association of HEXIM1 with P-TEFb (7Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 10Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the HEXIM2-P-TEFb interaction was also 7SK-dependent, as indicated by the disappearance of HEXIM2 in the CDK9 immunoprecipitates upon the destruction of 7SK with RNase A (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Next, an in vitro reconstitution system (7Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) was used to test the ability of HEXIM2 to associate with immobilized P-TEFb in the presence or absence of RNase A. When NE derived from HeLa cells transfected with the HA-tagged HEXIM2 was incubated with immobilized P-TEFb (immunoprecipitated from NE of F1C2 cells stably expressing CDK9-FLAG) (6Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), HEXIM2 was specifically retained on the P-TEFb beads only when 7SK remained intact in the extract (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 2 and 4). These in vivo and in vitro results, together with another one described in Fig. 5A, which employed DNA oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage to specifically target 7SK, confirmed the 7SK-dependent nature of the HEXIM2-P-TEFb interaction. Stable and 7SK/P-TEFb-independent Interaction of HEXIM2 with HEXIM1—To further characterize the interaction of HEXIM2 with the 7SK·P-TEFb snRNP, a HeLa-based cell line (H2C5) stably expressing the FLAG-tagged HEXIM2 (F-HXM2) was generated and then treated with two stress-inducing agents, actinomycin D and DRB, which are known to cause the disruption of the 7SK·HEXIM1·P-TEFb snRNP (6Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 7Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). F-HXM2 and its associated factors were immunoprecipitated from NE of treated cells and analyzed by Western and Northern blotting. In addition to the expected CDK9, CycT1, and 7SK, HEXIM1 was surprisingly found to also associate with HEXIM2 (Fig. 2A, lane 4). As in the case involving HEXIM1, 7SK and P-TEFb could be dissociated from HEXIM2 in actinomycin D- and DRB-treated cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). However, the interaction between HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 was not affected by the drug treatments, which dissociated 7SK and P-TEFb (lanes 2 and 3), nor was it affected by the degradation of 7SK with RNase A (lane 5). Thus, HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 formed a stable complex, whose integrity was not affected by the removal of 7SK and P-TEFb. However, it was not clear from this experiment whether such a complex existed in or outside the 7SK·P-TEFb snRNP. HEXIM2 Can Directly Interact with 7SK/P-TEFb in the Absence of HEXIM1—In light of the above-described HEXIM1-HEXIM2 interaction and the ability of HEXIM2 to co-immunoprecipitate with 7SK and core P-TEFb, we asked whether HEXIM2 bound directly to 7SK/P-TEFb or indirectly via HEXIM1, which had been shown to associate with 7SK/P-TEFb directly (7Yik J.H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 4153-4160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To address this question, NE from HeLa cells transiently expressing F-HXM2 was first immunodepleted of endogenous HEXIM1 (Fig. 2B, lane 2) and then subjected to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation to isolate the F-HXM2-associated factors. Western and Northern analyses revealed that 7SK and P-TEFb were able to associate with HEXIM2 in both mock- and HEXIM1-depleted NE (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4), revealing a direct interaction between HEXIM2 and 7SK/P-TEFb independent of HEXIM1. HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 Form Stable Homo- and Hetero-oligomers—Given the high degree of homology shared by HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 and their mutual interaction, it is possible that the individual HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 proteins may also form homo-oligomers. To test this possibility, cDNA constructs expressing FLAG- or HA-tagged HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 were co-transfected in different combinations into HeLa cells. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates derived from NE of the transfected cells were analyzed in parallel by anti-FLAG and anti-HA Western blotting. Indeed, HA-tagged HEXIM1 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) and HEXIM2 (lane 7) were found to co-immunoprecipitate with FLAG-tagged HEXIM1 and HEXIM2, respectively, demonstrating the abilities of both proteins to form homo-oligomers. In addition, formation of hetero-oligomers between HA-tagged HXM1 and FLAG-tagged HXM2 was also confirmed (lane 4). It is worth noting that the amount of the HEXIM homo-/hetero-oligomers was mostly unchanged by the RNase A-mediated removal of P-TEFb (data not shown) and 7SK from the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and 7 and 8), indicating that these oligomers were stable and that their formations were most likely 7SK/P-TEFb-independent. The HEXIM Homo-/Hetero-oligomers Can Be Detected as Part of the 7SK·P-TEFb snRNP—Although the different forms of HEXIM oligomers remained stable after the dissociation of 7SK and P-TEFb from the immunoprecipitates (Figs. 2A and 3A), it is not clear whether they existed in or outside the 7SK·P-TEFb snRNP. To resolve this issue, HeLa cells were co-transfected with the indicated combinations of FLAG- or HA-tagged HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 cDNA constructs (Fig. 3B). NE of the transfected cells was subjected to two successive rounds of immunoprecipitation, first with the anti-FLAG beads and then the anti-HA beads coupled with specific peptide elution after each precipitation. This procedure ensured that only homo- or hetero-oligomers containing both FLAG- and HA-tagged HEXIM1 and/or HEXIM2 would be obtained after the second round of immunoprecipitation; therefore, if any 7SK or P-TEFb were to be detected in the final precipitates, it must be associated with the HEXIM oligomers. Indeed, CycT1 (data not shown), CDK9, and 7SK were all detected after the second round of purification from cells co-transfected with FLAG- and HA-tagged HEXIM1 (Fig. 3B, lane 7), FLAG- and HA-tagged HEXIM2 (lane 9), or FLAG-tagged HXM1 and HA-tagged HXM2 (lane 8). Control immunoprecipitations indicate that the detected signals were not due to any nonspecific binding of 7SK, P-TEFb, or FLAG-tagged HEXIM proteins t"

Addition of 4-amino-4-deoxy-l -arabinose (4-aminoarabinose) moieties to the phosphate residues of the lipid A portion of the lipopolysaccharide decreases the net negative charge of the bacterial membrane resulting in protection from the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the PmrA/PmrB two-component regulatory system governs resistance to polymyxin B by controlling transcription of the 4-aminoarabinose biosynthetic genes. Transcription of PmrA-activated genes is induced by Fe3+, which is sensed by PmrA cognate sensor PmrB, and by low Mg2+, in a mechanism that requires not only the PmrA and PmrB proteins but also the Mg2+-responding PhoP/PhoQ system and the PhoP-activated PmrD protein, a post-translational activator of the PmrA protein. Surprisingly, Yersinia pestis can promote PhoP-dependent modification of its lipid A with 4-aminoarabinose despite lacking a PmrD protein. Here we report that Yersinia uses different promoters to transcribe the 4-aminoarabinose biosynthetic genes pbgP and ugd depending on the inducing signal. This is accomplished by the presence of distinct binding sites for the PmrA and PhoP proteins in the promoters of the pbgP and ugd genes. Our results demonstrate that closely related bacterial species may use disparate regulatory pathways to control genes encoding conserved proteins.

The lipid A is a major determinant of the interaction between Gram-negative bacteria and the host innate immune system because: 1) it is the molecule responsible for activation of host cell receptors such as TLR4 (4Takeda K.

In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, expression of these genes is controlled by the PmrA/PmrB two-component system (25Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6796-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Transcription of PmrA-activated genes is induced by Fe3+, which is the signal sensed by the PmrA cognate sensor PmrB (26Wosten M.M. Kox L.F. Chamnongpol S. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and by low Mg2+, in a mechanism that requires not only the PmrA and PmrB proteins but also the Mg2+-responsive PhoP/PhoQ system and the PhoP-activated PmrD protein, a post-translational activator of the PmrA protein (27Kox L.F.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2302-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The PmrA protein binds to the pbgP and ugd promoters at regions that include the hexanucleotide repeat (C/T)TTAAT separated by 5 bp, which has been termed the PmrA box (29Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. J.

The PmrA protein promotes transcription of the pbgP and ugd genes using the same start sites whether the inducing condition is Fe3+, which is a PhoP/PhoQ- and PmrD-independent process, or low Mg2+, which is dependent on both PhoP/PhoQ and PmrD (28Kato A. Groisman E.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2302-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, wild-type Salmonella expresses PmrA-regulated genes and is resistant to polymyxin B following growth in the presence of Fe3+ (26Wosten M.M. Kox L.F. Chamnongpol S. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and/or low Mg2+ (27Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas pmrD and phoP mutants are resistant to polymyxin B if grown in the presence of Fe3+ but sensitive if the inducing condition is low Mg2+ (26Wosten M.M.

Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This modification appears to be PhoP/PhoQ-dependent because it was detected only under PhoP-inducing conditions when bacteria were grown in defined media (33Gibbons H.S. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and because expression of the ugd gene inside macrophages required a functional PhoP/PhoQ system even though ugd transcription can be promoted by other two-component systems independently of PhoP/PhoQ (34Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli cannot modify its lipid A with 4-aminoarabinose in response to the low Mg2+ signal that induces the PhoP/PhoQ system (33Gibbons H.S. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) because its highly divergent PmrD protein fails to activate the PmrA protein, which prevents E. coli from expressing PmrA-dependent genes in low Mg2+ (36Winfield M.D. Groisman E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17162-17167Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The plague agent Yersinia pestis can promote PhoP-dependent modification of its LPS with 4-aminoarabinose (14Rebeil R. Ernst R.K. Gowen B.B. Miller S.I. Hinnebusch B.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This is surprising because Yersinia lacks a PmrD protein. Moreover, it indicates that Salmonella and Yersinia must use different strategies to promote expression of lipid A modifying genes under PhoP-inducing conditions. Here we report the mechanism by which Y. pestis regulates expression of the 4-aminoarabinose biosynthetic genes mediating resistance to polymyxin B. Our results demonstrate that closely related bacterial species adopt distinct regulatory strategies for expression of conserved genes encoding structural proteins, and highlight the difficulty of deducing bacterial behavior solely on the basis of gene content.

The Y. pestis phoP pmrA double mutant was constructed using the one-step method to delete the pmrA gene from the phoP mutant strain EG14738. The chromosomal structure of the mutated loci was verified both by PCR as described (41Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S1 Nuclease Assay—To prepare RNA, overnight cultures grown in the defined medium described above containing 10 mm Mg2+, washed and diluted 1:50 into 50 ml of the defined medium containing either 10 μm MgSO4, 10 mm MgSO4, or 10 μm MgSO4 + 100 μm FeSO4. Because the ΔphoP mutant was unable to grow in defined medium containing 10 μm MgSO4, strains were not washed prior to subculture into defined medium containing 10 μm MgSO4, which allowed growth. Total RNA was extracted from early-logarithmic phase cultures (A600, 0.250) with the MasterPure RNA purification kit (Epicenter Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers 1429 (5′-CCACAAGAAGCGTATAACGC-3′) and 5298 (5′-GTAGCTTGAACAAGTCCCAC-3′) were labeled at the 5′-end by phosphorylation with [32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Double-stranded DNA probes to the pbgP and ugd promoter regions were generated by PCR using primer pairs 1428 (5′-CTTCACTACCTATTGCTGGC-3′), 1429 and 5297 (5′-GCTGATGCTTGCTGCTGAAG-3′), 5298, respectively. S1 nuclease reactions were performed as described (42Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA (30 μg for pbgP and 100 μg for ugd) and the labeled DNA probe were combined with 50 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 20 mm HEPES pH 6.5, 0.4 m NaCl). The mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and then left to cool down in an incubator at 30 °C overnight. Hybridization reactions were treated with 10 units of S1 nuclease (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of phenol-chloroform, and the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in sequence loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 6% acrylamide, 7.5 m urea gel together with a Maxam-Gilbert DNA ladder generated from the pbgP and ugd promoter DNA probes. Assays were performed in duplicate. DNase I Footprinting—DNase I footprinting was performed as reported (31Kato A. Latifi T. Groisman E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4706-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pbgP promoter region was amplified as described above with labeling of primer 1429 for the coding strand and primer 1428 for the non-coding strand. The ugd promoter region was amplified using two different primer pairs, 3383 (5′-CACCTTGATGGACAGTTTCC-3′), 3384 (5′-TTCATACCAGACTTACTCCC-3′) for foot-printing with the PhoP protein and primers 5297, 5298 for footprinting with the PmrA protein. Primers 3383 and 5297 were labeled for the coding strand and primers 3384 and 5298 were labeled for the non-coding strand. The Salmonella PhoP and PmrA proteins were purified as described (29Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27185-27190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 43Chamnongpol S. Groisman E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Binding reactions with the PhoP and PmrA proteins were carried out as follows. Proteins were incubated with 25 fmol of DNA probe in 100 μl of 2mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 20 μm EDTA, 500 μg of bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 2% glycerol for 20 min at room temperature. DNase I (Invitrogen) (0.01 units), 100 μm CaCl2, and 100 μm MgCl2 were added and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by the addition of phenol-chloroform, and the aqueous phase was precipitated. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7.5 m urea gel and compared with a Maxam-Gilbert A+G DNA ladder generated from the same DNA probe. Polymyxin B Susceptibility Assay—Strains were grown to logarithmic phase in the defined medium described above containing either 10 μm MgSO4, 10 mm MgSO4, or 10 μm MgSO4 + 100 μm FeSO4, washed and incubated in the presence of 5.0 μg/ml polymyxin B at 28 °C for 1 h. Samples were serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, plated on BHI and incubated for 36–48 h at 28 °C for viability counts. Survival values were calculated by dividing the number of bacteria following treatment with polymyxin B relative to those incubated in the presence of PBS and then multiplied by 100. Assays were performed in triplicate.

Nature. 2001; 413: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), we reasoned that the low Mg2+ induction of the 4-aminoarabinose biosynthetic genes taking place in Yersinia must involve a mechanism different from the PmrD-dependent pathway described in Salmonella (27Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Kato A. Groisman E.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2302-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To determine the transcription start site of the pbgP operon in Y. pestis, we conducted S1 mapping experiments using RNA harvested from organisms grown under conditions known to modulate pbgP transcription in Salmonella (25Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6796-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Wosten M.M. Kox L.F. Chamnongpol S. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because the Yersinia strains were unable to grow in the N-minimal media (49Snavely M.D. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 815-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used to analyze pbgP transcription in Salmonella, we measured transcription of pbgP in Yersinia grown in a Yersinia-specific defined media (40Perry R.D. Brubaker R.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 1290-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which differs from N-minimal media in its salt composition and carbon source. We identified two transcription start sites: an ORF-proximal site that was stronger in organisms experiencing low Mg2+ than in those exposed to low Mg2+ + Fe3+, and an ORF-distal site that displayed the opposite behavior (Fig. 2A). There was weak expression from both promoters in wild-type cells following growth in high Mg2+ (Fig. 2A), a condition that represses pbgP transcription in Salmonella (27Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 50Soncini F.C. Garcia Vescovi E. Solomon F. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5092-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Deletion of the pmrA gene eliminated transcription from the distal but not from the proximal promoter (Fig. 2A). In contrast, inactivation of the phoP gene abolished transcription from the proximal but not from the distal promoter (Fig. 2A). There was no transcription from either promoter in a phoP pmrA double mutant, regardless of the growth condition (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that Y. pestis harbors a Fe3+-responding PmrA/PmrB system, which is consistent with the presence of the Fe3+-binding motif in the putative periplasmic region of the PmrB protein (26Wosten M.M. Kox L.F. Chamnongpol S. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Moreover, they indicate that, unlike what happens in Salmonella, the PmrA and PhoP proteins use different promoters to transcribe the pbgP gene (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, pbgP transcription from the pmrA-dependent promoter was still present in a phoP mutant experiencing low Mg2+ (Fig. 2A), indicative that the PmrA protein is activated in this media, albeit at lower levels. The PhoP and PmrA Proteins Bind to the pbgP Promoter— Analysis of the Yersinia pbgP promoter region revealed the presence of sequences resembling a PhoP box: the hexanucleotide repeat (G/T)TTTA(A/T) separated by 5 bp (44Kato A.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted DNase I footprinting analysis of the pbgP promoter using purified PhoP and PmrA proteins from Salmonella, which are 78.9 and 56.1% identical to the Yersinia PhoP and PmrA proteins, respectively. We established the following. (i) The PhoP protein protected nucleotides –17 to –46 and –28 to –53 from the PhoP-dependent start site on the coding and non-coding strands, respectively (Fig. 2C), which include the predicted PhoP box (Fig. 2B).

The objective of this study was to determine whether permanent ablation of NPRA signaling in mice alters the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 and pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), leading to myocardial collagen remodeling. Here, we report that expression levels of the MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes were increased by 3-5-fold and that the expression of the TNF-α gene was enhanced by 8-fold in Npr1 homozygous null mutant (Npr1-/-) mouse hearts compared with wild-type (Npr1+/+) control mouse hearts. Myocardial fibrosis, total collagen, and the collagen type I/III ratio (p < 0.01) were dramatically increased in adult Npr1-/- mice compared with age-matched wild-type counterparts. Hypertrophic marker genes, including the β-myosin heavy chain and transforming growth factor-β1, were significantly up-regulated (3-5-fold) in both young and adult Npr1-/- mouse hearts. NF-κB binding activity in ventricular tissues was enhanced by 4-fold with increased translocation of the p65 subunit from the cytoplasmic to nuclear fraction in Npr1-/- mice. Our results show that reduced NPRA signaling activates MMP, transforming growth factor-β1, and TNF-α expression in Npr1-/- mouse hearts. The findings of this study demonstrate that disruption of NPRA/cGMP signaling promotes hypertrophic growth and extracellular matrix remodeling, leading to the development of cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and congestive heart failure."

To determine the influence of phosphoinositide binding on the dynamic interaction of α-actinin with actin filaments and integrin adhesion receptors, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy was carried out comparing wild-type green fluorescent protein (GFP)-α-actinin and a GFP-α-actinin mutant with a decreased affinity for phosphoinositides (Fraley, T. S., Tran, T. C., Corgan, A. M., Nash, C. A., Hao, J., Critchley, D. R., and Greenwood, J. A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 24039–24045). In fibroblasts, recovery of the mutant α-actinin protein was 2.2 times slower than the wild type along actin stress fibers and 1.5 times slower within focal adhesions. FRAP was also measured in U87MG glioblastoma cells, which have higher levels of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. As expected, α-actinin turnover for both the stress fiber and focal adhesion populations was faster in U87MG cells compared with fibroblasts with recovery of the mutant protein slower than the wild type along actin stress fibers. To understand the influence of α-actinin turnover on the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, wild-type or mutant α-actinin was co-expressed with constitutively active phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase. Co-expression with the α-actinin mutant inhibited actin reorganization with the appearance of enlarged α-actinin containing focal adhesions. These results demonstrate that the binding of phosphoinositides regulates the association-dissociation rate of α-actinin with actin filaments and integrin adhesion receptors and that the dynamics of α-actinin is important for PI 3-kinase-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

In conclusion, phosphoinositide regulation of α-actinin dynamics modulates the plasticity of the actin cytoskeleton influencing remodeling. The dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for various aspects of intracellular physiology and function as well as the ability of the cell to respond to signals stimulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Individual protein molecules exchange between structures and the cytoplasm and/or membrane keeping the actin cytoskeleton pliable and able to quickly respond to signals inducing reorganization. In this report, we will refer to this dynamic exchange of proteins as turnover. Much of what we know about actin cytoskeletal dynamics has focused on the regulation of actin polymerization by specific actin-binding proteins during lamellipodial formation at the leading edge of migrating cells (1Small J.V. Stradal T. Vignal E. Rottner K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 112-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). It is largely unknown how actin filament bundling proteins influence actin cytoskeletal dynamics and remodeling in the cell. These proteins have not been thought to play an active role in the modulation of actin organization but have rather been cast in the more passive part as stabilizers of an actin cytoskeleton organized by the proteins regulating actin polymerization. In this study, we focus on the influence of α-actinin, an actin filament bundling protein, on the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.As an actin bundling protein that provides a direct link between actin stress fibers and integrin receptors within focal adhesions, α-actinin is a key protein for maintaining the stability of the actin cytoskeleton (2Otey C.A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The localization of α-actinin along actin stress fibers occurs through direct interaction of the actin binding domains of the anti-parallel homodimer with actin microfilaments (2Otey C.A. Carpen O.

Similarly, FRAP of α-actinin within focal adhesions is a combined measurement of the association-dissociation rate of α-actinin with actin filaments and integrins.Although the dynamics of α-actinin in cultured cells has recently been studied by several groups imaging GFP-α-actinin using FRAP (10Peterson L.J.

Cytoskeleton. 2001; 48: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it is not known what factors regulate the rate of α-actinin turnover. Many actin-binding proteins are regulated by specific interactions with phosphoinositides modulating activity and localization (13Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), and we have demonstrated that α-actinin is regulated by phosphoinositide binding (14Greenwood J.A. Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D.

Furthermore, replacement of three positively charged amino acid residues within the phosphoinositide binding site of α-actinin decreased binding to phosphoinositides by as much as 80% (15Fraley T.S.

Cells overexpressing the mutant protein were observed to have an increase in bundled actin filaments altering the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (15Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A.

Although these results demonstrated that phosphoinositide regulation of α-actinin bundling activity was modulating the structure of the actin cytoskeleton, the mechanism by which phosphoinositides were regulating α-actinin in the cell was not clear. In this study, we used the GFP-α-actinin wild-type and mutant proteins to examine the regulation of α-actinin turnover by phosphoinositide binding. The results show that phosphoinositide binding regulates the association-dissociation rate of α-actinin with actin filaments and integrin adhesion receptors influencing the plasticity of the actin cytoskeleton and its ability to remodel.MATERIALS AND METHODSFRAP Microscopy—FRAP experiments were carried out consistent with previously described procedures (11Tsuruta D. Gonzales M. Hopkinson S.B. Otey C. Khuon S. Goldman R.D. Jones J.C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Edlund M. Lotano M.A. Otey C.A. Cell Motil.

Rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) and U87MG glioblastoma cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation) and transfected with pEGFP-α-actinin wild-type and mutant constructs as described previously (15Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A. Hao J. Critchley D.R. Greenwood J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24039-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, cells were transferred to the heated stage (37 °C), with constant 5% CO2 flow, of a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope and equilibrated for at least 1 h. GFP fluorescence was imaged with a ×63 oil immersion objective with objective heater using the 488-nm line of a 30-milliwatt argon laser, and emissions were collected using a LP505 filter. Images were acquired at full dynamic range using the lowest laser intensity possible allowing the collection of quality images with little or no intrinsic photobleaching during the recovery period. Stationary cells expressing GFP-α-actinin of equivalent intensity and morphology were selected for the FRAP experiments. To prevent damage to the cells from the laser, only one region of interest (average size was 45 μm2 for stress fibers and 13 μm2 for focal adhesions) was chosen per cell. Five images were taken prior to photobleaching to calculate the initial fluorescence intensity. One hundred and fifty iterations with the laser were needed to photobleach the region of interest to ∼10% of the initial fluorescence. Following photobleaching, images were collected every 15 s for 15 min for the REFs and 10 min for the U87MGs. Photobleaching of the stress fibers had no observable negative effects on the cytoskeleton or morphology of the cell. However, photobleaching of peripheral focal adhesions did, on occasion, cause some retraction of the cell. This effect was observed for cells, primarily the U87MGs, expressing both wild-type and mutant GFP-α-actinin, and these experiments could not be completed. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using Zeiss Physiological Software 3.2.For each recovery curve, the half-time of recovery (t½) was the time taken to reach 50% of the postbleach maximum. To remove the effect of random fluctuations in fluorescence intensity, each postbleach maximum was estimated from the nonparametrically smoothed recovery curve (SAS Loess procedure with smoothing parameter chosen as the global minimum for the AICC criterion after graphical verification). Within the REF and U87MG data sets, the estimated t½ values were compared between cell types using linear mixed models (SAS mixed procedure) after log transformation of the data to reduce heterogeneity of variance. For REF data, experimental days were included in the model as additive complete blocks (interaction p value, >0.3). The final model for REF data allowed mutant cells to have different (greater) variability than wild-type cells (p < 0.005, residual likelihood ratio test) leading to the use of the Kenward-Rogers adjustment and Satterthwaite approximation for standard errors and tests. For U87MG data the final model was a simple one-way analysis of variance because data were collected on a single day and the variances were reasonably homogeneous after log transformation (Levene's test, p = 0.12). Residuals were acceptable for both sets of data. All statistical analyses were done with SAS version 9.1. 2SAS for Windows (2003), SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC. The mobile fraction was calculated as described by Tsuruta et al. (11Tsuruta D. Gonzales M. Hopkinson S.B. Otey C. Khuon S. Goldman R.D. Jones J.C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Microscopy—REFs were co-transfected with pEGFP-α-actinin wild type or mutant and p110K227E 5′-Myc or, as a control, the empty pSG5 construct (19Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde (Tousimis) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, and stained with anti-Myc (Upstate) followed by rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) to identify PI 3-kinase-expressing cells and Alexa 350-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to visualize filamentous actin. Images of the cells were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 100S microscope with a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine the influence of phosphoinositide binding on the association-dissociation rate of α-actinin with actin filaments, FRAP microscopy was carried out comparing wild-type GFP-α-actinin and the GFP-α-actinin mutant with a decreased affinity for phosphoinositides (15Fraley T.S.

Both proteins were transiently expressed in REFs as previously characterized (15Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A. Hao J. Critchley D.R. Greenwood J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24039-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A region of interest containing α-actinin bundled stress fibers within stationary cells was photobleached, and fluorescence recovery quantified within the defined region (Fig. 1). We observed a homogeneous recovery of GFP-α-actinin along the stress fibers with a t½ of 51.1 s and ∼90% of the fluorescence recovered by 300 s (Figs. 1 and 2, Table I). These rates are within the range of those previously reported for GFP-α-actinin using different cellular systems and culturing conditions (10Peterson L.J. Rajfur Z. Maddox A.S. Freel C.D. Chen Y.

Recovery of the GFP-α-actinin mutant was 2.2 times slower than the wild-type protein with a t½ of 111.9 s and less than 80% of the fluorescence recovered by 300 s (Figs. 1 and 2, Table I). Experiments were carried out on four separate days comparing cells expressing the wild-type or mutant protein; the t½ was consistently slower for the GFP-α-actinin mutant compared with the wild-type protein (p < 0.0001)(Fig. 2B). The mobile fractions for wild-type and mutant α-actinin were comparable (Table I), indicating that phosphoinositide binding regulates the rate of turnover and not the ability of the protein to exchange.Fig. 2Analysis of FRAP experiments examining the turnover of α-actinin along actin stress fibers.A, recovery curves for GFP-α-actinin wild type (top trace) and mutant (bottom trace), n = 12–13; error bars represent S.E.

An important question is whether the population of α-actinin bundling the actin filaments in stress fibers is accessible to and can interact with membrane-localized phosphoinositides. In addition to the above results and our previous study examining the GFP-α-actinin mutant (15Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A. Hao J. Critchley D.R. Greenwood J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24039-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Woods and colleagues (21Greene D.K. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7617-7623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that α-actinin interacted with the transmembrane receptor syndecan 4 along actin stress fibers. Furthermore, using immunofluorescent staining, Fukami et al. (22Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported co-localization of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and α-actinin along actin stress fibers. These results suggest that this population of α-actinin is in close enough proximity to bind membrane phosphoinositides.We next examined the association-dissociation rate of α-actinin with actin filaments and integrin receptors within focal adhesions. FRAP assays of GFP-α-actinin within focal adhesions were carried out exactly as described for the stress fiber experiments on the same days using different cells in the same culture dishes (Fig. 3). The size and distribution of the focal adhesions in the REFs expressing both the wild-type and mutant proteins were heterogeneous from cell to cell. As previously reported (15Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A. Hao J. Critchley D.R. Greenwood J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24039-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), structural differences have not been identified in the focal adhesions of unstimulated REFs expressing wild-type α-actinin compared with the mutant protein. Recovery of α-actinin within focal adhesions was 1.3 times faster than stress fibers (p = 0.0062, Table I). A similar trend was observed by Edlund et al. (12Edlund M. Lotano M.A. Otey C.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 48: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), although reported as statistically insignificant. The turnover of α-actinin within focal adhesions was 1.5 times slower for the mutant protein (t½ = 57.6 s) compared with the wild-type (t½ = 39.7 s) (p = 0.04). These results suggest that phosphoinositide binding regulates the association-dissociation rate of α-actinin with actin filaments and integrin receptors within focal adhesions, although a greater influence was observed on the association-dissociation rate of α-actinin with actin filaments within stress fibers. It is not clear why the rate of turnover for the α-actinin population within focal adhesions is faster compared with stress fibers; however, several factors may contribute. The increased rate of turnover may result from the local production of phosphoinositides by phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and PI 3-kinase, which have been shown to localize to focal adhesions (23Gillham H. Golding M.C. Pepperkok R. Gullick W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The focal adhesion population of α-actinin would also be expected to be in closer proximity to the membrane increasing the potential for interaction with phosphoinositides. In addition, the affinity of α-actinin is higher for actin filaments than integrin receptors (25Pomies P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Phosphoinositide binding regulates the association-dissociation rate of α-actinin with actin filaments and integrins within focal adhesions. REFs expressing GFP-α-actinin wild type or mutant with equivalent fluorescence intensity and similar morphologies were chosen for the FRAP experiments. One region of interest containing a focal adhesion was selected for each cell. FRAP experiments were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” An image of the cell prior to photobleaching is shown with the region of interest. Images of the region of interest immediately following photobleaching and after 30 and 300 s of recovery are also shown. Bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further examine the role of phosphoinositides in regulating α-actinin dynamics, turnover was measured in U87MG glioblastoma cells, which do not express the lipid phosphatase PTEN (26Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Science. 1997; 275: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar) and thus have higher levels of the 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides compared with cells expressing the phosphatase (27Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). As expected, α-actinin turnover for both the stress fiber and focal adhesion populations was faster in U87MG cells compared with REFs with recovery of the wild-type protein faster than the mutant along actin stress fibers (Table I). These results further support the hypothesis that phosphoinositide binding regulates the turnover of α-actinin in live cells. Interestingly, the wild-type and mutant proteins recovered at the same rate within the focal adhesions of U87MG cells. It is not clear why a rate difference was observed between the wild-type and mutant proteins in the focal adhesions of REFs but not U87MGs.To determine the influence of phosphoinositide-regulated α-actinin turnover on the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, REFs were co-transfected to express wild-type or mutant GFP-α-actinin with constitutively active PI 3-kinase. Rodriguez-Viciana et al. (28Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J.

The production of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides by PI 3-kinase induces the actin cytoskeleton to remodel and form prominent membrane ruffles (28Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A.

Actin cytoskeletal reorganization in the wild-type expressing cells was consistent with previous reports (28Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) showing an increase in membrane ruffling and a loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions (Fig. 4, A–C). As expected, α-actinin colocalized with filamentous actin. In addition, PI 3-kinase clearly localized to membrane ruffles as well as the cytosol (Fig. 4C). Co-transfection with pSG5, the empty vector, had no effect on the actin cytoskeleton or morphology of the cells (data not shown). Coexpression of the mutant protein with constitutively active PI 3-kinase was observed to partially inhibit actin reorganization with the appearance of enlarged α-actinin containing focal adhesions (Fig. 4, D–F). Light staining for PI 3-kinase was observed within the focal adhesions of some of these cells as well as in the membrane ruffles and cytosol (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that the rate of α-actinin turnover, as regulated by phosphoinositide binding, influences the ability of the actin cytoskeleton to remodel. Although we expected that expression of the α-actinin mutant would inhibit actin reorganization and the loss of focal adhesions, the observed increase in the size of α-actinin containing focal adhesions was unexpected. However, PI 3-kinase activation has been demonstrated to play an important role in integrin-mediated attachment and spreading (18Shimizu Y. Hunt S.W. II I Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Activation of integrin receptors in the presence of the α-actinin mutant, which was inhibiting the disassembly of the focal adhesions, may have resulted in the accumulation of focal adhesion proteins.Fig. 4Phosphoinositide-regulated α-actinin turnover is required for PI 3-kinase-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. REFs were co-transfected with pEGFP-α-actinin wild type or mutant and p110K227E 5′-Myc and stained for fluorescence microscopy as described under “Materials and Methods.” Images are shown of GFP-α-actinin (A, D), filamen"
https://openalex.org/W2077937228,"γ-Protocadherins (γ-pcdhs) are type I membrane-spanning glycoproteins, widely expressed in the mammal and required for survival. These cell adhesion molecules are expressed from a complex locus comprising 22 functional variable exons arranged in tandem, each encoding extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular sequence, and three exons for an invariant C-terminal domain (γ-ICD). However, the signaling mechanisms that lie downstream of γ-pcdhs have not been elucidated. Here we report that γ-pcdhs are subject to presenilin-dependent intramembrane cleavage (PS-IP), accompanied by shedding of the extracellular domain. The cleaved intracellular domain (γ-ICD) translocates to the cell nucleus and was detected in subsets of cortical neurons. Notably, gene-targeted mice lacking functional γ-ICD sequence showed severely reduced γ-pcdh mRNA levels and neonatal lethality. Most importantly, inhibition of γ-secretase decreased γ-pcdh locus expression. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that γ-pcdh promoter activity is increased by γ-ICD. These results reveal an intracellular signaling mechanism for γ-pcdhs and identify a novel vital target for the γ-secretase complex. γ-Protocadherins (γ-pcdhs) are type I membrane-spanning glycoproteins, widely expressed in the mammal and required for survival.

Cadherins represent a large superfamily of transmembrane glycoproteins, sharing common structural features, but exhibiting differential adhesive binding specificities (1Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 629-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterized best are the so-called classic cadherins, including E-, R-, N-, and P-cadherin, and the remainder forms subgroupings collectively referred to as protocadherins (pcdhs). 1The abbreviations used are: pcdhs, protocadherins; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse-transcriptase; ICD, invariant C-terminal domain; dko, double knockout; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Classic cadherins are characterized by an ectodomain consisting of 5 extracellular cadherin-like (EC) repeats, followed by a single transmembrane domain and a highly conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic region. Classic cadherins engage mostly in homophilic adhesive binding triggered by Ca2+ ions intercalating between the EC domains to produce a rigidified, rod-like ectodomain (2Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Intracellularly, classic cadherins associate with different proteins, including catenins, that regulate their adhesive properties or mediate downstream signaling (3Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), which is important for establishing brain structure and connectivity including synaptic structure, function and plasticity (4Nagafuchi A.

Besides their well documented signaling function via catenins, E- and N-cadherin have been shown to undergo presenilin dependent intramembrane proteolysis (PS-IP), which consists of matrix protease-mediated cleavage of the ectodomain and the characteristic release of a soluble cytoplasmic domain by the activity of the γ-secretase complex and its catalytic constituents presenilin-1/2 (10Marambaud P.

The released cytoplasmic cadherin domains can assume signaling function in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus, in analogy to the cytoplasmic domains of prominent targets of γ-secretase, Notch, APP, ErbB-4, and SREBP-1 (12Schroeter E.H.

In comparison to classic cadherins, pcdhs differ in the number of EC domains and have divergent intracellular domains. Recently, >50 novel type-I transmembrane pcdhs have been described (16Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 17Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Noonan J.P. Zhang M.Q.

They are thought to participate in specific synaptic connections based on their structural similarities to cell adhesion molecules and their synaptic localization (18Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S.

As a characteristic feature these pcdhs harbor six EC domains related to those of classic cadherins, but contain different cytoplasmic domains. In human and mouse they are arranged in three physically linked clusters, termed α, β, and γ, located on mouse chromosome 18 (human chromosome 5). Each cluster contains multiple tandemly arranged functional variable exons (14 for α, 22 each for β and γ), each encoding the extracellular sequence, the transmembrane region and part of the intracellular domain. Transcription of each α- and γ-pcdh variable exon is initiated at sequences immediately upstream of the translational start site (22Tasic B. Nabholz C.E. Baldwin K.K. Kim Y. Rueckert E.H. Ribich S.A. Cramer P. Wu Q. Axel R. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 23Wang X. Su H. Bradley A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1890-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Notably, each variable γ-pcdh exon contains its own promoter/enhancer, including a conserved sequence element (CSE) essential for proper transcription, ∼200-bp upstream of the translational start site (22Tasic B. Nabholz C.E. Baldwin K.K. Kim Y. Rueckert E.H. Ribich S.A. Cramer P. Wu Q. Axel R. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In addition to the variable exon array, the α- and γ-pcdh, but not the β-pcdh, locus harbor three exons 3′ of the variable exon cluster, which together encode invariant cytoplasmic domains (α-ICD, γ-ICD) (16Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 17Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Noonan J.P. Zhang M.Q. Myers R.M. Maniatis T. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, cis-splicing of the cluster transcripts produces α- and γ-pcdh isoforms with distinct adhesive properties but identical cluster specific intracellular domains. The γ-pcdh locus represents the best studied of the three subclusters of pcdhs. Initial investigations revealed that the γ-pcdh genes are abundantly transcribed in neurons. Importantly, an intact γ-pcdh locus is required, as demonstrated by neonatal death of mice from locus deletion (19Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 2002; 36: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Global aspects of neurogenesis, including neuronal migration, axonal outgrowth and synapse formation appeared unaffected, but specific neuronal populations, especially spinal interneurons, died at late stages of development, indicating a critical requirement for γ-pcdh-mediated signaling for their survival. As yet, the mode and mechanism of γ-pcdh-mediated signaling are unknown. An intriguing aspect is certainly provided by the γ-ICD, which as integral part of all 22 functionally expressed γ-pcdhs is likely to interact and provide cross-talk with cellular signaling pathways. However, no proteins interacting with the γ-ICD have been described. Here we provide evidence that the γ-ICD can be released by PS-IP from γ-pcdhs inserted in the plasma membrane and translocates to the nucleus where the γ-pcdh locus appears to be a potential target for γ-ICD-mediated transcriptional enhancement by as yet unknown mechanisms. This autoregulatory aspect of γ-pcdh expression may contribute to unexpectedly low γ-pcdh levels in mice heterozygous for a γ-pcdh locus lacking γ-ICD exon sequence. Generation of Mice with Floxed γ-pcdh Alleles—The γ-pcdh targeting construct was generated from ∼15-kb 129/Sv mouse genomic DNA isolated from a Stratagene λ Fix2 library with radiolabeled γ-C1 sequence. A ∼12-kb XhoI/BstBI fragment was subcloned and a floxed pgk-neo cassette from vector ploxPneo-3 (24Deng C. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2134-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was inserted into the unique SacII site 417-bp downstream of γ-C1. A EcoRV-SacII-loxP-SmaI linker containing a single loxP element was inserted into the single EcoRV site 1026 bp 5′ of γ-C1. The targeting construct was linearized by XhoI and electroporated into R1-ES cells (25Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar), and cells were selected for G418 resistance. Homologus recombination in selected clones was checked by Southern blotting. DNAs were digested with KpnI and probes 5′ or 3′ of γ-C1 were generated by PCR with oligonucleotide primers C1–5.1, 5′-CAGCCTCAAGTACACAGACCC-3′; C1–5.2, 5′-GACAGTAGAATGCACGTGACG-3′; C1–3.1, 5′-GAGACATATAGGACAACTTGG-3′; C1–3.2, 5′-CTGACTGTACTCCTACTGCAG-3′. Two clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Highly chimeric males were mated with C57BL/6 females to produce +/neo mice, which were mated with Cre deleter mice (26Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar) to produce +/ΔC1 mice. Removal of the intronic pgk-neo insert was confirmed by Southern blotting and routinely monitored by PCR analysis. Primers CL5, 5′-GTGCCCTGCTCCACGGCAGCC-3′ and CL3, 5′-ATTCTCACACAGGCTCCCAGG-3′ positioned 5′ and 3′ of the EcoRV site, detected the single loxP element upstream of γ-C1 in neo/neo animals. Primers CL5 and CN3, 5′-ATGCCGTCTCCAGCTTTGTGG-3′, the latter located 3′ from a unique SacII site, were used to genotype ΔC1/ΔC1 mice. Constructs—All cDNA inserts, subcloned into vectors for transient transfections in cell lines or transformations into competent bacteria, were generated by RT-PCR from RNA of neonatal mouse brains. For γ-ICD-10his a ∼380-bp RT-PCR fragment generated with primers cG1, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCAAGCCCCGCCGAACACGGACTGG-3′ and cG2, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTTACTTCTTCTCCTTCTTGCCCGA-3′ was subcloned into the NdeI site of vector pET-16b (Novagene).

For EYFPγ-pcdh-A1 use of primers A1vr5, 5′-GCCCTAGGGGAAACATCCGATACTCTGTGCC-3′and A1vr3, 5′-GTCCTAGGTTACTTCTTCTCTTTCTCGCC-3′ generated a ∼2.8-kb RT-PCR product, which was subcloned into the XbaI site of ΔRK5-mycCP3-EYFP (27Mack V.

For γ-pcdh-A1ΔCT primers A1vr5 and A1vr3ΔCT, 5′-CGCCTAGGTTAAGTCTGGAGCAAGCGTGAGGA-3′ were used. The resulting ∼2.4-kb RT-PCR product was subcloned into the XbaI site of pRK5-mycCP3-EYFP.

All γ-pcdh promoter fragments were generated by PCR from 129/Sv ES cell DNA, and the resulting 1-kb PCR products were subcloned into the XbaI and KpnI sites of vector pGL3-E (Promega). We used: for γ-B1P primers B1S1, 5′-GCTCTAGACTAGCCAAGGGCTCTCTAGTG-3′ and B1S2, 5′-GCTCTAGATTACTTCTTCTCTTTCTTGCC-3′; for γ-A2P primers A2S1, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGAGTTTCTGCAGCGTCGCCAT-3′ and A2S2, 5′-GGGGTACCCTGTCTCCAACTTGGAGAGTTG-3′; for γ-A3P primers A3S1, 5′CCCTCGAGTTCCTTTTCTGTTTTTTTCCTCCCCTC-3′ and A3S2, 5′-GGGGTACCGTCTGTCTTCATTTCTATTTCTGTG-3′; for γ-C4P primers C4S1, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGTGCTGGGCATTGCTGCCAT-3′ and C4S2, 5′-GGGGTACCTACTATGGTGTCAGATGAAGAG-3′. To delete the CSE in the γ-A2P construct, the γ-A2P construct was digested with StuI, Bsu36I, and subsequent religation generated γ-A2ΔCSEP. The NR2CP construct is described in Ref. 28Suchanek B.

Enzymes were heat-inactivated after RNase H (USB) treatment. Northern blots were carried out on poly(A)+ RNA generated with (Poly(A)Purist-MAG kit from Ambion), with membranes probed with γ-VAR, γ-C2C3, γ-C1, γ-C2, or neo probes and reprobed with a cyclophilin (CyP) probe. The γ-VAR probe (330 bp) was generated by RT-PCR from brain RNA using primers GV5, 5′-(CT)CT(AGC)GT(AGC)ACCAA(AG)GTGGT(AG)GC-3′ and GV3, 5′-GCCA(AC)(GT)GCCACCACCAGGTA(GCT)-3′; primers GC2, 5′-GCCGCTGATGGGAGCTCCACT-3′ and PBTG2, 5′-CGGAATTCTTACTTCTTCTCCTTCTTGCC-3′ generated the γ-C2C3-probe (315 bp).

The cyclophilin probe (252 bp) was amplified with primers MH70, 5′-CGCGAATTCTGGGAACCGTTTGTGTTTGGTC-3′ and MH127, 5′-CGCGGATCCAGAAAACTTTCGAGCTCTGAGC-3′. The amplified DNA fragments were labeled with radioactive [α-32P]dCMP using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The synthetic antisense oligonucleotides for detecting transcripts containing γ-C1, 5′-TCTCTGGGCTTGAGAGAAACGCCAGTCAGTGTTGG-3′ and γ-C2, 5′-GGCAGAGGCCAAGATCATGGCTTGCAGCATCTCTGTATCAAACTGGTTGTTG-3′ were 5′-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Hybridized membranes were washed in 0.2× SSC, 0.2× SDS at 68 °C (PCR probes) or 50 °C (oligonucleotide probes) for 15 min. RT-PCR analysis to assess splicing of wild-type and targeted allele transcripts (+/neo, +/ΔC1) were carried out using primers A1–12 5′-(c/g)TACCTGGTGGTGGC(A/C)(T/G)TGCC-3′, A8 5′-CAGAAGTGGATTGGCCCCTGCA-3′, B4 5′-CAGTCGGAAGTGGTGGTTCCC-3′, and C3 5′-GGTAGAGCTCCCATCAGCAGC-3′ on a Peltier-Thermo Cycler. In Situ Hybridization—Embryos or whole brains from E14/P42 C57-BL/6 mice were frozen on dry ice. Saggital or coronal sections (20 μm) prepared by cryostat were mounted on glass slides. In situ hybridization was performed as described (29Wisden W. Morris B.J. Bradley R.J. Harris A.R. Jenner P. In Situ Hybridization Protocols for the Brain, International Review of Neurobiology. 47. Academic Press, London, San Diego2002Google Scholar). The anti-γ-C2 oligonucleotide, 5′-GTCAAACTGGTTGTTGGGCCAGGTGCCGGTGTCATCGCCATTTTG-3′, was 3′-labeled with [35S]dATP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Roche Applied Science). After hybridization and washing in 0.5× SSC at 60 °C for 5 min, glass slides were exposed to KODAK BioMax MR-1 film for ∼48 h. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibody against AFP (all fluorescent proteins) was obtained from Q-BIOgene (Montreal, Canada), Myc, and FLAGM2 monoclonal antibodies from Sigma, polyclonal antibody against GFP from MoBiTec and polyclonal antibody against GAPDH from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Species-specific secondary antibodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), Alexa Fluor™488 nm (Molecular Probes) or TexasRed™ (Vector Laboratories). γ-ICD-10his and GST-γ-ICD were expressed in, and purified from, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated by Eurogentech Laboratories from purified soluble γ-ICD-10his protein. Immunohistochemistry—Fresh brains from newborn mice (n = 3 for wild type and knock out) were immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Adult mice were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA. Brain sections (50–100 μm) were preincubated in 5% normal goat serum (NGS; Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature and transferred to the polyclonal anti-γ-ICD antibody solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1% NGS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For controls, the primary antibody was preabsorbed with 0.4 μg of GST-γ-ICD protein/μl antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 13 krpm, or was omitted from the incubations. Sections were incubated in primary antibody solution for 48 h at 4 °C, washed 10 min in PBS, and incubated in biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:500; (Vector)) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS (10 min), the sections were incubated in streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC standard kit, Vector) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Immunolabeling was revealed by the glucose oxidase-diaminobenzidine (GOD-DAB) method. Intensification of the GOD-DAB reaction product was by osmium intensification (30Silver R.A. Lubke J. Sakmann B.

Plenum, New York1989: 49-96Google Scholar). Vibratome sections were washed in PBS, mounted on Superfrost (Menzel) glass slides, dried, dehydrated, and coverslipped from Xylene. Western blots, Immunofluorescence, and Co-immunoprecipitations— For Western blot (WB) analysis cultured cells or mouse brains were solubilized in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), containing 1% Triton X-100. SDS-PAGE and blotting were performed using standard conditions. γ-ICD rabbit polyclonal antiserum was used in 1:200 (fixed cells) or 1:500 (WB) dilutions, all other antisera were diluted according to manufacturer's protocols. Immunofluorescence was performed using standard protocols. To visualize nuclei, cells were treated with 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:5000; Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. Mounted sections were examined in a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Quantification of Western blots was performed with ImageJ software. For co-immunoprecipitation COS-1 cells were cotransfected with vectors for Flagγ-pcdh-B1 and EYFPγ-pcdh-A1 or GFPγ-pcdh-B1 or EYFPγ-pcdh-A1ΔCT or mycγ-ICD. All subsequent operations were at 4 °C. Cell lysates were precleared with 25 μl of immobilized protein A (Immuno-Pure®+, Pierce) for 30 min, and ∼400 μl of (protein concentration ∼1 μg/μl) were incubated with ∼5 μg of antibody (AFP or Myc) overnight. Precipitates were recovered after 4 h of incubation with 25 μl of bead-immobilized protein A. Beads were washed 4× with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and bound material was eluted at 99 °C in 20 μl of 3× sample buffer. Real Time PCR—An ABIPRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for cDNA quantification. Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells cotransfected with vectors for GFP and mycγ-ICD or mycα-ICD or from pharmacologically treated SH-SY5Y cells. RNAs were DNase I-treated and reverse-transcribed. About 1–2 μg of the resulting cDNA was analyzed in a reaction volume of 25 μl (on 96-well plates), using the TaqMan PCR Core reagent kit (PE Applied Biosystems). cDNA of each cell culture dish was analyzed in triplicate. Primers and probes for real time PCR were obtained from PE Applied Biosystems, designed using the manufacturer's programs. The primer and probe sequences located in the γ-pcdh 3′-untranslated region were: Probe-UTR3-VIC, 5′-TTGCTACCAAGCCTCTT-3′; RP-UTR5, 5′-TCCCCAGGGCGTTGG-3′; FP-UTR3, 5′-GCTGGATTTAGGGAGGGCA-3′. GFP probe and primers: 6-FAM, 5′-CTATAACTCCCACAATGTG-3′; FP-GFP, 5′-TCGGCCACAAGTTGGAATACA-3′; RP-GFP, 5′-TGCTTGTCGGCCATGATGT-3′, (for the pTR-UF2 plasmid, described in Ref. 32Zolotukhin S. Potter M. Hauswirth W.W. Guy J. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4646-4654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GAPDH primers (assay on demand) and probe were designed by the company and used according to their protocols (www.appliedbiosystems.com). The detected amount of γ-pcdh transcripts was subsequently normalized for that of GAPDH transcripts and for transfection efficiency, assessed by the amount of GFP transcripts. Cell Lines, Transfections, and Treatments—COS-1, HEK293, SH-SY5Y cells and dko fibroblasts (33Herreman A. Hartmann D. Annaert W. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Serneels L. Umans L. Schrijvers V. Checler F.

Cells were transfected with recombinant plasmids by the Ca2+-phosphate method, supplied with fresh medium 20 h after transfection and grown for another 24 h before harvesting. For treatment with monensin (final concentration, 83 μm) and brefeldin A (0.3 mm final) (both from Sigma), the agents were given with the fresh medium supply for 24 h before cell harvesting. L-685,458 (7 μm) and DAPT (10 μm) (CalBiochem) were added 12 h after the change to fresh medium, and cells were harvested 12 h later. TAPI (40 μm) (CalBiochem) treatment was similar, except exposure to cells was 10 h. Transactivation Assays—HEK293 cells grown in 6-well plates with ∼5 × 105 cells per well were cotransfected with reporter constructs, and constructs for β-galactosidase (Promega) and one of several activators indicated in Fig. 6. Transactivation of reporter constructs was measured in lysates from ∼8 × 104 cotransfected HEK293 cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (firefly luciferase system, Promega) 30 h after transfection in a luminometer (Macherey and Nagel). To evaluate individual transfection efficiencies for subsequent normalization, X-Gal-positive cells were counted in parallel wells. Luciferase activities were determined in a Beckman luminometer. Cotransfections were tested in triplicate in at least two independent experiments. The transactivation potential of mycγ-ICD was determined by comparing the amount of relative light units in parallel transfections with γ-pcdh-A1ΔCT or pRK5-mycα-ICD as control. For promoter control we used p0.4XPluci, containing the core promoter of the NR2C gene (28Suchanek B. Seeburg P.H. Sprengel R. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 929-934PubMed Google Scholar). Attenuated γ-Pcdh Locus Expression and Neonatal Lethality in Mice Lacking the Invariant γ-Pcdh C-terminal Domain—The mouse γ-pcdh locus (Fig. 1A) was targeted in murine embryonic stem cells (25Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar) to generate a γ-pcdhneo allele (neo) in which γ-C1, the first of the three exons, γ-C1 to γ-C3, that encode the γ-ICD (Fig. 1B), was floxed, by introducing a loxP site in the intron upstream of γ-C1 and a floxed pgk-neo gene into the downstream intron. The neo allele became precursor to the γ-pcdhΔC1 allele (ΔC1) with γ-C1 deleted, produced by crossing +/neo mice with a Cre deleter strain (26Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Removal of γ-C1 generates a frameshift (Fig. 1B) and hence, the ΔC1 allele cannot express functional γ-ICD. Heterozygous +/neo and +/ΔC1 mice appeared phenotypically inconspicuous and generated upon intracrossing homozygous neo/neo and ΔC1/ΔC1 offspring at Mendelian frequency (mice wild type, heterozygous, homozygous: neo 21, 34, 13; ΔC1 12, 24, 11). Notably, all homozygous pups died during the first 12 h after birth, as described for newborn mice lacking the entire γ-pcdh locus (19Wang X. Weiner J.A. Levi S. Craig A.M. Bradley A. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 2002; 36: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Hence, to evaluate splicing and expression of transcripts from the altered γ-pcdh alleles, we subjected brain RNA from newborns of different genotypes to RT-PCR and Northern analyses. Splicing from variable to constant region exons was determined by RT-PCR with sense oligonucleotide primers generic for variable region exons A1–12, or specific sense primers for variable exons A8 (not shown) and B4, in combination with an antisense primer within γ-C3. The amplicons, resolved on agarose gels (Fig. 1C) and checked by DNA sequencing (not shown), revealed that the pgk-neo insertion did not cause skipping of γ-C1 or γ-C2, and that loss of γ-C1 resulted in splicing from variable exons to γ-C2, with no detectable band corresponding to a splice directly to γ-C3. Moreover, the skewed ratio of the two RT-PCR fragments, respectively containing or lacking γ-C1 exon sequence, from RNA of heterozygous +/ΔC1 mice (Fig. 1C) documented that spliced transcripts from the ΔC1 allele were in much lower abundance than those from the wild-type γ-pcdh allele. Quantification by Northern analysis from poly(A)+ RNA with four probes for variable and conserved exon sequences showed that the amount of the ∼4.4-kb γ-pcdh mRNA was in +/neo mice little over, and in +/ΔC1 significantly below, the 50% expected from the intact wild-type allele present in these genotypes (Fig. 2, A and B). This indicated that both modified alleles (neo, ΔC1) were severely impaired in mRNA production. Moreover, the analysis revealed that the wild-type γ-pcdh allele in +/ΔC1 mice produced subnormal mRNA amounts. In neo/neo mice, γ-pcdh mRNA was reduced to ∼20% of wild-type levels; the intronic pgk-neo insertion may have resulted in reduced splicing efficacy of the allelic neo transcripts. In ΔC1/ΔC1 mice, γ-pcdh mRNA lacking γ-C1 sequence was <10% of wild-type levels. We also evaluated γ-pcdh protein levels in the different genotypes. The γ-pcdh specific ∼114 kDa protein band reacting on Western blots with our antibody showed relative to wild type an intensity of ∼60% in +/neo mice, an"

Over the last decade, evidence from many laboratories converged on the Mediator complex as a central Pol II coactivator (2Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev.

Mediator was discovered in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by its ability to enable activated transcription in an in vitro system containing Pol II and the general transcription factors (5Flanagan P.M.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Genome-wide studies showed that Mediator is required for regulated transcription of the majority of yeast genes (8Holstege F.C.P. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Mediator also stimulates basal transcription (9Mittler G. Kremmer E.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The yeast Mediator comprises 25 polypeptide subunits, of which 11 are essential and 22 are at least partially conserved in sequence throughout eukaryotes (11Bourbon H.M. Aguilera A. Ansari A.Z. Asturias F.J. Berk A.J. Bjorklund S. Blackwell T.K. Borggrefe T. Carey M. Carlson M. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Emmons S.W. Fondell J.D. Freedman L.P. Fukasawa T. Gustafsson C.M. Han M. He X.

Cell. 2002; 110: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Nine of the Mediator subunits are products of the srb genes, which were discovered in a genetic screen for suppressors of truncations of the C-terminal domain of the largest Pol II subunit (13Nonet M.L. Young R.A. Genetics. 1989; 123: 715-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Four of the Srb proteins reside in an independent Cdk-cyclin subcomplex that is only found in a subpopulation of Mediator complexes. Mediator promotes initiation complex assembly through activator-Mediator, Mediator-Pol II, and Mediator-general transcription factor contacts (15Cantin G.T. Stevens J.L. Berk A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12003-12008Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mediator also stimulates the kinase activity of the general transcription factor TFIIH, which phosphorylates the Pol II C-terminal domain, apparently triggering the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (6Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Mediator is recruited to active genes ahead of Pol II (16Cosma M.P. Panizza S. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1213-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and is thought to remain near the promoter to facilitate transcription reinitiation (17Liu Y. Ranish J.A.

Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy shows that Mediator undergoes strong structural changes upon interaction with Pol II (19Naar A.M.

Science. 2002; 295: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) that are obvious even at 35 Å resolution (21Davis J.A. Takagi Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 409-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The causes and consequences of these changes are, however, poorly understood, and the molecular mechanism of Mediator remains enigmatic mainly because of a complete lack of detailed structural information. The Mediator subunit architecture was inferred from biochemical, genetic, and electron microscopic studies. Biochemical studies defined three submodules of Mediator, the MED17 (Srb4), the MED9/10, and the MED15 (Gal11) submodules (23Kang J.S. Kim S.H. Hwang M.S. Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42003-42010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which were tentatively correlated with three density lobes in electron microscopic images, termed the head, middle, and tail module, respectively (24Dotson M.R. Yuan C.X. Roeder R.G. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Jiang Y.W. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14307-14310Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The head and middle modules form a core Mediator that can be isolated from yeast (17Liu Y. Ranish J.A. Aebersold R. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7169-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Core Mediator enables 4-fold activation of transcription in nuclear extracts compared with 18-fold activation for the complete Mediator. The middle module is the most conserved part of Mediator and comprises subunits MED7, MED21, MED10, MED1, MED4, MED9, and possibly MED31. With the exception of MED31 (Soh1) (25Linder T. Gustafsson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49455-49459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), MED7 and MED21 show the highest degree of sequence homology of all core Mediator subunits (40 and 45% between yeast and human, respectively). The high conservation of MED7 and MED21 is reflected in their essential function in yeast (26Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 27Hengartner C.J. Thompson C.M. Zhang J. Chao D.M. Liao S.M. Koleske A.J. Okamura S. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and in a requirement for MED21 in mouse development (28Tudor M. Murray P.J. Onufryk C. Jaenisch R. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2365-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To explore the general Mediator mechanism, we have determined the structure of the highly conserved heterodimeric MED7·MED21 subcomplex in two different conformational states and have analyzed the multiple direct protein interactions of this subcomplex in vitro. We show that highly conserved elements confer flexibility to the Mediator complex that may be important for function. Cloning—The genes of MED10His and MED4His were cloned into pET21b vector (Novagen) using the restriction sites NdeI and NotI so that a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (His) was introduced. For bicistronic expression of MED7 with MED21His, MED4 with MED21His, and MED10 with MED21His, the genes of MED7, MED4, and MED10 were cloned into the pET21b vector using the restriction sites NheI and EcoRI. The gene of MED21 was then inserted together with a second ribosomal binding site at the 5′ region of the MED21 gene as described (29Lutzmann M. Kunze R. Buerer A. Aebi U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The sequence of the primer was GGACGCGTCGACAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGACAGATAGAGATTAACACAATTGC (the start of the MED21 open reading frame is underlined). The restriction sites used were SalI and NotI. The genes for variants MED7ΔNΔC·MED21His (comprised of residues 102–205 of MED7) and MED7ΔNΔC·MED21 were cloned in the same way in the pET24b vector, which contains a kanamycin resistance cassette. For MED7ΔNΔC·MED21 the restriction site XhoI was used instead of NotI. MED7ΔNΔC·MED21ΔC (comprising residues 1–132 of MED21) was cloned in pet21b and contains methionine mutations (see x-ray structure determination). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MED17ΔN, comprising residues 241–688 of yeast MED17 and an N-terminal GST tag, was cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-3x (Amersham Biosciences). The gene of MED6 and an additional ribosomal binding site at its 5′-region were inserted into the Xma site, fused to a C-terminal His tag. Genomic DNA was used as a template for all constructs except for MED17, where a MED17-containing plasmid was used (30Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). MED6His was obtained from N. Lehming (31Gromoller A. Lehming N. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—All proteins were expressed for 16 h at 20 °Cin Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 (Stratagene). Heterodimeric complexes were coexpressed from a single bicistronic plasmid. For coexpression of a third protein, a second plasmid was cotransformed that contains the appropriate gene and a different antibiotic resistance (ampicillin). For protein purification, cell pellets were thawed and lysed by sonication in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with 30 ml of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. All complexes except MED6His· MED7ΔNΔC·MED21 and GSTMED17ΔN·MED6His were further purified by anion exchange chromatography (Mono Q, Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol), and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 20 column volumes from 50 mm to 1 m NaCl in buffer B. After concentration, the sample was applied to a Superose-6 high resolution gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Bicine, pH 8.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Purification of the triple methionine mutant was as for MED7ΔNΔC· MED21His, except for the Ni-NTA purification step. Instead, the mutant was precipitated with 35% saturated ammonium sulfate solution. For crystallization, the MED7ΔNΔC·MED21His peak fraction was concentrated to 16 mg/ml. MED6His·MED7ΔNΔC·MED21 was further purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation as above followed by gel filtration as above. GSTMED17ΔN·MED6His was purified by sequential Ni-NTA and GST affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer (CL4B, Amersham Biosciences). Bands of copurified proteins were generally verified by Edman sequencing. Crystallization and Crystal Treatment—Samples were crystallized at 20 °C with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Selenomethionine crystals of the triple methionine mutant of MED7ΔNΔC·MED21ΔC were crystallized using the reservoir solution 100 mm sodium potassium tartrate, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5% polyethylene glycol 400, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA. Mutant MED7ΔNΔC·MED21ΔC was crystallized in 500 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5% polyethylene glycol 400, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm EDTA. Crystals were harvested in mother solution, which was exchanged gradually against mother solution containing additionally 35% glycerol. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of the native and selenomethionine MED7ΔNΔC·MED21His complex were grown in 0.8–1.1 m NaCl, 10–15% ethanol, 0–3% polyethylene glycol 6000, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm EDTA. The mother solution was exchanged by the same solution containing 25% glycerol, but no ethanol, using microdialysis buttons. X-ray Structure Determination—All diffraction data were collected at the Swiss Light Source, Villigen, Switzerland. For MAD phasing, three additional methionines were introduced at positions of conserved hydrophobic residues in MED21ΔC (L5M/L119M/L125M). Selenomethionine was incorporated as described (32Meinhart A. Blobel J. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48267-48274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). MAD experiments were performed on selenomethionine-labeled crystals, and diffraction data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38527) Google Scholar) (see Table I). Four selenium sites were correctly identified with program SOLVE (34Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and refined using SHARP (35La Fortelle E.D. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Three additional selenium peaks were detected in residual electron density maps with SHARP. Phasing with SHARP using seven consistent peaks led to an electron density map that revealed distinct α-helices. A total of 10 methionine residues are present in the amino acid sequences and were ordered in the electron density map, except the two N-terminal methionines and Met-42 of MED21. Using the selenium sites as sequence markers, most of MED7 and MED21 could be built into the electron density map at 3.6 Å of resolution with program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). This initial model was repositioned in the unit cell of the native crystal by rigid body refinement with CNS (37Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Model-phased maps at the final resolution of 3.0 Å allowed us to complete and refine the structure with CNS to a free R-factor of 28.9% (see Table I). The second crystal form, belonging to space group C2221, was phased using the 4-helix bundle of the refined MED7·MED21 structure. A difference electron density map phased with the bundle domain showed locations of the coiled-coil protrusions in the two heterodimers of the asymmetric unit that deviated substantially from that observed in the original structure. The coiled-coil region was adjusted. An extended loop between MED21 helices α1 and α2 that was disordered in the P4322 crystal form was added as polyalanine in one of two heterodimers in the asymmetric unit, and the resulting model was refined to a free R-factor of 31.4% (see Table I). The MED21 loop α1-α2 is better ordered in the C2221 crystal form since it forms a crystal contact that is not observed in the P4322 crystal form. In both refined structures, none of the residues fall in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (see Table I).Table IDiffraction data and refinement statistics r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.CrystalSelenomethionine MAD MED7ΔNΔC/MED21ΔCaThe triple point mutant L5M/L119M/L125M of MED21 was usedNative MED7ΔNΔC/MED21ΔCaThe triple point mutant L5M/L119M/L125M of MED21 was usedNative MED7ΔNΔC/MED21Data collectionSpace groupP4322P4322C2221a (Å)85.685.7121.5b (Å)85.685.7128.9c (Å)185.2183.0170.2Wavelength (Å)0.9795 peak0.9797 inflection0.9686 remote0.97951.0749Resolution range20-3.6 (3.73-3.6)bThe numbers in parenthesis correspond to the highest resolution shell20-3.6 (3.73-3.6)20-3.6 (3.73-3.6)50-3.0 (3.11-3.0)50-3.3 (3.42-3.3)Completeness (%)100 (100)100 (100)100 (100)98.6 (100)99.6 (99.5)Unique reflections8,5178,5178,51714,18020,641Redundancy6.96.56.75.44.8Rsym(%)8.3 (21.0)8.7 (32.0)7.8 (26.0)6.5 (26.2)5.8 (36.2)〈I/σI〉7.66.46.88.910.4f′-8.0-9.8-3.8f″4.92.53.7RefinementNumber of residues209428Non-hydrogen atoms1,7373,549r.m.s.d. bonds (Å)0.0080.009r.m.s.d. angles (°)cPROCHECK (53)1.1641.37Ramachandran plot (core/allowed/additionally allowed)94.3/5.7/087.9/11.8/0.3Rcryst(%)25.727.9Rfree (%)28.931.4a The triple point mutant L5M/L119M/L125M of MED21 was usedb The numbers in parenthesis correspond to the highest resolution shellc PROCHECK (53Laskowski R.A.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Subcomplex Mapping—Individually expressed recombinant Mediator subunits are generally insoluble, explaining the current lack of Mediator subunit structures. Insolubility apparently results from a loss of structural integrity when subunits are outside their natural multiprotein context. To overcome this obstacle, we coexpressed the highly conserved and essential S. cerevisiae Mediator subunits MED7 and MED21 in E. coli with the use of a bicistronic vector (compare “Experimental Procedures”). A stable MED7·MED21 complex was purified and subjected to partial proteolysis to probe for flexible regions that may interfere with crystallization. Chymotrypsin treatment resulted in the removal of 101 poorly conserved N-terminal residues of MED7 (Fig. 1). A corresponding variant MED7ΔN (MED7 residues 102–222) still formed a stable complex with MED21 after coexpression. Proteinase K treatment of the purified MED7ΔN·MED21 complex resulted in cleavage of a short C-terminal portion of MED7. A subsequently prepared variant MED7ΔNΔC (residues 102–205) still bound MED21 strongly. This variant comprises only the highly conserved region of MED7, which shows 59% sequence homology between the yeast and human proteins. Except for a short C-terminal truncation, MED21 remained stable in all proteolysis experiments. In contrast, individually expressed MED21 was readily cleaved before residues 38 and 76 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, MED21 is protected from degradation upon MED7 binding. Taken together, iterative proteolysis and truncation of coexpressed and copurified subunits allowed us to map a stable subcomplex, and this approach may be used to obtain potentially crystallizable portions of other multiprotein complexes. Structure Determination—The preparations of the MED7ΔNΔC·MED21 subcomplex were monodisperse and homogeneous according to dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography. The subcomplex formed crystals that grew to a maximum size of 0.6 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm and comprise two heterodimers per asymmetric unit (space group C2221). Despite the large size of the crystals, diffraction extended only to 3.3 Å in favorable cases, most likely because of the very high solvent content of 78%. To increase the resolution limit of the crystals, we truncated eight non-conserved amino acid residues from the MED21 C terminus (variant MED21ΔC, residues 1–132, Fig. 1B). The resulting complex MED7ΔNΔC·MED21ΔC formed crystals that adopted space group P4322. These crystals were slightly more stable, and could be used for structure determination. The structure was solved with MAD data from a selenomethionine-substituted crystal and was refined to a free R-factor of 28.9% against native diffraction data extending to 3.0 Å of resolution (“Experimental Procedures,” Table I). We used the refined structure of the MED7ΔNΔC·MED21ΔC heterodimer to solve the structure in the initial crystal form (space group C2221) by molecular replacement. We refined this structure to a free R-factor of 31.4% with data extending to 3.3 Å of resolution (Table I). Elongated Two-domain Structure—MED7 and MED21 form a very elongated heterodimer of purely helical structure (Fig. 1C). The heterodimer extends over 110 Å, corresponding to ⅓ of the Mediator length (21Davis J.A. Takagi Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 409-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and amounting almost to the diameter of Pol II (39Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). This elongated shape is consistent with an unusually short retention in size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2). The retention of the MED7·MED21 species lies between that of the standard proteins aldolase (157 kDa) and catalase (230 kDa) and may be explained by formation of tetramers (dimers of heterodimers). Two different types of tetramers are observed in the crystal (Fig. 3, C–D), which show a computed (40Garcia De La Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) Stokes radius of 42–44 Å. This is in good agreement with the Stokes radii for aldolase and catalase (47 and 49 Å, respectively), whereas the Stokes radius of the MED7·MED21 heterodimer is only 31 Å. Thus, the complex apparently forms stable tetramers in solution. Dynamic light scattering also indicates a molecular weight well above that of the heterodimer, but the data quality did not allow for quantification.Fig. 3Interaction surfaces. A, MED7-MED21 interactions. On the left, the Connelly surface of MED21 (probe radius 1.2 Å) is shown together with a ribbon model of MED7. The view is as in Fig. 1C.

F, surface representation of the model in D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MED7 and MED21 show no sequence similarity, but they have the same structural organization, comprising three extended helices. MED7 and MED21 tightly pack against each other, forming a heterodimer with two domains. A 4-helix bundle domain is formed by the two N-terminal α-helices of each subunit, and the C-terminal helices of the two subunits form a long coiled-coil protrusion (Fig. 1C). A “hinge” region connects the bundle domain to the coiled-coil protrusion. A Conserved Flexible Hinge—Comparison of the MED7·MED21 structure in the two crystal forms reveals that the coiled-coil protrusion can undergo a hinge movement with respect to the bundle domain, giving rise to a 10-Å displacement of the C-terminal end of the protrusion (Fig. 1D). This repositioning of the protrusion is accommodated by a slight conformational adjustment in the hinge region. Thus, the MED7·MED21 heterodimer has an intrinsic flexibility that allows for a relative repositioning of the two domains. This flexibility is not due to the short C-terminal truncation of MED21 in the C2221 crystal form since the two chemically identical heterodimers in the asymmetric unit also show two different conformations indicating the same hinge motion and since the truncated residues are not involved in packing interactions in the C2221 crystal form. The high sequence conservation of amino acid residues in the hinge region of MED7 and MED21 (Fig. 1B) strongly suggests that the observed flexibility is functionally significant. A hinge movement is also predicted by molecular dynamics simulation with the Dynamite server (dynamite.biop.ox.ac.uk/dynamite). MED7-MED21 Interaction—MED7 and MED21 form a continuous hydrophobic interface, which explains why subunits that are individually expressed in E. coli are structurally unstable and either poorly soluble or easily degraded. The hydrophobic residues in the MED7-MED21 interface along the coiled-coil protrusion are mostly conserved throughout eukaryotes and show a spacing typical for coiled coils (MED7 residues Leu-175, Leu-178, Leu-182, Ile-189, Ile-192; MED21 residues Ile-94, Leu-97, Leu-101, Val-104, Ala-111) (Figs. 1B and 2). In MED7 the regular spacing of the hydrophobic residues is discontinued only at residue Lys-185. The regular pattern in MED21 is similar, except for residues Gln-90, Lys-K108, and Lys-115, which, however, also participate in fold-stabilizing interactions. The conserved MED21 residue Gln-90 forms hydrogen bonds with Glu-172 and Arg-171 of MED7 and may contribute to the specificity of the heterodimeric interaction. Given the high degree of sequence conservation of the crystallized regions, the MED7·MED21 structure must essentially be the same in all species. This conservation in structure explains why a chimeric MED21 protein consisting of the two human N-terminal helices (corresponding to yeast residues 1–81) and the yeast C-terminal helix (residues 82–140) is functional in vivo (41Chao D.M.

Nature. 1996; 380: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and why truncation of the MED21-interacting region of MED7 is lethal in Caenorhabditis elegans (42Kwon J.Y. Kim-Ha J. Lee B.J. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A Unique Leucine Zipper—The coiled-coil protrusion resembles a canonical leucine zipper as it occurs in transcription factors like c-Jun (43Junius F.K. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Weiss A.S. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13663-13667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or Gcn4 (44Keller W. Konig P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol.

The two helices of the coiled-coil separate at their C-terminal end. The inner side of this open end of the zipper is conserved and hydrophobic (MED21 residues Leu-118, Val-122, Ile-126, and Phe-129; MED7 residues Leu-203 and Val-199) and, thus, chemically different from the corresponding region in leucin"
https://openalex.org/W2008364371,"The E2F1 transcription factor is a critical regulator of cell cycle due to its ability to promote S phase entry. However, E2F1 overexpression also sensitizes cells to apoptosis and E2F1-null mice are predisposed to tumor development, suggesting that it also has properties of a growth suppressor. E2F1 transcription function is regulated by interaction with hypophosphorylated pRb. Cdk inhibitors such as p16INK4a and p27Kip1 inhibit pRb phosphorylation by the cyclin D/Cdk4 and cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes, thus keeping E2F1 in an inactive state. We found that E2F1 binds to the p27 promoter in vivo and activates p27 mRNA and protein expression. Depletion of endogenous E2F1 by siRNA causes a reduction in basal p27 expression level. Inhibition of endogenous p27 expression by siRNA increases E2F1 transcriptional activity and permits accelerated cell cycle progression by exogenous E2F1. These observations suggest that induction of p27 acts as a negative feedback mechanism for E2F1 and may also contribute to other functions of E2F1.

These observations suggest that induction of p27 acts as a negative feedback mechanism for E2F1 and may also contribute to other functions of E2F1. Progression of mammalian cells through normal cell cycle requires coordinated actions of positive and negative factors. Mitogenic signals stimulate sequential assembly and activation of cyclin D/Cdk4/6 and cyclin E/Cdk2 in early and late G1, resulting in the phosphorylation of pRb retinoblastoma protein and release of E2F transcription factors. The seven members of the E2F gene family play central roles in controlling S phase entry (1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Among the E2F proteins, E2F1, -2, and -3A promote cell growth, while E2F3B, -4, -5, -6, and -7 act as negative regulators (1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 2.Gaubatz S. Lindeman G.J. Ishida S. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Livingston D.M. Rempel R.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). E2Fs are inactivated by binding to the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins. Hyperphosphorylation of pRb releases E2F1, which initiates transcription of genes required for G1/S transition, such as cyclin A, cyclin D, cyclin E, c-myc, c-myb, and DNA polymerase (1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Subsequent activation of cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin B/Cdk1 complexes are important for completion of mitosis. The activities of cyclin/Cdk complexes are negatively regulated by Cdk inhibitors, including the INK4 family (p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d) and Cip/Kip family (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2). The INK4 family mainly inhibits cyclin D/Cdk4 complex and Cip/Kip family mainly targets cyclin E/cdk2. p27 is regulated at the levels of transcription and protein turnover. Proteolysis by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway is thought to be the predominant mechanism that regulates p27 levels. This occurs through phosphorylation at Thr187 by cyclin E/Cdk2 and subsequent recognition by ubiquitin ligase SCF Skp2 (3.Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 4.Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic mislocalization of p27 may also lead to loss of function (5.Ciaparrone M. Yamamoto H. Yao Y. Sgambato A. Cattoretti G. Tomita N. Monden T. Rotterdam H. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 114-122PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p27 activity can be regulated by sequestration by cyclin D/Cdk4/6 complex, which prevents it from inhibiting cyclin E/Cdk2 (6.Bouchard C. Thieke K. Maier A. Saffrich R. Hanley-Hyde J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5310-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Forkhead transcription factor has been shown to activate p27 transcription and induce cell cycle arrest (8.Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Mol. Cell.

Given its important roles in cell cycle regulation, p27 is likely to be controlled by multiple transcription factors that coordinate its expression with cell cycle progression. Disruption of p27Kip1 locus in mice results in increased animal size due to increase in cell proliferation (10.Fero M.L. Rivkin M. Tasch M. Porter P. Carow C.E. Firpo E. Polyak K. Tsai L.H. Broudy V. Perlmutter R.M. Kaushansky K. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p27Kip1-deficient mice also showed increased tumorigenesis after genotoxic or oncogenic insults (11.Fero M.L. Randel E. Gurley K.E. Roberts J.M. Kemp C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 12.Jackson R.J. Adnane J. Coppola D. Cantor A. Sebti S.M. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8486-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that it can function as a tumor suppressor gene. Consistent with this notion, reduced levels of p27 expression are frequently observed in human carcinomas and correlate directly with poor prognosis (13.Tsihlias J. Kapusta L. Slingerland J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 401-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, p27 has also been shown to promote assembly of active cyclin D/Cdk4 complex in vivo and is part of the active complex (14.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that p27 expression plays a role in coordinating cell cycle progression by increasing cyclinD/Cdk4 activity during early G1 phase. Ectopic expression of E2F1 is sufficient to drive quiescent cells into S phase (15.Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). As expected, E2F1 overexpression can cooperate with activated ras in inducing morphological and tumorigenic transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts in culture (16.Johnson D.G. Cress W.D. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), which fits the classic definition of an oncogene. Interestingly, E2F1 also has activities that are opposite to its role as an oncogene. Overexpression of E2F1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts results in abortive S phase and significant apoptosis through p53-dependent and independent mechanisms (17.Kowalik T.F. DeGregori J. Schwarz J.K. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). E2F1-null mice develop testicular atrophy and exocrine gland dysplasia (19.Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 20.Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), consistent with a growth suppressor function. Since formation of the pRb-E2F1 complex can lead to recruitment of histone deacetylases to E2F1 target promoters and actively repress transcription, loss of the repressive complexes in the E2F1-null mice may partially account for the cell proliferation phenotype. However, E2F1 has well documented target genes that are pro-apoptotic, such as caspase 3, 7, 9 and Apaf1 (21.Nahle Z. Polakoff J. Davuluri R.V. McCurrach M.E. Jacobson M.D. Narita M. Zhang M.Q. Lazebnik Y. Bar-Sagi D. Lowe S.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E2F1 directly induces expression of p19ARF, which in turn activates p53 by binding and inhibiting MDM2 function (22.Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Therefore, the growth-promoting function of E2F1 is likely to be counter-balanced by multiple self-imposed safeguard mechanisms. In this report, we present evidence that E2F1 can induce expression of p27 through activation of the p27 promoter. E2F1 expression is necessary for maintaining basal level p27 expression in the H1299 tumor cell line. Expression of p27 cooperates with pRb to suppress E2F1 activity, and ablation of endogenous p27 expression enhances E2F1 activity. The results suggest the presence of a novel p27-dependent negative feedback mechanism that regulates E2F1 activity. Cell Lines and Plasmids—H1299 (non-small cell lung carcinoma, p53-null), U2OS (osteosarcoma, wt p53), and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. To inhibit p27 expression by RNA interference, double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCCGTTGAGTAGAAGAATCGTCGGTTTGATATCCGACCGACGATTCTTCTACTCAATTTTTTA, p27 sequence underlined) was cloned into the pSuperiorRetroPuro vector (OligoEngine). The plasmid was packaged into retrovirus by transfection of the amphotropic packaging cell line LA (a kind gift from Dr. Peiqing Sun, the Scripps Institute). H1299 cells were infected with the p27 shRNA retrovirus and selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin for 10 days. Drug-resistant colonies were pooled for analysis. H1299 cells infected with a vector virus without the shRNA insert were also selected and pooled as control.

Western Blot—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and the insoluble debris was discarded. Cell lysate (10–50 μg of protein) was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P filters (Millipore). The filter was blocked for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20. p27 was detected using a monoclonal antibody (Clone 57, BD Biosciences). E2F1 was detected using monoclonal antibody KH95 or rabbit polyclonal antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ARF was detected using 14PO2 antibody (NeoMarkers). The filter was developed using ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR Analysis and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen). The following PCR primers were used: p27F (5′-TAACCCGGGACTTGGAGAAG) and p27R (5′-GCTTCTTGGGCGTCTGCTC) to amplify a 450-bp product and actin F (5′-GCTCGTCGTCGACAACGGCT) and actin R (5′-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC) to amplify a 353-bp product. To avoid overamplification, samples were retrieved after 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 PCR cycles and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Representative results are shown in Fig. 2C. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out using published procedure (23.Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mock IP was performed with a GFP antibody. Coprecipitated chromatin was analyzed by PCR for the presence of p27 promoter DNA between –615 to –326 using p27PF (5′-CGGCCGTTTGGCTAGTTTGTTTGT) and p27PR (5′-GGAGGCTGACGAAGAAGAAGATGA) primers, generating a 294-bp product. Results at cycle 35 are shown in Fig. 2F. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells (50,000/well) were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected with a mixture containing 10 ng luciferase reporter plasmid, 5 ng of CMV-lacZ plasmid, 20 ng of E2F1 expression plasmid, and 50 ng of pRb or p27 plasmid. Transfection was achieved using Lipofectamine PLUS reagents (Invitrogen), and cells were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase expression after 24 h. The ratio of luciferase/β-galactosidase activity was used as an indicator of E2F1 transcription activity. Immunofluorescence Staining and Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells cultured on chamber slides were transfected with E2F1 plasmid for 24 h using Lipofectamine Plus reagents. Cells were fixed for 2 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with p27 monoclonal antibody and E2F1 rabbit polyclonal antibody C20. Rhodamine-anti-mouse Ig and fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-rabbit Ig secondary antibodies were used to detect p27 and E2F1 in the double stain. For cell cycle analysis, H1299-p27Si cells in 10-cm plates were infected with Ad-GFP and Ad-E2F1 at ∼50 plaque-forming units/cell. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 18 h to block mitosis, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by FACS. E2F1 Induces p27 Expression—In experiments aimed at studying the regulation of E2F1 transcriptional activity, U2OS and H1299 cells were transiently transfected with E2F1 expression vector. Western blot analysis showed reproducible increase of p27Kip1 expression level after E2F1 transfection, despite less than 50% of the cells were transfected in a population (Fig. 1A). Coexpression of the tumor suppressor pRb with E2F1 blocked p27 induction, consistent with the ability of pRb to inactivate E2F1. Additional experiments showed that E2F1 transfection also induced p27 expression in MCF-7 cells and the NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the SV40 large T-antigen, which inhibits pRb and activates endogenous E2F1, induced p27 expression in non-transformed NIH3T3 but not in MCF-7 cells (presumably already have activated E2F1 due to oncogenic transformation). To further confirm the ability of E2F1 to induce p27 expression, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with E2F1 plasmid and subjected to immunofluorescence double staining for E2F1 and p27. The results showed that cells expressing ectopic E2F1 had elevated levels of p27 staining (Fig. 1C). Although p27 induction correlated with E2F1 expression, the levels of p27 and E2F1 expression did not show strict correlation in the same cells (Fig. 1C). This discordance may be due to the fact that p27 level is also affected by other factors such as cell cycle stages. To confirm the effect of transient E2F1 transfection on p27 expression, an H1299 cell line stably expressing E2F1-ER™ construct was treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen to activate the E2F1 fusion protein (25.Ma Y. Yuan J. Huang M. Jove R. Cress W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16770-16776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This treatment also resulted in significant increase of p27 expression level (Fig. 2A). In cells with activated E2F1, expression level of another E2F1 target p14ARF was also increased as expected (Fig. 2A) (26.Aslanian A. Iaquinta P.J. Verona R. Lees J.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These results suggested that p27 expression is regulated by E2F1. E2F1 binding to several promoters have been shown to inhibit gene expression during G0 and G1, possibly due to recruitment of pRb and the associated histone deacetylase complexes (1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). To determine the role of endogenous E2F1 in regulating p27 expression level, RNA interference targeting of E2F1 was employed. An H1299 cell line has been established that stably expresses E2F1 siRNA, resulting in ∼90% reduction of endogenous E2F1 level (27.Ma Y. Cress W.D. Haura E.B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 73-81PubMed Google Scholar). Suppression of E2F1 expression by siRNA correlated with significant reduction of p27 level in these cells (Fig. 2B), despite similar rates of cell growth compared with control H1299 cells. This result suggested that endogenous E2F1 is a major activator of basal p27 expression in H1299 cells under normal cell culture condition. Whether E2F1 or other E2F family members also negatively regulate p27 expression during growth arrest in culture, in vivo, or in tumors with reduced levels of p27 remains to be further investigated. Activation of p27 Promoter by E2F1—The level of p27 can be controlled at the level of degradation. To examine the effect of E2F1 on p27 degradation rate, U2OS cells transfected with E2F1 were treated with cyclohexamide to block protein synthesis, and the rate of p27 turnover was examined by Western blot. No difference in p27 stability was observed (data not shown), suggesting that E2F1 may directly regulate p27 expression at the level of transcription. This mechanism was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of H1299-E2F1-ER cells. Activation of E2F1-ER by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) resulted in significant increase in p27 mRNA level (Fig. 2C). To determine whether E2F1 activates the promoter of p27, luciferase reporter construct driven by a 1.6-kb mouse p27 promoter 2S. Mohapatra and W. J. Pledger, manuscript in preparation. was transfected with E2F1 expression vector. The results showed that the p27 promoter was strongly activated by E2F1 (up to 19-fold, Fig. 2D). In fact, the magnitude of p27 promoter activation by E2F1 was similar to the previously identified E2F1 and cyclin D3 promoters in similar assays (25.Ma Y. Yuan J. Huang M. Jove R. Cress W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16770-16776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The p27 promoter was also activated by other E2F1 family members that are known to be transcription activators but not by the inactive E2F6 (Fig. 2D). Therefore, activation of p27 promoter is a property shared by several E2F1 family members. Deletion analysis of the mouse p27 promoter suggested that the region between –326 to –615 contains sequences necessary and sufficient for significant response to E2F1 in reporter assays (Fig. 2E). Sequence search of this region revealed several putative E2F1 binding sites (TTTGGCTA, GCGCGGAG, GCGCCGAG) (28.Kwon T.K. Nagel J.E. Buchholz M.A. Nordin A.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additional putative E2F1 binding sites were also found upstream of this region (–680, TTTCGCGG; –1300, TTTCGCCC; –1560, TTTAGCGC). Human p27 promoter also contains several putative E2F1 sites (–670, TTAGGCGC; –1290, TTTGGCGG; –1670, TTTGGCTC) (29.Inoue T. Kamiyama J. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32309-32317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To determine whether E2F1 directly binds to the p27 promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed on mouse cells. PCR amplification of chromatin DNA cross-linked to E2F1 showed the presence of p27 promoter fragment containing the –326 to –615 region from control cells, suggesting binding by endogenous E2F1. The signal was further increased when cells were transfected with E2F1 (Fig. 2F). Therefore, E2F1 may activate p27 transcription by interacting with the E2F1 binding elements on the promoter. Although mouse promoter sequences between –326 to –615 contain the sites for strong E2F1 response in plasmid reporter assays, upstream E2F1 sites may also play a role in a physiological context, since the longer promoter mutants were more active in reporter assays (Fig. 2E). Further experiments will be needed to determine the detailed mechanism of p27 regulation by E2F1 and other E2F family members in different phases of the cell cycle and in response to growth signals. The transcriptional activity of E2F1 is controlled by pRb, which is in turn regulated by cyclin E/Cdk4-mediated phosphorylation. We hyposized that E2F1 induction of p27 expression may form a negative feedback loop to limit the activity of E2F1 (Fig. 3A). To test whether this is the case, E2F1-responsive cyclin D3 promoter was used to test the effect of p27 expression on E2F1 transcription function. Coexpression of p27 or pRb each resulted in inhibition of E2F1 function (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, p27 and pRb cooperatively inhibited E2F1 function. In a different assay, Gal4-E2F1-CT fusion that contains the C-terminal transcription activation domain of E2F1 (304–437) was used to activate the Gal4-luciferase reporter. Coexpression of p27 and pRb also strongly suppressed the ability of Gal4-E2F1-CT to activate the Gal4 reporter (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that induction of p27 expression by E2F1 can potentially function as a negative feedback regulatory mechanism that limits E2F1 activity. Inhibition of p27 Expression by siRNA Enhances E2F1 Functions—To further investigate the role of endogenous p27 in regulating E2F1 activity, p27 expression in H1299 cells was inhibited by retrovirus-mediated stable expression of a p27 shRNA (Fig. 4A). A stable pool of H1299 cells with ∼90% reduction of p27 level (H1299-p27Si) was transfected with p27-luc and E2F1 expression vector; activation of the luciferase reporters was consistently 2-fold stronger in p27-depleted cells (H1299-p27Si) compared with control (H1299-Vec) (Fig. 4B). Similar effects were observed by transient transfection of p27 siRNA expression plasmid (data not shown). There results demonstrate that endogenous p27 plays a role in regulating the activity of the transfected E2F1. E2F1 expression has been shown to promote cell cycle entry of quiescent cells (15.Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Induction of p27 expression by E2F1 may function in limiting the cell cycle promoting effect of E2F1. To test whether this is the case, H1299-p27Si cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus vector expressing E2F1. Infected cells were analyzed for cell cycle progression by FACS after 24 h. To determine whether the ability of cells to enter and complete S phase was altered by E2F1 expression, cells were also treated with the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole for 18 h before harvest to prevent cells from passing through M phase. This assay enabled us to determine the rate by which G1 cells enter and progress through S phase, since G1 cells would not be replenished once entering S phase. Unlike quiescent cells, expression of E2F1 in control H1299-Vec cells did not have significant effects on the rate of cell cycle progression except inducing moderate levels of apoptosis (Fig. 4C). However, E2F1 clearly accelerated cell cycle progression in H1299-p27Si cells, reducing the G1 population to ∼65% of control level after the same duration of nocodazole treatment (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that p27 expression plays a role in restricting the cell cycle promoting activity of E2F1. In summary, the data described above demonstrate that p27 is a transcriptional target of E2F1. Furthermore, endogenous E2F1 is an important factor in maintaining p27 basal expression level in H1299 cells. The ability of p27 to inhibit E2F1 activity in cooperation with pRb as demonstrated in this study and in previous publications, together with the accelerated cell cycle in p27-deficient cells upon E2F1 expression suggest the presence of a negative feedback loop that limits E2F1 activity (Fig. 3A). A recent study also showed that pRb/p27 double-null MEFs more readily escape crisis in culture and immortalize at a higher frequency than p27-null or pRb-null MEFs (30.Carneiro C. Jiao M.S. Hu M. Shaffer D. Park M. Pandolfi P.P. Cordon-Cardo C. Koff A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), consistent with the interpretation that p27 acts as a safeguard mechanism against pRb loss and E2F1 activation. Identification of the p27 negative feedback loop adds additional complexity to the cell cycle clock and reveals a new step that may be a target of growth signaling. Our interpretation of the data does not exclude more complex roles of the E2F1-p27 connection. Contrary to its established function as a cell cycle inhibitor, p27 has also been shown to promote assembly of active cyclin D/Cdk4 complex in vivo and is part of the active complex (14.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that p27 induction by E2F1 plays a role in coordinating cell cycle progression by increasing cyclinD/Cdk4 activity during early G1 phase. Furthermore, E2F1-null mice are predisposed to tumor development (19.Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 20.Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), suggesting that it also has properties of a growth suppressor. Induction of p27 may contribute to the tumor-suppressive function of E2F1 in vivo. We thank the Moffitt Molecular Biology Core and Flow Cytometry Core for their help in sequencing and FACS analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2094065347,"Members of the RME-1/mRme-1/EHD1 protein family have recently been shown to function in the recycling of membrane proteins from recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane. RME-1 family proteins are normally found in close association with recycling endosomes and the vesicles and tubules emanating from these endosomes, consistent with the proposal that these proteins directly participate in endosomal transport. RME-1 family proteins contain a C-terminal EH (eps15 homology) domain thought to be involved in linking RME-1 to other endocytic proteins, a coiled-coil domain thought to be involved in homo-oligomerization and an N-terminal P-loop domain thought to mediate nucleotide binding. In the present study, we show that both Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse RME-1 proteins bind and hydrolyze ATP. No significant GTP binding or hydrolysis was detected. Mutation or deletion of the ATP-binding P-loop prevented RME-1 oligomerization and at the same time dissociated RME-1 from endosomes. In addition, ATP depletion caused RME-1 to lose its endosome association in the cell, resulting in cytosolic localization. Taken together, these results indicate that ATP binding is required for oligomerization of mRme-1/EHD1, which in turn is required for its association with endosomes.

Taken together, these results indicate that ATP binding is required for oligomerization of mRme-1/EHD1, which in turn is required for its association with endosomes. The internalization and sorting of ligands and receptors by the endocytic pathway requires a network of proteins that orchestrate a complex series of membrane events. Regulation occurs on multiple levels including phosphorylation (1Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), ubiquitination (2Haglund K. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) abound in membrane trafficking pathways. These kinds, of proteins are thought to regulate, and in some cases utilize, energy, to perform work, changing the conformation of protein complexes and/or membrane lipids to promote transport. Receptors such as epidermal growth factor are ubiquitinated when internalized, routing them to the multivesicular body and ultimately to the lysosome, where they are degraded (2Haglund K. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 598-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Other receptors, such as the transferrin receptor, are recycled to the plasma membrane either directly or via the recycling endosome (9Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Efflux from the recycling endosome was shown to require the RME-1 protein (also referred to as mRme-1 or EHD1 in mammals), a role first indicated by Caenorhabditis elegans mutants defective in yolk endocytosis (10Grant B. Zhang Y. Paupard M-C. Lin S.X. Hall D.H. Hirsh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Not only is RME-1 critical in the recycling of the transferrin receptor internalized by clathrin-coated pits, but it is also involved in the recycling of major histocompatibility complex class 1 internalized in a clathrin-independent process (12Caplan S. Naslavsky N. Hartnell L.M. Lodge R. Polishchuk R.S. Donaldson J.G. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). RME-1 family members also function in the perinuclear sorting and insulin-regulated recycling of GLUT4 in cultured adipocytes (13Guilherme A. Soriano N.A. Furcinitti P.S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40062-40075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, RME-1 family proteins regulate the intracellular transport of a diverse group of membrane proteins. RME-1 has three predicted domains: an N-terminal P-loop nucleotide-binding domain, a central domain predicted to form a coiled-coil, and a C-terminal eps15 homology (EH) 1The abbreviations used are: EH, eps15 homology; EHD, EH domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; aa, amino acids; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; mRME-1, mammalian RME-1. 1The abbreviations used are: EH, eps15 homology; EHD, EH domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; aa, amino acids; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; mRME-1, mammalian RME-1. domain (10Grant B. Zhang Y. Paupard M-C. Lin S.X. Hall D.H. Hirsh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analysis suggested that EHD1 self-dimerizes or oligomerizes possibly through the activity of its coiled-coil domain (14Galperin E. Benjamin S. Rapaport D. Rotem-Yehudar R. Tolchinsky S. Horowitz M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Rotem-Yehudar R. Galperin E. Horowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33054-33060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). EHD1 also forms hetero-dimers or oligomers with EHD3, another member of the mammalian RME-1 protein family (14Galperin E. Benjamin S. Rapaport D. Rotem-Yehudar R. Tolchinsky S. Horowitz M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two dominant-negative mutations have been identified in RME-1 that interfere with endocytic recycling even in the presence of wild-type RME-1 (10Grant B. Zhang Y. Paupard M-C. Lin S.X. Hall D.H. Hirsh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). One dominant interfering mutation (G81R in C. elegans, G65R in mouse) was found in the P-loop. This form of the protein appears diffuse in the cell and lacks obvious endosome association. A second dominant interfering mutation was found very near the EH domain (G459R in C. elegans, G429R in mouse). This form of the protein remains associated with endosomal membranes and alters the morphology of endosomal membranes within the cell. The observation that a mutation in the P-loop of RME-1 inhibits endocytic recycling strongly suggests that nucleotide plays an important role in RME-1 function. Therefore, in the present study, we directly examined the nucleotide binding properties of both C. elegans RME-1 and mRme-1. First, we investigated whether RME-1 could bind GTP or ATP in vitro and whether nucleotide hydrolysis occurred. Having determined that RME-1 binds and hydrolyzes ATP but not GTP, we further investigated the role of ATP in the oligomerization of RME-1 and, in turn, its role in the localization of RME-1 in the cell. Our results suggest that the oligomerization of RME-1 is required for its association with endosomes. DNA Plasmids—The various GFP constructs of mRme-1 DNA were cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The coiled-coil region of mRme-1 was determined using the COILS software program. The primers used in constructing the deletion of the P-loop of mRme-1 (aa 1–80) were EcoRI, 5′-cacctgaattcgcaggacttcccggg-3′, and KpnI, 5′-gcggtacctcactcgtgcctccgtttggag-3′. The primers used in constructing the deletion of the coiled-coil region of mRme-1 (aa 195–236) were XhoI, 5′-ccgtctctcgagtcatgttcagctgggtg-3′, EcoRI, 5′-tctgagGAAtTcagcttgtgggcgtcg-3′, EcoRI, 5′-atacgggAATTCcatgtggtccctgg-3′, and KpnI, 5′-gcggtacctcactcgtgcctccgtttggag-3′. The primers used in constructing the deletion of the EH domain in mRme-1 (aa 1–422) were XhoI, 5′-ccgtctctcgagtcatgttcagctgggtg-3′, and the reverse primer was KpnI, 5′-gtagccggtaccaaagggcccattc-3′. The GFP constructs of wild-type mRme-1, mRme-1(G429R), and mRme-1(G65R) are described in Lin et al. (11Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). GST fusions for expression in Escherichia coli were made by cloning PCR-amplified segments of mRme-1 or Ce-rme-1(yk271a1) cDNAs into the vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length Ce-rme-1 was amplified with primers EcoRI_GSTrme1F (5′-cccggatccatgagtaatctttttgaagaaggac-3′) and SmaI_GSTrme1R (5′-ccccccgggtcattcatcgttgtcgttgagc-3′) and cloned into the vector pGEX-2T at like sites. Ce-RME-1 lacking a P-loop domain was amplified with primers BamHI_GSTNo-PloopF (5′-gggggatcctccgatttcccaggaatccga-3′) and SmaI_GSTrme1R (5′-ccccccgggtcattcatcgttgtcgttgagc-3′) and cloned into the vector pGEX-2T at like sites. Full-length mRme-1 was amplified with primers EcoRI_GSTmrme1F (5′-cccgaattcatatgttcagctgggtgagcaag-3′) and EcoRI_GSTmrme1R (5′-ggggaattctcactcgtgcctccgtttgga-3′) and cloned into the vector pGEX-2T at like sites. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) using the following primers: Ce-rme-1(G81R), 5′-ccaatgatcctgctcgtccgtcaatattcgaccggaaaa-3′ and 5′-ttttccggtcgaatattgacggacgagcaggatcattgg-3′; Ce-rme-1(G459R), 5′-gatgcacgctggggagaaagattcgacaagggagccg-3′ and 5′-cggctcccttgtcgaatctttctccccagcgtgcatc-3′; mRme-1-(G65R), 5′-ccgatggtgctcctggtccgccagtacagcaccggcaa-3′ and 5′-ttgccggtgctgtactggcggaccaggagcaccatcgg-3′; mRme-1(G429R), 5′-gggcatggctacggcgagcgggctggcgagggcattgatg-3′ and 5′-catcaatgccctcgccagcccgctcgccgtagccatgccc-3′. Plasmid sequences are available upon request. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—RME-1 was expressed in yeast cells both as a fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and as a fusion with the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain using the Proquest system (Invitrogen) as described previously (16Walhout A.J. Sordella R. Lu X. Hartley J.L. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Thierry-Mieg N. Vidal M. Science. 2000; 287: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 17Boulton S.J. Gartner A. Reboul J. Vaglio P. Dyson N. Hill D.E. Vidal M. Science. 2002; 295: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). If these two forms of RME-1 bind to each other, they reconstitute an active Gal4 transcription factor and allow expression of integrated reporter genes responsive to Gal4. The full rme-1 coding region from yk271a1 (aa 1–576), the N-terminal non-EH-containing region (aa 1–472), a short N-terminal P-loop-containing sequence (aa 1–218), a coiled-coil and EH domain-containing sequence (aa 97–576), or a C-terminal EH-domain containing region (aa 432–576) was PCR-amplified from cDNA yk271a1 and cloned into the NcoI and SpeI sites of Gal4-DNA-binding domain vector pDBleu (Invitrogen). Mutations equivalent to b1046 (G81R) and ar481 (G459R) were introduced into the full-length construct by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All PCR products were fully sequenced. Each of these rme-1 coding regions was then subcloned into Gal4-activation domain vector PC86. Pairwise combinations of pDBleu(bait) and PC86(prey) plasmids were then assayed for the ability to activate HIS3, LacZ, and URA3 reporter genes in yeast strain MaV203 according to the Proquest system manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). GST-Protein Preparation—E. coli BL21/DE3 cells were transformed with pGEX-2T1 encoding RME-1 constructs. Cells were grown for 4–5 h at 37 °C from a culture that was inoculated at a ratio of 1:10 from a stock culture that was grown overnight. Upon reaching an OD of 1.0 (600 nm), the cells were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then lysed by a probe sonicator. After adding Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.05%, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and then loaded onto a column containing 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation with the 1 ml of glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The eluate collected from three elutions of the column was dialyzed overnight against Buffer A (100 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0). Nucleotide Hydrolysis Activity—The ATPase and GTPase activities of various constructs of RME-1 were determined from the release of 32P from [γ32P]ATP and [γ32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), respectively. Purified proteins were incubated with radioactive nucleotide in Buffer A at 25 °C. At various times, aliquots were withdrawn, and the 32P extracted from the solution was determined by counting in a Beckman LS3801 liquid scintillation counter (18Chock S.P. Chock P.B. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3236-3243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chock S.P. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3229-3235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equilibrium Dialysis Studies—Equilibrium dialysis was performed in dialysis chambers (Technilab, Model E-l) containing 0.8 ml of solution on each side of the dialysis membrane. The solution consisted of 10 μm [14C]ADP (200 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and 30 units/ml creatine kinase/15 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma) or 10 μm [14C]ADP and 50 units/ml hexokinase/5 mm glucose (Sigma), whereas purified protein (10 μm) was added to only one side of the membrane at the beginning of the experiment. Then the dialysis chambers were gently rocked for 36 h at 4 °C. After dialysis, the nucleotide content of the solution on each side of the membrane was determined. Equilibrium dialysis was also performed using 10 μm [3H]GTP (1 mCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences), 3 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, and 1 unit/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma) or 10 μm [35S]GTPγS (1 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Tissue Culture and Western Blotting—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioSource International) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 unit/ml), and streptomycin (100 unit/ml) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with the plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were depleted of ATP by treatment with NaN3 and deoxyglucose as described in Wu et al. (20Wu X. Zhao X. Baylor L. Kaushal S. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Western blot of the GFP-RME-1 constructs expressed in HeLa cells was performed by running the cytosol on SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and then immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The GFP band, detected by using chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, catalog number 34080), was imaged using the densitometer (ChemiImager, Alpha Innotech Corp.). Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on two-chamber 25-mm2 coverslips (Labtek) were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. GFP-mRme-1 was imaged and photobleached using 488-nm laser light with a ×40, 1.4 NA objective. A defined region was photobleached at high laser power, resulting in 50–80% reduction in the fluorescence intensity. Scanning at low laser power monitored the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. When data sets were compared, identical conditions were used in photobleaching the cells including the number of bleaches, the area of the photobleach region, and the time course of imaging at low laser power. Measuring diffusive GFP constructs on a fast time scale, we used the method as described in Zeng et al. (21Zeng X.C. Bhasin S. Wu X. Lee J.G. Maffi S. Nichols C.J. Lee K.J. Taylor J.P. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4991-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—For each experimental condition, a minimum of eight data sets was averaged to get the mean and standard deviation for each time point. Setting the maximum fluorescence to 100% and the minimum fluorescence to 0% normalized the fluorescence intensity data in each experiment. The very low laser intensity used in scanning the cell after the initial photobleach did not cause significant bleaching during our experiments, and therefore, no correction was necessary for this effect. Although the fluorescence of the total GFP pool in the cell was unaffected by scanning, the total recovery in most experiments was only about 80% of the initial fluorescence because about 20% of the total GFP pool in the cell was bleached by the initial bleach. RME-1 Binds and Hydrolyzes ATP—Since all members of the RME-1/EHD1 protein family have a potential P-loop type nucleotide-binding site, we sought to determine whether C. elegans and mRme-1 could hydrolyze ATP and/or GTP in vitro. Recombinant C. elegans and mRme-1 proteins, expressed as GST fusions, were purified by affinity chromatography to yield single bands on SDS gels (Fig. 1). The molecular masses of these fusion proteins were, as predicted, about 100 kDa. The P-loop mutation of Ce-RME-1, Ce-RME-1(G81R), gave much lower yields than other forms of the protein, and following dialysis and centrifugation, there was essentially no remaining protein. Unlike the other purified recombinant proteins, this mutant protein was highly insoluble when expressed in E. coli, and the little protein we were able to purify aggregated during purification. This could reflect an inability of the P-loop region to fold into a stable domain in G81R mutants. We initially measured the ability of purified mRme-1 to hydrolyze nucleotide in the presence of either 40 μm ATP or 40 μm GTP. In Fig. 2A, in which the hydrolysis of these nucleotides is measured as a function of time, mRme-1 showed 6-fold greater ATPase activity than GTPase activity under identical conditions. Double purification of mRme-1 on a GST-agarose column did not alter its ATPase activity, indicating that contaminants were not responsible for the observed hydrolysis of ATP. Furthermore, GST-mRme-1 lacking a P-loop domain lacked ATP hydrolysis activity, also indicating that mRme-1 and not contaminants was responsible for the measured activity. The ATPase activity of wild-type and G459R Ce-RME-1 was essentially the same as that of mRme-1. One possible explanation for the dominant-negative activity of RME-1(G459R) would be that it is ATPase-defective, although its mutation is in the EH domain, and thus locked into one conformational state of a nucleotide regulated cycle (10Grant B. Zhang Y. Paupard M-C. Lin S.X. Hall D.H. Hirsh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 22Wendland B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E133-E135Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, since the G459R mutation did not significantly alter the ATPase activity of Ce-RME-1, we do not favor this model. It is still possible, however, that the G459R mutation alters ligand-stimulated ATPase activity without altering basal activity. To further characterize the ATPase activity of these recombinant RME-1 proteins, we measured the ATPase activity of these proteins at varying concentrations of ATP. A double reciprocal plot of ATPase activity versus ATP concentration is plotted in Fig. 2B. From these plots, we calculated the Vmax for mRme-1 as 2 × 10–3 s–1, whereas the Vmax of wild-type and G459R mutant of Ce-RME-1 was slightly lower, about 30–50% of mRme-1. The Km for ATP was about 80 μm for mRme-1 and about 30–40 μm for the C. elegans proteins. Our data show that both the mouse and the C. elegans RME-1 proteins have significant ATPase activity, although their affinity for ATP is relatively weak. The similarity in the binding and hydrolysis of ATP between mouse and C. elegans RME-1 is not unexpected since their P-loop domains are highly homologous. When we measured the GTPase rate of mRME-1 at varying GTP concentrations (40–100 μm), the rate did not level off with increasing concentrations of nucleotide (data not shown). This indicates that mRME-1 has a very weak Km for GTP. To definitively establish the preference of RME-1 for ATP over GTP, we performed equilibrium dialysis studies on Ce-RME-1 using labeled ATP and GTP. Due to the relatively large volume of soluble recombinant RME-1 required for this assay, the highest protein concentration we were able to use was 10 μm. As shown in Table I, at 10 μm concentration of nucleotide and protein, we obtained measurable binding of ATP. Assuming one nucleotide-binding site per molecule, the Kd for ATP was calculated to be about 30 μm for both Ce-RME-1 and Ce-RME-1(G459R), consistent with the Km value obtained from the double reciprocal plots of ATPase activity for these proteins. We could not detect any binding of GTP or GTPγS to Ce-RME-1 under identical conditions. We were unable to detect binding of ATP or GTP to mRme-1 in this assay, as expected given the relatively weak Km for ATP determined by nucleotide hydrolysis analysis.Table IVmax, Km, and Kd values for RME-1ATPaseDissociation constantVmaxKmATPGTPs-1μmμmmRme-12 × 10-380>60>60Ce-RME-11 × 10-33030 ± 15>60Ce-RME-1(G459R)5 × 10-44025 ± 10>60 Open table in a new tab RME-1 Oligomerization Depends on the P-loop—Having shown that one of the key properties of RME-1 is its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, we were interested in determining whether this interaction with ATP is related to another key property of RME-1, its ability to oligomerize. RME-1 family proteins have been shown to dimerize or oligomerize, presumably through interactions involving the central coiled-coil domain (14Galperin E. Benjamin S. Rapaport D. Rotem-Yehudar R. Tolchinsky S. Horowitz M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Rotem-Yehudar R. Galperin E. Horowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33054-33060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); similar coiled-coil domains have been shown to be involved in oligomerization of other proteins such as dynamin. We therefore examined whether mutations in the P-loop affect oligomerization of RME-1. We first confirmed that wild-type Ce-RME-1 molecules interact using the yeast two-hybrid system and found a strong and specific response, indicating that RME-1 monomers self-associate (Table II, supplemental Fig. S1). We then investigated the structural requirements for the RME-1:RME-1 interaction (Table II, supplemental Fig. S1) and found that whereas the EH domain was not required for interaction in the two-hybrid assay, both the coiled-coil domain and the P-loop domain were required. Of particular interest was our finding that Ce-RME-1(G81R), the dominant-negative P-loop mutant, failed to interact with itself or wild-type RME-1 in this assay. Similarly, Ce-RME-1(Δ P-loop), in which the P-loop was deleted, prevented RME-1 from interacting with itself or wild-type Ce-RME-1. In contrast, the dominant-negative G459R mutation near the EH domain did not interfere with the ability of Ce-RME-1 to interact with itself or wild-type Ce-RME-1. Therefore, our results with the yeast two-hybrid system indicate that an active ATP-binding domain is required for RME-1 to oligomerize. These results also indicate that the two dominant-negative forms of RME-1, G81R and G459R, likely interfere with recycling by different mechanisms (see “Discussion”).Table IIRequirements for RME-1 dimerization The ability of two Ce-RME-1 molecules to interact was assayed in the yeast two-hybrid system. Full-length RME-1 isoform IV from cDNA yk271a1, or portions thereof, was expressed as Gal4 fusion proteins in yeast and tested for the ability to reconstitute Gal4 transcription factor activity (see “Materials and Methods”). Significant protein motifs are indicated with the following symbols: P, P-loop domain, CC, coiled-coil domain, EH, EH domain. + (red fill) denotes activation of HIS3, LACZ, and URA3 reporter genes. –(grey fill) denotes lack of activation of HIS3, LACZ, and URA3 reporter genes. Empty black fill denotes tests not done. Expression of proteins failing to interact was confirmed by Western blot with antibodies to Gal4 DB or Gal4 AD. Quantitation of β-galactosidase activity (denoted by superscript numbers) is shown in Supplemental Fig. S1. Open table in a new tab Distribution of RME-1 in Vivo—Previous studies by Grant et al. (10Grant B. Zhang Y. Paupard M-C. Lin S.X. Hall D.H. Hirsh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) examining RME-1 function and localization in C. elegans showed that endogenous RME-1 with a dominant-negative point mutation in its P-loop domain (G81R) was cytosolic, whereas wild-type RME-1 and dominant-negative RME-1 with a point mutation near its EH domain (G459R) localized to cortical endosomes. Lin et al. (11Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) showed similar findings for GFP-tagged mRme-1, mutated at equivalent positions, G65R and G429R, expressed in tissue culture cells. These data suggest that polymerization of RME-1 is necessary for its localization to endosomal membranes. To test this proposition further, we expressed several new GFP-mRme-1 fusion proteins in cultured cells and analyzed their subcellular distribution. The first mutation was a deletion of the mRme-1 P-loop domain, GFP-mRme-1(Δ P-loop). This variant should not be able to bind nucleotide, as demonstrated in our in vitro assays (see above). The second mutation was a deletion of the major coiled-coil region of Rme-1(Δ coiled-coil), which should prevent mRme-1 from oligomerizing, as we found for a similar mutant RME-1 protein assayed for oligomerization in the yeast two-hybrid system. The third mutation was a deletion of the EH domain (Δ EH) of mRme-1, which should eliminate binding to partner proteins through this domain. Finally, we also expressed and analyzed the membrane association of existing GFP-mRme-1 fusion proteins G65R and G429R. All of these GFP-mRME-1 constructs, when expressed in HeLa cells, showed no significant degradation, as shown by the Western blot of these proteins (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the data of Lin et al. (11Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), our results showed that wild-type GFP-mRme-1 and GFP-mRme-1(G429R) are bound to membranous structures, whereas GFP-mRme-1(G65R) is cytosolic. The distribution of mRme-1(Δ EH) was similar to that of wild-type and mRme-1(G429R) (Fig. 3, A–C). Interestingly, the other two mutants, GFP-mRme-1(Δ P-loop) and GFP-mRme-1(Δ coiled-coil), gave a cytosolic appearance similar to the P-loop point mutant, G65R (Fig. 3, E and F). These results indicated that the association of mRme-1 with membranes is dependent on both nucleotide binding and homo-oligomerization. To confirm these results, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to determine whether the mRme-1 variants that appeared to be in the cytosol indeed showed rapid recovery after photobleaching in comparison with the variants that appeared to be membrane-bound. As shown in Fig. 4A, the membrane-bound GFP fusions of wild-type, G429R, and Δ EH mRme-1s recovered after photobleaching with a half-life of about 1 min. On the other hand, the GFP-mRme-1 fusions that appeared cytosolic, G65R, Δ P-loop, and Δ coiled-coil, showed a very rapid fluorescence recovery after photobleaching with a recovery half-life of about 1 s, only about twice that of GFP alone (Fig. 4B). This very rapid recovery was consistent with a free cytosolic localization of these proteins. These results suggested that when oligomerization of mRme-1 is prevented, either by deletion of the coiled-coil domain or by interference with the interaction of ATP with the P-loop domain, mRme-1 is unable to bind membranes and remains free in the cytosol. If ATP binding is required for RME-1 to bind to membranes, we would expect that depletion of cellular ATP by NaN3 and deoxyglucose treatment would cause mRme-1 to dissociate from endosomes. In agreement with this prediction, nucleotide depletion caused a dramatic alteration of the localization of wild-type, G429R mutant, and the EH deletion mutant forms of GFP-tagged mRme-1 (Fig. 3, G–I). These GFP fusions, which were initially associated with the endosomes, upon depletion of cellular ATP became mostly diffusive, indicating a cytosolic localization. Furthermore, when photobleached, their half-life of fluorescence recovery was about 1 s, showing that they are indeed free in the cytosol rather than membrane-bound (Fig. 5A). In fact, their recovery rates were indistinguishable from the three cytosolic GFP-mRme-1 mutant constructs, Δ coiledcoil, Δ P-loop, and G65R point mutants, measured in the presence of nucleotide (Fig. 4B). When the latter three mutants were depleted of nucleotide, their appearance was still diffusive (Fig. 3, G–I). Surprisingly, however, their rate of fluorescence recovery in the absence of nucleotide was much slower than in its presence (Fig. 5B). In addition, about one-third of the diffusive-appearing mRme-1 mutant proteins was now immobilized. In contrast, the rate of recovery after photobleaching of GFP alone was not affected by ATP depletion (Fig. 5, A and B). The effect of ATP depletion on the diffusive-appearing mRme-1 proteins likely occured because these forms of the protein were less well folded than other forms and require the action of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones such as Hsc70 to maintain them disaggregated in the cytosol. In any event, our data obtained after ATP depletion supported the view that RME-1 proteins must interact with ATP to bind to membranes. Since an intact ATP-binding site was also required for RME-1 oligomerization, the nucleotide status of RME-1 protein may regulate membrane association by regulating its oligomerization status. The function of the EH domain-containing protein RME-1 in protein trafficking was first revealed in a screen for proteins that are required for efficient receptor-mediated endocytosis in C. elegans (10Grant B. Zhang Y. Paupard M-C. Lin S.X. Hall D.H. Hirsh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This study, as well as a companion study in mammalian cells (11Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), showed that RME-1 is required for the recycling of proteins that enter endosomes through the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. In particular, the latter study showed that a dominant-negative mRme-1(G429R) mutant mutated near its EH domain inhibited recycling of the transferrin receptor (11Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicated that a defect in recycling of the C. elegans yolk receptor RME-2, a low density lipoprotein receptor homologue, is the primary defect resulting in defective yolk uptake in RME-1 mutant oocytes (10Grant B. Zhang Y. Paupard M-C. Lin S.X. Hall D.H. Hirsh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Many subsequent studies have identified other membrane proteins in both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent uptake pathways that require RME-1 family proteins to recycle from endosomes to the plasma membrane (12Caplan S. Naslavsky N. Hartnell L.M. Lodge R. Polishchuk R.S. Donaldson J.G. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 13Guilherme A. Soriano N.A. Furcinitti P.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33054-33060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, RME-1 is a general regulator of protein transport from recycling endosomes back to the plasma membrane. RME-1/mRme-1/EHD1 has been shown to interact with several other proteins that are likely to function with RME-1 during membrane transport processes. EHD1/mRme-1 has been shown to form dimers or hetero-oligomers with the highly related protein EHD3 (14Galperin E. Benjamin S. Rapaport D. Rotem-Yehudar R. Tolchinsky S. Horowitz M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, EHD1/mRme-1 interacts through its EH domain with an actin-associated protein EHBP1 that, like EHD1/mRme-1 itself, is required for insulin-stimulated translocation of the GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (13Guilherme A. Soriano N.A. Furcinitti P.S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40062-40075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Finally, EHD1/mRme-1 has been shown to interact through its EH domain with Rabenosyn-5, a Rab4/Rab5 effector that plays an important role in transport from early endosomes to recycling endosomes (23Naslavsky N. Boehm M. Backlund Jr., P.S. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2410-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that both Ce-RME-1 and mRme-1 bind and hydrolyze ATP. Although the Km for ATP (30–80 μm) was rather weak, we could not detect any GTP binding, and therefore, we are confident that RME-1 is an ATP-rather than a GTP-binding protein, especially since the ATP concentration in living cells is significantly higher than the GTP concentration (24Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Only with a co-factor that would have to change the relative affinity of both GTP and ATP can mRME-1 be a GTPase in the cell. Although the ATP hydrolysis rate was very slow, it is possible that one or more of the large number of proteins with which RME-1 interacts activates the RME-1 ATPase activity at an appropriate time and place. Alternatively, ATP hydrolysis could be related to the in vivo oligomerization of RME-1. Our data strongly suggested that interaction with ATP is required for RME-1 to oligomerize and that this oligomerization, in turn, is required for the RME-1 to bind to membranes in the cell. Mutation or deletion of the P-loop region caused most of the GFP-mRme-1 to dissociate from membranous structures, as did mutation of the coiled-coil domain. Furthermore, the dissociated protein was clearly cytosolic, as shown by the rate of recovery after photobleaching, being only twice that of GFP alone. In contrast, GFP-mRme-1 bound to membranes showed a much slower mobility. Depletion of ATP from the cell also caused GFP-mRme-1 to dissociate from membranes, and in the case of wild-type mRme-1, the rate of recovery after photobleaching indicated high mobility indicative of free diffusion in the cytosol. Mutant forms of the mRme-1 protein displayed lower mobility as determined by their rates of recovery, perhaps because mutant forms tend to aggregate after poor folding if they are not chaperoned by ATP-binding chaperones such as Hsp70. Interestingly, the dominant-negative form of mRme-1, G429R, and a mutant form reported by some groups to be dominant-negative, Δ EH, not only still bound to membranes, but the photobleaching results showed that they exchange with cytosolic mRme-1 at the same rate as wild-type mRme-1. Therefore, these mutant forms of RME-1 probably still oligomerize (as demonstrated in our yeast two-hybrid analysis) and bind to membranes. These mutant forms lack a functional EH domain and so are probably not able to interact with EH-binding proteins in a way that allows them to complete a normal duty cycle on the membrane. When these types of dominant-negative mutant RME-1 proteins oligomerize with wild-type RME-1, the hetero-oligomers may be non-functional and sequester endogenous wild-type RME-1 in non-productive complexes, an effect that can be overcome by co-overexpression of wild-type RME-1 (10Grant B. Zhang Y. Paupard M-C. Lin S.X. Hall D.H. Hirsh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative activity of P-loop mutants such as G81R/G65R is likely to occur by a very different mechanism since such mutants cannot bind to endogenous wild-type RME-1 proteins (this work). This type of mutant RME-1 likely titrates out co-factors into non-functional complexes in the cytoplasm. Our findings indicated that RME-1 requires ATP to oligomerize and that oligomerization is required for RME-1 to bind to membranes. Combined with observations that RME-1 may be involved in the formation of tubules that exit from recycling endosomes, our results raised the possibility that RME-1 acts in a manner similar to dynamin during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (4Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). In this model, oligomerization of RME-1 would be accompanied by ATP hydrolysis and would cause fission of tubules emanating from the recycling endosome. Dominant-negative RME-1 bearing a G429R mutation near the EH domain would interfere with the normal action of the oligomerized RME-1 by co-polymerizing with it and preventing its normal interaction with other proteins through its EH domain. Testing this model will require further studies of the ability of RME-1 to oligomerize as well as the relation of this oligomerization to ATP hydrolysis. Further studies to identify other protein partners of RME-1 and their effect on its ATP hydrolysis will also be necessary. Finally, it may be of interest to determine whether oligomerized RME-1, either alone or perhaps when bound to partner proteins, is able to interact with lipid vesicles in the same manner as dynamin, epsin, and amphyphisin.

https://openalex.org/W1986380943,"To investigate the biological significance of a longevity mutation found in daf-2 of Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated a homologous murine model by replacing Pro-1195 of insulin receptors with Leu using a targeted knock-in strategy. Homozygous mice died in the neonatal stage from diabetic ketoacidosis, whereas heterozygous mice showed the suppressed kinase activity of the insulin receptor but grew normally without spontaneously developing diabetes during adulthood. We examined heterozygous insulin receptor mutant mice for longevity phenotypes. Under 80% oxygen, mutant female mice survived 33.3% longer than wild-type female mice, whereas mutant male mice survived 18.2% longer than wild-type male mice. These results suggested that mutant mice acquired more resistance to oxidative stress, but the benefit of the longevity mutation was more pronounced in females than males. Manganese superoxide dismutase activity in mutant mice was significantly upregulated, suggesting that the suppressed insulin signaling leads to an enhanced antioxidant defense. To analyze the molecular basis of the gender difference, we administered estrogen to mutant mice. It was found that the survival of mice under 80% oxygen was extended when they were administered estradiol. In contrast, mutant and wild-type female mice showed shortened survivals when their ovaries were removed. The influence of estrogen is remarkable in mutant mice compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that estrogen modulates insulin signaling in mutant mice. Furthermore, we showed additional extension of survival under oxidative conditions when their diet was restricted. Collectively, we show that three distinct signals; insulin, estrogen, and dietary signals work in independent and cooperative ways to enhance the resistance to oxidative stress in mice. To investigate the biological significance of a longevity mutation found in daf-2 of Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated a homologous murine model by replacing Pro-1195 of insulin receptors with Leu using a targeted knock-in strategy. Homozygous mice died in the neonatal stage from diabetic ketoacidosis, whereas heterozygous mice showed the suppressed kinase activity of the insulin receptor but grew normally without spontaneously developing diabetes during adulthood. We examined heterozygous insulin receptor mutant mice for longevity phenotypes. Under 80% oxygen, mutant female mice survived 33.3% longer than wild-type female mice, whereas mutant male mice survived 18.2% longer than wild-type male mice. These results suggested that mutant mice acquired more resistance to oxidative stress, but the benefit of the longevity mutation was more pronounced in females than males. Manganese superoxide dismutase activity in mutant mice was significantly upregulated, suggesting that the suppressed insulin signaling leads to an enhanced antioxidant defense. To analyze the molecular basis of the gender difference, we administered estrogen to mutant mice. It was found that the survival of mice under 80% oxygen was extended when they were administered estradiol. In contrast, mutant and wild-type female mice showed shortened survivals when their ovaries were removed. The influence of estrogen is remarkable in mutant mice compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that estrogen modulates insulin signaling in mutant mice. Furthermore, we showed additional extension of survival under oxidative conditions when their diet was restricted. Collectively, we show that three distinct signals; insulin, estrogen, and dietary signals work in independent and cooperative ways to enhance the resistance to oxidative stress in mice. Recent experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress is a principle cause of aging (1Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7419) Google Scholar). Biochemical data further support the hypothesis that the oxidative damage accumulated in macromolecules such as DNAs, lipids, and proteins leads to the physiological decline in aging tissues. In a genetic analysis of invertebrate models, longevity mutants have been identified that show extension of lifespan associated with an enhanced resistance to oxidative stress (2Martin G.M. Austad S.N. Johnson T.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, a mutation of the daf-2 gene that encodes an insulin/insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor type 1; AL, ad libitum; Cu/ZnSOD, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; DR, dietary restriction; E2, 17β-estradiol; IR, insulin receptor; OVX, ovariectomy; ROS, reactive oxygen species; wt, wild type; kb, kilobase; RT, reverse transcription. receptor significantly enhanced resistance to oxidative stress and extended lifespan (3Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). These phenotypes are regulated by the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway from DAF-2 to DAF-16, a homologue of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead transcription factor (4Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudner A. Tabtiang R. Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar, 5Honda Y. Honda S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of sod3 encoding manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is up-regulated in daf-2 mutants (5Honda Y. Honda S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In insulin-like signaling mutants of flies, it is suggested that the increased expression of SOD genes confers resistance to oxidative stress and the extension of lifespan (6Clancy D.J. Gems D. Harshman L.G. Oldham S. Stocker H. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2001; 292: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of SOD levels is critical for the determination of lifespan, which is modified by the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. This signaling pathway has evidently been conserved from C. elegans to Drosophila (5Honda Y. Honda S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 6Clancy D.J. Gems D. Harshman L.G. Oldham S. Stocker H. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2001; 292: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Holzenberger et al. (7Holzenberger M. Dupont J. Ducos B. Leneuve P. Geloen A. Even P.C. Cervera P. Le Bouc Y. Nature. 2003; 421: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) reported that a heterozygous deficiency for the IGF-1 receptor in mice enhances resistance to oxidative stress and extends lifespan. Because in IGF-1 receptor deficient mice heterozygous females exhibited a greater increase in lifespan than males, the beneficial effect of reduced IGF-1 signaling is also modulated by gender difference. However, it is unclear whether insulin signaling controls tolerance to oxidative stress and the extension of lifespan in mammals or is modulated by gender difference. In humans, the life expectancy of women is generally longer than that of men. For example, in Japan, with the highest life expectancy in the world, life expectancy was 78.36 years for men and 85.33 years for women in 2003. However, in laboratory animal models, the relationship of gender to longevity is variable, with lifespan being dependent on other factors like breeding and diet (8Smith D.W. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1989; 64: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Borras et al. (9Borras C. Sastre J. Garcia-Sala D. Lloret A. Pallardo F.V. Vina J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) paid attention to the gender difference in rats, reporting that the expression and enzyme activity levels of MnSOD as well as glutathione peroxidase are higher in females than males. Ho et al. (10Ho Y.S. Vincent R. Dey M.S. Slot J.W. Crapo J.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reported that human MnSOD transgenic mice showed a significant increase in survival when exposed to 90% oxygen. Furthermore, in pulmonary epithelial cells of mice the overexpression of human MnSOD confers protection against exposure to hyperoxygen (11Wispe J.R. Warner B.B. Clark J.C. Dey C.R. Neuman J. Glasser S.W. Crapo J.D. Chang L.Y. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23937-23941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of antioxidant enzymes including MnSOD plays an important role in the determination of lifespan, suggesting that the gender difference in antioxidant enzymes explains the difference in life expectancy between females and males. In the present study we generated a homologous murine model similar to the daf-2 mutant (IrP1195L/wt) mouse in order to investigate the biological significance of longevity mutations found in the daf-2 gene of C. elegans. We demonstrated that the mutant mice acquired an enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. Furthermore, we also revealed that the influence of gender difference and dietary restriction (DR) on the acquired resistance involved defective insulin signaling. Generation of Insulin Receptor (IR) Mutant Mice—The 129 mouse genomic library in λFIXII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with rat IR cDNA containing exon 19–21 as a probe. Three overlapping clones covered exon 15–22 of the mouse IR gene. The 1.1-kb fragment containing exon 20 of the gene was PCR-amplified with two SpeI-anchored primers (5′-GGA CTA GTA GCA TTG AGA ACT GGA-3′ and 5′-GGA CTA GTA CCT GAG TTC AAT GCC A-3′). The SpeI-restricted fragment carrying exon 20 was mutagenized with a 19-bp mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-GGA TGT CAC TCG AGT CCC T-3′) using the pALTER system (Promega, Madison, WI). The introduced mutation, P1195L, was confirmed present by sequencing. The 2.6-kb short 3′ homologous fragment was amplified with a XhoI-anchored primer (5′-CCG CTC GAG ATA GAG ACT ATT GTA CG-3′) and an ApaI/NotI-anchored primer (5′-ATG GGC CCG CGG CCG CTG TGA ACA TAC CTC TG-3′). XhoI/ApaI-restricted short 3′ homologous fragments were inserted into a XhoI/ApaI-restricted pBluescript II SK (pBSII SK, Stratagene) vector. The 1.3-kb MC1neo cassette flanked by the loxp sequence was PCR-amplified from a pMC1neo-lox vector (12Taniguchi M. Sanbo M. Watanabe S. Naruse I. Mishina M. Yagi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with a SalI-anchored primer (5′-CGC GTC GAC ATA ACT TCG TAT AAT G-3′) and a SalI/EcoRI-anchored primer (5′-CGC GTC GAC GAA TTC ATC GAT ACC GGC GAC ATA-3′). The SalI-restricted MC1neo-loxp cassette was inserted into a XhoI-restricted pBSII SK vector containing the short 3′ homologous fragment. The SmaI/SalI-restricted fragment including a mutagenized exon 20 was inserted into a SmaI/SalI-restricted pBSII SK vector containing a short 3′ homologous fragment and a MC1neo-loxp cassette. The 7.3-kb-long 5′ homologous fragment was PCR-amplified with a NotI-anchored primer (5′-ATT TGC GGC CGC TGG CTA ACA ACT GAC TC-3′) and an SmaI-anchored primer (5′-TCC CCC GGG TTT CTT GAG ACG AGC-3′). The NotI/SmaI-restricted long 5′ homologous fragment was inserted into a NotI/SmaI-restricted pMC1DT-A (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan). The resulting construct encompassing the fragment carrying a modified exon 20, the MC1neo-loxp cassette, and the short 3′ homologous fragment was restricted with NotI, blunted, and inserted into SmaI-restricted pMC1DT-A containing the long 5′ homologous fragment. The vector was then linearized with NotI and used for the electroporation of embryonic stem cells. Genomic DNAs from 240 G418-resistant embryonic stem clones were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting. One embryonic stem clone with the expected homologous recombination was used for generating chimeric mice by the aggregation method as described (13Nagy Z.P. Joris H. Liu J. Staessen C. Devroey P. Van Steirteghem A.C. Hum. Reprod. 1993; 8: 2180-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The chimeric mice were cross-bred with C57BL/6CrSlc (Nihon SLC), and the germline transmission was confirmed by PCR amplification with the primers 5′-GCA TGT ATG TGG ACA CT-3′ and 5′-GTG GAG GTC ATG GTT GAG CA-3′ in agouti offspring. To analyze the sequence of the mutated allele in IR mutant mice, we prepared IR transcripts containing exons 19–21 from livers of homozygous embryos by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using as primers 5′-GCG AAT TCA ATA ACC CAG GCC GCC CT-3′ and 5′-AGT CTC TCT GGA CAG TTA TCA-3′, as described below. We confirmed the presence of the introduced mutation, P1195L, and the absence of additional mutations in exon 20 of the transcripts by sequencing. To delete the neomycin resistance gene from the germline, we cross-bred heterozygous mice with CAG-Cre mice (kindly provided by Dr. Miyazaki, Osaka University) (14Sakai K. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Animals were housed in specific pathogen-free facilities on a 12-h light/dark cycle (0800 on, 2000 off) and were fed a standard rodent chow (mouse diet CRF-1, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo) and water ad libitum (AL). All protocols for animal use and experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. Southern Blotting and PCR Analysis—For the knock-in allele, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV, subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel, and then transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized with a HincII/HincII fragment as a 3′ probe, and the fragment was visualized using a Bioimage analyzer BAS-1000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). To differentiate wild-type and mutated alleles, we amplified the genomic fragment harboring exons 20 and 21 by PCR with a sense primer (P1, 5′-GGA ATG ACA AGG GAC ATC TA-3′) and antisense primer (P2, 5′-CAC CTG TTC ATT AGA CAG GCC-3′). PCR products were then digested with EcoRI to separate wild-type and mutated alleles. Tyrosine Kinase Assay of IR—Livers from day1 neonates were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The insoluble material was separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a wheat germ lectin-agarose column pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors. The column was extensively washed using buffer A, and the bound glycoproteins, such as IR, were eluted in buffer A containing 0.3 mN-acetylglucosamine. Aliquots of eluate were incubated in the absence or presence of 0.1 nm insulin (Eli Lilly) for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 0.1 nm ATP. After 20 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of stopping solution containing 0.1 m NaF, 4 mm NaVO3, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-IR antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Ebina, Tokushima University) (15Imanaka T. Hayashi H. Kishi K. Wang L. Ishii K. Hazeki O. Katada T. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25347-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled phosphoproteins were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. Measurement of Protein Kinase B Phosphorylation—Mice were injected intravenously with 0.75 units kg-1 insulin or equal volume of vehicle. All tissues were collected in liquid nitrogen 5 min after the injection. Frozen tissues were homogenized with 6 (for muscle) or 10 (for liver and kidney) times the volume of the tissue in homogenization buffer (1% Triton X, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaVO3, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Phosphorylation at Ser-473 of protein kinase B in tissue extracts was analyzed with anti-phosphoprotein kinase B Ser-473 and anti-protein kinase B antibodies (Cell Signaling) as described (16Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Oxidative Stress—Twenty (4-month-old) mice were continuously exposed to 80% oxygen for 14 days in a chamber (50 × 30 × 30 cm). The concentration of fractional inspired O2 in the chamber was monitored with an oxygen analyzer (G-101-Y, Iijima Products, Gamagouri, Japan) and maintained with a constant flow of 80% oxygen gas (3 liters/min). Exposure was continuous for the time indicated except for a few minutes when the chamber was opened for housekeeping purposes weekly. The mice were fed food and water ad libitum and kept on a 12-h dark-light cycle at 25 °C. We checked the survival of mice every 12 h. As chemical oxidative stress, the mice (4-month-old) were intraperitoneally injected with paraquat (Sigma) prepared in phosphate-buffered saline at a dose of 70 mg/kg of body weight. We checked the survival of mice every 2 h until 120 h after the injection. Analytical Procedures—Blood glucose levels were determined in fed mice (3, 6, and 12 months old) using an automatic monitor, Gluco-card (Hoechst Marion Roussel). Serum insulin levels were measured in 16-week-old mice. Serum obtained from fed mice was analyzed for insulin using a mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Shibayagi, Japan). In glucose tolerance tests fasting (4-month-old) mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 g/kg body weight of 20% d-glucose. Blood glucose values were determined in whole blood obtained from the tail at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the glucose injection. In insulin tolerance tests, 4-month-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 units/kg of body weight of insulin. Blood glucose values were measured at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after the injection. SOD Activity Assay—Livers were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin, then sonicated 10 times using the handy sonicator. The lysates were spun at 15,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris. SOD activity was measured by a competitive assay as described previously (17Ikegami T. Suzuki Y. Shimizu T. Isono K. Koseki H. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The amount of protein that inhibits the tetrazolium dye WST-1 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) reduction to 50% of maximum is defined as 1 unit of SOD activity. Enzymatic activity was expressed in units per mg of protein. To measure MnSOD activity, KCN was added to tissue lysates at a final concentration of 1 mm to inhibit the cupper/zinc (Cu/Zn) SOD activity. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Tissues were homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase from 1 μg of total RNA using a RNA PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc., Japan). Mouse MnSOD, Cu/ZnSOD, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs were amplified using specific oligonucleotide primers (MnSOD, 5′-GAC CTG CCT TAC GAC TAT GG-3′ and 5′-GAC CTT GCT CCT TAT TGA AGC-3′; Cu/ZnSOD, 5′-ATG AAA GCG GTG TGC GTG CTG-3′ and 5′-AAT CAC TCC ACA GGC CAA GCG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TCG GTG TGA ACG GAT TTG GC-3′ and 5′-ATT TCT CGT GGT TCA CAC CC-3′). PCR products were electrophoresed and visualized using ethidium bromide. Ovariectomy (OVX) and Estradiol (E2) Administration—At 12 weeks of age, female mice were ovariectomized or sham-operated via a midline incision under anesthesia with pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection). After 4 weeks, treated mice were exposed to 80% oxygen or SOD activity, and gene expression levels were analyzed. Male (12-week-old) mice and OVX female (16-week-old) mice were administered a weekly subcutaneous injection of 17β-estradiol (20 mg/kg per week; Sigma) in corn oil (Ajinomoto, Japan). After 4 weeks of treatment, the male and female mice were exposed to 80% oxygen. E2-treated male mice were analyzed for SOD activity and gene expression. DR—At 16 weeks of age we measured food intake per day in male and female mice and randomly assigned the mice to two groups, AL and DR. Four mice were housed in every cage (20 × 10 × 20 cm). The mice in the AL group were fed freely, whereas those in the DR group were fed a restricted diet on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. First, DR mice were fed a 10%-restricted diet for a week, and then the restricted diet was gradually reduced by 65% for 3 weeks. Finally, DR consisted of 65% of food intake in AL mice. We adjusted the amount of restricted diet by measuring food intake in AL mice every 10 weeks. We housed DR mice until the age of 60 weeks. The Generation of Modified IR Mutant Mice—To elucidate the biological significance of the longevity mutation found in the daf-2 mutant of C. elegans, we generated a homologous murine model by replacing Pro-1195 of IR with Leu by targeted knock-in of the genomic IR gene in mice. As shown in Fig. 1A, we first isolated an ES cell carrying a mutation homologous to daf-2 (e1391) (3Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar), i.e. Leu-1195 in exon 20 of the IR genomic gene by homologous recombination with the target vector. Germline transmission was confirmed in the F1 offspring of the chimeric and C57BLACK/6 mice by Southern blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, the blot showed that the 3′ probe detected a 6.2-kb polymorphic EcoRV allele in wild-type (Irwt/wt) as well as heterozygous (IrP1195L/wt) mice, whereas the probe detected a 7.5-kb mutant EcoRV allele in heterozygous and homozygous (IrP1195L/P1195L) mice. To delete the neomycin resistance gene from the germline, we cross-bred IrP1195L/wt mice with CAG-Cre mice (14Sakai K. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We successfully deleted the neomycin resistance gene from the germline by cross-breeding CAG-Cre mice as schematized in the bottom of Fig. 1A. To detect the wild-type and mutant alleles, we amplified the genomic fragment harboring exon 20 and 21 by PCR with a sense primer (P1) and an antisense primer (P2). The PCR products were then differentiated based on the EcoRI site that is specifically introduced with the knock-in allele (Fig. 1C). A genotypic analysis of the offspring showed that the frequency of wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous mice was 31:61:0 at the 4-week-old stage. Further observation, however, showed that some mice were identified as homozygous at 1 day old, which apparently showed that the growth retardation was complicated by the diabetic ketoacidosis. 2T. Baba, T. Shimizu, Y. Suzuki, H. Koseki, and T. Shirasawa, manuscript in preparation. The result suggested that the homozygous mice failed to thrive due to diabetic ketoacidosis in the neonatal stage, which is consistent with the phenotypes previously reported in IR-deficient mice (18Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Salvatore P. Asico L.D. Jose P.A. Taylor S.I. Westphal H. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 19Joshi R.L. Lamothe B. Cordonnier N. Mesbah K. Monthioux E. Jami J. Bucchini D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1542-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To investigate the autophosphorylation activity of IR in IR mutant mice, insulin was added to extracts from the neonatal liver of the mice. As shown in Fig. 1D, we did not detect any insulin-induced autophosphorylation activity in the IrP1195L/P1195L mouse. On the other hand, the IrP1195L/wt mouse did show the insulin-induced autophosphorylation although it was less than 20% that of the Irwt/wt mouse. Furthermore, to investigate whether the downstream activity of IR is suppressed by the mutation of the IR gene, we monitored protein kinase B phosphorylation, a more distal event in IR signaling (Fig. 1E). As with IR autophosphorylation in IrP1195L/wt mice, insulin-induced protein kinase B phosphorylation was suppressed in liver, kidney, and muscle of IrP1195L/wt mice compared with Irwt/wt mice (Fig. 1E). These results indicated that the tyrosine kinase activity of IR from heterozygous (IrP1195L/wt) mice was severely suppressed in a dominant negative manner, suggesting that IR mutant mice provide an excellent model for the analysis of longevity phenotypes induced by suppressed insulin signaling compared with heterozygous IR-deficient mice with a haploinsufficiency of insulin signal. IR Mutant Mice Showed Enhanced Resistance to Oxidative Stress—To investigate whether IR mutant mice acquired enhanced resistance to oxidative stress, the mice at 4 months of age were exposed to 80% oxygen in a chamber. We then compared the survival of IR mutant mice to that of wild-type mice (Fig. 2). IR mutant females survived 33.3% longer than female wild-type mice, i.e. IR mutant mice had a 50% survival rate at 8 days compared with 6 days for wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). On the other hand IR male mutant mice survived 18.2% longer than wild-type male mice, i.e. IR mutant mice had a 50% survival rate at 6.5 days compared with 5.5 days for wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that IR mutant mice are more resistant to oxidative stress, but the benefit of the mutation was more pronounced in female than male mice. Next, we intraperitoneally injected paraquat, a chemical oxidant, into female and male mice to evaluate the defense system of the mutant mice against chemically induced oxidative stress. As shown in Fig. 2C, both IR mutant and wild-type female mice began to die ∼48 h after the administration of paraquat. IR mutant female mice, however, survived significantly longer than wild-type mice in stages beyond 72 h. IR mutant male mice also survived longer than wild-type mice, but the beneficial effects in male mutant mice were less pronounced in comparison to those in female mutant mice (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that IR mutant mice of both genders survived longer than wild-type mice in oxidative conditions. It is also of note that there is a gender difference in the resistance to oxidative stress in IR mutant mice. This data suggested that the insulin signaling may be modulated by sex hormones (i.e. either by the beneficial effects of estrogen or by the deleterious effects of testosterone). MnSOD Plays a Role in the Acquisition of Resistance to Oxidative Stress—Because MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD play an important role in the intracellular defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS), we measured SOD activities in the liver of IR mutant mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, the MnSOD activity of IR mutant female mice was significantly up-regulated by 39.9% compared with that of wild-type female mice (484.9 ± 96.1 units/mg of protein for IR mutant mice versus 346.5 ± 51.7 units/mg of protein for wild-type mice, p < 0.05). As for male mutant mice, MnSOD activity was up-regulated by 22.9% in comparison with that of wild-type male mice, but the up-regulation was less significant than that found in wild-type female mice (Fig. 3B). In contrast, we did not detect any pronounced difference in Cu/ZnSOD activity between IR mutant and wild-type mice of either sex (Fig. 3, C and D). To analyze the molecular basis for the up-regulation of MnSOD, mRNAs for MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD were analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3E). We found that the transcription of MnSOD was up-regulated in liver, brain, kidney, and heart of both female and male mutant mice, whereas that of the Cu/ZnSOD and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes was not up-regulated in mutant or wild-type mice (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, to investigate the contribution of other antioxidant enzymes to resistance to oxidative stress, we measured activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase. However, we did not detect any significant differences between IR mutant and wild-type mice (data not shown). These results suggested that the transcriptional upregulation of MnSOD is specific to the enhanced antioxidant system in IR mutant mice. In C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, the up-regulated SODs are reported to degrade the oxygen radicals that cause oxidative stress in IR/IGF-1 receptor mutants (5Honda Y. Honda S.

Here we demonstrated for the first time that the expression and the activity of MnSOD were up-regulated by the mutation introduced into the kinase domain of the IR gene in mice. Transgenic flies, which overexpressed Cu/ZnSOD in motor neurons, survived 40% longer than control fruit flies, whereas transgenic flies that overexpressed MnSOD in motor neurons survived 30% longer than control flies (22Parkes T.L.

https://openalex.org/W2091698280,"Sm and Sm-like (LSm) proteins form complexes engaging in various RNA-processing events. Composition and architecture of the complexes determine their intracellular distribution, RNA targets, and function. We have reconstituted the human LSm1–7 and LSm2–8 complexes from their constituent components in vitro. Based on the assembly pathway of the canonical Sm core domain, we used heterodimeric and heterotrimeric sub-complexes to assemble LSm1–7 and LSm2–8. Isolated sub-complexes form ring-like higher order structures. LSm1–7 is assembled and stable in the absence of RNA. LSm1–7 forms ring-like structures very similar to LSm2–8 at the EM level. Our in vitro reconstitution results illustrate likely features of the LSm complex assembly pathway. We prove the complexes to be functional both in an RNA bandshift and an in vivo cellular transport assay. Sm and Sm-like (LSm) proteins form complexes engaging in various RNA-processing events. Composition and architecture of the complexes determine their intracellular distribution, RNA targets, and function. We have reconstituted the human LSm1–7 and LSm2–8 complexes from their constituent components in vitro. Based on the assembly pathway of the canonical Sm core domain, we used heterodimeric and heterotrimeric sub-complexes to assemble LSm1–7 and LSm2–8.

Phylogenetic distribution suggests Sm proteins were already present in the last universal common ancestor of all present-day life forms and that the family underwent an explosive diversification with the advent of eukaryotes (1Anantharaman V. Aravind L. BMC. Genomics. 2004; 5: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Archaebacteria harbor one or two SM/LSM genes each. Escherichia coli Hfq and its orthologues in other Gram-negative bacteria are so far the only known eubacterial LSm proteins (2Moller T. Franch T. Hojrup P. Keene D.R. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G.

Thought to have originally arisen as chaperones mediating RNA-RNA interactions (5Donahue W.F. Jarrell K.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 7-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), Sm/LSm proteins have diversified through evolution and adopted new functionalities. LSm protein function in archaea is unknown. A structural and biochemical study on Archaeoglobus fulgidus LSm proteins showed that they bind to RNase P RNA in vivo and in vitro (6Toro I. Thore S. Mayer C. Basquin J. Seraphin B. Suck D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2293-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), a feature that has also been observed for several yeast LSm proteins (7Salgado-Garrido J. Bragado-Nilsson E. Kandels-Lewis S.

Parasitol. 1995; 73: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Sm/LSm proteins are characterized by a bipartite sequence motif of about 80 amino acids long situated in most members at the N terminus. Recently, divergent family members with additional domains have been identified (1Anantharaman V. Aravind L. BMC. Genomics. 2004; 5: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Albrecht M. Lengauer T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The conserved motif translates into a fold common to all Sm/LSm proteins. This Sm fold mediates specific Sm-Sm interaction through a generic interface, which the various Sm protein family members use to build up homomeric (in prokaryotes) or heteromeric (in eukaryotes) ring-shaped complexes. These represent the functional form of all Sm/LSm proteins. The common fold, generic interface, and ring-like morphology of Sm/LSm complexes provide a rationale for the observed large variety of RNA targets bound, the diverse complex compositions and functions. LSm proteins appear as building blocks for complexes whose composition and architecture determines their intracellular distribution, interaction with RNA targets and non-Sm effector proteins, and function. The structural basis for the balance between interaction specificity and flexibility required for assembling different complexes with some subunits in common is unknown.The canonical Sm core domain composed of the seven Sm proteins B, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G was demonstrated to assemble in an ordered pathway onto a conserved, single-stranded stretch on their target RNAs, the Sm site of the spliceosomal snRNAs U1, U2, U4, and U5 (22Raker V.A. Plessel G. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Raker V.A. Hartmuth K. Kastner B. Luhrmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6554-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The pathway is marked by the RNA-free sub-complexes D1D2,D3B, and EFG (22Raker V.A. Plessel G. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The sub-complexes may constitute stages of the assembly pathway. Sm-snRNA assembly occurs in the cytoplasm. After hypermethylation of the snRNA moiety, the pre-snRNPs are transported to the nucleus, where they mature to functional particles (9Will C.L. Luhrmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In vivo, Sm core domain assembly is a highly regulated process involving Sm protein modification by a methylase (24Meister G. Eggert C. Fischer U. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and numerous assembly factors like the survival of motor neurons protein. In vitro, the Sm core domain can be assembled from Sm protein sub-complexes by the addition of target snRNA in the absence of any auxiliary factors (23Raker V.A. Hartmuth K. Kastner B. Luhrmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6554-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 2C. Kambach, S. Waeke, and K. Nagai, unpublished observations. 2C. Kambach, S. Waeke, and K. Nagai, unpublished observations. Spliceosomal U6 snRNA differs from the other snRNAs in many ways. It is thought to have an entirely nuclear life cycle (25Boelens W.C. Palacios I. Mattaj I.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vankan P. McGuigan C. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3397-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), does not bear an Sm site, and does not bind the canonical Sm proteins. However, a complex built up of seven Sm-like (LSm) proteins 2–8 was shown to interact with the 3′ end of U6 snRNA in the nucleus (27Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), stabilizing U6 snRNP and the U4/U6 snRNA interaction (Fig. 1).The Sm core domain can only assemble onto its U snRNA target and is only stable in the presence of the RNA (23Raker V.A. Hartmuth K. Kastner B. Luhrmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6554-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, the native LSm2–8 complex has been shown to be stable in the absence of RNA (27Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is likely that the LSm2–8 complex is assembled in the cytoplasm, migrates as such to the nucleus, and there binds to U6 snRNA. The LSm2–8 assembly thus differs from the canonical core Sm domain pathway. In addition to LSm2–8, a cytoplasmic LSm1–7 complex exists that engages in mRNA decapping and degradation (10Bouveret E. Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11Tharun S. He W. Mayes A.E. Lennertz P. Beggs J.D. Parker R. Nature. 2000; 404: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The two complexes have LSm proteins 2 to 7 in common, differing only in the seventh subunit (LSm8 and LSm1, respectively, Fig. 1). The LSm1–7 assembly pathway is even less well characterized than the LSm2–8 pathway. LSm1–7 has been shown to accumulate in cytoplasmic foci together with other components of the mRNA decapping and degradation machinery (28Ingelfinger D. Arndt-Jovin D.J. Luhrmann R. Achsel T. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 1489-1501PubMed Google Scholar, 29van D.E. Cougot N. Meyer S. Babajko S. Wahle E. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6915-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These foci are apparently active sites of mRNA turnover (30Cougot N. Babajko S. Seraphin B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), but the available data do not indicate whether LSm1–7 assembles in these foci or elsewhere in the cytoplasm, nor whether it binds its mRNA targets as a preassembled complex. It is unknown whether LSm protein sub-complexes analogous to the Sm heterodimers and heterotrimers exist. Here we show that stable, soluble human LSm23, LSm48, and LSm567 sub-complexes corresponding to their paralogues SmD1D2, SmD3B, and SmEFG can be obtained by coexpression in E. coli. LSm1 and LSm4 are produced from monocistronic vectors. Isolated subcomplexes assemble into ring-like higher order structures, underscoring the preference of eukaryotic LSm proteins to associate with heterologous binding partners. The fact that both LSm1–7 and LSm2–8 complexes can be reconstituted from these components in the absence of RNA suggests that both species assemble in the cytoplasm and bind to their target RNAs as pre-assembled units. We show the recombinant LSm2–8 complex to be functional by in vitro bandshift with U6 snRNA and by an in vivo cell microinjection/intracellular transport assay.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning, Expression, and Purification of LSm1–8 Proteins and Sub-complexes—LSM2, -3, and -5–8 were subcloned from a human lymphoma U937 cDNA library (Stratagene) into a modified pUC19 vector. LSM1 and LSM4 were subcloned from expressed sequence tag clones IMAG p998P2110673Q2 and IMAG p958A041800Q2, respectively. Expressed sequence tag clones were obtained from the genetic resources center, Berlin (RZPD, available at www.rzpd.de). LSM2/3, LSM4/8, and LSM5/6/7 polycistronic T5 expression cassettes were constructed by successive compatible overhang cloning using engineered BamH1/BglII sites. The final cassettes were transferred to the pQE30 T5 expression vector (Qiagen, Basel). Expression constructs bear an MRGSH6 tag at the N terminus of the first cistron, followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site. LSM1 and LSM4 were subcloned into pQE30 as monocistrons. SG13009[pREP4] (for LSm1, LSm2/3, LSm4, and LSm5/6/7) or BLR[pREP4] (for LSm4/8) E. coli cells were transformed with plasmid DNA and plated out on selective media. LB starter cultures were grown at 30 °C overnight, and 2–12 liters of LB media were inoculated the next day. Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.8 at 37 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Induction temperature was between 25 °C and 37 °C. Cells were harvested after 4–48 h of induction, depending on construct. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.50, 0.5–1.0 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole-Cl, pH 7.50, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), sonicated, and treated with DNase I. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation, and supernatants were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) on nickel-charged Hi-Trap chelating Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). LSm proteins and sub-complexes were eluted with imidazole step gradients (60, 250, and 500 mm). If insufficiently pure, samples were subsequently dialyzed into 100 mm NaCl buffer without imidazole and subjected to ion exchange chromatography (100 mm to 1 m NaCl). Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen in ion exchange buffer. In some instances, the MRGSH6 tags were cleaved off by TEV protease (1:100 ratio, overnight at room temperature), and the sub-complexes purified by IMAC. Cloning and expression of Sm protein sub-complexes D1D2 and D3B has been described elsewhere (31Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la F.E. Raker V.A. Luhrmann R. Li J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). An SmEFG heterotrimer was produced from a pET15b vector (Novagen) and purified via consecutive IMAC and ion exchange chromatographies. 12% SDS-PAGE gels were run with equivalent amounts of total cell extracts at the time of induction (T0) and time of harvest (T4–T48) for both soluble material and pellet (insoluble material). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (GERBU Biochemicals, Germany) and destaining, gels were scanned, and the bands corresponding to soluble and insoluble LSm proteins were integrated via densitometry using the program ImageJ 1.29x (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health).Reconstitution and Purification of LSm1–7 and LSm2–8 Complexes—Individual LSm protein or sub-complex preparations were incubated in 4 m urea, 1 m NaCl buffer for 2 h at 37°Cand then mixed in equimolar amounts for the assembly of the desired heptamer. The mix was incubated again for 2–5 h, and the sample was dialyzed against buffer with progressively less salt (1 m and 0.5 m NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. Reconstituted LSm1–7 and LSm2–8 were purified by consecutive gel filtration and anion exchange chromatographies.Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—Samples were diluted at 10–20 μg/ml. Aliquots of 5 μl were stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate after sample adsorption onto glow-discharged 400-mesh carbon-coated grids. The micrographs were recorded at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and a magnification of 50,000×, using a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope. All micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film. Reference-free alignment was performed on manually selected particles from digitized electron micrographs using EMAN image processing package (32Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). After multivariate statistical analysis of a set of rotational and translational invariants previously generated, a reference-free kmeans classification was performed on the resulting footprint file. The resulting classified images were then aligned and classified iteratively. The class average with the best signal-to-noise ratio were selected and gathered in a gallery.Gel Permeation Chromatography/Static Light Scattering Analysis— LSm sub-complexes were run on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel permeation column using an ΔKTA Explorer FPLC (both Amersham Biosciences) coupled to a miniDAWN static light scattering analyzer and an Optilab DSP refractometer (both Wyatt Technology Corp., CA). Data were analyzed using Wyatt's ASTRA 4 software. Analytical gel filtrations were run on a Superdex 200 PC3.2/30 column using an Ettan HPLC (Amersham Biosciences).Analytical Ultracentrifugation—LSm sub-complexes were subjected to an equilibrium sedimentation run in 20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol buffer on an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 12,000 rpm. Data analysis was performed using the program DISCREEQ (50Stark H. Dube P. Luhrmann R. Kastner B. Nature. 2001; 409: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Electromobility Shift Assays—Xenopus tropicalis U6 snRNA or Xenopus laevis U1 snRNA (a kind gift from Iain Mattaj, EMBL Heidelberg) were in vitro transcribed and body-labeled with [32P]UTP. 20,000 cpm purified U snRNA was incubated with 5 pmol of an equimolar mixture of the Sm D1D2, D3B, and EFG sub-complexes or LSm protein heptameric complexes in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.50, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μl of RNasin (Promega) and 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA in a 10-μl assay at 30 °C for 1 h, then at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were loaded on 6% native PAGE gels and run at 4 °C for 2.5 h, 160 V. Gels were autoradiographed wet for 14–16 h at–80 °C on x-ray film.Cell Microinjections—REF52 rat fibroblasts were grown to 60–80% confluency on coverslips in Opti-Mem™ medium with glutamine (Invitrogen). LSm1–7 was labeled with Alexa555, LSm8 and LSm2–8 with Alexa488 succinimidyl ester fluorescent dyes (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Excess dye was removed by dialysis into microinjection buffer (20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Aggregates were removed by centrifugation (15 min and 13,000 rpm), and the supernatant was injected into cells. After incubation for 30–120 min, cells were fixed and visualized using an Olympus confocal fluorescence microscope. For analysis of LSm2–8 active transport, wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma) was coinjected at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml.RESULTSExpression of canonical human Sm proteins in E. coli from single cistron vectors gives very low yields or insoluble protein. In contrast, high yields of soluble Sm proteins are obtained by coexpressing the SmD1D2, SmD3B, and SmEFG sub-complexes from polycistronic expression vectors (31Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la F.E. Raker V.A. Luhrmann R. Li J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). 3C. Kambach, unpublished observations. These correspond to the sub-complexes identified in HeLa cell nuclear extract (22Raker V.A. Plessel G. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Although some LSm proteins can be expressed more efficiently in a soluble form from monocistronic vectors than their canonical Sm protein paralogues, in general yield is very low and the obtained preparations tend to aggregate heavily. Based on our experiences with Sm protein coexpression, and to facilitate expression and purification of LSm proteins, we initially constructed polycistronic expression vectors encoding LSm2/3, LSm4/8, and LSm5/6/7 cDNAs. These heterodimers and heterotrimers correspond to the canonical SmD1D2, SmD3B, and SmEFG sub-complexes, respectively. LSm1 and LSm4 were constructed and expressed as monocistrons for the reconstitution of LSm1–7. Expression yield and solubility of single-cistron LSm constructs could be greatly enhanced by fusing to two N-terminal Z tags (Staphylococcus aureus protein A IgG-binding domain), followed by a His6 tag and a TEV cleavage site. This phenomenon is exemplified by the ZZ-His6-TEV-LSm6 purification record (Fig. 2d). For crystallographic and other studies, we proceeded to express LSm5, LSm6, LSm8, and the complexes LSm5/6, LSm5/7, LSm6/7, and LSm5/3 (data not shown). In general, the solubility of a given LSm protein increased by up to 25-fold by coexpression, as measured by the supernatant:pellet ratio (Table I). Recombinant LSm protein sub-complexes were purified by Ni-IMAC followed by ion exchange chromatography where necessary. For each polycistron, only the first cDNA bears a His6 tag; the other LSm proteins are isolated through sub-complex formation and co-purification. The complexes and single LSm proteins were purified to homogeneity, as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, a–d). Sample integrity is further demonstrated by the successful crystallization of various LSm protein preparations. Weakly diffracting crystals could be obtained from LSm6 (Fig. 2e) and LSm5/6/7 (Fig. 2f).Fig. 2SDS-PAGE gels of LSm sub-complex purification protocols.a, LSm2/3; b, LSm4/8; c, LSm5/6/7; d, LSm6 (Z-tagged). a–d: lane 1: uninduced culture; lane 2: induced culture; lane 3: supernatant; lane 4: pellet. d: non-cleaved, Z-tagged LSm6 (lanes 1–6), TEV-cleaved LSm6 (lane 7).

Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and static light scattering experiments combined with gel filtration chromatography yielded molecular weights that indicate formation of higher order structures (Fig. 3, a–c, and Table II): The LSm2/3 heterodimer has a nominal molecular mass of 25 kDa. In the analytical ultracentrifuge, the LSm2/3 oligomer distribution is bimodal at 10 μm concentration, containing a hexamer (10%) and an octamer (87%). The molecular mass of LSm5/6/7 is 33 kDa. Analytical ultracentrifugation yields a mixture of individual subunits (26%), trimer (25%), hexamer (40%), and nonamer (8%) species at 16 μm concentration. Analytical gel filtration combined with static light scattering measurements yields 85 kDa for LSm2/3 and 77 kDa for LSm5/6/7. These values reflect the heterogeneity in oligomer distribution found by AUC. LSm5/6/7 stays intact during gel filtration, and individual subunits are not observed. Upon incubation in up to 8 m urea, the highest elution volume of LSm5/6/7 species corresponds to the trimer. This stands in contrast to LSm2/3, which at urea concentrations of 4 m and higher, falls apart to some extent into its subunits (data not shown). LSm4/8 aggregates most strongly of the LSm sub-complexes and does not seem to form oligomeric higher order structures of defined stoichiometry (Table II).Fig. 3Gel filtration chromatograms (Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column) of LSm sub-complexes LSm2/3 (a), LSm4/8 (b), and LSm5/6/7 (c).

Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). LSm 5/6/7 shows up mainly as a ring-shaped structure as well but heterogeneities appear in the background of the electron micrographs (Fig. 4b, overview). LSm4/8 aggregated too strongly to yield homogeneous particles in electron micrographs (data not shown). After particles classification and subsequent class averaging, distinct ring particles can be observed in LSm2/3 galleries (Fig. 4a, bottom) having an outer diameter of ∼7 nm and a cavity of <1.5 nm. Considering the mass of the LSm2/3 heterodimer (25 kDa), we suggest that the resulting class averages correspond to octameric LSm2/3 ([Lsm2/3]4) in accordance with the AUC measurements. Although the LSm5/6/7 preparation did not show up as homogenous as LSm2/3, class averaging yielded ring-shaped particles having a size of ∼7nm and a cavity of 1.5 nm suggesting a hexameric arrangement ([LSm5/6/7]2, 2 × 33 kDa) based on the AUC data. Nevertheless, from the electron microscopy analysis, a nonameric arrangement cannot be excluded. Smaller particles appear in the background (Fig. 4b, circles) and could represent LSm5/6/7 trimers. The small size of such particles was not suitable for classification.Fig. 4Electron micrographs of sub-complexes LSm2/3 (a) LSm5/6/7 (b), and complexes LSm1–7 (c) and LSm2–8 (d).Scale bars are 30 nm. Class averages were created from 641, 440, 993, and 988 particles, respectively, from initial data set containing 1000 particles of LSm2/3, LSm5/6/7, LSm1–7, and LSm2–8. White circles in b and c point to smaller than average particles in the LSm5/6/7 and LSm1–7 preparations that could, in the case of LSm5/6/7, represent trimers (see text).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Sm core domain can be reconstituted in vitro from recombinant Sm sub-complexes and U snRNA with good efficiency under native buffer conditions (33Sumpter V. Kahrs A. Fischer U. Kornstadt U. Luhrmann R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The LSm2–8 complex isolated from HeLa cell extract is, in contrast, stable and likely to assemble in the absence of RNA (27Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For our LSm complex in vitro reconstitution protocol, we required the disruption of the higher order structures formed by the sub-complexes. The in vitro reconstitution process should then be guided by relative thermodynamic stability. Reconstitution was carried out by mixing equimolar amounts of LSm2/3, LSm4/8, and LSm5/6/7 (for LSm2–8) or LSm4, LSm1, LSm2/3, and LSm5/6/7 (for LSm1–7) under semi-denaturing conditions (for details, see “Materials and Methods”) followed by dialysis. The reconstituted complexes were then purified by ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 5, c and d) followed by gel filtration (Fig. 5, e and f). In both types of chromatography, they elute as single peaks, demonstrating sample homogeneity in charge and in size. The SDS-PAGE ge"

The trans-activating ability of NFκB can be modified by another nuclear factor C/EBPβ that can physically bind to NFκB and regulate its activity. Because the COX2 promoter also contains a C/EBPβ site adjacent to the NFκB site, the present study examined whether these two transcription factors cooperate to induce COX2 expression following hypertonic stress. Hypertonicity markedly induced COX2 expression in cultured medullary interstitial cells by immunoblot analysis. The tonicity-induced COX2 expression was suppressed by mutant IκB (IκBm) that blocks NFκB activation, demonstrating that tonicity-induced COX2 expression depends on NFκB activation. However, mutation of the NFκB site in the COX2 promoter failed to abolish tonicity-induced COX2 reporter activity. IκB kinase-1 (IKK1) significantly induced COX2-luciferase activity by 2.3-fold (n = 10, p < 0.01); mutation of the NFκB site also failed to abolish IKK1-stimulated COX2 reporter activity (86 ± 3.1% of wild type, p > 0.05, n = 4). Interestingly, mutation of the C/EBPβ site of the COX2 gene significantly reduced both IKK1 and hypertonicity-induced COX2 reporter activity (p < 0.01). To further examine the potential role of C/EBPβ in tonicity-induced COX2 expression, a dominant negative C/EBPβ-p20 was transduced into RMICs. C/EBPβ-p20 markedly suppressed hypertonic (550 mOsm) induction of COX2 (immunoblot) to a similar extent as IκBm. No additional suppression was observed when both NFκB and C/EBPβ were simultaneously blocked by IκBm and C/EBPβ-p20. Interestingly, IKK-induced COX2 expression was not only blocked by IκBm, but also completely abolished by C/EBPβ-p20. Further studies demonstrated physical association of C/EBPβ to NFκB p65 by coimmunoprecipitation. Importantly, this interaction between C/EBPβ and NFκB was greatly enhanced following hypertonic stress. These studies indicate C/EBPβ is required for the transcriptional activation of COX2 by NFκB, suggesting a dominant role for the C/EBPβ pathway in regulating induction of RMIC COX2 by hypertonicity.

Two isoforms of COX have been identified, designated COX1 and COX2 (1Hla T. Bishop-Bailey D. Liu C.H. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Int. J. Biochem.

COX1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues detected and is thought to carry out housekeeping functions, such as cytoprotection of the gastric mucosa, regulation of renal blood flow, and control of platelet aggregation. In contrast, COX2 mRNA and protein are normally undetectable in most tissues, but can be rapidly induced by a variety of stimuli, including various cytokines, growth factors, oncogenes, endotoxins, and chemicals (2Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that COX2-mediated prostaglandins play important roles in regulating cellular homeostasis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis (2Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin.

However, recent studies indicate that the mechanism underlying NFκB-associated COX2 expression is more complex. Interactions between NFκB and other nuclear factors such as C/EBP, SP1, and PPAR have been reported (19Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem.

The present studies examined the mechanism by which NFκB activates COX2 gene expression in cultured renal medullary interstitial cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Rabbit medullary interstitial cells were cultured as described previously (6Guan Y. Chang M. Cho W. Zhang Y. Redha R. Davis L. Chang S. DuBois R.N. Hao C.M. Breyer M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F18-F26PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, female New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized (44 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, i.m.). The left kidney was removed, and the medulla was dissected and minced with a razor blade under sterile conditions in 5 ml of sterile RPMI 1640 plus 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah). This homogenate was injected subcutaneously in the abdominal wall using a 14-gauge needle. Twenty days postsurgery, subcutaneous nodules appeared. The rabbits were re-anesthetized and sacrificed by decapitation, and the nodules removed under sterile conditions. Nodules were minced into 1-mm fragments and explanted in 75-cm2 tissue culture plates. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and streptomycin and penicillin. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 95% O2, 5% CO2. Tissue culture medium was changed every 48–72 h. Mouse RMICs were prepared as reported (7Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed, and kidneys were rapidly removed and washed in Ringer's solution. The renal medulla was excised, minced, and placed in Ringer's solution containing collagenase (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h with occasional agitation. The collagenase-treated tissue was then washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) three times and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were studied in their third to fourth passages. These cells exhibited characteristic abundant oil red O-positive lipid droplets, a characteristic of type I RMICs (25Muirhead E.E. Germain G.S. Leach B.E. Brooks B. Stephenson P. Prostaglandins. 1973; 3: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—Immunoblots were performed on whole cell lysates from cultured RMICs. The protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Sigma). Thirty micrograms of protein extract were loaded in each lane of a 10% SDS-PAGE minigel and run at 120 V. Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 22 V overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times with TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated in blocking buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with an antihuman COX2 antibody (1:1,000, 160106, Cayman), anti-C/EBPβ (1:400 sc-150, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-p-C/EBPβ (1:500, 3084, Cell Signaling Technology) antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Following washing (3×), the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000, Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three 15-min washes. Antibody labeling was visualized by addition of the chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the membrane was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film.Nuclear Protein Extraction and Immunoprecipitation—Cultured cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice for 15 min in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO3, and 0.08% Nonidet P-40) containing proteinase inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml, Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (cytoplasmic proteins) was stored at -80 °C. The pellet was washed with hypotonic lysis buffer two times and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 s. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of Dignin solution (20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 420 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4,1mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, pH 7.9) for 30 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant nuclear protein was used for immunoprecipitation. 50 μg of nuclear protein extract was added to 500 μl of IP buffer (Tris 20 mm, pH 7.5, NaCl 150 mm,EDTA1mm, EGTA, 1 mm, Triton-100 1%). The nuclear protein was precleared by adding 0.2 μg of rabbit IgG and 20 μl of 25% protein A-agarose, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm. The supernatant was collected, and 0.4 μg of anti-C/EBPβ antibody was added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. 20 μl of 25% protein A-agarose beads were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight with mixing. The beads were washed three times with IP buffer and were resuspended in 30 μl of 2× sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 2 min, and 20 μl of precipitated proteins were added to each lane of an SDS-PAGE gel.Ad-IκBmu, Ad-IKKα, Ad-CEBP-p20, and Ad-GFP—Adenoviral vectors, encoding a dominant negative IκB and a constitutively active IκB kinase 1 (IKK1) or a dominant negative C/EBPβ-p20, were used to modulate NFκB and C/EBP activity, respectively, in cultured renal medullary interstitial cells. The trans-dominant inhibitor of NFκB, IκBmut (avian IκBαS36/40A) was provided by Dr. Timothy Blackwell (7Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin.

Constitutively active IKK1 (IKK1) cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Frank Mercurio (Signal Pharmaceutical, San Diego, CA) and subcloned into pACCMV for IKK1 adenovirus construction (7Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The IKK1 was made constitutively active by Ser-Glu mutations in Ser176 and Ser180 residues (26Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A.

Redha R. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F352-F359PubMed Google Scholar) for a control adenovirus. For infection of RMICs, 200 μl of virus (multiplicity of infection, 100) was added to each culture dish, and GFP adenovirus was used to adjust for equal loading. After a 2-h incubation, the virus was removed, and fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Experiments were carried out 48–72 h after infection.COX2 Reporter Studies—An 891-bp human COX2 luciferase reporter construct was generously provided by Dr. Lee-Ho Wang (17Tazawa R. Xu X.M. Wu K.K. Wang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).

The NFκB and C/EBPβ site mutants have been shown to lack the ability to bind to NFκB and C/EBP, respectively (28Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol.

The firefly luciferase COX2 reporter plasmid and a plasmid containing Renilla luciferase driven by the TK promoter (Promega) were transfected into cells using SuperFect (Qiagen). Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection for luciferase activity measurement using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega). COX2 luciferase activity was adjusted by Renilla luciferase activity.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ability of NFκB and C/EBPβ to bind to endogenous COX2 promoter was examined using the ChIP assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Technologies, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, cultured mouse renal medullary interstitial cells (7Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) were exposed to isotonic or hypertonic media for indicated periods of time. Cells were then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed with SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free). The chromatin was sheared by sonication (strength, 20%; pulse, 12 s × three times). The cross-linked chromatin was quantified to determine the initial amount of DNA present in the different samples. 100 ng of DNA were used as input. The remaining chromatin fractions were precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 1 h and immunoprecipitated with antibodies (NFκB-p65 or CEBPβ, 200 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The COX2 promoter DNA, bound to p65 and C/EBPβ, was analyzed by PCR using primers: sense, CGGAGGGTAGTTCCATGAAA; antisense, CAGGCTTTTACCCACGCAAA. PCR was performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, for 35 cycles.To further examine whether the C/EBPβ site in the COX2 promoter plays an important role in mediating NFκB binding to the COX2 gene, wild type or mutants of COX2 promoter constructs containing 327-bp human COX2 promoter sequences, were transfected into mouse interstitial cells using SuperFect (Qiagen). 24 h after transfection, cells were exposed to hypertonic stress for 1 h. The cells were cross-linked and precipitated as described in ChIP assay. The transfected human COX2 promoter bound to NFκB was detected by PCR using primers specific for the human COX2 gene. PCR primers: sense, CCCCTCTGCTCCCAAATT; antisense, CGCTCACTGCAAGTCGTAT. The PCR was performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, for 35 cycles. Genomic DNA from a human cell line HEK293 cells was used as a positive control. Genomic DNA extracted from mouse renal medullary interstitial cells without transfection was used as a negative control.RESULTSMutation of the NFκB site of the COX2 Promoter Fails to Suppress Induction of the COX2 Reporter by Hypertonic Stress—Our previous studies demonstrate that hypertonicity activates NFκB, and blocking NFκB by a mutant IκB dramatically suppresses hypertonic induction of COX2, suggesting that NFκB mediates hypertonicity-induced COX2 expression (7Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Two NFκB binding sites have been identified in the human COX2 promoter (-446 to -437 and -223 to -214) (31Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To examine whether hypertonicity-induced COX2 expression is mediated via binding of NFκB protein to the NFκB element of the COX2 gene, a COX2 luciferase transcription reporter system with mutant NFκB element was used. Hypertonic stress in RMICs significantly increased COX2 reporter activity in both 891-bp COX2 luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 1)- and 327-bp COX2 reporter construct (Fig. 2)-transfected cells. Surprisingly, mutation of NFκB sites in the COX2 promoter luciferase reporters failed to abolish hypertonic stress-induced COX2 reporter activity in either COX2 reporter constructs. In contrast, mutation of the C/EBPβ binding site completely blocked hypertonic activation of COX2 reporter activity (Fig. 2).Fig. 2COX2 luciferase reporter activity following hypertonic stress. Cultured RMICs were co-transfected with wild-type or mutant COX2 promoter-driven firefly luciferase vector and TK-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid.

As shown in Fig. 3, induction of COX2 expression by hypertonic stress was suppressed by IκB mutant that blocked NFκB activation, consistent with our previous findings (7Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These studies now find that a dominant negative C/EBPβ-p20 also dramatically reduced the ability of hypertonicity to induce COX2 expression. More importantly, combined treatment with C/EBPβ-p20 and IκBm did not further reduce COX2 expression, suggesting these two factors participate in the same signaling pathway.Fig. 3Effect of C/EBPβ-p20 on hypertonicity-induced COX2 expression. Cultured RMICs were transduced with GFP, IκBm, C/EBP-p20, or p20 plus IκBm via adenoviral vectors.

NFκB was activated by adenoviral transduction with IκB kinase 1 (IKK1). As expected, IKK1, which phosphorylates IκB and activates NFκB, dramatically induced COX2 expression. However, IKK1-induced COX2 expression was blocked not only by an inactive IκBm, but also by blocking C/EBPβ with C/EBPβ-p20 adenovirus (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of C/EBPβ-p20 on IKK1-induced COX2 expression.

IKK1 increased COX2 reporter activity by 3-fold (p < 0.01, Fig. 5). However unexpectedly, mutation of the NFκB site failed to completely abolish IKK1-induced COX2 reporter activity. In contrast, mutation of C/EBPβ site completely abolished IKK-induced COX2 reporter activity.Fig. 5IKK-associated COX2 luciferase reporter activity.

Nuclear protein extract was immunoprecipitated using anti-C/EBPβ antibody and separated with SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 6, C/EBPβ antibody-immunoprecipitated proteins from cultured medullary interstitial cells include NFκB p65 immunoreactive protein, consistent with a physical association of p65 with C/EBPβ. The interaction between p65 and C/EBPβ appears to be specific, because no p65 was coprecipitated by PPARδ (data not shown), a transcription factor abundantly expressed in renal medullary interstitial cells (34Hao C.M. Redha R. Morrow J. Breyer M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21341-21345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). More importantly, this physical interaction was dramatically enhanced following hypertonic stress, despite the fact that hypertonic stress did not change C/EBPβ protein expression (Fig. 6). Only C/EBPβ but not C/EBPα, δ, and γ were detected in cultured renal medullary interstitial cells by immunoblot. Furthermore, none of these C/EBP isoforms was induced by hypertonic stress (data not shown). Hypertonicity did not change C/EBPβ phosphorylation (Thr-235) (Fig. 6C), sugge"

However, CL-43, a bovine serum lectin, which evolved through duplication of the surfactant protein D gene in ruminants, prefers mannose and mannose-rich polysaccharides. Surfactant protein D is characterized by two relatively conserved motifs at the binding face, along the edges of the shallow carbohydrate-binding groove.

Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Like many other effectors of innate immunity, SP-D is a pattern recognition molecule with a variety of potential ligands (5Epstein J. Eichbaum Q. Sheriff S. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin.

These include cell wall glycoconjugates expressed by bacteria and fungi, viral coat proteins, and various organic antigens. In addition, SP-D, or SP-D-ligand complexes, can interact with specific binding sites on phagocytes and lymphoid cells. The consequences of these interactions include agglutination, opsonization with enhanced internalization, inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation, clearance of apoptotic cells, modulation of phagocyte cytokine production, and enhanced antigen presentation. Significantly, SP-D null animals show defective host responses to respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus (7LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. J.

Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). SP-D is a member of a family of collagenous, C-type lectins, or collectins (1Kishore U. Reid K.B. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2001; 33: 225-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Holmskov U.L. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Suppl. 2000; 100: 1-59Google Scholar). In humans, this family includes surfactant protein A (SP-A) and serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL). In cows, there are at least three other secreted collectins. Serum conglutinin (BC), serum CL-43, and CL-46 all appear to have evolved from SP-D in ruminants (12Hansen S. Holmskov U. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 498-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nearly all secreted collectins, including SP-D, are assembled as multimers of trimeric subunits associated at their amino termini and stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds (13Crouch E.C. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Each trimeric subunit consists of four major domains: an amino-terminal cross-linking domain, a collagen domain, a trimeric coiled-coil neck domain (N), and the C-terminal, C-type lectin CRD. Notably, bovine CL-43 is secreted exclusively as trimers (14Hartshorn K.L. Holmskov U. Hansen S. Zhang P. Meschi J. Mogues T. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lim B.L. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. Lu J. Laursen S.B. Jensenius J.C. Holmskov U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11820-11824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carbohydrate binding activity of SP-D and MBL, and probably other collectins, is directly mediated by a coordinated calcium ion in their CRD. However, there are differences in saccharide selectivity among members of this family, even for collectins closely related to SP-D (11Holmskov U.L. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Suppl. 2000; 100: 1-59Google Scholar). For example, rat SP-D preferentially interacts with maltose and myo-inositol, with lower affinity for mannose (16Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 177-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). By contrast, CL-43 shows preferential binding to mannose with comparatively low affinity for glucose (17Loveless R.W. Holmskov U. Feizi T. Immunology. 1995; 95: 651-659Google Scholar, 18Holmskov U. Fischer P.B. Rothmann A. Hojrup P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19van Eijk M.

Whereas CL-43 binds efficiently to fungal cell wall mannan (14Hartshorn K.L. Holmskov U. Hansen S. Zhang P. Meschi J. Mogues T. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lim B.L. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. Lu J. Laursen S.B. Jensenius J.C. Holmskov U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11820-11824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SP-D has been reported to show relatively poor binding to this ligand (20Lu J. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For all collectins, high affinity binding to saccharide ligands appears to require trimerization of the CRDs, which is mediated by the contiguous neck domain (21Hakansson K. Reid K.B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1607-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By analogy with studies for rat MBL (22Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 23Quesenberry M.S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10831-10841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been shown that site-directed substitution of two residues known to coordinate with calcium at the carbohydrate binding site of SP-D can alter ligand affinity and specificity (24Ogasawara Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14725-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The so-called QPD substitution (Gln for Glu321 plus Glu for Asn323 of rat SP-D) reversed the relative inhibitory potencies of galactose compared with mannose, maltose, or glucose in phosphatidylinositol binding assays and increased the amount of calcium required for optimal phosphatidylinositol binding. Thus, alterations in amino acids that directly coordinate with calcium can alter ligand preferences. Studies of the crystal structure of the trimeric recombinant human SP-D neck + CRD domains demonstrated the presence of bulky charged residues at two edges of the shallow carbohydrate binding groove, the so-called “SP-D groove” (25Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the primary sequence of five different species of SP-D show marked conservation of this feature, which consists of two relatively conserved motifs immediately C-terminal to the site of the QPD mutation and near the ends of the short Cys331–Cys345 loop: (D/N)GG(S/A) and (R/K)(A/V)CEGXR (Fig. 1A). CL-43 is distinguished from SP-Ds by an insertion of three amino acids (RAK) immediately N-terminal to, and contiguous with, the first motif (Fig. 1A) (11Holmskov U.L. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Suppl. 2000; 100: 1-59Google Scholar, 25Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This insertion is predicted to flank the carbohydrate binding site (Fig. 1, B and C). Given the above, we used site-directed mutagenesis to test the hypothesis that this unique insertion near the primary carbohydrate binding site contributes to the different ligand binding properties of SP-D and CL-43 and that this region adjoining the SP-D groove contributes to the unique ligand selectivity of SP-D. Our studies demonstrate that sequences near the primary carbohydrate binding site contribute to SP-D's recognition of saccharide ligands and strongly suggest that these sequences also contribute to certain unique antiviral properties of CL-43. The RAK insertion increased the capacity of SP-D to inhibit the infectivity of influenza A and to enhance viral uptake by neutrophils, effects probably mediated by enhanced interactions with mannose-rich oligosaccharides associated with the viral hemagglutinin. Because wild-type trimeric NCRDs have demonstrated protective effects in various animal models of microbial and antigenic challenge, our studies also demonstrate feasibility of “fine-tuning” host defense functions through site-directed modifications of the CRD. The pET-30a(+) vector, S-protein HRP conjugate, anti-His tag antibodies, and competent cells were from Novagen (Madison, WI). BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes were from Promega (Madison, WI). BSA (Fraction V; A4503), BSA (Fraction V, fatty acid-free, low endotoxin; A8806), and yeast mannan were from Sigma. All saccharides were the D anomers and of the highest purity available from Sigma. Purified synthetic oligomers were obtained from the oligonucleotide synthesis center at Washington University School of Medicine. For these studies, we generated a panel of bacterial expression constructs encoding homologous, N-terminally tagged, trimeric neck + CRD (NCRD) fusion proteins. Bacterial expression is feasible, because the neck domains can efficiently trimerize and mediate the formation of trimeric CRDs (26Hoppe H.J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27Lim B.L. Wang J.Y. Holmskov U. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and because the selected sequences lack known posttranslational modifications. Previous studies have shown that the human neck + CRD domain contains all information necessary to direct normal CRD folding, intrachain disulfide bond formation, coordination of calcium ions, and ligand binding (25Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Shrive A.K. Tharia H.A. Strong P. Kishore U. Burns I. Rizkallah P.J. Reid K.B. Greenhough T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The full-length human SP-D and bovine CL-43 cDNAs were described previously (14Hartshorn K.L. Holmskov U. Hansen S. Zhang P. Meschi J. Mogues T. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L753-L762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SP-D and CL-43 neck + CRD domains were generated by thermal amplification of these cDNAs, using forward and reverse primers that incorporated restriction sites for BamHI and HindIII, respectively. For each construct, the collectin sequence encoded the first amino acid of the neck and terminated immediately after the C-terminal phenylalanine. The resulting DNAs and pET30a(+) were digested with BamHI and HindIII, ligated, and transformed into RosettaBlue competent cells (Novagen, Madison, WI). Sequence was verified by automated sequencing. This encoded a fusion protein with a His tag, S tag, and enterokinase (EK) cleavage site N-terminal to the neck + CRD domain (Fig. 1A). All amplification products were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA). DNA sequencing was performed by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory at Washington University School of Medicine. Site-directed mutagenesis of the hSP-D-NCRD cDNA to generate RAK and AAA mutants was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenenesis kit (Stratagene, LA Jolla, CA) and/or overlap extension using the full-length hSP-D cDNA in pGEM-3Z (Promega) as the template. The mutated neck + CRD was then amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers for the hSP-D-NCRD, which contained restriction sites for BamHI and HindIII. DNA sequences were verified by automated sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the fusion protein. Transformed competent cells were inoculated into 100 ml of Luria-Bertani medium (Fisher) containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and grown for 16 h at 37 °C with shaking. The cells were then diluted into 1 liter of medium and grown for an additional 4 h to obtain an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Following induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were incubated for 4 h at 30 or 37 °C, harvested by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and temporarily stored at –80 °C. Bacteria transfected with the NCRD construct showed a major isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible protein of the predicted size in Coomassie Blue-stained gels of whole cell lysates (data not shown). The reduced protein migrated slightly more slowly than soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.1 kDa), approximating the predicted mass of 21 kDa for the fusion protein (data not shown). The identity of the NCRD and human mutant fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting using antibodies to human SP-D and/or by blotting with S-protein-HRP conjugate as described below (data not shown). Initially, recombinant proteins were isolated from soluble extracts of BL21 or NovaBlue cells. However, maximum yields of trimeric protein were in the range of several hundred μg/liter. In subsequent experiments, the recombinant proteins were isolated in much larger amounts from inclusion bodies (IBs) produced in RosettaBlue competent cells (Novagen, Madison, WI). Isolation of Soluble Protein from Periplasm—For some control experiments using soluble fusion proteins, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in Tris-buffered saline buffer with lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml), in the absence of added calcium, with or without 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. After incubating for 15 min at 30 °C, the cells were lysed by sonication on ice with three 20-s bursts (30% of maximum power using a CE-3240 sonicator and microprobe; Heat Systems, Farmingdale, NY) until the suspension was no longer viscous. The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g at 4 °C for 25 min. Isolation from Inclusion Bodies—Bacteria from 1 liter of cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed using 10 ml of CelLytic B reagent (Sigma) per gram of bacterial pellet. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, IBs were collected and washed, dissolved in 10 or 20 ml of CelLytic IB in the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, dialyzed into 6 m urea, and then refolded and oligomerized by dialysis against decreasing concentrations of urea and increasing concentrations of NaCl at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the AAA mutant, it was necessary to include a bacterial protease inhibitor mixture (P8849; Sigma) prior to and immediately following refolding and oligomerization to prevent degradation during chelation chromatography. Given that endotoxin is a ligand for SP-D, particular precautions were undertaken to minimize endotoxin contamination during protein purification and characterization. Endotoxin was quantified using an end-point chromogenic assay (QCL-1000; Cambrex Corp., E. Rutherford, NJ). Water was purified using a MQ Biocel A10 water purification system with TOC and Pyroguard 5000UF cartridge (Millipore Corp.). All chromatography and binding assay buffers were prepared using freshly purified, endotoxin-free water and stored in depyrogenated or pyrogen-free glass and plasticware. Saccharide affinity columns were routinely precleaned by washing with PyroCLEAN (ALerChek, Portland, ME). Tricorn gel filtration columns were depyrogenated by washing with 0.5 m sodium hydroxide and stored in ethanol. Chelation Affinity Chromatography—Refolded proteins isolated from IBs or soluble proteins from cell lysates were dialyzed against 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm imidazole (binding buffer). After centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g, the soluble His-tagged fusion proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography using an AKTA Purifier chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) and a freshly charged, 5-ml HiTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were bound to the column in the binding buffer (see above) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The column was then washed with 5 column volumes of binding buffer prior to elution with a two-step imidazole gradient with 5 column volumes per step (step 1, 10–50 mm imidazole; step 2, 50–500 mm). Elution was monitored at A280 with subtraction of buffer absorbance. All of the fusion proteins eluted near the same position from the metal columns. Yields of the human proteins were in the range of 40 mg of fusion protein/liter of bacteria. However, yields of RCL-43-NCRD were much lower, reflecting reproducibly lower levels of protein accumulation by the transformed cells. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Aliquots (up to 0.5 ml) of pooled affinity-purified protein containing as much 10 mg of total protein were dialyzed versus 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and concentrated as needed by ultrafiltration (Centricon-20; Millipore Corp.). Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, samples were applied to a Tricorn 10/300 GL Superose 12 column on the AKTA purifier. The column was precalibrated with commercial globular protein standards (151-1901; Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at room temperature. All recombinant protein stocks isolated from IBs had very low endotoxin values, with maximum concentrations ranging from 1.9 to 3.1 pg/μg purified protein. Aliquots of protein were stored at –80 °C. Samples dialyzed into 150 mm NaCl prior to gel filtration showed an increased proportion of larger aggregates on the chromatogram. Careful pooling of the trimer fractions and storage at higher ionic strength was implemented to minimize aggregation of concentrated stocks and ensure reproducible results in these assays. Fusion protein purified by gel filtration in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl showed negligible aggregation at concentrations up to several hundred μg/ml, even following freezing and thawing (data not shown). Saccharide Affinity Chromatography—For some preliminary experiments, soluble or refolded IB proteins were dialyzed versus Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C. Following the addition of calcium to 5 mm, samples were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was applied at 30 ml/h to a depyrogenated column of maltosyl-agarose or mannosyl-agarose equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline containing 5 mm calcium (30Persson A. Chang D. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5755-5760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After extensive washing with several column volumes, bound proteins were eluted with calcium-free column buffer containing 10 mm EDTA. SDS-PAGE and Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed using prepoured 10 or 12% separating or 10–20% gradient gels. Recombinant proteins were routinely visualized by rapid staining with Bio-Safe Comassie Blue (Bio-Rad). Molecular weights were estimated using Mark 12 standards (Invitrogen). The identity of the proteins was confirmed by blotting using S-protein-HRP (1:5000; Novagen) or by indirect immunoassay. For blotting, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 9 V for 35 min using a semidry transfer apparatus. For immunoblotting, blots were incubated with P13 rabbit polyclonal antibody to hSPD (31Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Am .J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar) or bovine serum CL-43 (32Holmskov U. Teisner B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. Jensenius J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10120-10125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000; Bio-Rad 170-6515), complexes were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Enterokinase Cleavage—For selected control experiments, fusion tags were cleaved from the recombinant proteins at the enterokinase cleavage site using a protocol provided with the enzyme (P98070L; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Up to 1 mg of fusion protein was incubated with 0.005% (w/w) enzyme for 16 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 2 mm CaCl2. The reaction was terminated by the addition of a 2-fold volume excess of trypsin inhibitoragarose (T-0637; Sigma). The suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and the beads were removed by centrifugation. The EK-cleaved trimeric neck + CRD domain was isolated by gel filtration as described above. Cross-linking Assays—The extent of oligomerization of proteins recovered by gel filtration was confirmed by chemical cross-linking using the covalent homobifunctional cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Pierce), as previously described (33Zhang P. McAlinden A. Li S. Schumacher T. Wang H. Hu S. Sandell L. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19862-19870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). BS3 was added to the purified neck + CRD fusion protein (1 μg/100 μl) in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at the indicated concentrations. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 3 min prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. The binding of trimeric fusion proteins to surface-adsorbed mannan or other ligands was assessed using 96-well plates and a S protein-HRP detection system. Buffers for binding assays were prepared as follows: coating buffer, 15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, pH 9.6; wash buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4; blocking/binding buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and containing 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA. For some experiments, calcium was deleted from buffers used for the initial wash and blocking/binding steps. Immediately prior to each assay, thawed aliquots of the protein stock solutions were briefly centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and the concentration of protein in the supernatant was confirmed using a BCA protein assay. Mannan Binding Assays—The binding of trimeric neck + CRDs to yeast mannan- or LPS-coated plates was performed using limited modifications of the method of Lim et al. (27Lim B.L. Wang J.Y. Holmskov U. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wells of 96-well plates (catalog no. 3590; Corning) were incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature with 100 μlof50 μg/ml mannan dissolved in coating buffer. After washing, the wells were incubated for at least 1 h with blocking/binding buffer. Neck + CRDs were diluted as required in the calcium-containing blocking/binding buffer and added to wells to give a final volume of 100 μl/well. The plates were incubated with protein for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with S protein-HRP conjugate (Novagen) at a verified optimal dilution of 1:5000. For some control experiments, bound recombinant SP-Ds were detected by an indirect immunoassay using the P13 antibody and goat anti-rabbit HRP IgG (1:2000; Bio-Rad). After washing, the wells were incubated with ABTS peroxidase substrate (KPL), usually for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Background binding in the absence of fusion protein was subtracted to give total binding; where indicated, specific binding (defined as binding in the presence of calcium minus binding in the absence of calcium) was determined. The fusion proteins showed essentially identical signals on blotting of equivalent amounts of protein with S-protein conjugate. However, to confirm comparable S-protein binding activities of the nondenatured trimeric fusion proteins, equivalent dilutions of proteins were adsorbed to untreated 96-well plates. After blocking and washing, bound fusion proteins were detected with S-protein-HRP conjugate as described above. Competition assays were performed as for direct mannan binding except that the proteins were added to wells in the presence of various concentrations of competing inhibitors. For critical comparisons of I50 values (mm) of RhSP-D-NCRD and RAK, replicates were derived from dilutions of three independent stocks of saccharide. Unless otherwise stated, all values are given as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations, and the data are representative of two to three independent experiments using independent dilutions of protein and/or competitors. Binding data were plotted and analyzed using Sigmaplot 8.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Preparation of Influenza A virus (IAV) and Neutrophil Isolation— IAV, Phil82 strain, was grown in the chorioallantoic fluid of 10-day-old chicken eggs and purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The virus was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline to remove sucrose, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C. After thawing, the viral stocks contained ∼5 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml. Neutrophils from healthy volunteers were isolated to >95% purity by using dextran precipitation, followed by Ficoll-Paque gradient separation for the removal of mononuclear cells, and hypotonic lysis to eliminate any erythrocytes. Cell viability was determined to be >98% by trypan blue staining. The isolated neutrophils were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing divalent cations and used within 2 h. Neutrophil Uptake of IAV—Uptake assays were performed as recently described for CL-43 (14Hartshorn K.L. Holmskov U. Hansen S. Zhang P. Meschi J. Mogues T. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled IAV were preincubated with control buffer or various concentrations of NCRDs for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation of aliquots of these samples with neutrophils for 30 min at 37 °C. Trypan blue (0.2 mg/ml) was added to quench extracellular fluorescence. Following washing, the neutrophils were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and neutrophil-associated fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry. The mean neutrophil fluorescence (>1000 cells counted/sample) and the percentage of neutrophils with positive fluorescence (i.e. fluore"

Members include cytochrome P450 reductase, nitric-oxide synthase, methionine synthase reductase, and novel oxidoreductase 1. These enzymes show a strong preference for NADPH over NADH as reducing coenzyme. An aromatic residue stacks over the FAD isoalloxazine ring in each enzyme, and in some cases it is important in controlling coenzyme specificity. In P450 BM3, the aromatic residue inferred from sequence alignments to stack over the FAD is Trp-1046. Mutation to Ala-1046 and His-1046 effected a remarkable coenzyme specificity switch. P450 BM3 W1046A/W106H FAD and reductase domains are efficient NADH-dependent ferricyanide reductases with selectivity coefficients (kcat/Km(NADPH)/kcat/Km(NADH)) of 1.5, 67, and 8571 for the W1046A, W1046H, and wild-type reductase domains, respectively. Stopped-flow photodiode array absorption studies indicated a charge-transfer intermediate accumulated in the W1046A FAD domain (and to a lesser extent in the W1046H FAD domain) and was attributed to formation of a reduced FADH2-NAD(P)+ charge-transfer species, suggesting a relatively slow rate of release of NAD(P)+ from reduced enzymes. Unlike wild-type enzymes, there was no formation of the blue semiquinone species observed during reductive titration of the W0146A/W146H FAD and reductase domains with dithionite or NAD(P)H. This was a consequence of elevation of the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple of the FAD with respect to the oxidized/semiquinone couple, and a concomitant ∼100-mV elevation in the 2-electron redox couple for the enzyme-bound FAD (–320, –220, and –224 mV in the wild-type, W1046A, and W1046H FAD domains, respectively).

Bacillus megaterium flavocytochrome P450 BM3 is a high activity fatty acid hydroxylase enzyme that has evolved from fusion of a eukaryotic-like NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) 1The abbreviations used are: CPR, cytochrome P450 reductase; BM3, flavocytochrome P450 BM3 from B. megaterium; NOS, nitricoxide synthase. to a P450 in a single polypeptide (1Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6683-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion provides an efficient electron transport system from NADPH, through the FAD and FMN cofactors in the CPR, and onto the heme b in the P450 (2Fulco A.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 177-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). P450 BM3 has the highest monooxygenase activity of any P450 system examined to date (3Noble M.A. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. MacKay A.C. Reid G.A. Hanzlik R.P. Munro A.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Molecular dissection has been used to generate the individual heme and CPR domains for structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic studies (e.g. Refs. 4Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 5Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasermann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The component flavodoxin-like (FMN-containing) and ferredoxin reductase-like (FAD-containing) domains of the CPR have also been generated, supporting the hypothesis that the enzyme has a discrete domain organization and that the BM3 CPR and other related enzymes evolved by fusion of genes encoding the smaller flavoproteins (8Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Molecular dissection of the related human CPR to produce component flavin-binding domains has been reported (9Smith G.C. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The isolated domains of human CPR exchange electrons and have thermodynamic properties almost identical to those of intact CPR (9Smith G.C. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The availability of isolated domains has enabled detailed study of electron transfer mechanisms in wild-type and mutant proteins (11Gutierrez A. Grunau A. Paine M.J. Munro A.W. Wolf C.R.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Flavocytochrome P450 BM3 belongs to the diflavin reductase family of enzymes, members of which contain both FAD and FMN cofactors in the same polypeptide chain. Other members of this class include eukaryotic CPRs (13Paine M.J. Garner A.P. Powell D. Sibbald J. Sales M. Pratt N. Smith T. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1471-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), mammalian methionine synthase reductase (14Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), human novel reductase 1 (15Rowland P. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the various isoforms of nitric-oxide synthase (16White K.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6627-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B also contains FAD and FMN cofactors bound noncovalently in discrete domains and in addition binds an iron-sulfur cluster (17Finn R.D. Basran J. Roitel O. Wolf C.R. Munro A.W. Paine M.J. Scrutton N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1164-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the modular construction of this enzyme, essential in nucleotide synthesis, is distinct from other members of the family. The eukaryotic NOS isoforms, like P450 BM3, contain heme b bound to an oxygenase domain covalently linked to the reductase domain (18Noble M.A. Munro A.W. Rivers S.L. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Yellowlees L.J. Shimizu T. Sagami I. Guillemette J.G. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16413-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In recent work, the reduction potentials for each of the couples of the flavin cofactors in P450 BM3, neuronal NOS, human CPR, human novel reductase 1, and methionine synthase reductase have been determined by anaerobic spectroelectrochemistry (6Daff S.N.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3911-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each member of the diflavin reductase family has a strong preference for NADPH over NADH as reducing coenzyme. This is of particular relevance for P450 BM3, which is recognized as an enzyme of biotechnological potential, because of its efficiency as a regio- and stereo-selective oxygenase (20Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 6: 1115-1125Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Through both rational engineering (by structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis) and forced evolution approaches, P450 BM3 variants have been generated with alkane, short chain alkanoic acid, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon oxygenase activities (21Ost T.W.B. Miles C.S. Murdoch J. Cheung Y. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Munro A.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Glieder A. Farinas E.T. Arnold F.H. Nat.

A potential obstacle to the exploitation of P450 BM3 is the high cost of the natural reducing coenzyme for the enzyme, and the relatively poor activity with less expensive NADH coenzyme. A number of reports have emerged concerning the rational engineering of coenzyme specificity, following the first successful study with the flavoprotein glutathione reductase (24Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Substantial switches in coenzyme specificity (∼18,000-fold in the case of glutathione reductase) often require multiple mutations in the nicotinamide coenzyme-binding site. Recently, however, a single point mutation in both human CPR (25Dohr O. Paine M.J.I. Fredberg T. Roberts G.C.K. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Elmore C.L. Porter T.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15990-15999Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and (albeit to a lesser extent) in nitric-oxide synthase (28Adak S. Sharma M. Meade A.L. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13516-13521Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was shown to be sufficient to effect a substantial switch in specificity toward NADH. In both cases, the residue targeted is aromatic and shields the re-face of the FAD isoalloxazine ring; replacement with either histidine or a smaller nonaromatic amino acid facilitates excellent conversion of selectivity toward NADH in both cases. Here we report the isolation and detailed characterization of two mutant forms (W1046H and W1046A) of the isolated FAD domain and diflavin reductase domains of flavocytochrome P450 BM3. From sequence alignment studies and modeling using the crystallographic structure of rat CPR, we infer that Trp-1046 shields the FAD isoalloxazine ring analogous to the role of Trp-677 and Trp-676 in rat and human CPR, respectively (25Dohr O.

We have performed a detailed study of the thermodynamic, spectral, and kinetic properties of the W1046H and W1046A proteins. We show that mutation of Trp-1046 effects a remarkable switch in coenzyme preference. Detailed stopped-flow kinetic and potentiometric studies of the W1046H and W1046A proteins are used to elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic origins of this switch in specificity for the reducing coenzyme. Molecular Biology—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the P450 BM3 diflavin reductase domain was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange kit, using plasmid clones for the P450 BM3 reductase domain (amino acid residues 473–1048 of the full-length flavocytochrome) described previously as the templates for the reactions (7Munro A.W. Daff S. Coggins J.R. Lindsay J.G. Chapman S.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared by standard methods (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers for mutagenesis were synthesized in the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Leicester. The following primers were used for the mutagenesis reactions to create W1046A and W0146H variants of P450 BM3 flavin domains: 5′-CGCAAAAGACGTGCACGCTGGGTAAATT-3′ (W1046H forward primer); 5′-AATTTACCCAGCGTGCACGTCTTTTGC-3′ (W1046H reverse primer); 5′-CGCAAAAGACGTGGCGGCTGGGTAAATT-3′ (W1046A forward primer); 5′-AATTTACCCAGCCGCCACGTCTTTTGCG-3′ (W1046A reverse primer). The underlined regions indicate the section of the oligonucleotides modified from the wild-type sequence to produce the codon change required for the two amino acid substitutions. The reductase mutant plasmids were isolated, and the entire CYP102A1 reductase DNA sequences were determined to ensure that the desired mutation had been introduced and that there were no secondary mutations. Reductase mutant domains were amplified by PCR (amino acid residues 471–1048) using the following two oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GAACAGTCTGCTAAAACCATGGCAAAAAAGGCAGAAAACGCTC-3′ (primer NcoI) and 5′-ACTAAACTACTTTTATCGGATCCTCTTTTTAAT-3′(primer BamHI). The underlined nucleotides indicate sites for the named restriction enzymes. PCR was performed using cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Conditions were as follows: template DNA 50 ng, primers 150 ng, 100 μm dNTPs, 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase in a 50-μl total reaction volume. PCR was performed using a Techne Genius Thermocycler for 30 cycles of 95 °C (45 s), 52 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (2.5 min) for denaturation, annealing, and extension, respectively. Amplified cDNA was cloned into pET11d (Novagen). These mutant reductase clones were used as templates to amplify the NADPH/FAD-binding domains (amino acid residues 664–1048) using the following two oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GCGCCGCGCATATGCCGCTTGCG-3′ (primer NdeI) and 5′-ACTAAACTACTTTTATCGGATCCTCTTTTTAAT-3′ (primer BamHI). Primer NdeI binds at the 5′ end of the sub-gene encoding the FAD domain, and primer BamHI binds at the 3′ end. The underlined nucleotides indicate the positions of engineered sites for the respective enzymes. The amplified cDNAs for the W1046H and W1046A FAD domains were cloned into plasmid expression vector pET11a (Novagen) by cutting the PCR products with restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI at the engineered sites. The plasmid vector was digested with the same enzymes prior to ligation of vector and insert. Constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli XL1 Blue and selected on LB agar/ampicillin plates. Similar reaction conditions for PCR and ligation were used as described for the reductase domains. Expression and Purification of Mutant Reductase and FAD Domains—Production of the FAD (FAD and NADPH binding) and diflavin reductase (FAD, FMN, and NADPH binding) domains of wild-type flavocytochrome P450 BM3 has been described (6Daff S.N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The E. coli T7 RNA polymerase lysogen strain BL21 (DE3) was used to express the wild-type and FAD/reductase domain mutant (W1046A/W104H) proteins. Freshly transformed cells were cultured in Terrific Broth (TB) media (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37 °C with vigorous agitation. At an A600 of 0.8, gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), and culture was continued for a further 3 h before harvesting cells. Recombinant bacterial cells expressing the FAD domains were broken by sonication, and protein was selectively precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation (on ice). The ammonium sulfate protein pellet containing the FAD domain was harvested by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was retained. A similar procedure was used for the reductase domains, with the exception that a 0–30% ammonium sulfate fractionation was performed first, with the supernatant being retained and subjected to further fractionation (30–60% saturation). At all stages following cell breakage, protein degradation was minimized by maintenance of samples on ice in a cold room and by addition of protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor tablet; Roche Applied Science). The final ammonium sulfate pellets were resuspended in, and dialyzed against, 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A). Reductase and FAD domain samples were applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column previously equilibrated with Buffer A. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of KCl (0–500 mm) in the same buffer. Fractions containing the FAD domains were selected on the basis of color and UV-visible absorption spectrum, pooled, and dialyzed overnight using 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride (Buffer B) and applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. Protein was eluted using a linear gradient of KCl (0–500 mm), and fractions with an A280/A450 ratio of <10 were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). For the reductase domains, the Q-Sepharose step was replaced by hydoxyapatite chromatography. Pooled reductase fractions from the DEAE-Sephacel stage were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0, Buffer C) and loaded onto the hydroxyapatite column. Protein was eluted using a linear gradient of Buffer C to 250 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), and fractions with an A280/A450 ratio of < 8 (eluting at ∼100 mm phosphate) were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Purity and integrity of the proteins were established by SDS-PAGE (15% gels), and samples were stored at –70 °C in Buffer C containing 50% (v/v) glycerol following ultrafiltration (Centricon 30, Millipore) to ∼0.5–1 mm final concentration. SDS-PAGE (15%) indicated that the proteins were pure. The concentration of purified proteins was measured spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficients 11,300 m–1 cm–1 for the FAD domains and 21,200 m–1 cm–1 for the reductase domains, as described previously (7Munro A.W.

Steady-state Kinetic Studies—All steady-state kinetic assays were performed using a Jasco V-550 UV-visible double beam spectrophotometer. The split-beam method was used to account for nonenzymatic ferricyanide and cytochrome c reduction by NAD(P)H coenzymes. Assays were set up typically containing 5–10 nm enzyme, potassium ferricyanide at 1.5 mm (for both FAD domains and reductase domains), and cytochrome c at 50 μm (for reductase domains). NAD(P)H was varied across a broad concentration range (∼0–2 mm) to determine apparent Km values for the pyridine nucleotides. Reactions were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 25 °C. In the assays, all components were added to the sample cuvette. The enzyme was not added to the reference cuvette, and the volume was made up with the requisite volume of assay buffer. For the FAD and reductase domains, potassium ferricyanide reduction was monitored at 420 nm (Δϵ420 nm(red-ox) = 1,020 m–1 cm–1). For the reductase domains, cytochrome c reduction was monitored at 550 nm ((Δϵ550 nm(red-ox) = 22,640 m–1 cm–1) (33Daff S. Sharp R.E. Short D.M. Bell C. White P. Manson F.D.C. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6351-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (where ox indicates oxidized; red indicates reduced). To determine the apparent kcat values for NAD(P)H-driven reduction of the electron acceptors and the Km values for NAD(P)H, rate versus [NAD(P)H], data were fitted to a rectangular hyperbola. Stopped-flow Kinetic Studies—Single turnover stopped-flow kinetic studies of flavin reduction in the W1046A/W106H FAD and reductase domains were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX18 MVR stopped-flow spectrophotometer contained within a customized glove box (Belle Technology) to maintain anaerobic conditions (<5 ppm oxygen). Flavin reduction by NADH and NADPH was monitored at 450 nm. Rates of flavin reduction for mutant proteins were measured at 5 and 25 °C. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) with 10 and 5 μm protein concentrations for FAD and reductase domains, respectively. All buffers were made oxygen-free by evacuation and extensive bubbling with oxygen-free argon before use. Prior to stopped-flow studies, protein samples were fully oxidized by treatment with potassium ferricyanide; excess ferricyanide was removed by rapid gel filtration in the glove box (PD-10 column; Amersham Biosciences). Flavin reduction on mixing of reductase and FAD domains with NADPH and NADH was monitored at 450 nm. Absorption transients from the stopped-flow experiments were fitted to appropriate exponential functions using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). Observed rate constants for flavin reduction by NADH showed a hyperbolic dependence on coenzyme concentration, and data were fitted to Equation 1 (31Roitel O. Scrutton N.S. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10809-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to determine the apparent enzyme-coenzyme dissociation constant, K, and the limiting rate of hydride transfer (klim). kobs=klim[S]K+S(Eq. 1) For studies of flavin re-oxidation in single and multiple wavelength stopped-flow modes, FAD and reductase enzymes were reduced to the 2- and 4-electron level with sodium dithionite in the presence of mediators (6 μm phenazine methosulfate, 15 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 1.5 μm methyl viologen, and 3 μm benzyl viologen). Excess sodium dithionite and mediators were removed by gel filtration, and their absence was ensured by spectrophotometric readings of a fully reduced sample of each preparation. These proteins were then mixed rapidly with buffered NADP+ or NAD+ (50–1000 μm). Pseudo first-order conditions were always maintained by keeping coenzyme concentration at least 10-fold greater than enzyme concentration in all stopped-flow analyses. Stopped-flow, multiple-wavelength absorption studies were carried out using a photodiode array detector and X-SCAN software supplied with the Applied Photophysics instrument. Reactions were typically performed up to 1 s (although some spectra were recorded over longer time scales) after the initial mixing event, and the first spectrum was recorded 1.3 ms after mixing. NADH and NADPH (typically in the concentration range 50 μm to 10 mm) were mixed with oxidized enzymes (typically 5–10 μm). NAD+ and NADP+ (typically 50 μm to 1 mm) were mixed with fully reduced enzymes (typically 5–10 μm). Potentiometry—Potentiometric redox titrations to determine the midpoint reduction potentials of the FAD and FMN cofactors in the W1046A/W106H domains were performed in a Belle Technology glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere, as described previously (10Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All solutions were degassed under vacuum with argon. Oxygen levels were always maintained at less than 2 ppm. 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 10% v/v glycerol (titration buffer) was used in all potentiometric titrations, and the protein was applied to a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) in the anaerobic box, pre-equilibrated with degassed titration buffer, to ensure removal of all traces of oxygen. The protein solutions (typically 25–50 μm in ∼5 ml of titration buffer) were titrated electrochemically according to the method of Dutton (34Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) using sodium dithionite as reductant and potassium ferricyanide as oxidant. Dithionite and ferricyanide were delivered in ∼1–2-μl aliquots from concentrated stock solutions (typically 10–50 mm). Mediators (2 μm phenazine methosulfate, 5 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 0.5 μm methyl viologen, and 1 μm benzyl viologen) were added to facilitate electrical communication between enzyme and electrode, prior to titration. The mediators are effective in the range between +100 and –480 mV, as described previously (6Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13816-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 10Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The electrode was allowed to stabilize between each addition of reductant/oxidant. Spectra (300–800 nm) were recorded using a Cary UV-50 Bio UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer, using a fiber optic probe inside the glove box connected to the external spectrophotometer. The electrochemical potential of the solution was measured using a Hanna pH 211 meter coupled to a Pt/Calomel electrode (ThermoRussell Ltd.) at 25 ± 2 °C. The electrode was calibrated using the Fe3+/Fe2+ EDTA couple as a standard (+108 mV). A factor of +244 mV was used to correct relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Data manipulation and analysis were performed using Origin software (Microcal). For titration of the FAD mutants, absorbance data at 462 (W1046H FAD/reductase), 475, and 469 nm (W1046A FAD and reductase) were plotted against the applied potential to determine the FAD-oxidized/hydroquinone couples. Data for the FAD domains were fitted to both the Nernst equation and to Equation 2, which represents a 2-electron redox process derived by extension to the Nernst equation and the Beer-Lambert law, as described previously (10Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Dutton P.L.

For the redox titrations of the W1046A and W1046H reductase domains, data were fitted to Equation 3, describing a 4-electron redox process, as described in previous studies (6Daff S.N. Chapman S.K.

To enable the fitting process, data for the redox couples of the FMN from previous studies were fixed in the initial fitting regime (31Roitel O. Scrutton N.S. Munro A.W.

https://openalex.org/W1977926384,"Cycling of intracellular pH has recently been shown to play a critical role in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Ischemia-reperfusion also leads to mitochondrial matrix acidification and dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which matrix acidification contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and the resultant cellular injury has not been elucidated. We observe pH-dependent equilibria between monomeric, dimeric, and a previously undescribed tetrameric form of pig heart lipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH), a mitochondrial matrix enzyme. Dynamic light scattering studies of native LADH in aqueous solution indicate that lowering pH favors a shift in average molecular mass from higher oligomeric states to monomer. Sedimentation velocity of LADH entrapped in reverse micelles reveals dimer and tetramer at both pH 5.8 and 7.5, but monomer was observed only at pH 5.8. Enzyme activity measurements in reverse Aerosol OT micelles in octane indicate that LADH dimer and tetramer possess lipoamide dehydrogenase and diaphorase activities at pH 7.5. Upon acidification to pH 5.8 only the LADH monomer is active and only the diaphorase activity is observed. These results indicate a correlation between pH-dependent changes in the LADH reaction specificity and its oligomeric state. The acidification of mitochondrial matrix that occurs during ischemia-reperfusion injury is sufficient to alter the structure and enzymatic specificity of LADH, thereby reducing mitochondrial defenses, increasing oxidative stress, and slowing the recovery of energy metabolism. Matrix acidification may also disrupt the quaternary structure of other mitochondrial protein complexes critical for cellular homeostasis and survival.

Transient ischemia results in cellular necrosis and depressed cellular activity that often precedes apoptotic death, which is referred to as ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R). 1The abbreviations used are: I/R, ischemia-reperfusion injury; AOT, Aerosol OT or sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate; DCPIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; LA, oxidized lipoamide; LADH, lipoamide (dihydrolypoil) dehydrogenase; PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; DLS, dynamic light scattering.

Anaerobic energy metabolism causes the accumulation of cytosolic lactic acid, which might further contribute to matrix acidification. It is well documented that substrate flux through the energy-producing mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) is reduced for up to 24 h after I/R in either heart (5Das D.K. Maulik N.

Brain Dis. 1990; 5: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, a biochemical mechanism for the persistent mitochondrial dysfunction observed in the cells that survive I/R has not been elucidated. PDHC is composed of three enzymes catalyzing a series of sequential reactions (14Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The final reaction in this sequence, reduction of NAD+ to NADH, is catalyzed by lipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH). LADH (EC 1.8.1.4) belongs to the family of FAD-dependent thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, which include glutathione and thioredoxin reductases (15Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). LADH is a dimeric flavoprotein with subunit molecular mass of 52 kDa that contains one molecule of FAD and a catalytically active disulfide bridge per subunit (16Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3553-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LADH also catalyzes a “diaphorase” reaction, i.e. reduction of quinones by NADH, and a mechanistically related oxidase reaction that generates superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. We have demonstrated previously that Zn2+ inhibits the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity of LADH, whereas it enhances the oxidase activity (17Gazaryan I.G. Krasnikov B.F. Ashby G.A. Thorneley R.N. Kristal B.S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10064-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this example, the optimal conditions for dehydrogenase and oxidase reactions catalyzed by LADH are mutually exclusive. Similarly, earlier studies reported different pH optima for dehydrogenase (18Reed J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4834-4839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Leichus B.N. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3065-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and diaphorase activities (20Nakamura M. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus pH may provide another potentially physiological way to modify LADH catalytic activity. Published results suggest that LADH exists as a stable dimer. Chemical modification allowed the preparation of monomer, which was reported to retain diaphorase activity (21Tsai C.S. Templeton D.M. Wand A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, conformational instability of the fully reduced LADH from Azotobacter vinelandii has been reported (22van Berkel W.J. Regelink A.G. Beintema J.J. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have observed inactivation of LADH under reducing conditions, which was favored under more dilute conditions. 2I. G. Gazaryan and A. M. Brown, unpublished results. This suggests that dissociation of the pig heart LADH dimer may be involved in the inactivation process. The tendency toward higher oligomeric association of LADH is suggested by the binding of its dimer to the core structures of several enzyme complexes (23Zhou Z.H. McCarthy D.B. O'Connor C.M. Reed L.J. Stoops J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14802-14807Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography of concentrated purified LADH provided evidence for tetrameric LADH, as shown below. Taken together, these observations suggested that LADH might exist as monomer, dimer, and tetramer in solution. Precise knowledge of the catalytic properties of different oligomeric forms of LADH and conditions that promote their interconversion may be of key importance for understanding intracellular changes in PDHC activity. The goal of this work was to characterize the pH dependence of the enzymatic activities and oligomerization of pig heart LADH. Physical and enzymatic studies indicate that substantial changes in both the degree of oligomerization and the catalytic specificity of LADH occur over a narrow, physiologically important pH range. The possible role of pH changes associated with I/R in the alteration of LADH activity or other mitochondrial functions is discussed. NADH, Tris, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), and citric acid were from Sigma. NaOH, HCl, and acetonitrile were purchased from Reakhim (Russia). Me2SO was from Amerco, d,l-α-lipoamide was from Lancaster Synthesis (Great Britain). All solutions were prepared using Milli-Q water with >15 MΩ/cm resistance. All reagents were “ultra grade,” if available, to reduce the possibility of divalent cation contamination. NADH and DCPIP (ϵ600 = 20,600 m–1 cm–1, pH 7.0 (24Popov V.O. Gazarian I.G. Egorov A.M. Berezin I.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 466-471Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) stock solutions (50 and 13–16 mm, respectively) were prepared daily in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or citrate, pH 5.8, buffer solutions. n-Octane (analytical grade, Reakhim) was treated with H2SO4 followed by treatment with Na2CO3 and a subsequent distillation. Bis-(2-ethylhexyl)sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT) (ultra grade) was purchased from American Cyanamid Co. LADH from porcine heart (Type III) was from Sigma. Enzyme Preparation—LADH suspension in 3.2 m ammonium sulfate (500 μl) was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 5 min on a Eppendorf MiniSpin centrifuge, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet dissolved in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, or 25 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.8. The remaining ammonium sulfate was removed by gel-filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column (NAP-5; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, or 25 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.8. The concentration of the eluted protein was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient of ϵ455 = 11,300 m–1 cm–1 (25Massey V. Hofmann T. Palmer G. J. Biol.

The A280/A455 ratio of the enzyme preparations obtained was 5.3–5.8. Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography of Porcine Heart LADH—Chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. An aliquot of LADH suspension was diluted 3-fold in water, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and then 1 ml (about 4 mg of protein) of the resulting solution was applied to the column. Optical density was recorded with a flow-through cell at 280 nm and eluting fractions were collected. LADH activity in collected fractions was measured with 0.2 mm lipoamide and 0.1 mm NADH in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. NADH oxidation was monitored by absorbance at 340 nm in a 96-well plate reader (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices). The reaction was initiated by the addition of LADH. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)—Light scattering measurements were carried out on a “PhotoCor Complex” Photon Correlation Spectrometer (PhotoCor Instruments Inc., College Park, MD) utilizing a 20-milliwatt He-Ne laser as a light source. All measurements were performed at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. The thermostatted bath and the cell holder were coaxial with z axis of a precise goniometer. The photo-detecting system comprised efficient receiving optics, a low-noise photomultiplier tube operating in a photon counting regime, and an amplifier discriminator. A single-board digital correlator analyzed the output signal of the photo-detecting system using a programmable number of channels in linear (128) and multi-tau (256) regimes. Scattering measurements were done at 30 and 90°. Particle size distribution analysis was carried out with the DynaLS version 2 program (Alango Ltd., Haifa, Israel). Diaphorase Activity of LADH in Reverse AOT Micelles in n-Octane— The most commonly used system for preparation and study of reverse micelles is water/AOT/octane, which forms optically transparent and stable solutions of spherical reverse micelles (27Eicke H.F. Top. Curr. Chem. 1980; 87: 85-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of AOT reverse micelles, the particle size distribution is narrow, i.e. uniformed micelles of equal size are formed at each surfactant hydration degree, wo = [H2O]/[AOT] (28Kotlarchyk M. Huang J.S. Chen S-H. J. Phys. Chem. 1985; 89: 4382-4386Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 29Kohling R. Woenckhaus J. Klyachko N.L. Winter R. Langmuir. 2002; 18: 8626-8632Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The inner cavity radius of the micelle, rm, expressed in Å, was shown to conform to the empirical equation (27Eicke H.F. Top. Curr. Chem. 1980; 87: 85-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rm=1.5w0+4eq.1 which holds for all enzyme-containing reverse AOT micellar systems studied thus far (29Kohling R. Woenckhaus J. Klyachko N.L. Winter R. Langmuir. 2002; 18: 8626-8632Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In a typical kinetic experiment, a solution of LADH, NADH, and DCPIP in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, or in 25 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.8, was solubilized by intensive shaking in a solution of 0.1 m AOT in octane. The surfactant hydration degrees, wo, were varied over the range of 12–46. The final reagent concentrations were 25–300 nm LADH, 0.01–0.75 mm NADH, and 0.003–0.15 mm DCPIP. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 2 ml. The background rate for non-enzymatic reduction of DCPIP by NADH was subtracted from the reaction rate values measured in the presence of the enzyme. All activity measurements were performed on a Shimadzu UV-1601PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a cell holder thermostatted at 25 °C and a light path of 1 cm. The reaction was monitored by DCPIP absorbance changes. The extinction coefficient of DCPIP in reverse AOT micelles in octane differs from that in water. DCPIP spectra were scanned at hydration degrees, wo, in the range 12–44 and in the pH range of 5.8–8.5. The extinction coefficients were determined to be 12,730 m–1 cm–1 for Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 (λmax = 568 nm), and 11,300 m–1 cm–1 for citrate buffer, pH 5.8 (λmax = 535 nm). To determine Vm and Km values, DCPIP concentration was varied at a saturating concentration (0.225 mm) of NADH. The kinetic parameters Vm and Km were calculated from kinetic curves by using the Michaelis-Menten equation, v = Vm[S]0/Km + [S]0, where v is the rate of reaction; Vm is the observed maximal rate of the reaction; Km is the observed Michaelis constant and [S]0 is the initial concentration of substrate. Lipoamide Dehydrogenase Activity of LADH in Reverse AOT Micelles in n-Octane—All activity measurements were performed as above, except the reaction time course was monitored by NADH absorbance decrease at 340 nm. To determine Vm and Km values, lipoamide (LA) concentration was varied at a fixed concentration (0.1 mm) of NADH. LA was diluted from a 1 m stock in Me2SO. As in the case with DCPIP, acetonitrile was added to the micellar system to improve solubilization at high hydration degrees of the reagent (wo = 30–42). The final reagent concentrations were in the range of 40–300 nm LADH, 0.1 mm NADH, and 0.25–2 mm LA. The final combined concentration of Me2SO and acetonitrile was less than 5% of the water phase volume in the micellar system. Sedimentation Measurements—Sedimentation coefficients, s, of empty and LADH-containing reverse AOT micelles were determined in 12-mm bisection cells at 20 °C using a Beckman E analytical ultracentrifuge, fitted with a photoelectric scanning device, monochromator, and a multiplexor, and an An-G-Ti rotor at 20,000 rpm as previously described (30Levashov A.V. Khmelnitsky Y.L. Klyachko N.L. Chernyak V. Martinek K. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Levashov A.V. Khmelnitsky Y.L. Klyachko N.L. Chernyak V.Y. Martinek K. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1982; 88: 444-457Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Absorbance scanning was carried out at 280 nm. Aqueous solutions of LADH in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, or in citrate buffer, pH 5.8, were solubilized in 0.1 m AOT in octane at different hydration degrees, wo = 12–44. The protein concentrations were 5–10 μm. Prior to sedimentation experiments, the micellar solutions were incubated at room temperature for 0.5–1 h. The dependence of s on wo was analyzed as previously described (31Levashov A.V. Khmelnitsky Y.L. Klyachko N.L. Chernyak V.Y. Martinek K. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1982; 88: 444-457Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The values of molecular masses of protein forms incorporated into reverse micelles, MP, were calculated from the s values according to the empirical equation (31Levashov A.V. Khmelnitsky Y.L. Klyachko N.L. Chernyak V.Y. Martinek K. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1982; 88: 444-457Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), MP=M0(SPS0−1)·(1−ρV¯0)eq.2 where M0 is a molecular mass of enzyme-free (empty) micelles; sP and s0 are sedimentation coefficients of protein-containing and empty micelles, respectively; V̄0 is the partial molar volume of empty micelles in the solvent with density ρ. Computer Modeling—The three-dimensional structures of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric forms of pig LADH were obtained by homology modeling. First, homologous proteins with known three-dimensional structures were identified using BLAST (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Pairwise sequence alignment indicated that garden pea LADH (Protein Data Bank code 1DXL) is one of the best potential templates for homology modeling of pig heart enzyme (GenBank™ 118675, SwissProt Database code P09623). Pig heart LADH has 57% conserved and 74% semi-conserved amino acids compared with pea LADH sequence. This conclusion was supported by multiple sequence alignment performed with the CLUST-ALW program (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). An additional consideration in choosing pea garden LADH as the modeling template is that it occurs in tetrameric form in the asymmetric unit of LADH crystal. A structural model of pig heart LADH was built using the program on the SWISS-MODEL server (34Guex N. Diemand A. Peitsch M.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Visual analysis of the models obtained was performed with a DeepView/Swiss-Pdb Viewer, version 3.7 (35Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). pH Dependence of Lipoamide and Diaphorase Activities— The pH dependence of the activity of pig heart LADH in NADH-dependent reduction of LA (Fig. 1) displays a broad activity maximum at pH 6.5–8, which is in agreement with earlier reports (18Reed J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4834-4839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Leichus B.N. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3065-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Diaphorase activity was monitored as the NADH-dependent reduction of DCPIP. The preference for the LA reaction over DCPIP varies from 3 to 9 as pH increases from 6 to 8. The optimum DCPIP activity was centered below pH 6 (Fig. 1), which is in agreement with measurements done using benzoquinone (20Nakamura M. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), ferrycianide (20Nakamura M. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and oxygen 3I. G. Gazaryan, unpublished data. as electron acceptors in the NADH dehydrogenase reaction. All of these substrates have different protonation profiles, which eliminates substrate protonation as a significant contributor to the different pH activity curves observed for DCPIP and LA. Another possible explanation is that protonation of enzyme thiols favors formation of fully reduced FAD, which is known to be the catalyst of all the NADH dehydrogenase reactions, over the charge-transfer complex. However, within the pH range from 5.5 to 7.5 no changes in the contribution of the charge transfer form of LADH to the spectrum of two-electron reduced LADH have been detected (36Matthews R.G. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3956-3964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sahlman L. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8033-8038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we examined the possibility that pH was changing the protein structure. Gel Filtration—Fine performance liquid chromatography gel filtration of purified commercial preparations at pH 7.5 of pig heart LADH consistently showed a catalytically active protein shoulder with an estimated MP, molecular mass, of 200 kDa (Fig. 2A). The high molecular weight material displayed specific activity equal to the main peak and SDS-PAGE indicated only the presence of LADH protein monomers. Re-injection of the tetramer peak resulted only in a dimer peak (not shown). The relative abundance of the high molecular weight form was dependent on the initial concentration of the protein, but never exceeded 5%. It is likely that this shoulder corresponds to the tetrameric form of LADH because of the MP value and the presence of lipoamide dehydrogenase activity. Dynamic Light Scattering—Quasielastic or DLS monitors time-dependent fluctuations in the intensity of light scattered by macromolecular solutions. Intensity fluctuations are because of local changes in the concentration of macromolecules responsible for scattering light. Analysis of these fluctuations in the time domain (autocorrelation function) provides a method for the determination of the diffusion rates of macromolecules. The latter can be converted into a hydrodynamic radius, Rh, assuming spherically shaped macromolecules and accounting for the solvent viscosity and temperature (38Kazakov S.V. Galaev I.Y. Mattiasson B. Int. J. Thermophys. 2002; 23: 161-173Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The hydrodynamic radius of proteins has consistently been observed to be larger than the protein radius derived from crystal structures. This discrepancy has been attributed to many factors including “bound” water (hydration shells), frictional coupling to solvent, and deviation from spherical shape (39Halle B. Davidovic M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). DLS has been used successfully to detect changes in subunit association and aggregation in many systems. DLS was employed to assess possible changes of subunit association with varying pH. The autocorrelation function was analyzed to yield the distribution of hydrodynamic radii at each pH value. The average (most probable) hydrodynamic radius reaches a minimum of 3.7 nm at pH 5.7 and increases monotonically to 7.8 nm at pH 8.5 (Fig. 2B). Below pH 5.4 a time-dependent increase in the hydrodynamic radius was observed, consistent with aggregation. It has been noted that pig heart LADH is unstable below pH 5.5 (37Sahlman L. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8033-8038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the purpose of comparison, data from Fig. 1 were re-plotted as the ratio of LA and DCPIP activities (Fig. 2B, closed circles). The shift toward greater subunit association over the pH interval from 5.7 to 8.0 is accompanied by increasing preference for LA over DCPIP activity. Above pH 8, the preference for the LA reaction begins to decline, whereas the hydrodynamic radius continues to increase. Thus, the pH changes in the reaction specificity of pig heart LADH correlate with the changes in the oligomeric state. Reverse Micelles—The gel filtration and DLS data presented above suggest the existence of multiple oligomeric states of LADH. The pH behavior in enzyme and hydrodynamic studies suggests that enzyme activity may vary in correlation with association state. To examine this possibility in greater detail, structure-reactivity studies were initiated using the well established system of reverse micelles as a media for enzymatic reactions (40Martinek K.

Reverse micelles are self-forming and thermodynamically stable aggregates in which micelle size can be varied over a wide range by changing the surfactant hydration degree (wo), i.e. the molar ratio water/surfactant in the system. Entrapping enzymes in nanocontainers composed of surfactant or lipid molecules in organic solvents gives an advantage in elucidation of structure-function relationships for supramolecular complexes (42Luisi P.L.

The diaphorase activity of LADH was used to detect oligomeric forms in reverse micelles because all enzyme forms, including monomer, retain this activity. In contrast, it was reported that LADH monomer does not display lipoamide dehydrogenase activity in aqueous solution (47Visser J. Veeger C. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2069823766,"LeuO protein relieves bacterial gene silencer AT8-mediated transcriptional repression as part of a promoter relay mechanism found in the <i>ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD</i> gene cluster. The gene silencing activity has recently been characterized as a nucleoprotein filament initiated at the gene silencer. In this gene locus, the nucleoprotein filament cis-spreads toward the target <i>leuO</i> promoter and results in the repression of the <i>leuO</i> gene. Although the cis-spreading nature of the transcriptionally repressive nucleoprotein filament has been revealed, the mechanism underlying LeuO-mediated gene silencing relief remains unknown. We have demonstrated here that LeuO functions analogously to the eukaryotic boundary element that delimits the transcriptionally active and repressive domains on the chromosome by blocking the cis-spreading pathway of the transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin. Given that one LeuO-binding site is positioned between the gene silencer and the target promoter, the simultaneous presence of a second LeuO-binding site synergistically enhances the blockade, resulting in a cooperative increase in LeuO-mediated gene silencing relief. A known DNA loop-forming protein, the <i>lac</i> repressor (LacI), was used to confirm that cooperative protein binding via DNA looping is responsible for the blocking synergy. Indeed, a distal LeuO site located downstream cooperates with the LeuO sites located upstream of the <i>leuO</i> gene, resulting in synergistic relief for the repressed <i>leuO</i> gene via looping out the intervening DNA between LeuO sites in the <i>ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD</i> gene cluster."

Identifying the various states of cytosine methylation in human L1 promoter sequences is thus potentially useful in understanding L1 stability. Methylation states of CpG/CpG dyads are expected usually to be concordant, i.e. fully methylated or fully unmethylated. Methylated cytosines on the parent strand usually give rise to methylated cytosines on the daughter strand, and unmethylated cytosines on the parent strand usually give rise to unmethylated cytosines on the daughter strand because of the properties of DNA methyltransferases during DNA replication (4Bestor T.H.

Contrary to this expectation, L1 sequences in human fetal fibroblast cultures were reported to be much more methylated on the sense strand than on the antisense strand (11Woodcock D.M. Lawler C.B. Linsenmeyer M.E. Doherty J.P. Warren W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7810-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which would imply high levels of hemimethylation. Estimating methylation patterns on the complementary strands of repeated sequences can, however, be difficult using conventional bisulfite methylation analysis because few if any of the sampled sense and antisense strand sequences are likely to be derived from the same repeat in the same cell. Even sequences that have an apparent match are likely to be derived from different loci that either had identical sequence in the region examined prior to conversion or a match because of the sequence degeneration caused by bisulfite conversion. Estimating methylation patterns on the complementary strands of L1s using conventional analysis of sense and antisense strands also may be confounded by differential biases during PCR amplification and bacterial cloning. For example, the primers used for the sense strand might preferentially amplify methylated sequences from a small subclass of L1 sequences, whereas the antisense primers might amplify a different subclass of L1s that are more hypomethylated.To overcome these inherent limitations of conventional bisulfite methylation analysis for determining methylation patterns on both strands of L1 repeat elements, we have used a double-strand PCR method, “hairpin-bisulfite PCR” (9Laird C.D. Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C. Vary Jr., J.C. Morgan T. Hansen R.S. Stoger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). With this approach, the limitations of single-strand PCR can be avoided. Strand biases do not occur because both strands are linked prior to PCR amplification. Bisulfite-converted cytosines can be distinguished from evolutionary C-to-T transitions in L1 sequences by the presence, in the former class, of a guanine on the complementary strand, and information from the exact complementary strands of an individual allele is preserved, allowing allele and cell variation to be studied (9Laird C.D.

DNA methylation data presented previously (9Laird C.D. Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C. Vary Jr., J.C. Morgan T. Hansen R.S. Stoger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fibroblast tissue cultures were maintained in AmnioMAX™-C100 (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The transfer of cells was accomplished with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). Purification of tissue culture DNA was performed using Qiagen genomic-tip 20/G. Approximately 2–3 cell doublings occurred between successive cell passages.We examined L1 CpG and non-CpG methylation within a 104-bp promoter region of human L1 sequences, a region that contains nine CpG sites corresponding to those between nucleotides 219 and 323 as reported by Woodcock et al. (11Woodcock D.M. Lawler C.B. Linsenmeyer M.E. Doherty J.P. Warren W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7810-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A more limited set of data from a variety of cell types was obtained for a 118-bp promoter region of L1, focusing on the possibility of non-CpG methylation between nucleotides 328 and 446.We used hairpin-bisulfite PCR to assess methylation status on both strands of individual DNA molecules (9Laird C.D. Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C. Vary Jr., J.C. Morgan T. Hansen R.S. Stoger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For samples of fetal fibroblasts, a molecular-barcoded hairpin linker, either 5′-PO4-ACCAAGCGATGCGTTDDDDDDDCGAGCATCGCT-3′ or 5′-PO4-ACCAAGCGATGCDDDDDDDGCATCGCT-3′ in which D represents random incorporation of A, G, or T (for review see Ref. 16Miner B.E. Stoger R.J. Burden A.F. Laird C.D. Hansen R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was ligated to BsmAI-cleaved genomic DNA for 15 min at 20 °C using 400 units of New England Biolabs T4 DNA ligase in 20 μl with 1× ligation buffer. For DNA samples other than fetal fibroblasts, ligation of hairpin linkers 5′-PO4ACCAAGCGATGCGTTCGAGCATCGCT-3′ or 5′-PO4-TGCTAGCGATGCGGTTGAGCATCGCT-3′ for the 104- and 118-bp regions, respectively, to BsmAI-cleaved genomic DNA was for 15 min at 20 °C using 400 units of New England Biolabs T4 DNA ligase in 20 μl with 1× ligation buffer.Bisulfite-conversion cycling conditions were as follows. Hairpin-ligated DNA was denatured in 0.3 m NaOH for 20 min and then heated to 100 °C for 2 min before the addition of 3.4 m sodium bisulfite and 1 mm hydroquinone. The reaction mixture was incubated at 99.9 °C for 1 min followed by 10 cycles of 55 °C for 15 min and 99 °C for 1 min 30 s. Cycling was completed at 55 °C for 1 h and 10 °C for 9 h. A detailed schematic representation of the hairpin-bisulfite PCR method is shown by Laird et al. (see Fig. 2 and supporting Fig. 6 in Ref. 9Laird C.D. Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C. Vary Jr., J.C. Morgan T. Hansen R.S. Stoger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Post-bisulfite PCR conditions, TOPO TA cloning reactions, and sequencing of all of the samples were carried out as described previously (9Laird C.D. Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C. Vary Jr., J.C. Morgan T. Hansen R.S. Stoger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with the exception of the 118-bp region of the promoter for which PCR primers 5′-CTCCACCCAATTC(A/G)AACTTCCC-3′ and 5′-CTAACTTTGGGTAATGG(C/T)GGG(C/T)G-3′ were used and optimized with Failsafe buffer F (Epicenter). We also routinely clean the underside of the PCR machine lid with DNA Zap (Ambion). We have confirmed through barcoding that this procedure reduces contamination substantially.The cytosine to uracil conversion efficiency based on non-CpG sites was generally high. Only sequences with >98.2% conversion (≤1 unconverted non-CpG cytosine per sequence) were included in our analysis except as described in the next paragraph. The average frequencies of converted non-CpG cytosines in the sequences used for our analysis were 99.4 and 99.8% for the 104- and 118-bp regions, respectively. Sequences with one or more hemimethylated CpG dyads from the 104-bp region had an equally high level of non-CpG conversion efficiency (99.5%) compared with the mean, indicating that hemimethylated dyads are intrinsic to the DNA analyzed and are not a consequence of incomplete conversion of unmethylated CpG dyads. To provide approximately equal representation of data from each of the four passages of fetal fibroblasts analyzed, here we include data from the first 15 well-converted sequences obtained from each passage with the exception of passage 22 from which only 12 well-converted sequences were recovered.To search for possible non-CpG cytosine methylation in the 118-bp region, we also analyzed 14 L1 sequences from human sperm DNA that were chosen because of their lower conversion efficiency. These lower levels of conversion are not often observed with our normal protocol but were generated in some experiments by using fewer denaturation steps or by moving the denaturation steps to the end of the bisulfite procedure.RESULTSThe analysis presented here for methylation patterns of L1 sequences in fibroblasts expands on our previous study (9Laird C.D. Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C. Vary Jr., J.C. Morgan T. Hansen R.S. Stoger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) in several important ways. To provide the highest level of confidence in methylation data, we labeled hairpin-bisulfite PCR products from fetal fibroblasts with molecular barcodes (16Miner B.E. Stoger R.J. Burden A.F. Laird C.D. Hansen R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Molecular barcoding allows us to tag genomic sequences at the time of hairpin-linker ligation. The complementary strands of individual DNA molecules, thus, carry this identification through bisulfite conversion, PCR, cloning, and sequencing. We were also able to detect PCR redundancy and contamination, problems often associated with bisulfite conversion (17Grunau C. Clark S.J. Rosenthal A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E65Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and other PCR applications using limiting template (16Miner B.E. Stoger R.J. Burden A.F. Laird C.D. Hansen R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fetal fibroblast data presented here illustrate such barcodes (Fig. 1). For example, only one nucleotide is different between any two pairs of hypermethylated sequences AB257, AB261, and AB287. Such small differences can arise from subtle differences in methylation patterns among different repeats or from errors during PCR amplification of a single allele. In this example, we can conclude that all three sequences are of independent genomic origins because each sequence has a different seven-nucleotide molecular barcode in the hairpin region (Fig. 1). Unmethylated sequences AB307 and AB313 are identical in having no CpG methylation. They, thus, lack the distinctive information provided by partial methylation patterns. We can conclude that these unmethylated sequences also have independent genomic origins because of their different barcodes within the hairpins.Fig. 1Methylation of a 104-bp L1 promoter sequence in DNAs from fetal fibroblast passages 10, 14, and 22 using barcoded hairpin-bisulfite PCR. Methylation states were inferred using barcoded hairpin-bisulfite PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.” As illustrated and labeled for the top sequence AB258, methylated CpG dyads (M) are indicated in black, unmethylated CpG dyads (U) are boxed, hemimethylated CpG dyads (H) are black on the methylated strand and boxed on the unmethylated complementary strand, evolutionary divergence (ed) within consensus CpG dyads is indicated in gray, and evolutionary divergence not within CpG dyads is indicated by “+.” The hairpin linker on the right is boxed, and bases shaded within the linker represent the seven-nucleotide barcode. For the first eight sequences, evolutionary divergences within consensus CpG dyads are G/C→ A/T transitions. In examples of divergence, information on the complementary strands of individual DNA duplexes distinguishes evolutionary changes from PCR errors (9Laird C.D. Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C. Vary Jr., J.C. Morgan T. Hansen R.S. Stoger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Identification number and conversion efficiency of each sequence are listed on the left. Only two non-converted non-CpG cytosines (asterisk) were observed in the first eight sequences. Only sequences with ≥98.2% conversion of non-CpG cytosines (representing zero or one non-conversion event per sequence) were used for analysis. Dashes within the sequence indicate sequencing errors resulting from uncalled bases. The first four analyzed sequences from passage 10 (top four) and passage 22 (next four) are shown here. Additionally, two fully unmethylated sequences from passage 14 were observed (bottom two). Distinctive barcodes indicate that these 10 sequences were derived from different genomic L1s. For example, sequence AB307 had a barcode of 5′-AATGGCA-3′ and sequence AB313 had a barcode of 5′-TTAGGGT-3′. For the former barcode, the C is either a PCR error (because cytosines were not included in the barcodes (16Miner B.E. Stoger R.J. Burden A.F. Laird C.D. Hansen R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) or the C represents a low level of error during synthesis of the barcoded linker. One unconverted non-CpG cytosine (asterisk) was observed in the last sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The use of DNAs from passages of fetal rather than adult fibroblasts permits a more direct comparison of our data with those of Woodcock et al. (11Woodcock D.M. Lawler C.B. Linsenmeyer M.E. Doherty J.P. Warren W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7810-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not cell passage alters methylation patterns, we sampled fetal fibroblasts at several points throughout 14 passages beyond the initial passage 8 cells. In this data set of methylation patterns from fetal fibroblast L1s, complementary CpG dinucleotides on sense and antisense strands were usually concordant in their methylation status. For example, the ten illustrated sequences have a total of 81 CpG dyads that are conserved relative to the consensus human sequence (11Woodcock D.M. Lawler C.B. Linsenmeyer M.E. Doherty J.P. Warren W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7810-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Of these 81 dyads, 47 (58.0%) were fully methylated, 27 (33.3%) were fully unmethylated, and 7 (8.6%) were hemimethylated. Thus, 91.3% CpG dyads were concordant in their methylation status (Fig. 1). Our larger data set of 57 L1 sequences from fetal fibroblast DNA, representing 471 consensus CpG dyads, showed a similar high level of methylation concordance (91.7%) and low level of hemimethylation (8.3%).We analyzed nine of the 22 CpG consensus sites within the L1 promoter (11Woodcock D.M. Lawler C.B. Linsenmeyer M.E. Doherty J.P. Warren W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7810-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For these nine sites, the methylation percentages ranged from 69 to 90% in fetal fibroblast sequences and the two complementary strands had approximately equal levels of methylation (Fig. 2A). The levels of sense-strand and antisense-strand methylation were highly correlated at these nine sites (r2 = 0.78). In contrast to our data presented here, methylation levels of L1 sequences from fetal fibroblasts were reported by Woodcock et al. (11Woodcock D.M. Lawler C.B. Linsenmeyer M.E. Doherty J.P. Warren W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7810-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) to be very different between strands. Our analysis of their data indicates that sense-strand methylation averaged 99.4% and that antisense-strand methylation averaged 40% for these CpG sites in their sequences (Fig. 2B). Such discordance in the levels of strand methylation would, if correct, imply high levels of hemimethylation. To search for possible explanations for these differences, we asked whether or not the passaging of fetal fibroblasts in cell culture significantly altered the level of hemimethylation. No systematic differences in the levels of hemimethylation were observed for DNA from cell passages 10, 14, 17, and 22 (Fig. 3). The percentages of CpG dyads hemimethylated in L1 sequences from these four passages were 9.5, 8.5, 7.4, and 7.5%, respectively, values that are not significantly different from the average of 8.3% (p > 0.50).Fig. 3Percent hemimethylation of L1 promoter sites within a 104-bp region in DNA from four passages of human fetal fibroblasts. Fibroblasts from a 16-week female fetus obtained from Coriell Cell Repository were cultured as described under “Materials and Methods.” An estimated 2–3 cell doublings occurred between successive passages with DNA from passage 10 (♦) representing the earliest sample and DNA from passage 22 (×) representing the last sample from these cells. Hemimethylation data for DNA from intermediate passages 14 (▪) and 17 (▴) are also shown as well as the average hemimethylation value (boldface line) for the combined data. The percent of hemimethylation at the same nine CpG sites estimated from Fig. 3 of Woodcock et al. (11Woodcock D.M. Lawler C.B. Linsenmeyer M.E. Doherty J.P. Warren W.D. J. Biol.

Each sequence included in our analysis did, however, have a unique methylation pattern (for example, see Fig. 3 in Ref 9Laird C.D. Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C.

In this region, we observed seven unconverted non-CpG cytosines in 57 well-converted sequences (>98.2% conversion of non-CpG cytosines) with no site represented more than once (Fig. 4A). We conclude that methylation of non-CpG cytosines in this region is rare.Fig. 4Hairpin-bisulfite conversion of non-CpG cytosines in L1 promoter regions.A, conversion of non-CpG cytosines in the 104-bp region from 57 well-converted (≥98.2%) fetal fibroblast DNA sequences.

A newly discovered Trypanosoma cruzi PI-PLC (TcPI-PLC) is lipid modified in its N terminus, targeted to its plasma membrane, and believed to play a role in differentiation of the parasite because its expression increases during the differentiation of trypomastigote to amastigote stages. To determine whether TcPI-PLC is involved in this differentiation step, antisense inhibition using phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides, and overexpression of the gene were performed. Antisense oligonucleotide-treated parasites showed a reduced rate of differentiation in comparison to controls, as well as accumulation of intermediate forms. Overexpression of TcPI-PLC led to a faster differentiation rate. In contrast, overexpression of a mutant TcPI-PLC that lacked the lipid modification at its N terminus did not affect the differentiation rate. Therefore, TcPI-PLC is involved, when expressed in the plasma membrane, in the differentiation of trypomastigotes to amastigotes, an essential step for the intracellular replication of these parasites.

Nature. 1996; 380: 582-583Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol is the physiological activator of protein kinase C (2Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar), and IP3 induces the release of Ca2+ from internal stores (3Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2454) Google Scholar). Together, these second messengers cause an increase in phosphorylation of proteins that result in a cellular response. This pathway, also known as the inositol phosphate/diacylglycerol pathway, is known to regulate a large array of cellular processes, including metabolism, secretion, contraction, neural activity, and proliferation (1Irvine R. Nature. 1996; 380: 582-583Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Previous research has indicated that some of the signaling components of the inositol phosphate/diacylglycerol signal pathway are present in Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, and seem to be associated with cell differentiation. T. cruzi has three main developmental stages, the epimastigote that is found in the insect vector and can be grown in axenic culture, the amastigote or intracellular form, which lives in the cytosol of nucleated cells, and the trypomastigote, which is the terminal differentiation stage in the vector (metacyclic form) or is found in the bloodstream of mammalian hosts (bloodstream form). Ca2+ stimulated IP3 and diacylglycerol formation in digitonin-permeabilized epimastigotes of T. cruzi, thus suggesting the presence of a PI-PLC (4Docampo R. Pignataro O.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C activities were characterized in T. cruzi epimastigotes (5Gomez M.L. Erijman L Arauzo S Torres H.N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6428-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) confirmed the presence of a functional enzyme in T. cruzi. The PI-PLC described in T. cruzi is, like all PI-PLC described so far in unicellular eukaryotes, similar to the δ-type PI-PLC of mammalian cells and plants. However, the T. cruzi enzyme possesses an N-myristoylation and palmitoylation consensus sequence that had not been described previously in any other PI-PLC, and has been shown to be myristoylated and palmitoylated (10Furuya T. Kashuba C. Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6428-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that this lipid modification could be important for plasma membrane attachment (10Furuya T. Kashuba C. Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6428-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Evidence for the involvement of T. cruzi PI-PLC in differentiation of these parasites is based on the increase in the IP3 levels and in the expression of the enzyme during the trypomastigote to amastigote differentiation. Within amastigotes, TcPI-PLC localized to the plasma membrane although the protein was not observed in detectable amounts in trypomastigotes (10Furuya T. Kashuba C. Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. J. Biol.

Differentiation of trypomastigotes to amastigotes was also shown to be stimulated by nanomolar concentrations of the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor calyculin A (11Grellier P. Blum J.

Parasitol. 1999; 98: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and inhibited by the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor okadaic acid (12Gonzalez J. Cornejo A. Santos M.R.M. Cordero E.M. Gutierrez B. Porcile P. Mortara R.A. Sagua H. Da Silveira J.F. Araya J.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) implying the intervention of phosphorylation signaling cascades in this process. In the present study, we report that antisense inhibition using phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides inhibits, although overexpression of TcPI-PLC stimulates, the differentiation of trypomastigote to amastigote forms, and that lipid modification is essential for its plasma membrane localization, and stimulation of differentiation. Culture Methods—T. cruzi trypomastigotes and amastigotes (Y strain) were obtained from the culture medium of L6E9 myoblasts by a modification of the method of Schmatz and Murray (13Schmatz D.M. Murray P.K. Parasitology. 1982; 85: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as we have described before (7Moreno S.N.J. Vercesi A.E. Pignataro O.P. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Vercesi A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The contamination of trypomastigotes with amastigotes and intermediate forms or of amastigotes with trypomastigotes or intermediate forms was always less than 10% unless otherwise stated. T. cruzi epimastigotes (Y strain) were grown at 28 °C in liver infusion tryptose medium (14Bone G.J. Steinert M. Nature. 1956; 178: 308-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) supplemented with either 10% newborn calf serum under normal conditions or 20% newborn calf serum after cell transfections. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Trypomastigotes were induced to transform into amastigotes axenically as described previously (15Tomlinson S. VanDekerckhove F. Frevert U. Nussenzweig V. Parasitology. 1995; 110: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, trypomastigotes were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin (DMEM/BSA) at pH 7.5. The cells were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 107/ml in DMEM/BSA at either pH 5 or 7.5. The DMEM was buffered with 20 mm Mes (pH 5.0) or 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). Parasites were incubated at 35 °C and harvested at different time points. For overnight incubations, parasites previously incubated at acidic pH for 4 h were centrifuged and resuspended in DMEM/BSA at pH 7.5. Chemicals—ECL chemiluminescence detection kits, [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and nylon membranes were from Amersham Biosciences. The protein assay was from Bio-Rad. All primers and oligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). G418 sulfate, Gene Tailor Site-directed Mutagenesis System, pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector, protein prestained molecular weight markers, restriction enzymes, Taq polymerase, and TRIzol reagent were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mouse monoclonal antibody 3E6 was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Prime-a-Gene Labeling System was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Bovine serum albumin (Fraction V), β-mercaptoethanol, bromphenol blue, DMEM, Dulbecco's PBS (PBS), EDTA, Hank's balanced salts, Hepes, minimum essential medium, Mes, Mops, newborn calf serum, poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides, protease inhibitor mixture for use with mammalian cells and tissue culture, sodium acetate, sodium deoxycholate, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma. EN3HANCE, [9,10-3H]myristate (47.00 Ci/mmol), and [9,10-3H]palmitate (57.00 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Analytical Sciences. Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Nonidet P-40 was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). The plasmid pXG-GFP+2′ was a gift from Dr. Stephen Beverley, Washington University (St. Louis, MO). The T. cruzi expression vector pTEX was a gift from Dr. David Engman, Northwestern University (Chicago, IL). All other reagents were analytical grade. Attempts to Generate a TcPI-PLC Knock-out—The first step in our attempt to generate null mutants was the preparation of a targeting construct in which the region coding for the X and Y active sites of TcPI-PLC was replaced by the neomycin (Neor) resistance gene. This was accomplished using PCR to generate the 5′ upstream region of TcPI-PLC, the resistance gene (Neor), and the 3′ downstream region of TcPI-PLC with restriction sites attached to the termini of each fragment and sequentially ligated into the pBluescript II KS(+) plasmid vector so that the order of sequences were 5′ TcPI-PLC region, Neor marker, and the 3′ TcPI-PLC region. To generate the 5′ TcPI-PLC fragment, primers were made to amplify a 831-bp region starting at –102 and ending at +729 and adding an XhoI site to the 5′ end and a HindIII site to the 3′ end of the PCR product using forward primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAATTAGGCATAGAAGCGCAAA-3′, reverse primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTTGCTGACTTTTTCTTCATCC-3′, and T. cruzi genomic DNA as template. The 3′ TcPI-PLC fragment was made by amplifying a 410-bp region beginning at +1827 and ending at +2237 and adding a BamHI site to the 5′ end and an XbaI site to the 3′ end using forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCAAACGTTCCAACAAGGGCGAAA-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGATGTCCCCTATATCCTCCCCAAA-3′, and T. cruzi genomic DNA as template. The resistance gene Neor (795 bp) was produced using the plasmid CpCDNA3 (Invitrogen) as template, with forward primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTATGATTGAACAAGATGGATTGC-3′, and reverse primer 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAGG-3′. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and transformed into an Escherichia coli host strain according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA from presumptive positive colonies was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and screened by restriction analysis. Isolates with plasmids carrying the correct size fragment were sequenced to confirm the identity of the insert. In preparation for ligation, insert DNA was gel purified after restriction digestion and DNA inserts eluted from gel fragments using the Ultrafree-DA extraction system (Millipore Inc., Bedford, MA) followed by concentration using ethanol precipitation. The inserts were directionally subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) using standard ligation procedures for cohesive termini and transformed into JM109 E. coli host cells using a standard CaCl2 method for preparation of competent cells and heat shock transformation (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Isolates were screened by restriction analysis, and sequenced to confirm their identity and orientation of the inserts. The Neor knock-out construct was later redesigned to include a splice acceptor site upstream of the drug resistance marker (17Caler E.V. de Avalos S.V. Haynes P.A. Andrews N.W. Burleigh B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4975-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This was accomplished by cloning 511 bp of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase intergenic region (GAP) (18Kendall G. Wilderspin A.F. Ashall F. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) into the HindIII site separating the 5′-TcPI-PLC and Neor marker. T. cruzi genomic DNA was used as template and PCR was performed using forward primer 5′-CCAAGCTTAGGCGTGGCGATGACTTCAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCAAGCTTAAATTCTGTTCAATGTAATT-3′, which both attached HindIII sites to the PCR product. Amplified DNA was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO, subcloned into the HindIII restriction site of the Neor knock-out cassette of pBluescript II KS(+), and sequenced to confirm the identity and orientation of the insert. Large-scale purification of plasmid DNA was accomplished using the Qiagen Plasmid Maxi kit for purification of log phase culture volumes of 200–500 ml in Luria-Bertrani medium. After plasmid isolation, a restriction fragment containing each targeting construct was removed by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, purified by electrophoresis using the Ultrafree-DA extraction system, followed by concentration using ethanol precipitation. Targeting constructs were transfected into wild-type epimastigotes (Y strain) by electroporation (19Cooper R. Ribeiro de Jesus A. Cross G.A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Kelly J.M. Ward H.M. Miles M.A. Kendall G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and cultured overnight in liver infusion tryptose medium. After 48 h incubation at 28 °C, 400 μg/ml G418 sulfate was added to the culture. Culture medium was changed every 1–3 days. Three-6 weeks after transfection, surviving cells were cloned by limited dilution (19Cooper R. Ribeiro de Jesus A. Cross G.A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Generation of TcPI-PLC Expression Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—All constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu Turbo polymerase unless otherwise stated. GFP alone in pTEX was made by amplifying GFP in pXG-GFP+2′ using forward primer 5′-GTCTAGAATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′, which contained a XbaI site, and reverse primer 5′-GCTCGAGTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAGGC-3′ with a XhoI site. The PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted from the gel using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector. Constructs were removed from pCR2.1-TOPO by restriction digest with XbaI and XhoI, gel purified, and ligated into the XbaI and XhoI sites of the T. cruzi episomal expression vector pTEX. Site-directed mutagenesis of the full-length TcPI-PLC inserted between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pTEX and TcPI-PLC/GFP with GFP inserted in the HindIII site following the TcPI-PLC construct of pTEX was accomplished using the Gene Tailor Site-directed Mutagenesis System in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The Gly2–Ala2 mutation was generated using forward primer 5′-TTCGCCCTTTGCTAGCATGGCTCTTTGTAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCATGCTAGCAAAGGGCGAATTCCTGCAGC-3′. The sequence and orientation of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Transfection of T. cruzi—Approximately 1 × 108 mid-log phase epimastigotes were washed twice with 5 ml of Hepes-buffered saline (21 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, and 6 mm glucose), resuspended in 500 μl of Hepes-buffered saline, and mixed with 50–100 μg of plasmid DNA. The suspension was placed in a 2-mm Gene Pulser Cuvette (Bio-Rad) and pulsed twice at room temperature with a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad) set at 1.5 KV and 50 microfarad capacitance. Cuvettes were cooled on ice for 5 min and the parasites transferred to 5 ml of liver infusion tryptose medium containing 20% newborn calf serum. After 48 h incubation at 28 °C, 400 μg/ml G418 sulfate was added to the culture. Culture medium was changed every 1–3 days. Transfected epimastigotes were differentiated to mammalian forms as described before (17Caler E.V. de Avalos S.V. Haynes P.A. Andrews N.W. Burleigh B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4975-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—To observe GFP-tagged proteins, ∼1 × 107 parasites were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides for 10 min. Images of GFP expressing parasites were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) using settings for fluorescent microscopy and equipped with a Spot RT Slider system consisting of a charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Acquired images were evaluated using Meta Morph 5.0 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Slides intended for phase-contrast microscopy were treated in the same manner but images were obtained using an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope. The images were collected with a charge-coupled device camera (model CH250; Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ), an electronic unit (model CE 200A, equipped with a 50-Hz 16-bit A/D converter), and a controller board (model NU 200; both from Photometrics Ltd.). These images were evaluated using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Phosphorotioate Antisense Inhibition of TcPI-PLC—High performance liquid chromatography-purified phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were used containing the following sequences, antisense G*A*A*ATCATCTACAAGTCTTTC*A*G*C, and sense G*C*T*GAAAGACTTGTAGATGAT*T*T*C (* = phosphorothioate modification). The sense oligonucleotide contains the nucleotide sequence for TcPI-PLC bases 61 to 85 in the coding region of the gene and the antisense is complimentary. Oligonucleotides were rehydrated using sterile water at a concentration of 1 mm. Approximately 5 × 108 trypomastigotes were harvested from L6E9 myoblast cell cultures. Only cultures containing >90% trypomastigotes were used for pretreatment. Parasites were divided into 4 aliquots of ∼1 × 108 trypomastigotes each. Two aliquots were used for treatment groups Antisense and Sense and these were resuspended in 400 μl of DMEM (pH 7.5) (DMEM containing 0.4% BSA and buffered with 20 mm Hepes with a final pH adjustment to 7.5) (15Tomlinson S. VanDekerckhove F. Frevert U. Nussenzweig V. Parasitology. 1995; 110: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) containing 20 μm of either antisense or sense oligonucleotides. The two remaining aliquots were used for Controls, pH 5.0 and pH 7.5, and were resuspended in 400 μl of DMEM (pH 7.5). All aliquots were incubated in closed sterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes for 5 h at 35 °C. After 5 h, a modified acid-induced differentiation procedure for trypomastigotes to amastigotes was followed (15Tomlinson S. VanDekerckhove F. Frevert U. Nussenzweig V. Parasitology. 1995; 110: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Before starting, a 40-μl sample containing ∼1 × 107 cells was removed from each group fixed with an equal volume of PBS containing 4% formaldehyde and processed for microscope counting. These samples were labeled time 0. Each group of pretreated trypomastigotes was then washed once with 400 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution and groups Antisense, Sense, and Control pH 5 were washed quickly in 400 μl of DMEM (pH 5.0) (DMEM containing 0.4% BSA with 20 mm Mes and adjusted to pH 5.0) (15Tomlinson S. VanDekerckhove F. Frevert U. Nussenzweig V. Parasitology. 1995; 110: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Control pH 7.5 was resuspended in 400 μl of DMEM (pH 7.5). Aliquots Antisense, Sense, and Control pH 5 were resuspended in 400 μl of fresh DMEM (pH 5.0) and the appropriate oligonucleotide was added to obtain a final concentration of 20 μm in the Sense and Antisense groups. Treatment groups and controls were incubated at 35 °C and samples containing ∼1 × 107 cells were taken at time points 1, 2, and 4 h after the initial time 0 time point and fixed with an equal volume of PBS containing 4% formaldehyde and processed for microscope counting. An additional sample of 1 × 107 cells was taken at 2 h and processed for real-time PCR. At 4 h the remaining parasites in each aliquot group were washed in DMEM (pH 7.5) and re-suspended in 400 μl of DMEM (pH 7.5). Aliquots of the Antisense and Sense groups were combined with the appropriate oligonucleotide to obtain a final concentration of 20 μm. Samples were incubated overnight at 35 °C in closed 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The experiment was ended at 22 h after the time 0 time point when all samples were collected, individually fixed by combining with an equal volume of PBS containing 4% formaldehyde, and processed for microscope counting. Overexpression of TcPI-PLC in Tissue Culture-derived Trypomastigotes—Approximately 5 × 107 wild-type or transfected tissue culture-derived trypomastigotes were harvested from L6E9 myoblast cell cultures and the composition of the cultures was determined by microscope counts. Whenever possible cultures containing >90% trypomastigotes were used for the experiment. If cultures contained <90% trypomastigotes, differential centrifugation was used to reduce the number of amastigotes and intermediate forms. This consisted of a low speed centrifugation (120 × g) for 10 min at 28 °C to remove amastigotes and intermediate forms. The supernatant was removed and high-speed centrifugation (1,700 × g) for 10 min at 28 °C was used to pellet the remaining trypomastigotes. A modified acid-induced differentiation procedure of trypomastigotes to amastigotes was followed (15Tomlinson S. VanDekerckhove F. Frevert U. Nussenzweig V. Parasitology. 1995; 110: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For each group, a sample containing 1.5 × 107 cells was removed and fixed with an equal volume of PBS containing 4% formaldehyde. This sample was labeled time 0. For the reminder of parasites in each group, 2 aliquots of 1.5 × 107 were removed and washed once with 400 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution. Aliquots of the pH 5 groups were washed quickly in 200 μl of DMEM (pH 5.0) and resuspended in 200 μl of fresh DMEM (pH 5.0). Aliquots of the pH 7.5 group were resuspended in 200 μl of DMEM (pH 7.5). Samples were incubated at 35 °C for 1 h, fixed with an equal volume of PBS containing 4% formaldehyde at the end of the incubation, and processed for microscope counting. Cell Counting—Formaldehyde-fixed samples were washed twice with 200 μl of PBS within 1 h after fixing and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS or diluted 1:10 with PBS. A 100-μl aliquot was smeared on polylysine slides and allowed to air dry. All slides were observed by phase-contrast microscopy under the ×100 oil immersion objective. Images were obtained with an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope containing a contact ridicule with 1-mm index squares (Edmund Industrial Optics) installed in the eyepiece. At least 300 cells were counted on each slide in 3 or more randomly chosen fields of view. The images were collected with the system described above. The percentage of trypomastigotes (including intermediate forms), and amastigotes were calculated for each treatment group at each time point sampled. Northern Blotting—The total RNA from ∼1 × 108 cells trypomastigotes (transfected or wild-type) was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose gels with 2.2 m formaldehyde, 20 mm Mops (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm sodium acetate, and transferred to nylon membranes. The DNA probe consisting of the full-length TcPI-PLC was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random hexanucleotide primers and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Prime-A-Gene labeling system). The RNA blot was hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h, washed at high stringency, and exposed to x-ray film (Midwest Scientific, St. Louis, MO) at –80 °C for 1–7 days. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Approximately 1 × 107 parasites were washed in PBS and total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) following the procedure for animal cells including the optional DNase digestion step. cDNA synthesis was accomplished using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) with 100 ng of total RNA used per reaction. Real-time PCR was done using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with software version 1.1 and the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen). The primers for TcPI-PLC amplification were: forward primer 5′-CACTGAGTTCTCGTGGGATGTGAA-3′, and reverse primer 5′-ATGCACTCTGCTAGAAAGTCGTCG-3′. The primers for amplification of the reference ribosomal gene TcP0 were forward primer 5′-CCTCCGTTGCCACCGAATAC-3′, and reverse primer 5′-CGTCATCATCATCCTCCTCT-3′. The primers for amastin amplification were forward primer 5′-ATCTTTGCGACCCTGCTGTTGG-3′, and reverse primer 5′-AGCACGACGGCGACAAATATCAG-3′ (21Minning T.A. Bua J. Garcia G.A. McGraw R.A. Tarleton R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 131: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 12.5 μl of 2 × QuantiTech SYBR Green master mixture, 0.5 μm of each primer, 10 ng of cDNA template, and RNase-free water to 25 μl of the total reaction volume. PCR cycling conditions were 1 cycle (50 °C for 2 min/95 °C for 10 min) and 40 cycles (95 °C 15 s/60 °C for 1 min). All PCR reactions were performed in duplicate. Separate reactions for amplification of TcPI-PLC, TcP0, and amastin were performed for each sample. Relative expression of TcPI-PLC or amastin was calculated by comparing the Ct of amplification to the Ct of TcP0 in each group using the following equation: relative TcPI-PLC or amastin expression = 2–ΔCt with ΔCt = [ΔCttreatment group (CtTcPI-PLC or amastin-CtT0) – ΔCtpH 5 control group-(CtTcPI-PLC or amastin-CtT0)]. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—For myristate and palmitate labeling, cells were individually labeled with either [9,10-3H]myristate (25 μCi/ml) or [9,10-3H]palmitate (50 μCi/ml) using a modified procedure developed by Godsel and Engman (22Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, epimastigotes were grown to a density of 5–7 × 106/ml and 2 × 108 cells were suspended in 5 ml of minimal essential medium with 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum containing 1 mCi of [9,10-3H]myristate (25 μCi/ml), or 1 mCi of [9,10-3H]palmitate (50 μCi/ml). Cultures were incubated at room temperature for 4 h (myristate labeling), or 1 h (palmitate labeling) with gentle shaking and then washed 3 times with 20 ml of sterile PBS to remove"
https://openalex.org/W2038989596,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is an endogenous Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger in many cell types and organisms. Although the biological activity of several modified analogues of cADPR has been analyzed, most of these structures were still very similar to the original molecule. Recently, we have introduced simplified analogues in which the northern ribose (N1-linked ribose) was replaced by an ether strand (Gu, X., Yang, Z., Zhang, L., Kunerth, S., Fliegert, R., Weber, K., Guse, A. H., and Zhang, L. (2004) J. Med. Chem. 47, 5674–5682). Here we also demonstrate that the southern ribose (N9-linked ribose) can be replaced by an ether strand resulting in N1-[(phosphoryl-O-ethoxy)-methyl]-N9-[(phosphoryl-O-ethoxy)-methyl]-hypoxanthinecyclic pyrophosphate (cIDP-DE). This minimal structural analogue of cyclic ADP-ribose released Ca2+ from intracellular stores of permeabilized Jurkat T lymphocytes. In intact T lymphocytes initial subcellular Ca2+ release events, global Ca2+ release, and subsequent global Ca2+ entry were observed. Cardiac myocytes freshly prepared from mice responded to cIDP-DE by increased recruitment of localized Ca2+ signals and by global Ca2+ waves.

(compound 1; see Fig. 1), a metabolite of NAD+ discovered by Lee and co-workers in 1987 (1Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a signaling molecule that regulates calcium mobilization via ryanodine receptors from intracellular stores in a wide variety of biological systems such as sea urchin eggs, pancreatic β cells, smooth and cardiac muscle, T lymphocytes, and cerebellar neurons (reviewed in Refs. 2Lee H.C. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3Guse A.H. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Galione A. Churchill G.C.

Because of the important biological activities of cADPR, much effort has been focused on the syntheses of structural derivatives to elucidate the structure-activity relationship and to supply tools for investigating cellular Ca2+ signaling (reviewed in Refs. 6Potter B.V.L. Walseth T.F. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Guse A.H. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Shuto S. Matsuda A. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 827-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the differences in pharmacological properties between the various modified cADPR analogues are still difficult to explain in terms of the structure-activity relationship.Recently, cyclic IDP-ribose (cIDPR) analogues have been described as agonists of the cADPR/Ca2+ signaling system. 8-Br-N1-cIDPR, a cyclic metabolite obtained by cyclization of 8-Br-nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide, induced Ca2+ signaling in intact Jurkat T lymphocytes (9Wagner G.K.

This finding was unexpected, because 8-substituted cADPR analogues have been known as potent antagonists of cADPR (reviewed in Refs. 6Potter B.V.L. Walseth T.F. Curr. Mol.

A series of N1-glycosyl-substituted cIDPR derivatives with different configurations at the N1-glycosyl moiety also retained agonistic Ca2+-releasing activities (10Huang L.J. Zhou Y.Y. Yuan L. Min J.M. Zhang L.H. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 5340-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More interestingly, a simplified molecule in which the northern ribose was replaced by an ether strand, the N1-ethoxymethyl-cIDPR (cIDPRE) analogue, exhibited a strong potency for inducing Ca2+ release in intact and permeabilized human Jurkat T lymphocytes (11Gu X.F. Yang Z.J. Zhang L.R. Kunerth S. Fliegert R. Weber K. Guse A.H. Zhang L.H. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 8-substituted cIDPRE analogues 8-N3-cIDPRE and 8-NH2-cIDPRE showed similar biological activities as compared with cIDPRE, whereas the halogenated derivatives 8-Br-cIDPRE and 8-Cl-cIDPRE did not significantly elevate [Ca2+]i (11Gu X.F. Yang Z.J. Zhang L.R. Kunerth S. Fliegert R. Weber K. Guse A.H. Zhang L.H. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the N1-ribosyl moiety (northern ribose) and the 6-amino group in cADPR are not, per se, critical structural factors for biological activity, whereas different substituents at the 8-position of the base moiety obviously influence strongly the overall electron affinity and sterical conformation of the analogue, thereby greatly influencing its biological activity.Concerning the southern ribose moiety of cADPR, it was found that the 3′-hydroxyl group was essential for Ca2+ release in the sea urchin egg system, whereas the 2′-hydroxyl was not (12Ashamu G.A. Sethi J.K. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9509-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). O-Methylation of the 3′-hydroxyl group generated an antagonist (12Ashamu G.A. Sethi J.K. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9509-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The stable carbocyclic derivative cyclic aristeromycin diphosphoribose was an agonist in both sea urchin eggs and T lymphocytes (13Bailey V.C. Fortt S.M. Summerhill R.J. Galione A. Potter B.V.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Guse A.H. Cakir-Kiefer C. Fukuoka M. Shuto S. Weber K. Bailey V.C. Matsuda A. Mayr G.W. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Potter B.V.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To further explore the structure-activity relationship of cADPR in mammalian cells, we replaced both the southern and northern ribose moieties of cIDPR with ether strands. The resulting molecule, called N1-[(phosphoryl-O-ethoxy)-methyl]-N9-[(phosphoryl-O-ethoxy)-methyl]-hypoxanthine-cyclic-pyrophosphate (cIDP-DE, compound 2) (Fig. 1), is a minimal structural analogue of cADPR that retained biological activity. Here we report on the chemical and biological characterization of cIDP-DE.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fura2/AM and ionomycin were purchased from Calbiochem. Cyclic ADP-ribose, 8-Br-cADPR, and BDM were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Solvents were dried by reflux over CaH2 and distilled before use. Chemical reagents were supplied by Acros or Aldrich. Laminin was purchased from Roche Applied Science, culture medium reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen, and HEPES was from Invitrogen.Chemistry—UV spectra were recorded on a Varian DMS200 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Steady-state emission spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer. The concentration of the sample was 10 m. Time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry was performed with Bruker BIFLEX™ III. Elemental analysis was determined by a PE-240C analyzer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR were recorded with a JEOL AL300 or a Varian VXR-500 spectrometer using Me2SO-d6, or D2O as a solvent. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million downfield from tetramethyl silicane (1H and 13C). 31P NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature by use of a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer (121.42 MHz); orthophosphoric acid (85%) was used as an external standard. Compounds 2 and 13 were purified on an Alltech preparative C18 reversed phase column (2.2 × 25 cm) with Gilson high performance liquid chromatography by two different buffer systems, acetonitrile/triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0) and acetonitrile/triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.5).Molecular Modeling—The conformations of cADPR and cIDP-DE were minimized using the density functional theory method. Equilibrium geometries of all molecules were fully optimized at the B3LYP/6–31G(d) level of theory. Vibrational frequencies, each calculated at the same level, were used to determine the nature of the stationary points and to give the zero point vibrational energies. Minima were characterized with zero imaginary frequency. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 98 program package. Superimposition was performed by the Accelrys Insight II package.Jurkat T Lymphocyte Cell Culture—Jurkat T lymphocytes (clone JMP) were cultured as described previously (15Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Cardiac Myocyte Isolation and Cell Culture—Wild-type C57/Black Swiss mice (5–7 months old, 3 males and 2 females) were anesthetized with CO2. The heart was quickly removed and retrogradely perfused for 5 min (flow rate of 3 ml/min at 37 °C) with a perfusion buffer containing 113 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 12 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm KHCO3, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.46), 30 mm taurine, 20 mm glucose, and 15 mm BDM. The heart was then digested with perfusion buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml Blendzyme 3 (Roche Applied Science) and 12.5 μm CaCl2 for 9 min. After digestion, the heart was removed, placed in a dish, and cut gently into small pieces. Digestion was stopped with the perfusion buffer containing 12.5 μm CaCl2 and 5% bovine serum albumin. CaCl2 was slowly added back to a final concentration of 1 mm. A total of 211,275 ± 62,203 rod-shaped cells were obtained per heart. Cells were plated in laminin-coated Labtek chambers (0.01 mg of laminin per milliliter; Roche Applied Science) at a density of 20,000 rod-shaped myocytes per milliliter in the plating medium containing minimum essential medium with Hanks' salts and l-glutamine (Invitrogen, catalog number 21575), 5% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 mm BDM and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in a 2% CO2 incubator.Ca2+ Measurements in Intact and Permeabilized Jurkat T Cell Suspensions—Intact Jurkat T lymphocytes were loaded with fura2/AM as described (15Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Ratiometric determination of [Ca2+]i was carried out in cell suspension in a Hitachi F2000 fluorometer at room temperature at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm (alternating) and an emission wavelength of 495 nm. Each experiment was calibrated by the addition of Triton X-100 (10% v/v final concentration) to obtain the maximal ratio and subsequent addition of 4 mm EGTA and 40 mm Tris-base to obtain the minimal ratio.Permeabilized Jurkat T cells were prepared as detailed previously (14Guse A.H. Cakir-Kiefer C. Fukuoka M. Shuto S. Weber K. Bailey V.C. Matsuda A. Mayr G.W. Oppenheimer N. Schuber F. Potter B.V.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were transferred into an intracellular medium (nominally Ca2+-free, pH 7.2), permeabilized with 55 mg/ml saponin for 20 min, and afterward washed three times to remove all saponin. Then, the cells were left on ice for ∼2 h to allow for the resealing of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Finally, ∼1.5 × 107 permeabilized cells were transferred into a quartz cuvette and placed into an F2000 fluorometer (Hitachi Instruments). The cell suspension was warmed to 37 °C and stirred slightly. Fura2/free acid (1 μm final concentration) was added, and the free Ca2+ concentration was monitored at 340 and 380 nm as alternating excitation wavelengths and 495 nm as the emission wavelength. Experiments were started by the addition of creatine kinase (20 units/ml) and creatine phosphate (20 mm), followed by the addition of 1 mm ATP to allow loading of the intracellular Ca2+ pools by endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPases.Chelex resin was added generally to solutions of compounds to be tested for Ca2+ release to avoid any Ca2+ contamination. The quality of the permeabilized cell suspension was checked each day by its responsiveness to cADPR and d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.Confocal Calcium Imaging of T Cells and Cardiac Myocytes—Jurkat T lymphocytes were loaded with fura2/AM as described (15Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Imaging experiments were carried out on thin glass coverslips (0.1 mm) coated with bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) and poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). Silicon grease was used to seal small chambers that consisted of a rubber O-ring on the glass coverslips. Then, 60 μl of buffer A containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) along with 40 μl of cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) in the same buffer were added into the small chamber (16Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The coverslip with cells slightly attached to the bovine serum albumin/poly-l-lysine coating was mounted on the stage of a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRE2).Cardiac myocytes attached to laminin-coated chamber slides were loaded with fura2/AM (4 μm final concentration) for 45 min at 37 °C in plating medium (see above for the composition). Then, the medium was removed by gentle aspiration and replaced by buffer A. This step was repeated one or two times to completely remove fura2/AM as well as rounded or non-attached myocytes.Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging was performed as described recently (16Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Bruzzone S. Kunerth S. Zocchi E. De Flora A. Guse A.H. J.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2141-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In brief, we used an Improvision imaging system (Heidelberg, Germany) built around the Leica microscope at 100-fold magnification. Illumination at 340 and 380 nm was carried out using a monochromator system (Polychromator IV; TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Images were taken with a gray scale charge-coupled device camera (type C4742–95-12ER; Hamamatsu, Enfield, United Kingdom) operated in 8-bit mode. The spatial resolution was 512 × 640 pixels at either 40-fold magnification for cardiac myocytes or 100-fold magnification for T cells. The acquisition rate was approximately one ratio per 160 ms. Raw data images were stored on hard disk. Confocal Ca2+ images were obtained by off-line no neighbor deconvolution using the volume deconvolution module of the Openlab software as described recently for 3T3 fibroblasts (17Bruzzone S. Kunerth S. Zocchi E. De Flora A. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The removal of stray light was set to 0.6 for T cells and 0.63 for cardiac myocytes (removal range was 0 (no removal) to 0.999 (highest removal)). The deconvoluted images were used to construct ratio images (340/380). Finally, ratio values were converted to Ca2+ concentrations by external calibration; images used for calibration underwent identical image processing. To reduce noise, ratio images were subjected to median filter (3 × 3) as described (16Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Data processing was performed using Openlab software versions 1.7.8, 3.0.9, or 3.5.2 (Improvision). Surface plots were generated using Image J software version 1.32J (shareware at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).RESULTSChemistry—The key steps for the synthesis of cIDP-DE (compound 2; Fig. 1) include the synthesis of the N1,N9-disubstituted hypoxanthine 8 and the intramolecular cyclization of the intermediate 13 (Fig. 3). It is well known that hypoxanthine exists in the 6-oxo form in solution and can be converted to N1,N9-disubstituted hypoxanthine after alkylation. However, because the strategy of intramolecular cyclization requires different protecting groups on the N1- and N9-substituted hypoxanthines, respectively, it would be difficult to use hypoxanthine as a starting material. Therefore, N6-benzoyl-N9-substituted adenine 4 was obtained from N6-benzoyl-adenine 3 by the known method (19Robbins M.J. Hansske F. Wnuk S.F. Kanai T. Can. J. Med. 1991; 69: 1468-1471Google Scholar, 20Robins M.J. Zou R. Guo Z. Wnuk S.F. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 9207-9212Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). After deprotection and oxidation of compound 4, N9-substituted hypoxanthine 6 was synthesized (Fig. 2), and N1, N9-disubstituted hypoxanthine 8 with different protecting groups was provided from 4 conveniently. Following the procedure for the synthesis of cIDPRE (11Gu X.F. Yang Z.J. Zhang L.R. Kunerth S. Fliegert R. Weber K. Guse A.H. Zhang L.H. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the intermediate 13 was obtained in very good yield (Fig. 3). It was very interesting to find that the intramolecular cyclization of compound 13 was completed in 61% yield, although the more flexible N1 and N9 ether strands in compound 13 resulted in a larger spatial distance of the two phosphate groups (Fig. 3). The structure of cIDP-DE (compound 2) was identified by 1H NMR,31P NMR (δ–10.09(s)), and high resolution mass spectrometry (time-of-flight, positive) (for C13H19N5O12P2 calculated, 427.0420 ([M+1]–); found, 427.0435).Fig. 3Synthesis of cIDP-DE (2Lee H.C. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) from N9-[(TBDMS-O-ethoxy)-methyl]-hypoxanthine (compound 7). Syntheses were completed as described in the supplemental data (available in the on-line version of this article), and the structures of synthesized compounds were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 31P NMR, and elemental analysis or high-resolution mass spectrometry (time-of-flight, positive). Compound 2 was purified twice by high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 reversed phase column and developed by a linear gradient of 0–40% CH3CN in triethylammonium acetate and triethylammonium bicarbonate buffers (0.1 m, pH 7.0 and 0.1 m, pH 7.5, respectively).

The UV spectrum of cIDP-DE in water exhibited intense absorption at 250 nm (λmax) with an extinction coefficient (ϵ) of 6212.66 mol–1 dm3 cm–1 (data not shown). A moderately intense shoulder band at 278 nm (ϵ = 2478.95 mol–1 dm3 cm–1) was observed. The absorption spectral properties were found to follow Beer's Law at concentrations below 1 × 10–3 mol/liter. Interestingly, cIDP-DE displayed moderate fluorescence in water at room temperature (Fig. 4). The excitation spectrum showed two prominent peaks at 223 and at 278 nm (Fig. 4, top). When excited at 278 nm, an emission spectrum with a single peak at 355 nm was observed (Fig. 4, bottom). By using single photon counting, the fluorescence lifetime was estimated to be 6.2 ns (data not shown). In contrast, no fluorescence was observed in cIDPR and cIDPRE (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that the more flexible N1 and N9 ether strands in cIDP-DE made the π electronic transition in the purine ring easier.Fig. 4Fluorescence spectra of cIDP-DE (compound 2). The excitation spectrum (top) at λem = 355 nm was recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer using a cIDP-DE concentration of 10 m. The emission spectrum (bottom) was recorded using the second excitation peak (λex = 278 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biochemistry and Pharmacology—Because cIDPRE and some of its analogues were recently identified as membranepermeant Ca2+-mobilizing agonists of the cADPR/Ca2+ signaling system (11Gu X.F. Yang Z.J. Zhang L.R. Kunerth S. Fliegert R. Weber K. Guse A.H. Zhang L.H. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we intended to also analyze the biological activities of cIDP-DE. However, due to the unexpected fluorescence properties of cIDP-DE, any interference with the Ca2+ indicator fura2 had to be ruled out first. Thus, [Ca2+]i was determined in Jurkat T cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5). Intracellular Ca2+ pools were completely depleted by the addition of ionomycin; a second addition of ionomycin did not release any further Ca2+ (Fig. 5A). Under these conditions cIDP-DE did not change the fura2 ratio (Fig. 5A). In contrast, when the intracellular Ca2+ pools were filled, cIDP-DE induced a transient Ca2+ release (Fig. 5B) after a short delay. Together with the control data (Fig. 5A), this indicates that cIDP-DE is a membrane-permeant analogue of cADPR with agonistic properties. In addition, Fig. 5B shows that Ca2+ store depletion by cIDP-DE activates Ca2+ entry upon the re-addition of extracellular Ca2+.Fig. 5Global Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry by cIDP-DE in intact Jurkat T cells. Jurkat T cells were loaded with fura2/AM and analyzed by ratiometric fluorometry in a Hitachi F-2000 fluorometer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In panel A the intracellular Ca2+ pools were initially depleted by two subsequent additions of ionomycin (IM; each 1 μm final concentration) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ before cIDP-DE (500 μm final concentration) was added. The further addition of 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ at 900 s demonstrated the activation of Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ entry (31Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). In panel B cIDP-DE (500 μm final concentration) was added without prior depletion of Ca2+ pools. Re-addition of extracellular Ca2+ at 600 s resulted in a significant activation of Ca2+ entry. Dashed line, control experiment without the addition of cIDP-DE. The data shown are typical for 3–5 independent experiments of each type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In saponin-permeabilized Jurkat T cells, cIDP-DE did indeed release Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 6A). However, comparison of the concentration-response curves for cADPR versus cIDP-DE indicates that cIDP-DE is an ∼3-fold weaker agonist (Fig. 6B). The specificity of Ca2+ release evoked by cIDP-DE was demonstrated by its sensitivity to 8-Br-cADPR and ruthenium red; in contrast, Ca2+ release by d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trsiphosphate was almost unaffected (Fig. 6C).Fig. 6cIDP-DE mediated Ca2+ release in permeabilized Jurkat T cells. Jurkat T cells were transferred to an intracellular buffer and permeabilized using saponin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” [Ca2+] was determined in a Hitachi F-2000 fluorometer in the presence of 1 μm fura2/free acid, ATP (1 mm), and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of creatine kinase and creatine phosphate. Panel A shows the release of Ca2+ by cIDP-DE (100 μm) compared with cADPR (100 μm). In panel B the concentration-response relationship is displayed; data are mean ± S.E. (n = 3–6). In panel C 8-Br-cADPR (500 μm) or ruthenium red (RuRed; 25 μm) were added a few minutes before cIDP-DE (100 μm) and d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3; 4 μm); data are mean ± S.E. (n = 3–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regardless of its weak activity in permeabilized cells, a pronounced effect of cIDP-DE on Ca2+ signaling was observed in intact Jurkat T cells when the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to 1 mm during the whole experiment (Fig. 7). Both 500 μm and 1 mm cIDP-DE-activated biphasic Ca2+ signaling consisting of a dose-dependent initial peak (Fig. 7B) and a less dose-dependent sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 7A). cIDP-DE, added at 1 mm extracellular concentration, induced Ca2+ signaling in a manner comparable with that of the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3 (Fig. 7A). At prolonged incubation periods with cIDP-DE, [Ca2+]i did not return to baseline values but remained slightly elevated. This indicates that, in addition to Ca2+ release, Ca2+ entry is also activated and, thus, confirms the data obtained with the Ca2+ free/Ca2+ reintroduction protocol shown in Fig. 5B. The Ca2+-mobilizing activity of cIDP-DE was also observed in Ca2+ imaging experiments. Although the addition of extracellular buffer did not significantly change [Ca2+]i, an increase was observed upon the addition of cIDP-DE (Fig. 8). The increase was not immediate but delayed. In the phase between the cIDP-DE addition and the onset of the global signal, subcellular hot spots of Ca2+ signaling were visible (Fig. 8A, arrowhead, time point 96.826 s).Fig. 7cIDP-DE mediated Ca2+ signaling in intact Jurkat T cells. Jurkat T cells were loaded with fura2/AM and analyzed by ratiometric fluorometry in a Hitachi F-2000 fluorometer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Extracellular Ca2+ was present at 1 mm throughout the experiments. In panel A characteristic examples of the addition of 0.5 and 1 mm cIDP-DE in comparison to a maximal stimulation by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3 (10 μg/ml) are displayed.

https://openalex.org/W2083321861,"Leishmania donovani topoisomerase I is an unusual bisubunit enzyme. We have demonstrated earlier that the large and small subunit could be reconstituted in vitro to show topoisomerase I activity. We extend our biochemical study to evaluate the role of the large subunit in topoisomerase activity. The large subunit (LdTOP1L) shows a substantial degree of homology with the core DNA binding domain of the topoisomerase IB family. Two N-terminal truncation constructs, LdTOP1Δ39L (lacking amino acids 1–39) and LdTOP1Δ99L (lacking amino acids 1–99) of the large subunit were generated and mixed with intact small subunit (LdTOP1S). Our observations reveal that residues within amino acids 1–39 of the large subunit have significant roles in modulating topoisomerase I activity (i.e. in vitro DNA relaxation, camptothecin sensitivity, cleavage activity, and DNA binding affinity). Interestingly, the mutant LdTOP1Δ99LS was unable to show topoisomerase I activity. Investigation of the loss of activity indicates that LdTOP1Δ99L was unable to pull down glutathione S-transferase-LdTOP1S in an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid co-immobilization experiment. For further analysis, we co-expressed LdTOP1L and LdTOP1S in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The lysate shows topoisomerase I activity. Immunoprecipitation revealed that LdTOP1L could interact with LdTOP1S, indicating the subunit interaction in bacterial cells, whereas immunoprecipitation of bacterial lysate co-expressing LdTOP1Δ99L and LdTOP1S reveals that LdTOP1Δ99L was significantly deficient at interacting with LdTOP1S to reconstitute topoisomerase I activity. This study demonstrates that heterodimerization between the large and small subunits of the bisubunit enzyme appears to be an absolute requirement for topoisomerase activity. The residue within amino acids 1–39 from the N-terminal end of the large subunit regulates DNA topology during relaxation by controlling noncovalent DNA binding or by coordinating DNA contacts by other parts of the enzyme.

For further analysis, we co-expressed LdTOP1L and LdTOP1S in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The lysate shows topoisomerase I activity. Immunoprecipitation revealed that LdTOP1L could interact with LdTOP1S, indicating the subunit interaction in bacterial cells, whereas immunoprecipitation of bacterial lysate co-expressing LdTOP1Δ99L and LdTOP1S reveals that LdTOP1Δ99L was significantly deficient at interacting with LdTOP1S to reconstitute topoisomerase I activity. This study demonstrates that heterodimerization between the large and small subunits of the bisubunit enzyme appears to be an absolute requirement for topoisomerase activity. The residue within amino acids 1–39 from the N-terminal end of the large subunit regulates DNA topology during relaxation by controlling noncovalent DNA binding or by coordinating DNA contacts by other parts of the enzyme. Topoisomerases are enzymes that can modify the tertiary structure of DNA without altering the primary structure (1Osheroff N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). DNA topoisomerases accomplish their function by passing one strand of DNA duplex through a transient break in the other strand (type I topoisomerase), resulting in changes in linking number in steps of one (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) or by passing of a duplex DNA from the same or another molecule through a double-stranded break generated in the DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (type II topoisomerase), resulting in changes in the linking number in steps of two (3Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and are involved in vital cellular processes (4Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). Trypanosoma and Leishmania are ancient eukaryotes. The distinctive features include structurally and metabolically unusual kinetoplast DNA within the single mitochondrion of the organism. DNA topoisomerases from the kinetoplastid parasites play a key role in many aspects of nucleic acid metabolism (5Das A. Dasgupta A. Sengupta T. Majumder H.K. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, the emergence of the bisubunit topoisomerase I of Trypanosoma (6Bodley A.L. Chakraborty A.K. Xie S. Burri C. Shapiro T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7539-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and Leishmania (7Villa H. OteroMarcos A.R. Reguera R.M. Balana-Fouce R. Garcia-Estrada C. Perez-Pertejo Y. Tekwani B.L. Myler P.J. Stuart K.D. Bjornsti M.A. Ordonez D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3521-3526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in the kinetoplastid family have brought a new twist in topoisomerase research related to evolution and functional conservation of the type IB family. The core DNA binding domain and the catalytic domain harboring the consensus SKXXY motif lies in separate subunits. The two subunits are synthesized by two different genes, which associate with each other through protein-protein interaction to form an active heterodimeric topoisomerase I within the parasite. This unusual structure of DNA topoisomerase I may provide a missing link in the evolution of type IB enzyme. Camptothecin (CPT), an important class of antitumor agent (8Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), is an uncompetitive inhibitor that traps the enzyme-DNA covalent complex and slows the religation step of the nicking closing cycle (9Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 10Li C.J. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22463-22468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania donovani, CPT promotes protein-DNA complex formation with nuclear as well as kinetoplast DNA (11Bodley A.L. Shapiro T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3726-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated the in vitro reconstitution of bisubunit topoisomerase I of L. donovani. The reconstituted enzyme (LdTOP1LS) is characterized by direct 1:1 molar interaction. Under standard relaxation assay conditions, reconstituted enzyme showed reduced processivity as well as 2-fold reduced affinity for DNA compared with eukaryotic monomeric rat liver topoisomerase I. The enzyme is conventional in its Mg2+ independence and binds with the eukaryotic type 1B-specific recognition site. CPT enhanced the formation of “cleavable complex” at low salt (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CPT induces cellular dysfunction in L. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes with features that are well characterized by several cytoplasmic and nuclear events of apoptosis (13Sen N. Das B.B. Ganguly A. Mukherjee T. Tripathi G. Bandyopadhyay S. Rakhit S. Sen T. Majumder H.K. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 8: 924-936Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 14Sen N. Das B.B. Ganguly A. Mukherjee T. Bandyopadhyay S. Majumder H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52366-52375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic type IB topoisomerases are monomeric and consist of highly conserved structure (15Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The enzymes contain a central DNA binding core domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain harboring SKINYL motif. The linker domain, which is poorly conserved and variable in length, links the two domains. Cleavage occurs by a trans-esterification reaction involving nucleophilic attack by an active tyrosine (Tyr723 in human topoisomerase I) on a DNA phosphodiester bond, resulting in the formation of a covalent DNA 3′-phosphotyrosyl linkage. In the religation phase, a similar trans-esterification reaction involves attack by the free DNA 5′-hydroxyl that releases the enzyme from DNA (16D'Arpa P. Machlin P.S. Ratrie H. II I Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17Liu L.F. Miller K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3487-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human topoisomerase I demonstrates that the core and C-terminal domains form a clamplike structure embedding the DNA helix in a central pore, with two lobes of the protein binding each their site of the helix (18Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The conserved subdomains I and II contribute the upper part “CAP,” which is connected by a flexible hinge to the bottom part of the clamp of subdomain III. This architecture facilitates the opening and closing of protein clamp during binding and release of DNA. The N-terminal domain of human topoisomerase I is the only part of the enzyme still not crystallized. Knudsen and co-workers demonstrated that the amino acid residues located between positions 191 and 206 coordinate “controlled strand rotation” during the topoisomerization step and sensitivity toward CPT (19Frohlich R.F. Andersen F.F. Westergaard O. Andersen H.A. Knudsen B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the most recent crystal structure of human topoisomerase I, which reveals a close interaction of Trp205 with Gly437, which controls protein dynamics including spatial rearrangements required for strand rotation (20Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have addressed the possible role of the large subunit of the bisubunit topoisomerase I of L. donovani. Two N-terminal deletion mutants of the large subunit (LdTOP1Δ39L and LdTOP1Δ99L) were generated and mixed with intact small subunit (LdTOP1S). The mutant enzymes were analyzed for topoisomerase I activity. Our findings reveal that amino acid residues 1–39 of the large subunit have a modulating role in noncovalent interaction with DNA and CPT sensitivity, whereas the residues within the amino acid 40–99 region of LdTOP1L appear to be important in relation to interaction with LdTOP1S. Taken together, our study provides the first insight into the mechanistic detail for understanding the unusual structure of bisubunit topoisomerase I of L. donovani. Construction of Recombinant Plasmid—The full-length large subunit gene (LdTOP1L) was cloned in the NdeI/BamHI site of bacterial expression vector pET16b (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For construction of the N-terminal truncation mutants, the region corresponding to amino acids 40–635 and 100–635 were amplified by PCR using pET16bLdTOP1L as a template. The sense primers were 5′-GGGAATTCCCATATGAAGGGCGAGCGTCGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGAATTCCCATATGGTGTTCCGGCGCAACTTC-3′, respectively, containing a NdeI site created at the initiation codon, whereas the antisense primer was the same 5′-CGGGATCCCTACACCCTCAAAGCTGCAAGAGG-3′ with a BamHI site immediately downstream from the termination codon. The amplified products were cloned in the NdeI/BamHI site of pET16b. The resultant constructs pET16bLdTOP1Δ39L and pET16b LdTOP1Δ99L were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS as described (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The full-length small subunit gene (LdTOP1S) was previously cloned in the NdeI/BamHI site of bacterial expression vector pET16b (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The open reading frame was PCR-amplified using sense primer 5′-CGGGATCCTGATGCAGCCTGTTCAAAGTCCT-3′, containing a BamHI site created at the initiation codon of the open reading frame, and an antisense primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTACTAAAATCGAAGTTCTCGGC-3′ with a HindIII site immediately downstream from the termination codon. The PCR-amplified fragment was cloned in the BamHI/HindIII site of bacterial expression vector pET28c, resulting in the construct pET28c LdTOP1S. For co-expression, we used two compatible T7-based expression vectors (pET16b and pET28c) with two different antibiotics resistances as selectable markers (22Yao N. Coryell L. Zhang D. Georgescu R.E. Finkelstein J. Coman M.M. Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50744-50753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring pET16bLdTOP1L and pET16bLdTOP1Δ99L conferring ampicillin resistance were separately co-transformed with pET28cLdTOP1S with kanamycin resistance. These transformants were selected using ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) for the E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain in an LB agar plate. Overexpression and Purification Procedures—E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS cells harboring pET16bLdTOP1L, pET16bLdTOP1Δ39L, pET16bLdTOP1Δ99L, and pET16bLdTOP1S were separately induced at A600 = 0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 22 °C for 12 h. Cells harvested from 1 liter of culture were separately lysed by lysozyme/sonication, and the proteins were purified through a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) followed by a phosphocellulose column (P11 cellulose; Whatman) as described previously (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Finally, the purified proteins LdTOP1L, LdTOP1Δ39L, LdTOP1Δ99L, and LdTOP1S were stored at -70 °C. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pGEX-GST-LdTOP1S were overexpressed, solubilized, and purified through a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Sepharose column as described previously (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified proteins were quantified by a Bradford reaction using a Bio-Rad protein estimation kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Reconstitution of Mutant Large Subunit with Small Subunit in Vitro—Purified LdTOP1Δ39L and LdTOP1Δ99L were mixed with purified LdTOP1S separately at a molar ratio of 1:1 as described previously (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a total protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in reconstitution buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol). The mix was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C, and the dialyzed fractions were used for the plasmid relaxation activity. Plasmid Relaxation Assay—The type I DNA topoisomerase was assayed by decreased mobility of the relaxed isomers of supercoiled pBlue-script (SK+) DNA in an agarose gel. Relaxation assay was carried out as described (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with LdTOP1LS, LdTOP1Δ39LS, and LdTOP1Δ99LS serially diluted in the relaxation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), supercoiled pBluescript (SK+) DNA (85–95% were negatively supercoiled, with the remainder being nicked circles), and 50 mm KCl. The amount of supercoiled monomer DNA band florescence after EtBr staining was quantitated by integration using Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad Quality One software). Initial velocities (nm DNA base pairs relaxed × min-1) were calculated by the following equation, Initial velocity=([supercoiled DNA]0−Int0·[supercoiled DNA]0)Intt/teq.1 where [supercoiled DNA]0 is the initial concentration of supercoiled DNA, Int0 is the area under the supercoiled DNA band at time zero, and Intt is the area at the reaction time t (23Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of DNA concentration on the kinetics of relaxation was examined over a range of 2.5–40 nm supercoiled pBluescript (SK+) DNA (0.1–2 μg/25 μl of reaction mix) at a constant concentration of 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.9 nm enzyme (LdTOP1Δ39LS) at 37 °C for 1 min. The data were analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plot. The intercept of the y axis is 1/Vmax, and the turnover number = Vmax/enzyme concentration (plasmid molecules relaxed/min/molecule of enzyme). Suicidal Cleavage Assay—A 14-mer (5′-GAAAAAAGACTT↓AG-3′) oligonucleotides containing the topoisomerase IB-specific cleavage site was 5′-32P-end-labeled and annealed to 25-mer (3′-CTTTTTTCTGAATCTTTTTAAAAATp-5′, where “p” is unlabeled phosphate) oligonucleotide as described (24Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The suicidal cleavage reaction was carried out with 5 nm DNA substrate with 0.1 μm enzymes (LdTOP1LS, LdTOP1Δ39LS, and LdTOP1Δ99LS) in 20 μl of reaction mix under standard assay conditions (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl) at 23 °C for the indicated time periods. All reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). Samples were precipitated with 0.4 mm NaCl and three volumes of ethanol and subsequently digested with 5 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 5 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. For analysis, samples were mixed with 5 μl of formamide dye (80% deionized formamide, 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue), boiled, and electrophoresed in 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed (19Frohlich R.F. Andersen F.F. Westergaard O. Andersen H.A. Knudsen B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the percentage of substrate converted to cleavage product was done by film densitometry by using Bio-Rad Quality One software and was plotted as a function of time. For further analysis, suicidal cleavable complex formed with the mutant and wild type enzymes after 2 h of incubation at 23 °C were boiled with 5 μl of SDS loading buffer (5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.12% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the protein bands and dried before exposure to the film to detect the radiolabeled proteins. Single Turnover Religation—Covalent complexes were generated by incubating 5 nm suicide DNA substrate with 0.15 μm enzymes (LdTOP1LS, LdTOP1Δ39LS) for 4 h at 23 °C as above. Under these conditions, suicidal cleavage of 70–80% of the input DNA was observed. Excess salt was not added in the reaction due to the unusual salt sensitivity of the wild type enzyme. The reactions were transferred to 37 °C and preincubated for 2 min. Religation was initiated by the addition of a 300-fold molar excess of the 11-mer religation acceptor oligonucleotides (5′-OH-AGAAAAATTTT-3′) as described in Ref. 24Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. The reaction was carried out under standard conditions (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl) in a 30-μl reaction volume at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. All of the reactions were stopped by adding SDS, and DNAs were subsequently precipitated by ethanol. The precipitated samples were treated with trypsin and analyzed as described for the suicidal cleavage reaction. Analysis of Duplex Oligonucleotide Cleavage Assay—The 25-mer duplex of oligonucleotide 1 (5′-GAAAAAAGACTT↓AGAAAAATTTTTA-3′) and oligonucleotide 2 (5′-TAAAAATTTTTCTAAGTCTTTTTTC-3′) containing a topoisomerase I binding motif was labeled and annealed as described in Ref. 24Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. Cleavage was carried out using a 20-fold molar excess of the wild type and mutant enzymes over duplex 25-mer DNA (enzymes, 0.2 μm; DNA, 10 nm). The reactions were carried out in standard assay mix containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl in the presence or absence of CPT (60 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. All of the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). Samples were precipitated with ethanol, digested with 5 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin, and analyzed by 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography as described above. The amounts of strand cleavage in the presence or absence of CPT for the wild type and mutant enzymes were determined by film densitometry. Analysis of Topoisomerase I DNA Interaction by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The γ-32P end labeling and annealing of the 25-mer duplex of oligonucleotide have been carried out as described above. A DNA binding assay was carried out by incubating the labeled oligonucleotide 1/oligonucleotide 2 (1 nm) in a 25-μl reaction as described previously (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For LdTOP1Δ39LS and LdTOP1Δ99LS, the protein concentrations used in the assay ranged from 2.5 to 0.06 μm. For lysozyme used as a negative control, the concentration extended from 1 to 12 μm. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 15 °C for 15 min and electrophoresed in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C in 0.167× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Due to the high pI values for the reconstituted topoisomerase I proteins (> 9.0), free protein and protein-DNA complexes migrated to the cathode, and therefore only the free oligonucleotides entered the gel. The unbound oligonucleotides in the gel were quantified by using a phosphor imager (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager system). The Kd value was estimated from the protein concentration at which one-half of the duplex oligonucleotide was bound to the protein (25Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Ni2+-NTA-Agarose Co-immobilization Binding Assay—Protein complexes of hexahistidine-tagged LdTOP1Δ39L or LdTOP1Δ99L with GST-LdTOP1S (10 μg) were mixed with pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) in 100 μl of reconstitution buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 2.5 h with gentle shaking as described previously (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, flow-through was collected, and the beads were washed twice with 500 μl of reconstitution buffer containing 20 mm imidazole so that all of the unbound proteins were removed. The protein samples were eluted from the beads with 50 μl of reconstitution buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Co-expression, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analyses— E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring pET16bLdTOP1L and pET28cLdTOP1S or pET16bLdTOP1Δ99L and pET28cLdTOP1S were grown in 150 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing the appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C until reaching an A600 value of 0.6. The cultures were then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 22 °C for 12 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), lysed by sonication, and subjected to immunoprecipitation analyses. The antibodies used in the study were raised against LdTOP1L and LdTOP1S separately as described previously (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 2–5 mg/ml of cleared bacterial total lysate were incubated overnight at 4 °C either with anti-LdTOP1L or anti-LdTOP1S antibody (5 μl/ml) with 150 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Isolated immunocomplex was recovered by centrifugation washed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described (26Sengupta T. Mukherjee M. Mandal C. Das A. Majumder H.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5305-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—A schematic representation of all recombinant constructs used in the present study is shown in Fig. 1A. The overexpressed proteins from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring plasmid pET16bLd-TOP1Δ39L (amino acid 1–39 deletion mutant from the N-terminal region of the large subunit) and pET16bLdTOP1Δ99L (amino acid 1–99 deletion mutant from the N-terminal region of the large subunit) were purified separately through an Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. Mutant proteins were further purified through a phosphocellulose column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The other recombinant proteins (i.e. LdTOP1L (large subunit), LdTOP1S (small subunit), and GST-LdTOP1S) were purified as described previously (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analysis of the purified proteins by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) showed that all of the recombinant proteins are essentially homogeneous. Reconstitution of Relaxation Activity with Wild Type and Mutant Subunits—Reconstitution of enzyme activity was examined by a plasmid relaxation assay as described previously (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The purified wild type and mutant large subunits (LdTOP1L, LdTOP1Δ39L, and LdTOP1Δ99L) were mixed separately with intact LdTOP1S at a molar ratio of 1:1 in reconstitution buffer and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reconstituted enzymes LdTOP1LS and LdTOP1Δ39LS show the topoisomerase I relaxation activity (Fig. 2, A and B). We have shown earlier that the parasite reconstituted enzyme is active at low salt, and the optimum activity is at 50 mm KCl and 10 mm Mg2+ concentration (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, the subsequent relaxation experiments were performed at the above mentioned conditions. To investigate the relaxation activity of mutant reconstituted enzymes, we compared it with that of LdTOP1LS. Time course relaxation experiments were performed in a standard assay mix, where the plasmid DNA and the enzymes (LdTOP1LS, LdTOP1Δ39LS, and LdTOP1Δ99LS) were mixed at a molar ratio of 3:1. The velocities for LdTOP1LS and LdTOP1Δ39LS enzymes were linear for the first 5 min of the reaction. All of the subsequent initial velocities during kinetic studies were calculated for the time points up to 1 min, well within the linear range for the velocity examined. It was observed that LdTOP1Δ39LS relaxes supercoiled DNA at a slower rate than that of LdTOP1LS (Fig. 2; compare lanes 2–10 of A with lanes 2–10 of B), whereas LdTOP1Δ99LS failed to show the generation of topological isomers in a plasmid DNA relaxation assay (Fig. 2C). When the molar ratio between LdTOP1Δ99L and LdTOP1S was changed to 2:1, relaxation activity was still not achieved. The loss of activity of the mutant enzyme was further analyzed in subsequent experiments. The kinetics of relaxation by LdTOP1Δ39LS was examined over a range of supercoiled pBS (SK+) DNA (2.5–40 nm), and the initial velocity was plotted in a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 2D). The maximal velocity (Vmax) for LdTOP1Δ39LS was 4.5 × 10-8 m base pairs of supercoiled DNA relaxed/min/0.9 nm of enzyme, which corresponds to a turnover number of about 50 plasmid molecules relaxed/min/molecules of enzyme. This turnover number appears to be about 1.5-fold slower than that of LdTOP1LS (73 plasmid molecules relaxed/min/molecule of enzyme), as previously demonstrated (12Das B.B. Sen N. Ganguly A. Majumder H.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hence, the slower relaxation rate of mutant enzyme (LdTOP1Δ39LS) compared with wild type reconstituted enzyme (LdTOP1LS) suggests that deletion of amino acid residues 1–39 from the N terminus of the large subunit affe"
https://openalex.org/W2017181069,"In the heme-based oxygen sensor protein FixL, conformational changes induced by oxygen binding to the heme sensor domain regulate the activity of a neighboring histidine kinase, eventually restricting expression of specific genes to hypoxic conditions. The conserved arginine 220 residue is suggested to play a key role in the signal transduction mechanism. To obtain detailed insights into the role of this residue, we replaced Arg220 by histidine (R220H), glutamine (R220Q), glutamate (R220E), and isoleucine (R220I) in the heme domain FixLH from Bradyrhizobium japonicum. These mutations resulted in dramatic changes in the O2 affinity with Kd values in the order R220I < R220Q < wild type < R220H. For the R220H and R220Q mutants, residue 220 interacts with the bound O2 or CO ligands, as seen by resonance Raman spectroscopy. For the oxy-adducts, this H-bond modifies the π acidity of the O2 ligand, and its strength is correlated with the back-bonding-sensitive ν4 frequency, the koff value for O2 dissociation, and heme core-size conformational changes. This effect is especially strong for the wild-type protein where Arg220 is, in addition, positively charged. These observations strongly suggest that neither strong ligand fixation nor the displacement of residue 220 into the heme distal pocket are solely responsible for the reported heme conformational changes associated with kinase activity regulation, but that a significant decrease of the heme π* electron density because of strong back-bonding toward the oxygen ligand also plays a key role.

Oxygen regulates diverse processes essential to life and has recently been identified as an activity regulator ligand for several heme-based sensor proteins, with either histidine kinase activity as for FixL in Rhizobia, or phosphodiesterase activity as for EcDOS 1The abbreviations used are: EcDOS, direct oxygen sensor from E. coli; Bj, B. japonicum; FixL*, soluble truncated FixL; FixLH, heme domain of FixL; FG loop, Thr209 to His220 in BjFixLH; Hb, hemoglobin; HS, high spin; LS, low spin; Mb, myoglobin; RR, resonance Raman; SW, sperm whale; WT, wild type; FT-IR, Fourier transform infrared. in Escherichia coli and PDEA1 in Acetobacter (1Gilles-Gonzalez M-A.

Heme-based sensors carry out crucial roles in biological signaling in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms responding to various gaseous ligands such as dioxygen, nitric oxide (guanylate cyclase, Ref. 4Denninger J.W.

Science. 2002; 298: 2385-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In these sensor proteins, the heme cofactor plays a central role not only in binding the respective effector molecules but also in regulating the associated enzymatic function via heme and protein conformational changes induced by ligand binding. The N-terminal segments of several of these proteins (FixL, EcDOS, PDEA1, and NPAS2) consist of a heme sensor domain whose fold characterizes them as PAS domains. These domains are proposed to share a common conformational flexibility, potentially related to a mechanism for communicating ligand binding and signal transduction (8Vreede J. van der Horst M.A. Hellingwerf K.J. Crielaard W. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18434-18439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PAS domains were also identified in several non-heme proteins involved in the mammalian oxygen-sensing pathway, as ARNT or HIF1-α, which play crucial roles in the cellular metabolic changes under hypoxic conditions (9Safran M. Kaelin Jr., W.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The FixL/FixJ two-component regulatory system is part of the signaling cascade of Bradyrhizobium japonicum that enables this bacterium to adapt its respiratory energy metabolism to the microaerobic environment during root hair invasion and nodule formation (10Sciotti M-A. Chanfon A. Hennecke H. Fischer H-M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5639-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The FixL proteins have a histidine kinase domain, responsible for the phosphorylation of the transcription factor FixJ, and an oxygen-sensing heme domain (11Nellen-Anthamatten D. Rossi P. Preisig O. Kullik I. Babst M. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5251-5255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the oxygen storage protein myoglobin, the heme domain has a b-type heme as prosthetic group with a proximal histidine as axial ligand. Both the deoxy-FeII and Met-FeIII forms are high spin and 5-coordinated (12Gilles-Gonzalez M-A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Upon oxygen fixation, the heme becomes low spin 6-coordinated, and the kinase activity strongly diminishes. Thus, a local perturbation at the heme domain is transduced over a relatively long distance within the protein. Diminished kinase activity has also been observed with low spin CO or NO adducts, but to a far lesser degree (13Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M. Gilles-Gonzalez M-A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6170-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Dunham C.M. Dioum E.M. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Scott W.G. Gilles-Gonzalez M-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7701-7708Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not solely the spin change of the heme upon ligand binding that is responsible for the switching of the kinase activity. Structural studies indicate similarities in the steady-state heme geometry of the oxy-complexes of FixLH and Mb proteins (15Gong W. Hao B. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3955-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), as well as in the bond strength between the heme iron and O2 (16Tamura K. Nakamura H. Tanaka Y. Oue S. Tsukamoto K. Nomura M. Tsuchiya T. Adachi S. Takahashi S. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9434-9435Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, notable differences are observed, especially with regard to the dynamic aspects of the interaction with oxygen. Oxygen affinity is much lower in FixL (17Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8067-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), whereas oxygen geminate recombination after O2 dissociation occurs with unprecedented efficiency and high yield (18Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Négrerie M. Martin J-L. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12771-12776Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike myoglobin, there is substantial reorganization in the FixL heme pocket upon O2 fixation that acts as an oxygen trap, a finding consistent with the x-ray crystallographic structures of the heme domain obtained for BjFixL (BjFixLH) (15Gong W. Hao B. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3955-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Gong W. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M-A. Chan M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15177-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 20Hao B. Isaza C. Arndt J. Soltis M. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12952-12958Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Upon O2 or CN- binding, the FixL heme pocket structure is significantly modified, especially the position of the FG loop (Thr209 to Arg220), and the spatial position of one arginine (Arg220) moves from the propionate 7 group of the heme toward the oxygen ligand (Fig. 1). Based on these structures, the mechanism of primary signal transduction has been suggested to involve the heme propionates and two arginine residues (Arg206 and Arg220). One model proposes that flattening of the heme plane upon ligand binding leads to a shift in the position of the heme propionates reducing the strength of the salt bridge between Arg220 and propionate 7 (15Gong W. Hao B. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3955-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As a result, the arginine at position 220 shifts into the distal pocket of FixL where a H-bond can be formed with the ligand (O2, CN-), leading to new polar interactions and eventually inducing the structural reorganization responsible for kinase inactivation (20Hao B. Isaza C. Arndt J. Soltis M. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12952-12958Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Movement in the FG loop is thus thought to be an important element of this structural reorganization responsible for kinase inactivation. Recently, the three-dimensional crystallographic structure of the R220A mutant of BjFixLH in its FeIII state has been described (14Dunham C.M. Dioum E.M. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Scott W.G. Gilles-Gonzalez M-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7701-7708Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the histidine kinase activity was strongly affected by this mutation as reported for the cyanomet-FixL adduct, but it was not reported for the oxy form because binding of O2 was very inefficient (Kd = 1500 μm-1). According to the description of the FeIII R220A mutant structure, the major structural modifications involved the heme planarity, the lengthening of the axial FeIII-NHis bond, and the propionate 7 geometry. Arg220 is a conserved residue among all known FixL proteins, and its equivalent is also found in the distal pocket of the EcDOS sensor protein (Arg64) (21Park H. Suquet C. Satterlee J.D. Kang C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2738-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of BjFixLH as well as EcDOSH point to the importance of this residue, which interacts with the bound O2 ligand, but its exact role in the O2 affinity and chemical details related to Fe-O2 adduct stabilization are not clear. Here, we have constructed four site-directed mutants of BjFixLH at position 220 to study the influence of Arg220 on the heme conformation and on the nature of O2 binding. The point mutations were chosen in order to modify the electrostatic properties and H-bonding capabilities of residue 220, with minor steric modifications of the side chain. Therefore, Arg220 was substituted by Ile, Gln, His, and Glu. In this study we use resonance Raman spectroscopy to obtain detailed insight in the structural and electrostatic role of Arg220 in different ligation states. In particular, we focus on the oxy-FeII-O2 and the FeII-CO states, because both species exhibit a low-spin 6-coordinated iron with two different heme pockets. The structural information obtained for these states, in terms of residue 220 interactions with bound ligand, can be related to the measured association and dissociation rates for O2 and CO binding, providing new insights into the factors responsible of the structural reorganization in the FixL sensor and the related function. DNA Manipulations, Protein Expression, and Purification—A recombinant gene fragment, corresponding to the region between codons 142 and 270 and encoding the FixL heme domain in B. japonicum, was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis reactions. The substitutions R220H, R220Q, R220I, R220A 2The R220A FixLH mutant has been constructed and characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy and only used for the ligand binding experiments. It was not initially the purpose of this work to study this mutant because we first selected the mutations that would least modify the size of the residue 220 side chain. We observed similar behavior for the R220A and R220E FixLH mutants, with low conversion to the oxy form and rapid degradation of this complex. Thus, the flash photolysis experiments were performed with the R220A mutant as described for the R220E mutant (see “Materials and Methods”). and R220E were introduced following the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) by replacing the codon CGC by CAC, CAG, ATC, GCC2 and GAG, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to further analyses. The final constructs, containing fixLH in the vector pET 28a were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 for expression. Protein expression and purification were performed as described in Liebl et al. (18Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Négrerie M. Martin J-L. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12771-12776Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—All protein samples were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4. The deoxy form of BjFixLH was prepared by reduction in deoxygenated buffer, by addition of freshly prepared degassed sodium dithionite (200 μm final concentration) (Sigma) stock solution in deionized water. Except for the Met forms, all modifications of the sample atmosphere were prepared on a system equipped with a vacuum line. These samples were anaerobically sealed with gas-tight rubber septums and transferred, when required, using gas-tight syringes (Hamilton). The O2 complexes were prepared by addition of an anaerobic sodium ascorbate (Fluka) solution, incubated for 5 min for WT, 15 min for R220Q and R220H, and 30 min for R220I, then flushed with 1 atm O2 for 30 s. For the 18O2 complexes, the flushing was done with 18O2 (Eurisotop; 93.3% 18O (atom percent)). The CO complexes were prepared by reduction with excess sodium ascorbate under 1 atm CO. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments were performed by diluting a 50 μm protein sample into a D2O (Sigma) Tris-DCl buffer solution (pD = 7.4) by a factor of 100. The solution was left for the exchange for 24 h at 4 °C and then concentrated to a final concentration of 30 μm. UV-Visible Absorption Spectroscopy—Optical absorbance measurements were made using a UVIKON 922 (Kontron) spectrophotometer with a 70-μl airtight quartz cell (Hellma) with a pathlength of 1 cm. Protein concentration was 20 μm, and the measurements were performed at ambient temperature. Ligand Association—The rates of association (kon) of the FixL proteins with CO or O2 (except for the oxy-adduct of the R220E mutant), were obtained after flash photolysis with a 10-ns 160-mJ pulse at 532 nm (Quantel YAG laser, France). The heme proteins (10 μm, in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C in 4-mm cuvettes) were reduced with dithionite and equilibrated with CO to form the stable FeII-CO adduct. The samples were then flushed with air, 1 atm of O2 or CO (1, 10, and 100%). A typical kinetic curve was obtained averaging a minimum of 5 measurements, with at least 5 s between photolysis pulses to allow sample recovery. Ligand Dissociation—For all mutants, the rate of O2 dissociation (koff) was measured according to the method previously described (17Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8067-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 22Uzan J. Dewilde S. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Moens L. Hamdane D. Marden M.C. Kiger L. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1196-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The proteins were equilibrated with a mixture of O2 and CO (final concentrations of 75 μm CO and 1.3 mm O2). After photodissociation of the CO, O2 may rebind to the exposed heme, followed by the replacement of O2 by CO. If the gas mixture contains nonsaturating amounts of O2, the P50 can be estimated from the fraction that binds after photodissociation of the CO. For the R220E mutant, where autooxidation of the protein may be a problem, this method was used to estimate the kon value for O2 binding, because the heme was exposed to O2 for less than 1 s. FT-IR Spectroscopy—FT-IR spectra were recorded with an IFS 66 (Bruker) spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. ATR spectra were taken using a ZnSe reflection crystal (Pike Technologies). 10 μl of the sample solution (0.5 mm) was deposited on the crystal and dried by a gentle stream of nitrogen gas to avoid water contributions to the FT-IR spectra. Reported spectra were the result of the averaging of 10 single spectra recorded with 250 scans. Spectral resolution was 4 cm-1. Baseline corrections were performed using GRAMS 32 software (Galactic Industries). Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Resonance Raman spectra were recorded using a modified single-stage spectrometer T64000 (Jobin-Yvon) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled back-thinned CCD detector and 1800 grooves/mm holographic gratings. Samples for the resonance Raman measurements were prepared at a protein concentration of 20 μm. The excitation wavelength at 413.1 nm was provided by a Kr+ ion laser (Spectra physics series 2000). A 90° scattering geometry was used and laser power at the sample was 5 milliwatt. Holographic notch filters (Kaiser) were placed at the entrance slits (100 μm) to reject stray light. For measurements of the CO derivatives, the laser power was decreased to ≤2 milliwatt to minimize photodissociation using neutral density filters. All spectra were recorded at room temperature using a spinning cell (diameter 2 mm) to prevent excessive photodissociation and avoid local thermal degradation of the protein during the measurements. To accurately determine isotope shifts, the monochromator was calibrated using the laser excitation wavelength and a saturated sulfate solution; spectra of samples to be directly compared were recorded the same day with no change in experimental geometry. Reported spectra were the result of the averaging of 200 single spectra each recorded with a CCD exposure time of 30 s. Spectral resolution was about 3 cm-1. The band assignments are proposed by analogy with SW myoglobin and RmFixL (23Hu S. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 24Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4178-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Band-fitting analyses for the RR and FT-IR data were performed using the GRAMS 32 software. The central frequency values of spectral components in a complex cluster of bands were determined using second derivative and Fourier self-deconvolution. These frequency values and bandwidths of 15 cm-1 were used as input parameters for the reiterative band-fitting routine. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the BjFixLH and mutant proteins were recorded in the range 200–800 nm, and the results are summarized in Supplemental Data Table S1. All mutants were able to fully bind CO like the wild-type protein, and the UV-visible data are very similar to that of WT Bj- FixLH. In contrast, dramatic differences were observed for the mutants in their ability to bind O2. The formation of a stable Fe-O2 adduct under similar conditions as WT (10 mm ascorbate, 1 atm O2) was observed for the R220H, R220I, and R220Q substitutions, whereas the reaction of R220E with dioxygen did not allow formation of any stable adduct; the UV-visible absorption spectra are presented in Fig. 2. The spectrum of WT Fe-O2 is taken as reference for 100% O2 fixation (Fig. 2A) (18Liebl U. Bouzhir-Sima L. Négrerie M. Martin J-L. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12771-12776Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For R220I and R220Q mutants, the spectra obtained appear as mixtures of FeIII, FeII, and FeII-O2 states, as indicated by shoulders at 395 nm (FeIII species) and 440 nm (FeII species) for R220I. For each mutant, the contributions of the FeII deoxy or FeIII Met states were subtracted in order to obtain a homogeneous Soret band similar to that of WT FeII-O2. The resulting spectra are presented in Fig. 2, B and C, and data are reported in Supplemental Data Table S1. The amounts of the oxy form were estimated to be 50 and 80% for the R220I and R220Q mutants, respectively. For the R220H mutant, a 100% of O2 fixation was observed under 1 atm O2 as well as under air (20% O2; data not shown). Thus, this mutant exhibits a higher affinity for O2 than wild type, since wild type is unable to form 100% of the oxy form under air. FixL proteins have lower O2 and CO affinities than most natural myoglobins, because of slow ligand association rates as reported in Table I (17Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8067-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). kon values for O2 binding were measured by flash photolysis of the oxy-adduct as described under “Materials and Methods” (see Supplemental Data Fig. S1). For the R220E mutant a mixed O2/CO atmosphere experiment was performed (30 μm CO and 1.3 mm O2); the first phase of the rebinding kinetics has a rate that is the sum of kon (O2) and koff (O2) (see Supplemental Data Fig. S2). After 4 ms, the rebinding reaction under 1 atm O2 was almost complete, and the ΔA value corresponds to formation of 42% of the oxy-complex for the R220I mutant, 74% for the R220Q mutant, and 100% for the R220H mutant (Fig. 3). The experiment was also performed under air for the R220I mutant, leading to formation of only 10% of the oxy-complex. These results are in full agreement with the UV-visible results presented above.Table IKinetics and equilibrium constants for the reaction of ferrous BjFixL with O2and CO compared to those of other hemoproteinsProteinO2CO konRef.P50KdkonkoffmmHgμmX 10-4 m-1s-1s-1X 10-4 m-1s-1BjFixL7614014.5200.517Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G.

Truncation of the kinase domain apparently results in the lowering of the P50 (O2) value. The same observation has been previously made for the Rm- FixL protein (17Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G.

Upon mutation of Arg220, the association rate of O2 and CO are modified in a similar manner and kon values for both ligands follow the order: WT < R220E < R220Q < R220H < R220I. The koff values for CO dissociation were calculated from experimentally determined KCO and kon (CO) values. A consensus value for koff (CO) at 25 °C was about 0.06 ± 0.03 s-1. The koff values for O2 dissociation given Table I were determined from mixed O2/CO atmosphere (see “Materials and Methods”). Mutation of Arg220 strongly influences the koff rates, which follows the order: R220I ∼ R220E < R220Q < R220H ∼ WT. koff values are very similar for SW Mb and for the R220H BjFixLH mutant (Table I). Replacement of the histidine residue in SW Mb and in the R220H BjFixLH mutant by a glutamine or an isoleucine leads to an increase of the koff value for both proteins by a factor of 10–20 or 200–400, respectively. For Mbs in general, increased koff values have been associated with weakening of H-bonding to the bound O2 molecule (26Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Finally, P50 (O2) binding coefficient were calculated from the kinetic (on and off) rates and are reported in Table I. The values obtained for the R220I, Gln, and Glu mutants are higher than for the wild-type protein, indicating a lower affinity for dioxygen. This is mainly because of a large increase of the koff value. In contrast, the R220H mutant exhibits a lower P50 (O2) value, largely because of an increase of the kon value with respect to WT.

Biological membrane fusion is not spontaneous because merging two stable membranes to a single bilayer imposes a high activation energy barrier (2Chernomordik L.V. Leikina E. Kozlov M.M. Frolov V.A.

Thus, specialized fusion proteins are required either to provide the necessary free energy or to lower the fusion energy barrier.

The “zipper model” predicts that complex formation starts from the membrane-distal N-terminal region, setting up the stage, and progresses toward the membrane-proximal C-terminal region, closing the gap between the two bilayers. Although the existence of a partially zipped complex has been supported by several biochemical experiments (17Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), such a complex has not been physically trapped or kinetically identified. Therefore, the structure and the stability of the partially zipped complex, which seem to be important in understanding the exact role of SNARE assembly in membrane fusion, are unknown. In this work, we investigated the structure of the SNARE core assembled by recombinant t-SNARE Sso1p/Sec9 and v-SNARE Snc2p, a set of SNARE partners involved in post-Golgi trafficking in yeast, using site-directed spin labeling EPR (23Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 24Chen Y. Xu Y. Zhang F. Shin Y.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In detergent solutions, SNARE core assembly was spontaneous and complete. However, when t-SNAREs were reconstituted in the proteoliposome and mixed with a soluble recombinant v-SNARE representing the cytoplasmic domain of Snc2p, an equilibrium was established between the complete SNARE complex and the partially zipped SNARE complex. It appears that the membrane stabilized the partially zipped complex and made it energetically equivalent to the complete SNARE complex. On the other hand, the analysis of the sitedirected mutants of Sso1p, using the proteoliposome fusion assay, indicated that complete SNARE core formation is required for membrane fusion. Therefore, the results provide new insights into the structural and energetic roles of SNARE assembly in promoting membrane fusion. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—DNA sequences encoding Sso1pHT (amino acids 185–290 of Sso1pHT) and Snc2pS (amino acids 1–93 of Snc2p) were inserted into the pGEX-KG vector between EcoRI and HindIII sites as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Sec9c (amino acids 401–651 of Sec9) was inserted into pET-24b(+) between NdeI and XhoI sites as a C-terminal His6-tagged protein. To introduce a unique cysteine residue for the specific nitroxide attachment, native cysteine 266 of Sso1pHT was mutated to alanine. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate all mutants; DNA sequences were confirmed by the Iowa State University DNA Sequencing Facility. Protein Expression, Purification, and Spin Labeling—Expression of recombinant GST fusion proteins was conducted in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (Novagene). The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with glucose (2 g/liter), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) until the A600 reached 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were grown for an additional 4 h at 18 °C. Cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min. Purification of GST fusion proteins was achieved with affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in PBS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v)) with 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were broken by sonication in an ice bath. As for Sso1pHT, 1% of n-lauroyl sarcosine was added to the solution before sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with glutathione-agarose beads in the resuspension buffer and nutated at 4 °C for 120 min. The protein-bound beads were washed with an excess volume of washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for at least six rounds. When washing, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added to Sso1pHT, whereas no detergent was added to Snc2pS. The beads were then washed with thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0), either with 0.2% Triton X-100 for Sso1pHT or without detergent for Snc2pS. Finally, the proteins were cleaved from the resin by thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature for 40 min. AEBSF was added to the protein after the cleavage (2 mm final concentration). The protein was stored at –80 °C with 10% glycerol if needed. Cysteine mutants of Sso1pHT were spin-labeled before thrombin cleavage. After the cell lysate was incubated with beads and washed with PBS buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. The sample was incubated at 4 °C for 40 min, and the beads were then washed eight times with an excess volume of PBS buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100 to remove dithiothreitol. An ∼20-fold excess of 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolinyl-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate spin label was immediately added to the protein. The reaction mixture was left overnight at 4 °C. Free methanethiosulfonate spin label was removed by washing with excess PBS buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100. The proteins were cleaved by thrombin in cleavage buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100. The His6-tagged protein Sec9c was expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS. The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with glucose (2 g/liter), kanamycin (30 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) until the A600 reached 0.6–0.8. After isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) addition, the cells were incubated further for an additional 4 h at 22 °C. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min. For purification, the frozen cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS buffer with 20 mm imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm AEBSF, pH 8.0). After sonication on ice, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) in lysis buffer. The mixture was nutated for binding at 4 °C for 120 min. After binding, the beads were washed with washing buffer (PBS buffer with 50 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Then the protein was eluted by elution buffer (PBS buffer with 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The protein can be stored at –80 °C with 10% glycerol. All purified proteins were examined with 15% SDS-PAGE. Membrane Reconstitution and SNARE Ternary Complex Formation—Large unilamellar vesicles (∼100 nm in diameter) of 1-palmitoyl-2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) containing 15% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (DOPS) were prepared in a detergent-free cleavage buffer using an extruder (24Chen Y. Xu Y. Zhang F. Shin Y.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The total lipid concentration was 100 mm. Proteins were reconstituted into vesicles by the Bio-Beads method (24Chen Y. Xu Y. Zhang F. Shin Y.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Proteins were mixed with vesicles at an ∼1:300 protein-to-lipid molar ratio. The detergent was removed by treating the sample with Bio-Beads SM2 (Bio-Rad), which was directly added to the sample in the ratio of 200 mg/1 ml of the mixed solution. After 45 min of nutation, Bio-Beads were removed from the sample by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The same procedure was repeated three times. Reconstitution efficiency was estimated by determining the protein concentration using EPR before and after reconstitution. For all samples, the efficiency was ∼70%. For ternary SNARE complex formation in the membrane, Sso1pHT-reconstituted vesicles were mixed with Sec9c in a molar ratio of 1:4 and then incubated at room temperature for 60 min to help the formation of the binary t-SNARE complex. Next, Snc2ps was added, forming the ternary SNARE complex with the final Sso1p to Snc2ps molar ratio of 1:4. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1–5 h. The vesicle solution was concentrated using a 100-kDa cutoff centrifugal filter (Millipore) before taking an EPR spectrum. As for SNARE assembly in detergent, the procedure was the same as described above except that all three proteins were directly mixed in a detergent solution and were concentrated using a 5-kDa cutoff centrifugal filter (Millipore) after a 30-min incubation. EPR Data Collection—EPR spectra were collected using the Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with a loop-gap resonator. The modulation amplitude was set at no greater than one-fourth of the line width. Spectra were collected at room temperature. Proteoliposome Fusion Assay—For the lipid-mixing fusion assay, two different populations of vesicles were separately prepared. Snc2p was reconstituted to vesicles containing POPC, DOPS, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) at a molar ratio of 62:35:1.5:1.5. SSo1pHT was reconstituted into the vesicles containing POPC and DOPS at a molar ratio of 65:35. The protein-to-lipid molar ratio was ∼1:150. The detergent in the sample was removed by Bio-Beads at three cycles, and then the samples were dialyzed against 2 liters of dialysis buffer at 4 °C overnight. Prior to the fusion assay, Sso1pHT-reconstituted vesicles, Sec9c, and Snc2p-reconstituted vesicles were mixed at a molar ratio 9:9:1. The final solution contained 0.5 mm lipids. Fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 465 and 530 nm, respectively. Fluorescence changes were recorded with a Varian Cary Eclipse model fluorescence spectrophotometer using a quartz cell of 100 μl with the 2-mm path length. The maximum fluorescence intensity (MFI) was obtained by adding 0.1% reduced Triton X-100. Theoretically, MFI should be obtained at the end of the fusion reaction, in which dyes are distributed homogeneously on every vesicle as a result of the completion of the fusion reaction. As an approximation, we prepared the samples with the homogeneous distribution of dyes. The fluorescence intensities of these samples were measured and compared with those obtained at the onset of the fusion reaction. We found that the MFIs obtained by adding 0.1% reduced Triton X-100 were virtually the same as those obtained with the latter method. All lipid mixing experiments were carried out at 35 °C. Site-directed Spin Labeling of Yeast t-SNARE Sso1p—In site-directed spin labeling, native amino acids are site-specifically replaced one by one with cysteines to which the nitroxide side chain is attached. The coiled coil motifs of individual SNAREs are mostly unstructured prior to complex formation. When associated with their partners, however, the polypeptides become α-helical (25Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which significantly reduces the tumbling rates for the peptide backbone as well as for the amino acid side chains. The EPR line shape is sensitive to the motional rates of the nitroxide (26Schneider D.J. Freed J.H. Lasers, Molecules and Method. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 385-527Google Scholar). Thus, SNARE core formation accompanies large EPR line shape changes, from a narrow spectrum reflecting the fast motion to a broad spectrum reflecting the slow motion (24Chen Y. Xu Y. Zhang F. Shin Y.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Kweon D.H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To investigate SNARE core formation, we prepared 26 consecutive cysteine mutants (N215C–L240C) of recombinant Sso1pHT (amino acids 185–283 of Sso1p), which contains the SNARE motif and the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1), and cysteine mutants were labeled with methanethiosulfonate spin label. Spin-labeled mutants were then reconstituted into POPC vesicles containing 15 mol% negatively charged DOPS, a lipid composition commonly used to mimic the native cellular membrane (5McNew J.A.

The functionality of the cysteine and spin-labeled mutants was checked with the proteoliposome fusion assay (see below). The EPR spectra of the first 11 reconstituted Sso1pHT mutants (N215C–Q225C) had two spectral components. One broad component reflects the slow motion and another sharp component reflects the fast motion of the nitroxide (Fig. 2A). Such composite spectra are characteristic of two coexisting structures, one structured and the other random coil-like. EPR spectra of the next 15 mutants (E226C–L240C) were all fast motional, indicating that this region is a freely moving random coil. The structure in the N-terminal region might be due to the self-association of Sso1pHT. Previously, it was shown that Syntaxin, the neuronal counterpart of Sso1p, self-associates to form dimers (30Misura K.M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. May A.P. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41301-41309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Kim C.S. Kweon D.H. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10928-10933Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To verify whether the N-terminal structure of Sso1pHT was due to a similar oligomerization, we collected the low temperature EPR spectra (32Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and found that some mutants exhibited apparent spin-spin interactions (data not shown), supporting the oligomeric state of Sso1pHT. Partially Zipped SNARE Complex Is Stabilized by the Membrane—As for the core complex, we first examined SNARE complex formation in detergent solutions as a control. Spin-labeled Sso1pHTs dissolved in 0.5% Triton X-100 were mixed with a 4-fold excess of Sec9c (amino acids 401–651 of Sec9) and soluble Snc2pS (amino acids 1–93 of Snc2p) lacking the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). The room temperature EPR spectra were collected after incubating the mixture at 20 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2B). The EPR spectra of all mutants are broad, reflecting the slow motion of the nitroxide, most likely due to the formation of the fully assembled coiled coil in the entire region. In fact, the variation of the EPR spectra along the amino acid sequence appeared to be in qualitative agreement with the pattern of a coiled coil. Residues 217, 222, 224, 228, 231, 235, and 238 are predicted to be internal a or d positions and yielded very broad EPR spectra reflecting nearly completely frozen motion, indicative of the tight packing of the coiled coil interior. These EPR results are consistent with the previous NMR study reporting that soluble yeast SNAREs form a well defined coiled coil (33Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Next, we used reconstituted Sso1pHT into vesicles and mixed it with 4-fold molar excess of soluble Sec9c and Snc2pS. For the first 14 mutants N215C–V225C, we observed the broad and slow motional EPR spectra with a small fraction of the sharp spectral component (Fig. 2C, arrow), indicating that most Sso1p molecules were engaged in complex formation. In contrast, for the next 12 mutants, the sharp spectral component appears to be significantly increased, suggesting that a large fraction of Sso1p is uncomplexed and uncoiled. The addition of an extra 4-fold excess of Sec9c and Snc2pS to the mixture did not change the EPR spectra, supporting that the sharp component was due to the local (intramolecular) fraying of the coiled coil and not due to the global (intermolecular) dissociation of the complex. Also, neither the incubation of the mixture for 1 day at room temperature nor the incubation at 37 °C for 5 h changed the EPR spectra. Thus, the results support that the protein samples were in equilibrium rather than in a kinetic trap. We, however, note that we were unable to reconstitute the preassembled SNARE complex into the vesicles because of the protein aggregation. To analyze the data quantitatively, we decomposed the two spectral components into individual ones using spectral subtraction method (34Thorgeirsson T.E. Russell C.J. King D.S. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For each spin-labeled position, the fraction of the unstructured was calculated based on the ratio of the spin concentrations of two species (Fig. 3). For the SNARE samples in the detergent, coiled coil formation was nearly complete across all positions examined. For reconstituted Sso1pHT, however, the N-terminal region showed that ∼90% formed the complex, whereas the C-terminal positions showed that only 50% participated in the complex. Therefore, it appeared that 50% of Sso1pHT formed the full SNARE complex, 40% percent formed the partially zipped complex for which the N-terminal region was structured, whereas the C-terminal region was frayed, and the remaining 10% stayed as an uncomplexed species. The Structure and the Stability of the Partially Zipped Complex—The analysis of the EPR data indicates that the partially zipped core is well structured in the N-terminal region, whereas it might be predominantly a random coil in the C-terminal region. In the meanwhile, we observed a gradual increase of the disordered population of Sso1p from 10 to 50% in the range of D229C–L240C. Such a gradual change in the broad range might suggest that there is a significant degree of heterogeneity in the structure. Further, this region may undergo random fluctuations between the helical conformation and the random coil conformation. Since the population ratio between the complete complex and the partially zipped complex is known, it is possible to estimate the Gibbs free energy difference (ΔG°) between these two species. Under current conditions, the two species are nearly equally populated, which means that the equilibrium constant (K) is close to unity. Since ΔG° = –RT ln K, where R is the universal gas constant and T is the temperature, the free energy difference comes out to be nearly 0 between these two species. Therefore, we conclude that the transition from the partially zipped SNARE complex to the complete complex may not release the free energy. Complete Core SNARE Assembly Is Required for Membrane Fusion—The EPR analysis revealed that the partially zipped SNARE complex was stabilized by the membrane and coexisted with the fully assembled complex. It was also shown that there might be no free energy gain on going from the partially zipped complex to the complete complex. One then might wonder whether the formation of the complete SNARE complex is required for membrane fusion. To test this possibility, we examined the fusion activity of cysteine- and nitroxide-scanning mutants of Sso1pHT using the proteoliposome fusion assay. The size of the nitroxide side chain is relatively bulky, and it is comparable with that of tryptophane. Therefore, if the formation of the complete coiled coil were required for membrane fusion, the alterations at the internal positions might cause some serious perturbations. With the cysteine- and nitroxide-scanning mutants, we might observe the periodic behavior of the fusion activity along the sequence, consistent with the heptad repeat pattern of the coiled coil (35Weimbs T. Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For the lipid mixing fusion assay, we prepared POPC/DOPS vesicles containing mutant t-SNAREs (Sso1pHT mutants/Sec9c). Snc2p was reconstituted into separate vesicles containing fluorescence dyes. When we mixed two vesicle populations, we detected significantly reduced lipid mixing with the mutations at internal a and d positions as compared with that of wild type (Fig. 4), particularly in the C-terminal region below the conserved “0” layer (Q224 of Sso1p). In this region, we observed a periodic behavior of the fusion activity along the sequence that was in phase with the heptad repeat pattern. However, the addition of dithiothreitol that cleaved off the nitroxide side chain from the cysteine residue restored fusion activities significantly at the internal a and d positions (Fig. 4, triangles). Therefore, the results suggested that complete coiled coil formation is required for membrane fusion. To further examine the necessity of the formation of the complete core, we prepared several Sso1pHT mutants in which the internal d positions in the C-terminal region were replaced with helix-breaking prolines. The proline mutations should block coiled coil formation. When the proline mutants were examined with the lipid mixing fusion assay, we observed significantly reduced lipid mixing as compared with that of wild type, further supporting the assertion that complete core formation is essential for membrane fusion (Fig. 5). In this work, it was shown that membrane-reconstituted SNAREs behaved differently from those in solution. In solution, SNARE motifs of v- and t-SNAREs engaged one another to form the complete coiled coil core. In the membrane, however, the partially zipped complex, in which the C-terminal region of the SNARE core was frayed, became stabilized and coexisted with the complete complex. The EPR analysis suggested that the two complexes were energetically equivalent with little Gibbs free energy difference between the two. Based on these results, it seems difficult to envision that the transition from the partially zipped complex to the complete complex releases the free energy that might be used for membrane fusion. In contrast, the results from the lipid mixing fusion assay suggested that the formation of the complete complex is still essential for membrane fusion. Moreover, it is highly likely that complete core formation occurs before the lipid mixing (36Zhang F. Chen Y. Su Z. Shin Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38668-38672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). How is this possible, given that the SNARE core might not have enough strength to bring two mutually repulsive membranes into contact? One possibility is that membranes might no longer be mutually repulsive at the fusion site where several t- and v-SNAREs are presumably clustered. Both t- and v-SNAREs carry basic membrane-proximal regions that have a strong propensity for the membrane surface (24Chen Y. Xu Y. Zhang F. Shin Y.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Kim C.S. Kweon D.H. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10928-10933Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Kweon D.H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9264-9268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The insertion of several membrane-proximal regions into the small patch of the membrane might activate the surfaces to become no longer mutually repulsive. Perhaps complete core formation simply puts, by fluctuation, two activated membranes into a correct geometry necessary for the fusion without the expense of much free energy. The proposal that SNARE core formation plays a set-up role instead of an energy source for membrane fusion might not be general for all SNARE systems. For example, for neuronal SNAREs involved in neurotransmitter release at synapses, the coiled coil core is extremely stable and is even SDS-resistant (38Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), whereas the coiled coil of yeast SNAREs is not (39Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brunger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, there must be some energy release that could directly assist the apposition of the two membranes. Such an energetic assistance might be necessary for neuronal membrane fusion, in which a fast and controlled release of neurotransmitters is essential. The possibility that yeast SNAREs might function differently from neuronal SNAREs is not unusual. In fact, there are several other features that yeast SNAREs do not share with their neuronal homologues. First, yeast SNARE assembly is known to be regulated by the N-terminal Habc domain of Sso1p (40Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas neuronal SNARE assembly is not significantly affected by that of Syntaxin (41Margittai M. Widengren J. Schweinberger E. Schroder G.F. Felekyan S. Haustein E. Konig M. Fasshauer D. Grubmuller H. Jahn R. Seidel C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15516-15521Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Second, yeast t-SNAREs Sso1p and Sec9 form a 1:1 complex in which the C-terminal region is significantly frayed (33Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), whereas neuronal Syntaxin and SNAP-25 assemble into a 2:1 complex, the structure of which is virtually identical to that of the ternary SNARE core (42Zhang F. Chen Y. Kweon D.H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24294-24298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 43Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R.

Biol. 2001; 8: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Third, the trans complex formation of yeast SNAREs in vitro proceeds in a single step (36Zhang F. Chen Y. Su Z. Shin Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38668-38672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), in contrast to the two-step mechanism proposed for neuronal SNAREs. In this work, we arbitrarily assumed that the membrane stabilizes the partially zipped complex. However, we do not know whether this is the case or whether the complete SNARE core is destabilized by the membrane. Also, the mechanism by which the membrane influences the relative energy between two forms of SNARE complex is unclear, warranting further investigation. In summary, we have identified the partially zipped SNARE complex in which the N-terminal regions of individual SNARE motifs engaged one another to form the coiled coil, whereas the C-terminal regions are separate and unstructured. The EPR analysis showed that the partially zipped complex coexisted with the complete SNARE complex with no free energy difference between two forms. Thus, the result suggests that yeast SNAREs play more of a set-up role than serving as the primary energy source for membrane fusion, which is different from what has been proposed for neuronal SNAREs."

The resulting 5′-diphosphate end is then capped by transfer of GMP from GTP to form an inverted terminal dinucleotide structure, G(5′)ppp(5′)N. The first reaction is catalyzed by RNA 5′-triphosphatase and the second by GTP:RNA guanylyltransferase (reviewed in Refs. 1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar and 2Shuman S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In metazoans and plants, the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities reside in a single polypeptide composed of an N-terminal triphosphatase domain fused to a C-terminal guanylyltransferase domain. The metazoan and plant RNA triphosphatases belong to the cysteine phosphatase superfamily (3Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which includes phosphoprotein phosphatases (4Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and phosphoinositide phosphatases (5Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar). Cysteine phosphatase-type RNA triphosphatases act via a two-step mechanism entailing attack by a cysteine thiolate nucleophile of the enzyme on the γ-phosphate of triphosphate-terminated RNA to form a cysteinyl-phosphoenzyme intermediate, which is then hydrolyzed to liberate inorganic phosphate. The active site cysteine is located within a signature P-loop motif, HCTHGXNRT. We reported previously (3Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) the crystal structure of the RNA triphosphatase domain of mouse capping enzyme Mce1 at 1.65 Å resolution. Mce1 adopts a globular fold consisting of a five-stranded parallel β sheet flanked by α helices on both sides. The active site cysteine is located at the bottom of a deep, positively charged pocket formed by essential amino acids that line the pocket walls and surface rim. Structural, biochemical, and mutational results showed that despite sharing a HCXXXXXR(S/T) P-loop motif, a phosphoenzyme intermediate, and a core α/β fold with other cysteine phosphatases, the mechanism of phosphoanhydride cleavage by Mce1 and its baculovirus homologue BVP 1The abbreviations used are: BVP, baculovirus phosphatase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviations used are: BVP, baculovirus phosphatase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol. differs from that used by phosphoprotein phosphatases to hydrolyze phosphomonoesters. The key distinction is the absence of a carboxylate general acid catalyst in the RNA-specific triphosphatases. Residues conserved uniquely among the RNA phosphatase subfamily are important for cap formation in vivo and have been proposed to play a role in substrate recognition. However, the structure of the Mce1 triphosphatase apoenzyme provided no direct information regarding the nature of the atomic contacts involved. Baculovirus phosphatase (BVP) is a 168-amino acid protein encoded by Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (6Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7057-7063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Takagi T. Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). BVP displays primary structure similarity to the N-terminal RNA triphosphatase domain of Mce1. BVP differs from the cellular capping enzyme in several respects. First, it is a monofunctional triphosphatase that is not covalently linked to a guanylyltransferase domain. Second, unlike the cellular capping enzyme, which hydrolyzes only the γ-phosphate of a triphosphate-terminated substrate, BVP can also hydrolyze the β-phosphate of either diphosphate-terminated RNA or free NDPs (6Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7057-7063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Takagi T. Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Monofunctional RNA phosphatases are not confined to baculovirus; the monofunctional human phosphatase PIR1 is a homologue of BVP that also displays RNA triphosphatase and diphosphatase activities (8Deshpande T. Takagi T. Hao L. Buratowski S. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16590-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additionally, PIR1-like proteins are present in many metazoan proteomes, but their functions are not known (8Deshpande T. Takagi T. Hao L. Buratowski S. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16590-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). BVP activity also embraces the hydrolysis of inorganic tripolyphosphate and pyrophosphate (9Martins A. Shuman S. Virology. 2002; 304: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Despite its broad specificity for hydrolysis of phosphoanhydrides in vitro, BVP can act as an RNA triphosphatase in the cap synthetic pathway in vivo in yeast cells (9Martins A. Shuman S. Virology. 2002; 304: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The availability of biochemical and genetic readouts of BVP activity has prompted an extensive mutational analysis of BVP, whereby amino acids essential for triphosphatase activity in vitro and in vivo were identified initially by alanine scanning (10Martins A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35070-35076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), after which structure-activity relationships at the essential residues were determined via conservative substitutions (11Martins A. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13403-13409Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). What is lacking is a structural explanation for the mutational effects based on atomic interactions with substrates, intermediates, or products, as well as a structural framework for the unique specificity of BVP for phosphoanhydrides and the broad specificity of BVP for triphosphate and diphosphate ends versus the more stringent specificity of the bifunctional capping enzymes for triphosphate ends. Here we report the crystal structure of BVP in a phosphate-bound state at 1.5 Å resolution, which provides new insights into these issues. Purification and Crystallization of BVP—BVP was produced as an N-terminal His10-BVP fusion in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and purified by nickel-agarose chromatography as described previously (11Martins A. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13403-13409Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For crystallization, His-tagged BVP was purified further by gel filtration chromatography, dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, and concentrated to 3–4 mg/ml. Attempts to remove the His tag prior to crystallization resulted in protein precipitation, and hence the crystallization trials were done by using the His-tagged protein. Initial crystallization trials of His-tagged BVP at 22 °C in hanging drops equilibrated against 2.0 m sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5) yielded showers of small needle-like crystals. In order to improve crystal quality, the affinity tag was cleaved off during crystallization by including 0.1 m guanidine HCl and trypsin (1:5000 molar ratio of trypsin to BVP) in the original mother liquor prior to setting up the crystallization experiment. In this manner, strongly diffracting crystals of the untagged form of BVP appeared within 1 week and grew as large needles of ∼0.06 × 0.06 × 0.4 mm3. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Prior to data collection, crystals were transferred in a single step to crystallization solution supplemented with 25% glycerol for 1–2 min and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at 100 K using a MAR-CCD detector at beamline 5ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source. Data were integrated using XDS (12Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3217) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (13Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 40.9 Å, b = 74.1 Å, c = 105.2 Å, β = 92.4°, and there are three molecules (molecules A–C) in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (13Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the RNA triphosphatase domain of the mouse mRNA capping enzyme (Mce1) (3Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with the nonconserved loop and C-terminal regions removed, was used as the search model. A clear solution for the positions of all three monomers was found with an R-factor of 47.5% and a correlation coefficient of 0.388. An initial model was built using an electron density map calculated to 2.5 Å resolution with improved phases obtained from prime-and-switch phasing in RESOLVE (14Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Manual model building was carried out in O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and alternated with cycles of simulated annealing and positional and individual temperature factor refinement in CNS (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). Two strong Fo – Fc difference density peaks for phosphate ions were found at the active site of each monomer. In molecule B, additional electron density adjacent to one of the phosphates (site 2) was assigned as a second phosphate with low occupancy. It is not clear whether these two phosphates are part of a diphosphate molecule or not, and they were treated as two separate ions. Once most of the model had been built, the resolution was extended using data to 1.5 Å resolution obtained from a crystal grown in the presence of 5 mm ATP. No ATP was observed in the electron density maps. Subsequent refinement was performed with REFMAC5 (17Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar). Molecules A and B are intact and contain residues 1–168, whereas in molecule C residues 1 and 34–41 are disordered. Additionally, in molecule B there is electron density for an N-terminal histidine residue encoded by the expression vector.

Coordinates and structure factors for BVP have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1YN9. Purification of Native BVP—In order to produce soluble, His tag-free BVP, the BVP gene was amplified by PCR from pET16b-BVP plasmid (6Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7057-7063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a sense primer designed to introduce a BamHI restriction site immediately upstream of the start codon. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of the vector pET28-His-Smt3 to generate the plasmid pET-His-Smt3-BVP, which encodes BVP fused to an N-terminal tag consisting of a His6 leader peptide followed by the 98-amino acid Saccharomyces cerevisiae Smt3 protein and a single serine. (Smt3 is the yeast orthologue of the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO.) The pET-His-Smt3-BVP plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. A 1-liter bacterial culture amplified from a single transformant was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol until A600 reached ∼0.6. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The culture was then incubated at 30 °C for 4 h with continuous shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the recombinant His6-Smt3-BVP protein was purified from the soluble bacterial extract by nickel-agarose chromatography as described previously (11Martins A. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13403-13409Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The 33-kDa His6-Smt3-BVP polypeptide was recovered in the 50 and 200 mm imidazole eluate fractions; the yield was ∼18 mg. The enzyme preparation was dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The His6-Smt3 tag was removed by proteolytic cleavage with the S. cerevisiae Smt3-specific protease Ulp1 (22Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Briefly, a reaction mixture (560 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 350 mm NaCl, 9% glycerol, 1.5 mg of His6-Smt3-BVP, and 1.5 μg of His6Ulp1-NΔ403 was incubated on ice for 30 min. To separate the cleaved His-Smt3 tag from native BVP, the digest was applied to a 0.2-ml column of nickel-NTA resin (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The 19-kDa native BVP protein was recovered in the flow-through and wash fractions, whereas His-Smt3 was retained on the resin and was eluted with 0.2 m imidazole. BVP concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of serial dilutions of the BVP preparations in parallel with serial dilutions of a BSA standard. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the staining intensities of the BVP and BSA polypeptides were quantified using a digital imaging and analysis system from Alpha Innotech Corp. Velocity Sedimentation—Aliquots (100 μg) of the His10-BVP and native BVP preparations were applied to 5.0 ml of 15–30% glycerol gradients containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged in an SW50i rotor at 50,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C. Protein standards catalase (75 μg), BSA (75 μg), and cytochrome c (75 μg) were sedimented in a parallel gradient. Fractions (21 drops each) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. Aliquots (10 μl) of even numbered gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of the fractions were assayed for triphosphatase activity as specified in the figure legend. Structure Determination of Baculovirus Phosphatase—Initial crystallization trials of His-tagged BVP yielded small crystals of the fusion protein that were unsuitable for diffraction studies. In order to improve crystal quality, attempts were made to remove the His10 tag from BVP in solution using various proteases, but all trials resulted in protein precipitation. However, strongly diffracting crystals could be grown by including small amounts of trypsin in the original mother liquor prior to setting up the crystallization experiment. SDS-PAGE analysis of crystals grown in the presence of trypsin suggested that most or all of the affinity tag had been cleaved off during crystallization, which was later confirmed by the crystal structure. Because of solubility problems and because we could obtain excellent crystals using the above described procedure, no attempts to crystallize BVP using a tag-free version of the protein were done. The structure of BVP was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of the RNA triphosphatase domain of mammalian capping enzyme (3Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) as a search model. The final model containing three BVP molecules (A–C) in the asymmetric unit was refined to 1.5 Å resolution with an Rfree = 19.4% and R-factor = 16.5% (Table I). All three monomers are nearly identical in conformation, with root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values ranging between 0.3 Å and 0.4 Å for all C-α atoms. Molecules A and B are complete (residues 1–168 are visualized; Fig. 1A), whereas in molecule C the N-terminal methionine and surface loop residues 34–41 are disordered. Within the asymmetric unit, molecules B and C are each related to molecule A by local 2-fold symmetry. The occurrence of three protomers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal derived from BVP that was trypsinized in situ to remove the tag prompted us to compare the quaternary structures of His10-tagged BVP and native tag-free BVP. Zonal velocity sedimentation analysis of recombinant His10-tagged BVP revealed two distinct populations: a slow migrating species sedimenting between BSA (68 kDa) and cytochrome c (13 kDa) that we presumed was a BVP monomer, and a fast migrating species that sedimented on the light side of catalase (248 kDa) that could represent an octameric or higher order oligomeric complex (Fig. 2A). Both components possessed ATP phosphohydrolase activity (Fig. 2A). To obtain tag-free BVP, we first produced BVP in bacteria as a His6-Smt3 fusion protein, purified the fusion protein by nickel-agarose chromatography, removed the His10-Smt3 tag by digesting the protein with the Smt3-specific protease Ulp1, and then isolated the “native” BVP protein free of His6-Smt3 by passing the digest over a nickel-agarose column and recovering native BVP in the flow-through fraction. Native BVP sedimented as a single catalytically active monomeric component, with no detectable oligomeric forms (Fig. 2B). We surmised the following: (i) native BVP is monomeric; (ii) higher order oligomerization is induced by the His10 tag; and (iii) the arrangement of BVP molecules in the crystal structure does not reflect a biologically relevant oligomerization state. Although the structure presented here was derived from data obtained from a BVP crystal grown in the presence of ATP, no electron density was observed for an ATP molecule. Instead, strong density was observed in the Fo – Fc electron density map for two well ordered phosphate ions in the active site region of each monomer (Fig. 3A), which were likely derived from the 2 m sodium/potassium phosphate crystallization solution. Although the catalytic pockets in molecules A and B were blocked due to crystal packing interactions, the active site in molecule C was solvent-accessible (Fig. 4,B--D). Extensive cocrystallization trials and crystal soaks in the presence of excess ATP and other substrate analogues failed to replace the bound phosphates with alternative ligands.Fig. 4A, surface representation of the active site pocket with bound phosphate ions. A close-up view of the active site region in BVP is shown as a surface rendering colored by electrostatic potential. Blue and red regions correspond to positively and negatively charged areas, respectively. The phosphate at site 1 binds deep in the positively charged catalytic pocket, whereas the site 2 phosphate ion sits in a neighboring hollow. The approximate locations of the catalytic cysteine and other charged residues that are ideally positioned to interact with a triphosphate moiety are indicated.

The conserved phosphate-binding P-loop motif connects the β5 strand and the α6 helix. The compact α/β domain structure adopted by BVP is nearly identical in topology to the RNA triphosphatase domain of Mce1 (Fig. 1B) and resembles the conserved catalytic core found in other cysteine phosphatases. Structural comparisons using the DALI server (23Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) indicated that BVP shares the most similarity to Mce1, the phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN (24Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M.

Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The conformation of the P-loop residues 118HCTHGINRT126 and the overall active site environment are identical in all three BVP monomers. The Cys-119 nucleophile extended from the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket toward one of the bound phosphate ions (site 1) (Fig. 3B). Other conserved P-loop residues and residues from neighboring surface loops lent an overall positive surface potential, providing an attractive docking site for either a diphosphate or triphosphate substrate. Positively charged, shallow grooves extending from the catalytic pocket indicate additional regions possibly involved in substrate binding (Fig. 4A). In other cysteine phosphatases, the depth of the active site pocket was a critical factor in defining substrate specificity (24Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y.

Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). It was postulated that BVP would use a shallower pocket to act on diphosphate-terminated substrates that cannot be accommodated by the deep pocket in Mce1 (3Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the depth of the active site pocket in BVP was ∼8 Å, making it very similar to Mce1 and suggesting that other factors dictate substrate specificity in the RNA-specific cysteine phosphatase family (see below). Two Phosphate-binding Sites—One phosphate ion (site 1) binds deep in the catalytic pocket and is coordinated by conserved P-loop residues and main chain amide groups (Fig. 3B). The phosphate is directly above the catalytic Cys-119 at a sulfur to phosphorous distance of ∼3.8 Å, indicative of a noncovalent interaction. The phosphate in site 1 exemplifies the binding mode expected for the terminal phosphate of an RNA substrate prior to formation of the covalent cysteinyl-phosphoenzyme intermediate or a product complex generated after hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme. The invariant P-loop residue, Arg-125, makes a bidentate contact with two of the phosphate oxygens at site 1, consistent with the role proposed for this residue in substrate binding and transition-state stabilization (11Martins A. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13403-13409Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The key contribution of the bidentate contact is underscored by previous findings that mutation of Arg-125 to alanine abolished BVP triphosphatase activity in vitro and in vivo, and conservative substitution by lysine did not rescue function (11Martins A. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13403-13409Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). P-loop residues His-121 and Asn-124 make additional hydrogen bonds to the site 1 phosphate.

Glutamate 210 in the “DEVD” Walker B motif of the SecA ATP-binding site has been proposed as the catalytic base for ATP hydrolysis (Hunt, J. F., Weinkauf, S., Henry, L., Fak, J. J., McNicholas, P., Oliver, D. B., and Deisenhofer, J. (2002) Science 297, 2018–2026). Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that mutation of glutamate 210 to aspartate results in a 90-fold reduction of the ATP hydrolysis rate compared with wild type SecA, 0.3 s–1versus 27 s–1, respectively. SecA-E210D also releases ADP at a slower rate compared with wild type SecA, suggesting that in addition to serving as the catalytic base, glutamate 210 might aid turnover as well. Our results contradict an earlier report that proposed aspartate 133 as the catalytic base (Sato, K., Mori, H., Yoshida, M., and Mizushima, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 17439–17444). Re-evaluation of the SecA-D133N mutant used in that study confirms its loss of ATPase and membrane translocation activities, but surprisingly, the analogous SecA-D133A mutant retains full activity, revealing that this residue does not play a key role in catalysis.

SecA is an essential component of the protein translocation machinery in prokaryotes whose function is to transport preproteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. According to current model mechanisms for protein translocation, SecA takes up a precursor of secretory protein from the chaperone SecB, or from the cytosol, and inserts it through a membrane translocon formed by SecYEG and SecDFyajC proteins via repeated cycles of membrane insertion and retraction associated with pre-protein binding and release. SecA possesses an ATPase activity that is essential for protein transport (see reviews Refs. 1de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Cell Mol.

The coupling between SecA-catalyzed ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product dissociation events, and the translocon and preprotein binding and release events underlies the mechanics of the protein transport process. SecA has a high-affinity ATP-binding site that comprises Walker A and B motifs responsible for coordinating the α- and β-phosphates of the nucleotide and the Mg2+ ion, respectively (Fig. 1) (4Geourjon C.

There also appears to be a low-affinity nucleotide-binding site on SecA, although it is not known whether this site is catalytically active and how it might contribute to the protein translocation mechanism (5Fak J.J.

SecA has a low endogenous ATPase activity that is stimulated 5–10-fold by the presence of SecYEG translocon/membrane and pre-protein, highlighting the link between the ATPase and protein translocation activities (16Natale P.

One interpretation of this result is that ATP binding to SecA triggers its insertion into the translocon. However, because the interaction of AMP-PNP with SecA is ∼1000-fold weaker than that of ATP, it is not entirely clear whether this nucleotide analog can accurately mimic the effects of ATP binding to SecA (5Fak J.J.

Thus, the question of what role ATP binding to SecA plays in the protein translocation mechanism remains open. Another notable finding is that ADP binding to the high-affinity site stabilizes a compact conformation of SecA (ground state) that has low affinity for the SecYEG/membrane (5Fak J.J. Itkin A.

This result suggests that following ATP hydrolysis, the ADP-bound SecA undergoes retraction from the translocon to complete one reaction cycle. However, the apo (nucleotide free) form of SecA can also exist in a compact conformation with low affinity for the translocon (5Fak J.J. Itkin A. Ciobanu D.D. Lin E.C. Song X.J. Chou Y.T.

Moreover, ADP release from SecA is stimulated by SecYEG/membrane, raising the question whether SecA retraction from the membrane occurs in the ADP-bound form, the apo form, or both (16Natale P. Swaving J. van der Does C. de Keyzer J. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13769-13777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One approach to resolving questions regarding the timing and stoichiometry of ATP binding and hydrolysis events as well as membrane insertion and retraction events, and how they relate to each other during protein translocation, is to directly measure the kinetic parameters that define the progress of the two reactions and the linkage between them (25Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here we report the kinetics of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release catalyzed by SecA, measured by pre-steady-state experiments. The results reveal that the SecA dimer rapidly binds and hydrolyzes two ATP molecules in one catalytic turnover (very likely at the high-affinity site), and that the slow step(s) limiting the steady-state turnover rate occur after phosphate release, either before or at ADP release from SecA. Another objective of this study was to identify the catalytic base in the ATPase site that activates a water molecule for attack on the γ phosphate during ATP hydrolysis. Mutation of this residue might allow SecA to bind ATP with high affinity, but not catalyze hydrolysis. Such a mutant could be of value for characterizing the ATP-bound conformation of SecA, which is proposed to insert into the membrane. In a previous report, aspartate 133 (Asp-133) was proposed as the catalytic base, based on the finding that mutation of Asp-133 to asparagine drastically reduced SecA ATPase and protein translocation activity (26Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17439-17444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in the crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis SecA, a homolog of Escherichia coli SecA, this residue does not appear in the correct position to serve a catalytic function (Fig. 1; Glu-131 in B. subtilis SecA); in fact, the structure indicates that glutamate 210 (Glu-210) is a strong candidate for this function (Glu-208 in B. subtilis SecA) (12Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We tested the ATPase activities of several glutamate 210 mutants under pre-steady-state conditions and found that SecA-E210N and SecA-E210D are capable of binding ATP with similar affinity as wild type SecA, but their ability to catalyze ATP hydrolysis is severely disrupted, consistent with the hypothesis that Glu-210 is the catalytic base. Proteins and Other Reagents—Wild type SecA (pT7SecA2) was overproduced and purified from E. coli strain BL21.19 as described earlier (6Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 27Weinkauf S. Hunt J.F. Scheuring J. Henry L. Fak J. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: an SP-Sepharose column was used instead of Mono-S (protein eluted with 300 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol) followed by a hexyl-agarose column (protein eluted with 400 mm (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Carboxyl terminus 6 histidine-tagged SecA (His-SecA) was prepared by inserting secA into pET29b in the polycloning site between NdeI/XhoI (pET29b-T7His-SecA), followed by overexpression in BL21.19 cells (growth to 0.6 A600 at 37 °C and a 3-h induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside), and purification on a His-Bind resin column (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (protein eluted with 1 m imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl). His-tagged SecA-E210D, SecA-E210N, SecA-E210Q, and SecA-E210A were prepared by introducing mutations into pET29b-T7His-SecA using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The mutant proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography similar to His-SecA. All SecA proteins were stored in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 35 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay, absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidinium-HCl, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5 (SecA monomer molar extinction coefficient = 71,950 m–1 cm–1), and by amino acid analysis; all three methods yielded values within 20% of each other. Pro-OmpA (28Crooke E. Guthrie B. Lecker S. Lill R. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and urea-treated inverted membrane vesicles (29Rhoads D.B. Tai P.C. Davis B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as described. Phosphate-binding protein (PBP) was purified and labeled with 7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)coumarin (MDCC) as described (30Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43778-43784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Radioactive nucleotides, [α-32P]ATP and [35S]ATPγS, were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, [3H]ADP was purchased Amersham Biosciences, [α-32P]ADP was prepared as described previously (32Antony E. Hingorani M.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7682-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and non-radioactive nucleotides were purchased from Sigma. Polyethyleneimine cellulose-F TLC plates were purchased from EM Science and nitrocellulose membranes from Schleicher and Schuell. In Vitro Protein Translocation Assays—For analysis of pro-OmpA translocation, 100-μl reactions were prepared with SecA (50 μg/ml), SecB (66 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (200 μg/ml), ATP (2 mm), NADH (5 mm), and CK1801.4 urea-treated inverted membrane vesicles (100 μg/ml) in TL buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Reactions were initiated with 125I-pro-OmpA (5 × 105 cpm/ml) and pro-OmpA (32 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Samples were transferred to ice and digested with Proteinase K (1 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 15 min. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 75 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, re-suspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated for 5 min at 100 °C, followed by electrophoresis on 12% gels and autoradiography. In Vivo Complementation Assays—Complementation was assessed by streaking Bl21.19 cells (containing a temperature-sensitive amber suppressor, an amber mutation in chromosomal secA and a plasmidborne copy of wild type or mutant secA) on media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, followed by incubation at permissive (30 °C) or non-permissive temperatures (42 °C) for 16–24 h, and comparison of growth. Nucleotide Binding Assays—ATP binding to SecA proteins was measured by nitrocellulose membrane filtration assays. The membranes were treated with 0.5 n NaOH for 2 min, washed with H2O, and equilibrated in nucleotide binding buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgOAc2). 15-μl reactions containing 2.5 μm SecA dimer and 0–250 μm ATP (+0.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP per point) were incubated in binding buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. 10-μl aliquots of the reaction were filtered through the membrane. The membranes were washed before and after filtration with 150 μl of the binding buffer. One-μl aliquots were spotted onto a separate membrane to measure total nucleotide in the reaction. The molar amount of nucleotide bound to SecA dimer was determined by quantitation on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and plotted versus nucleotide concentration. The binding isotherms were fit to an equation describing 1:1 protein-ligand interaction, [N ·M] = 0.5{(Kd + [Nt] + [Mt]) – [(Kd + [Nt] + [Mt])2 – 4[Nt][Mt]]1/2}, where N ·M is the molar amount of ATP bound to SecA dimer, Nt and Mt are total ATP and SecA concentrations, respectively, and Kd is the apparent dissociation constant. The rate of dissociation of ADP from SecA was measured by incubating 2.5 μm SecA dimer with 250 μm ADP (+0.5 μCi of [α-32P]ADP per point) in nucleotide binding buffer, at 25 °C for 10 min, followed by addition of 10 mm Mg2+-ADP chase and filtration through nitrocellulose membranes at times ranging from 20 s to 10 min. The molar amount of ADP bound to SecA was plotted versus time and fit to a single exponential function to determine the rate constant, koff. Steady-state ATPase Assays—For colorimetric ATPase assays, 25-μl reactions were prepared with SecA (0.2 μm dimer) in buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 30 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 mm MgOAc2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), in the absence of other ligands (endogenous ATPase) or in the presence of 50 μg of membrane protein/ml of CK1801 inverted membrane vesicle alone (membrane ATPase) or with 20 μm pre-protein PSN (chimera of alkaline phosphatase signal sequence and mature portion of staphylococcal nuclease; translocation ATPase). The reactions were initiated with 4 mm ATP and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. ATP hydrolysis was measured using the malachite green assay (33Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) with the modifications described previously (6Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The steady-state ATPase rate constant was measured by radiometric assays with 1 μm SecA dimer and 1 mm ATP (+ 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP per point) in ATPase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgOAc2) at 37 °C. At varying times, 5 μl of the reaction was quenched with 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 1-μl aliquots were analyzed by polyethyleneimine cellulose thin-layer chromatography with 0.6 m potassium phosphate, pH 3.4. The molar amount of [α-32P]ADP formed was plotted versus time, and the kcat value was obtained from velocity ÷ [SecA dimer]. Rapid-quench and Pulse-Chase ATPase Assays—Pre-steady-state ATPase assays were performed on a KinTek Corp. quench-flow instrument (Austin, TX) at 37 °C with 6 μm SecA dimer and 1 mm ATP (+ 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP per point) in ATPase buffer. Sixteen μl of SecA was mixed rapidly with 16 μl of ATP and quenched after varying times (0.004–5 s) with 35 μl of 0.7 m formic acid (final concentrations were 3 μm SecA dimer and 0.5 mm ATP). One-μl aliquots of the reactions were spotted immediately on TLC plates and analyzed as above. Molar amounts of ADP formed were plotted versus time and fit to a single-exponential plus linear equation (burst equation), [ADP] = A(1-e–kt) + Vt, where A and k are burst amplitude and rate constant, respectively, V is steady-state velocity, and t is reaction time. Pulse-chase experiments were performed similarly, except 35 μl of 10–20 mm unlabeled Mg2+-ATP chase was added to the reaction after various times (0.004–2 s). After chase time equivalents to 5–6 turnovers (25 s), the reactions were quenched with 70 μlof0.7 m formic acid and analyzed as above. Stopped-flow experiments were performed on a KinTek Corp. SF-2001 Stopped-Flow instrument (Austin, TX) to measure the rates of ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release catalyzed by SecA. Phosphate (Pi) release was assayed in real-time using fluorescent MDCC-labeled E. coli PBP as described previously (31Jeong Y.J. Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43778-43784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Baird C.L. Gordon M.S. Andrenyak D.M. Marecek J.F. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28413-28420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Changes in MDCC-PBP fluorescence upon Pi binding were monitored by excitation at 425 nm and monitoring emission above 450 nm (cut-off filter; Corion LL-450 F). A coupled enzyme reaction (Mop) containing 200 μm 7-methylguanosine and 0.03 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase was used in all reactions to sequester contaminant Pi as ribose 1-phosphate, because MDCC-PBP is sensitive to micromolar concentrations of Pi. A Pi calibration curve relating the PBP-MDCC fluorescence signal to Pi concentration was generated prior to each experiment (31Jeong Y.J. Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43778-43784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All reactions and syringes were “mopped” for at least 45 min before each experiment. Pi release experiments were carried out at 37 °C in ATPase buffer containing the Mop. A 60-μl solution of 2 μm SecA dimer, incubated with 16 μm MDCC-PBP, was mixed rapidly with an equal volume of 1 mm ATP, and the change in fluorescence monitored over time in the observation cell (final concentrations are 1 μm SecA, 500 μm ATP, 8 μm MDCC-PBP). Background fluorescence, measured for each reaction by omitting Mg2+ to prevent ATP hydrolysis, was subtracted from the traces. Raw data obtained by averaging at least 5 traces were divided by the slope from the Pi calibration curve to determine the molar amount of Pi released during the reaction. Data were fit to a burst equation or a linear equation. The kinetics of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release catalyzed by wild type and mutant SecA proteins were measured to better define the mechanism of the ATPase reaction, which is necessary to understand how SecA uses ATP to drive transport of proteins across membranes. The proposed catalytic base, glutamate 210, in the Walker B “DEVD” motif of the high-affinity nucleotide-binding site was replaced by aspartate, asparagine, glutamine, or alanine residues, using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). A 6-histidine tag was introduced into the mutants to help completely purify these proteins from any contaminating ATPase activity. As a control, a 6-histidine-tagged version of wild type SecA was also prepared and its activity compared with that of untagged SecA; the two wild type SecA proteins functioned similarly in all assays. In a commonly used colorimetric assay used to measure ATP hydrolysis, none of the mutants had any detectable level of activity above background levels (Fig. 2A), alone (endogenous ATPase), or in the presence of inverted membrane vesicles that contain the SecYEG translocon and are stripped of endogenous SecA without (membrane ATPase) or with pre-protein (translocation ATPase) at 37 °C. As expected from previous studies, wild type SecA ATPase activity is stimulated about 10-fold in the presence of SecYEG/membrane and pre-protein (Fig. 2A) (22Zito C.R. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40640-40646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A more sensitive and accurate radiometric assay used to measure the steady-state rate constants for wild type SecA (kcat = 0.2–0.3 s–1) and mutant SecA endogenous ATPase activity indicates that SecA-E210D retains some level of activity (kcat = 0.15 s–1), but SecA-E210A mutant activity is near background level (kcat = 0.04 s–1) (Fig. 2B). All the mutants, even SecA-E210D, fail to complement inactivated SecA in vivo (Fig. 2B), consistent with the results of an in vitro protein translocation assay in which the mutants cannot catalyze transport of pro-OmpA polypeptide across a membrane (Fig. 2C, lanes 3-6). These initial results suggest that glutamate 210 plays a key role in the ATPase reaction, and therefore the protein translocation activity of SecA. Before this residue can be implicated as the catalytic base, however, some significant caveats must be addressed. Because the steady-state assays described above do not measure individual ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release steps in the reaction, they do not reveal which of these steps is affected by the mutations, and therefore cannot determine the role of Glu-210 in the catalytic mechanism. In addition, it is possible that the Glu-210 mutations affect SecA function for reasons other than direct disruption of catalytic chemistry (e.g. via some unrelated perturbation of SecA structure). The experiments described below address these concerns. Wild Type SecA as Well as E210D and E210N Mutants Bind Two ATP Molecules Per Dimer—ATP binding to wild type and mutant SecA proteins was examined by nitrocellulose membrane filtration assays. 2.5 μm SecA (dimer concentration) bound 4.8 μm [α-32P]ATP at 4 °C, i.e. a ratio of nearly 2 ATP molecules per SecA dimer (there was no nonspecific ATP binding to the membrane up to 300 μm ATP) (Fig. 3A). The ATP molecules bind SecA with an apparent Kd of 1.4 μm, indicating that the interaction occurs at the high-affinity nucleotide-binding site. No additional ATP binding (i.e. to a low-affinity site on SecA) could be detected at 300 μm ATP, and data at higher ATP concentrations were not considered reliable because of increasing levels of nonspecific ATP binding to the membrane. The SecA-E210D mutant exhibits almost identical nucleotide binding characteristics, with 2 ATP molecules bound per dimer with an apparent Kd of 2.4 μm (Fig. 3B), and SecA-E210N also binds close to 2 ATP per dimer with an apparent Kd of 0.8 μm (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that substitution of glutamate 210 in SecA with aspartate or asparagine does not appreciably affect its nucleotide binding stoichiometry and affinity. In contrast, only a fraction of the SecA-E210A and SecA-E210Q mutant proteins appears capable of binding nucleotide, as their binding isotherms saturate at only ∼1 ATP bound per protein dimer (Fig. 1, Supplemental Materials). Interestingly, a partial proteolysis assay of the proteins reveals that SecA-E210A and SecA-E210Q are also significantly more sensitive to trypsin digestion than wild type SecA and SecA-E210D and SecA-E210N (Fig. 1, Supplemental Materials). These data indicate variations in protein structure/stability between the mutants, and suggest that in the case of the SecA-E210A and SecA-E210Q mutants, the loss of ATPase and protein translocation activity may be attributable to reasons other than disruption of catalytic chemistry. Wild Type SecA Rapidly Binds and Hydrolyzes Two ATP Molecules per Dimer, Unlike the E210D and E210N Mutants—To determine whether mutation of Glu-210 to aspartate or asparagine specifically impacts ATP hydrolysis rather than some other event(s) in the SecA-catalyzed ATPase reaction, it was necessary to directly measure the ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release steps in the reaction. We first performed rapid quench experiments with 2.6–3 μm wild type SecA dimer and 500 μm [α-32P]ATP, and observed a burst of ATP hydrolysis in the first turnover at a rate constant of 27 ± 2.5 s–1, followed by a slow linear phase at a rate constant of 0.3 s–1 (similar to the steady-state kcat of 0.25 s–1) (Fig. 4A). The amplitude of the burst phase is 5.2 ± 0.1 μm, close to 2 ATP molecules per SecA dimer. Next, a pulse-chase experiment was performed to measure the kinetics of ATP binding to SecA. The protein (2.6–3 μm dimer) was mixed with [α-32P]ATP (500 μm) for varying times (mixing time), and chased with 20-fold excess unlabeled Mg2+-ATP for time equivalent to 5–6 turnovers (chase time). During the chase, bound [α-32P]ATP may be hydrolyzed to [α-32P]ADP + Pi or remain unhydrolyzed (either bound to SecA or released into solution). Any free [α-32P]ATP in solution is diluted upon addition of unlabeled ATP chase and is not available for further binding and hydrolysis. Thus, the pulse-chase experiment measures the rate of ATP binding to SecA and the fraction of the SecA·ATP complex that undergoes hydrolysis. The data reveal a burst of A"

It has been shown that release of the T7 promoter is inhibited when the T7 RNA polymerase-promoter interaction is strengthened. Here we asked whether release would be facilitated when the T7 promoter-polymerase interaction is weakened by the introduction of promoter mutations known to reduce promoter activity. Using chemical and enzymatic probes to monitor the position of the polymerase as a function of RNA length, we found that promoter mutations upstream of –4 facilitated release of the polymerase from the promoter, but more downstream mutations did not have such effects. We also found that released complexes turn over more slowly than promoter-bound complexes, indicating that retention of promoter interactions contributes to the dissociation of short RNAs during initial transcription.

T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; wt, wild-type; IC, initiation complex; EC, elongation complex; nt, nucleotide; T, template; NT, non-template; FeBABE, iron(S)-1-(p-bromoacetamidobenzyl) ethylenediaminetetraacetate; ITS, initially transcribed sequence; exo III, exonuclease III. initiates transcription by a process in which it specifically binds to a consensus class III T7 promoter that contains a 23-base pair sequence extending from –17 to +6, melts duplex DNA in the vicinity of the initiation site to form a transcription bubble, and begins RNA synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Sousa R. Mukherjee S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This initiation process is remarkably similar to that of the multidomain RNAPs from prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and archaeal species (2Cramer P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When the RNA is <9 nt in length, the T7 initiation complex (IC) is relatively unstable, and short nascent transcripts are continuously synthesized and released. The transition from unstable IC to stable elongation complex (EC) starts when the RNA reaches a length of 8–9 nt and results in promoter release, collapse of the melted promoter region, and displacement of the 5′-end of the nascent RNA (3Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a T7RNAP IC with a 3-nt transcript reveals that the promoter interaction involves three distinct structural motifs of the T7 RNAP (4Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Two of these participate directly in binding the –17 to –5 region of the promoter, which remains duplex throughout the initiation reaction. Residues 93–101 of T7 RNAP recognize the AT-rich –17 to –13 region of the promoter, whereas the promoter recognition hairpin loop (residues 739–770) binds in the major groove of the –11 to –7 region of the promoter. The third motif comprises an intercalating hairpin (residues 231–241) that melts the promoter and stabilizes the upstream edge of the initiation bubble between –5 and –4. The melted template (T) strand downstream of –5 is bound to the palm and finger subdomains by numerous contacts, whereas the single-stranded segment of the non-template (NT) strand downstream of –4 is disordered. The downstream DNA is bent and fit into the enclosed active site pocket and forms three base pairs of RNA-DNA heteroduplex. In the EC, a major conformational change in the N-terminal domain (residues 1–310) allows RNA-DNA hybrid extension to eight base-pairs and disrupts the specific promoter contacts observed in the IC (6Tahirov T.H.

Previous biochemical studies (9Brieba L.G. Sousa R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have shown that the transition from IC to EC usually entails polymerase release from the promoter, although it has been shown that the polymerase can retain promoter contacts and still synthesize long transcripts. The latter can occur if the polymerase is covalently tethered to the promoter (12Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44270-44276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), or if the promoter-polymerase interaction is strengthened by eliminating the free energy penalty of promoter melting by deletion of the NT strand around the initiation site (13Guo Q. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3474-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The observation that strengthening of the promoter-polymerase interaction inhibits promoter release led us to ask whether weakening of this interaction by mutating the promoter would facilitate release. For example, would it allow the polymerase to release the promoter when the RNA is only 6 or 7 nt in length, rather than the 8 or 9 nt at which release begins on a consensus promoter? Would mutations in the different regions of the promoter (the –17 to –5 binding element, the –4 to –1 melting element, and the +1 to +6 initially transcribed sequence (ITS)) affect release in similar ways? Finally, if complexes release the promoter while the RNA is still relatively short, would they be stable or would they turn over rapidly? Would retention of promoter contacts favor dissociation of the RNA from the IC, or would such dissociation be due solely to the short length of the RNA in these complexes? To address these questions, we made mutants in different regions of the promoter and examined release using enzymatic footprinting and a chemical nuclease tethered to residue 207 of the polymerase, which lies close to the upstream region of the promoter (–9 to –15) in the IC. Our results indicated that mutations upstream of –5 do facilitate release of the polymerase from the promoter. In contrast, it was found that promoter mutations downstream of –5 do not facilitate release. We also found that released complexes turn over less rapidly than complexes that retain promoter interactions. Thus, retention of promoter contacts contributes significantly to the rapid rate of RNA dissociation from the IC. RNA Polymerase and Templates—Wild-type and mutant T7 RNAP were purified as described previously (7Mukherjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Cell. 2002; 110: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol. The E207C (–7) mutant was constructed by cysteine substitution of Glu-207 in a T7 RNAP in which 7 of the 12 endogenous cysteines had been mutated to serines using PCR-mediated mutagenesis as described previously (7Mukherjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Cell. 2002; 110: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Mukherjee S. Sousa R. Biol. Proced. Online. 2003; 5: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All DNA oligomers were from Qiagen Corp. and were purified by PAGE. The sequences of all oligomers are presented in Table I. Where indicated, synthetic oligomers were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol, ICN) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Maxam-Gilbert G + A ladders of labeled wt T and NT strands were prepared and used as a reference to identify the cleavage positions on DNA templates (14Mukherjee S. Sousa R. Biol. Proced. Online. 2003; 5: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA templates were formed by mixing equimolar amounts of each complementary oligomer in annealing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl) at 0.5 μm followed by heating to 95 °C for 1 min and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature.Table ISequences of promoter DNAs used Open table in a new tab Transcription Assays—Transcription reactions were carried out for 15 min at room temperature in 10-μl reactions containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Spermidine, 0.01% Triton X-100. NTPs were added to 0.5 mm, and transcripts were labeled by inclusion of 1% (v/v) 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]GTP in the reaction mixture. To form halted complexes, required NTPs with 3′-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (3′dNTP, Trilink Biotechnologies) were added to 0.5 mm in the reaction mixture. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop buffer (90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.01% xylene cyanol) and then treated at 90 °C for 2 min and chilled in an ice bath. The transcription products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 25% polyacrylamide (22.5% acrylamide, 2.5% bisacrylamide) gels cast in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer containing 7 m urea. The gels were analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging device. DNase I Footprinting and exo III Digestion Assays—Halted complexes were formed as described above. DNase I footprinting and exonuclease III (exo III) digestion on halted complexes were carried out as described previously (13Guo Q. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3474-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Products were resolved by denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels (14.2% acrylamide, 0.8% bisacrylamide) with 7 m urea followed by phosphorimaging. The digestion patterns were assessed with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). DNA Cleavage by FeBABE-conjugated RNAP—Conjugation of E207C (–7) with FeBABE (Dojindo Laboratories) was carried out as described previously (17Mukherjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6483-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All reactions were carried out on halted complexes with duplex DNA in which either the T or NT strand was labeled at the 5′-end. DNA sequences are given in Table I. Halted complexes were formed at room temperature in transcription buffer with 1 × 10–8m template DNA and 1 × 10–7m FeBABE-conjugated enzyme as above. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, cleavage was brought about by the addition of sodium ascorbate and H2O2 as described previously (14Mukherjee S. Sousa R. Biol. Proced. Online. 2003; 5: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide and visualized by phosphorimaging. A Weak Binding Promoter Releases Polymerase Early—To determine whether weakening of the promoter-polymerase interaction would facilitate release, we compared release on a wt promoter to one in which the –15 A:T base pair had been mutated to G:C. This mutation occurs in a region important for polymerase binding (4Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and has been previously shown to reduce promoter utilization by 10-fold (15Imburgio D. Rong M. Ma K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We therefore expected that this mutant would bind polymerase less strongly than a wt promoter, but would still be a template for transcription. Fig. 1A shows an experiment in which release was measured by DNase I protection. Lanes 1–7 show experiments in which a wt template was used and in which digestion was carried out with either no polymerase present (lane 1) or with polymerases and NTPs allowing RNA extension from 2 to 8 nt (lanes 2–7). Fig. 1A, lanes 8 –14, repeats this experiment with the A15G promoter. With the wt promoter, protection extended from the upstream region of the promoter to +9 for RNAs 2–4 nt in length (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–5) and to +11 for RNAs 6 or 7 nt in length (lanes 5 and 6). Upon extension of the RNA to 8 nt, protection of the upstream region of the promoters is lost, and the footprint extends from –3 to +11 (Fig. 1A, lane 7). For the A15G promoter, protection in the 2-nt RNA reaction was negligible (Fig. 1A, lane 9), suggesting that this weak promoter does not stably bind the polymerase when the RNA is only 2 nt in length. For reactions in which RNAs are 3 or 4 nt long, protection is observed from –3to +9 (Fig. 1A, lanes 10 and 11), but unlike what is seen with the wt template, protection of the upstream region of the promoter is not observed (lane 10) or is weak (lane 11). For reactions with 6–8-nt RNAs, protection extends from –3 to +14 (Fig. 1A, lanes 12–14). In Fig. 1B, this experiment was repeated using exonuclease III to assess release. The results were broadly similar to what was seen with DNase I protection. For the wt promoter, a block to exo III digestion at –20 is seen with RNAs 2–7 nt in length (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–7), although the block is weak for the 2-nt RNA reaction (lane 3) and is diminished in the 7-nt RNA reaction (lane 7), where we also detected the appearance of a weak block at –5 to –7. Upon RNA extension to 8 nt, the –20 block disappears completely and a strong block is seen at –5 (Fig. 1B, lane 8). On the A15G template, a block at –20 is not detected, except in the 4-nt RNA reaction (Fig. 1B, lane 12) and (very weakly) in the 2-, 3-, and 6-nt reactions (lanes 10, 11, 13). However, blocks are seen at –7 in the 3-nt reaction (Fig. 1B, lane 11) and at –5 to –7 (7-nt reaction, lane 14) and –5 in the 8-nt RNA reaction (lane 15). The DNase I and exo III results suggest that, on the wt template, most of the polymerase molecules remain bound to the promoter as the RNA is extended from 2 to 7 nt, providing DNase I protection of the upstream promoter region and creating a block to exo III at –20. Upon extension of the RNA to 8 nt, most of the polymerase molecules are released, and protection of the upstream promoter region from DNase I and the exo III block at –20 disappear simultaneously (a fraction of the polymerases may release when the RNA is 7 nt in length). In contrast, on the A15G template, (partial) protection of the upstream promoter region and a –20 block to exo III is seen only when the RNA is 4 nt in length, although protection of downstream promoter regions is seen with RNAs 3–8 nt in length, and downstream blocks to exo III are seen with RNAs 3, 7, or 8 nt in length. Both DNase I and exo III are potentially perturbing reagents. In particular, exo III overdigestion could “push” the polymerase off the promoter. We have observed such pushing upon extended exo III digestion of both ICs and ECs (9Brieba L.G. Sousa R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 346-358Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We therefore also tested the use of a polymerase with a chemical nuclease (FeBABE) tethered to an amino acid near the upstream region of the promoter. We have previously found that cleavage by this reagent is complete in 5 s or less (the limit of manual mixing; Ref. 17Mukherjee S. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6483-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), so it should report on the instantaneous occupancy of the promoter by the polymerase. Further, because strong cleavage requires proximity of the nuclease to the DNA, this method should be directly sensitive to movement of the polymerase away from the promoter. Fig. 2A shows the structures of the T7RNAP IC and EC, with the template (T) and non-template (NT) strands in blue and cyan, respectively, and the residue selected for mutation to Cys and conjugation with FeBABE highlighted in magenta (Glu-207). In the IC, this residue is close to the –9 to –12 region of the NT strand and the –12 to –15 region of the T strand, both of which are highlighted in yellow in Fig. 2A. In the EC, conformational changes in the polymerase and movements of the DNA place residue 207 far from the nucleic acids. Fig. 2B, lanes 2–15 and 16–29, shows cleavage reactions carried out with a polymerase in which FeBABE was conjugated to residue 207 and for RNAs extending from 2 to 8 nt in length (as indicated above each gel lane). Reactions were carried out with labeled T strand (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–15) and NT strand (lanes 16–30) on both wt (lanes 1–8 and 16–22) and A15G (lanes 9–15 and 23–30) promoters. On both promoters, cleavage is observed between –12 and –15 and –9to –12 on the T and NT strands, respectively, in agreement with the proximity and accessibility of these regions to residue 207 in the IC crystal structure. On the wt template, cleavage is relatively weak in the reaction with the 2-nt RNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 17), is strong for reactions with 4–6-nt RNAs (lanes 4–6 and 18–20), and then begins to diminish as the RNA is extended to 7 or 8 nt (lanes 7, 8, 21, 22). The intensity of cleavage (in arbitrary units) is presented in Fig. 2C. For the A15G template, cleavage intensity is ∼75% of that seen with the wt template in the reactions with 3- and 4-nt RNAs (Fig. 2B, lanes 11, 12, 25, 26) but is reduced, respectively, to 60 and 40% of wt for the 2- and 6-nt reactions (lanes 10, 13, 24, 27), and in the 7- and 8-nt reactions, cleavage on A15G is 30 and 10%, respectively, of that seen with the wt promoter (lanes 14, 15, 28, 29). Overall the FeBABE cleavage, DNase I, and exo III results agree that the polymerase is released earlier from the A15G promoter than from the wt template, although the different methods exhibit quantitative differences in their measures of the fraction of polymerases released at different RNA lengths. Promoter Release Stabilizes the Transcription Complex— Once a transcription complex extends the RNA to 9 nt and releases the promoter, it becomes much more stable than ICs that retain promoter interactions and readily release short RNAs (18Gopal V. Brieba L.G. Guajardo R. McAllister W.T. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Mentesanas P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The instability of ICs could be due to the short length of the RNAs in these complexes or to the fact that they retain promoter interactions. Because the A15G promoter releases the polymerase while the RNA is still relatively short, we wondered whether these released complexes would be as unstable as promoter-bound initiation complexes with RNAs of identical length. To measure this, we carried out transcription reactions in which transcript extension was halted 4, 7, or 8 nt by 3′dNMP incorporation (Fig. 3). When the synthesis of such transcripts follows burst kinetics the steady-state rate of their accumulation reflects the rate at which the halted transcription complexes dissociate and re-initiate synthesis (20Brieba L.G. Gopal V. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10306-10313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For reactions in which transcription was halted at 4 nt, transcripts were found to accumulate at rates of 1 min–1 and 0.8 min–1 on the wt and A15G promoters, respectively, indicating that the 4-mer ICs turned over rapidly on both templates (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22). When transcription was halted at 7 nt, synthesis was characterized by burst kinetics, and the steady-state rates of transcript accumulation corresponded to 0.3 min–1 on the wt promoter and 0.06 min–1 on the A15G promoter (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23). Transcripts halted at 8 nt accumulated at rates of 0.17 min–1 and .033 min–1 on the wt and A15G promoters, respectively (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24). The 7- and 8-mer complexes that form on the A15G promoter therefore turn over 5-fold more slowly than the same complexes on the wt promoter. We concluded that release from the promoter stabilizes the transcription complex, even if the RNA is still relatively short. Mutations in the Polymerase Binding Region of the Promoter Facilitate Release—The T7 promoter can be divided into three parts. The region upstream of –5 remains base-paired throughout the initiation reaction and is important for binding the polymerase via an extensive set of sequence-specific contacts (4Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The –4 to –1 TATA element facilitates promoter opening (21Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5413-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas the +1 to +6 ITS is important for efficient progression through initial transcription (mutations in the ITS lead to increased release of short RNAs) (22Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). To determine how mutations in these different regions would affect release, we prepared a set of promoters with mutations from –17 to +2. The mutants were selected from information contained in Ref. 15Imburgio D. Rong M. Ma K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and included promoters that were 2–3-fold less active than wt (T17G, C12G, A10C, C5G, A3G, G+2C), as well as mutations that were 20-fold (A15C, A10G, C5T) or 30-fold (G11C) less active than wt. Fig. 4 shows NT strand cleavage on these promoters by a polymerase with FeBABE tethered to residue 207. The reactions contained NTPs allowing RNA extension to either 4 or 7 nt. For mutations upstream of –4, there is a direct correlation between the magnitude of the effect of the mutation on promoter utilization and our ability to detect a cleavage signal. Mutations that reduce promoter activity by only 2-fold exhibit cleavage in the IC4 complex similar to a wt promoter (Fig. 4, lanes 3, 9, 21; cleavage of A10C, which is 3-fold less active, was somewhat reduced, as seen in lane 15), whereas cleavage of mutants with 20-fold (lanes 6, 18, 24) or >30-fold (lane 12) reductions was weak or undetectable, indicating low occupancy of these weak promoters by the polymerase. Although the more active promoters could achieve occupancy levels similar to a wt promoter in the 4-nt reactions, the mutations did have an effect on promoter release; cleavage in the 7-nt reactions averaged 50–60% lower than in the 4-nt reactions (Fig. 4, lane 4 versus 3, lane 10 versus 9, lane 16 versus 15, and lane 22 versus 21). For the weaker promoters, cleavage signals were too weak for reliable quantification, but inspection of gels indicated more release in the 7-nt reaction than is seen with a wt promoter (Fig. 4, compare lanes 18 and 19). In the unwinding element, the T4A and A3G mutations reduce promoter activity by 13- and 5-fold, respectively. However, they do not have as drastic an effect on promoter release as the more upstream mutants. For T4A and A3G, cleavage in the 7-nt reactions is reduced by only 20–30% relative to the 4-nt reaction (Fig. 4, lane 28 versus 27 and lane 31 versus 30), a value comparable with what we see for NT strand cleavage with a wt promoter. Fig. 5 shows that mutations in the ITS that reduce promoter activity by 13-fold (G+1C) or 2-fold (G+2C) also affect release differently than the more upstream mutations. For G+1C, cleavage in the 7-nt reaction is identical or even slightly greater than in the 4-nt reaction (Fig. 5, lane 3 versus 2 and lane 9 versus 8), whereas cleavage of G+2C in the 7-nt reaction is 3-fold greater than in the 4-nt reaction (lane 6 versus 5 and lane 12 versus 11). Release was also examined using DNase I, and Fig. 6 shows results for mutants that exhibited high promoter occupancy in the FeBABE assay (T17G, C12G, A10C, C5G) for one of the weakly active mutants (A15C) and for the unwinding element mutant (A3G), which also exhibited high promoter occupancy in the FeBABE experiment. In the 4-nt reactions, all of the mutant promoters, except A15C, are at least partially protected by the polymerase. Protection of A10C in the 4-nt reaction is weak, with partial protection detected from –3 to +10 (Fig. 6, lane 14), whereas upstream of –3, the A10C promoter shows no obvious protection but displays an altered cleavage pattern (lane 14 versus 13). In the 7- and 8-nt reactions, protection extends downstream to +14 on all the promoters; however, the upstream promoter region is protected only in A3G (Fig 6, lanes 23 and 24), indicating that this promoter does not release the polymerase as readily as do the other mutant promoters, in agreement with the FeBABE cleavage results (Fig. 5). Note that in the 7- and 8-nt reactions, cleavage between –8 and –10 is strongly enhanced relative to that seen in reactions without polymerase. The enhancement is also seen in Fig. 1A. It has been previously noted that T7RNAP elongation complexes exhibit increased DNase I sensitivity 15–20 nt upstream of the RNA 3′-end (23Shi Y.B. Gamper H. Hearst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this may reflect bending of DNA upstream of the EC. 2Q. Guo and R. Sousa, unpublished results.. Although occupancy of the A15C promoter was too low to provide detectable protection in the 4-nt reaction, protection of –3 to +14 is detected in the 7- and 8-nt reactions with this promoter, as is enhanced cleavage between –8 and –10 (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8). Significantly, both protection of –3 to +10 and enhancement of cleavage between –8 and –10 are weaker with A15C than with the more active promoters, indicating that, although complexes with 7- or 8-nt RNAs can be formed on this promoter, they do not accumulate to the same level as with a wt template. The enhancement of –8 to –10 cleavage in the 7- and 8-nt reactions complicates the interpretation of the DNase I patterns, because in those cases where some polymerases have released and some have not, we observe the combined effects of partial protection and partial enhancement. We interpret the cleavage pattern in the 8-nt A3G reaction (Fig 6, lane 24), which exhibits both enhanced and protected points of cleavage relative to the no polymerase reaction (lane 21), to reflect release by a small fraction of the polymerases, because the enhancement of cleavage at –10 is much less than is seen with the other promoters. Similarly, the cleavage pattern of the upstream promoter region in the 4-nt reaction with A10C (Fig. 6, lane 14) may reflect a mixture of released and retained complexes. The central conclusion of this study is that weakening of the T7 promoter-polymerase interaction by introduction of base changes into the –5 to –17 binding region of the promoter allows the polymerase to release the promoter when the RNA is shorter than the length normally required to trigger release. Mutations in the –4 to –1 TATA sequence, which is melted during initiation (9Brieba L.G. Sousa R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Place C. Oddos J. Buc H. McAllister W.T. Buckle M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), do not have such an effect, even when they decrease promoter activity as much as (or more than) mutations in the more upstream region. Mutations in the ITS also do not appear to facilitate release of the polymerase. In fact, for at least one of the latter mutations, extension of the RNA from 4 to 7 nt actually enhances occupancy of the promoter. There may be at least two explanations for the latter observation. The first is that the introduced mutation destabilizes the association of the RNA with the IC (its mutations have been previously shown to increase the release of short RNAs during initial transcription (22Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar)). Because it has been shown that the presence of the RNA in the IC stabilizes the association of the polymerase (10Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with the promoter and that the complex becomes more stable as the RNA is progressively extended (3Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is possible that extension of the RNA from 4 to 7 nt has a proportionately greater stabilizing effect on the IC when the complex is more unstable to begin with. It is also likely that the effect of the mutation becomes progressively less destabilizing as the RNA is extended away from the site of the mutation. For example, with the G+2C promoter and the 4-nt reaction, the mutation is only 2 nt away from the RNA 3′-end, whereas in the 7 nt reaction, it is 5 nt away. The destabilizing effect of the mutation may therefore decrease with its distance from the active site of the enzyme. Our results also reveal that retention of promoter contacts contributes significantly to the release of RNAs during initial transcription, because we observe that complexes on the A15G promoter with 7- or 8-nt RNAs turn over much less frequently than similar complexes on a wt promoter. That such complexes can be quite stable is perhaps not surprising, because the RNA:DNA hybrid in an elongation complex is 7 base pairs in length (3Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S.

U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14109-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); therefore, a 7-nt RNA would satisfy this basic requirement. The conclusion that a released complex with a 7-nt RNA is relatively stable is also supported by the observation that such a complex can present a strong block to exo III digestion (Fig. 1B). However, complexes with shorter RNAs are not able to present such strong blocks to exo III. For example, in the 6-nt reaction with A15G, shown in Fig. 1B, lane 13, we observe neither a strong (–20) block, corresponding to a promoter bound complex, nor a downstream block, corresponding a released complex. Apparently in this case, the promoter-polymerase association is too weak to resist exo III digestion, but the 6-nt RNA also does not provide for a sufficiently stable elongation complex to block exo III once the polymerase is released. A similar interpretation can be made for the 4-nt reaction in Fig. 1B, lane 11, although in this case, the polymerase-promoter complex provides at least partial resistance to exo III. Interestingly, the 3-nt reaction in Fig. 1B, lane 10, shows a block to exo III around –7, showing that the released complex can block exo III. However, in these reactions oligo-G RNAs can be extended up 14 nt by a process of transcript slippage (25Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2690-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), so it is possible that these longer RNAs stabilize the released complexes, even though they are only partially complementary to the template. These exo III results are in qualitative agreement with the DNase I protection patterns and with the FeBABE results, but there are quantitative differences in the detection of promoter release with these methods. For example, with exo III, we detect extensive release on the wt promoter when the RNA is 8 nt long (Fig. 1B, lane 8) at a point that coincides with apparent loss of protection of the upstream promoter region in a DNase I assay (Fig. 1A, lane 7), whereas we detect only partial release at 8 nt with the FeBABE assay (Fig. 2). A recent study (26Gong P. Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44277-44285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using fluorescent probes to characterize initiation on T7 promoters detected little release at 8 nt, 50% release at 9 nt, and complete release at 12–13 nt. exo III digestion is potentially perturbing and is likely to overestimate the fraction of release relative to the other methods (26Gong P. Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44277-44285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but provides additional information on the relative stability of the released complexes. Of the methods used here, the FeBABE cleavage assay is likely to be the least perturbing and is probably the best measure of the point at which release occurs. We have previously shown (13Guo Q. Sousa R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3474-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that promoter release is inhibited when the T7 promoter-polymerase interaction is strengthened by deletion of the NT strand around the transcription start site. This study establishes the corollary to this: a weakened promoter interaction facilitates release. Tintutt et al. (27Tintut Y. Wang J.T. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24392-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed previously that, on an Escherichia coli σ54 promoter, release of the polymerase from the promoter occurs when the RNA reaches 6–7 nt, whereas on a σ70 promoter, release occurs when the RNA reaches 12–13 nt. They concluded that these differences were probably due to weaker polymerase binding to the σ54 promoter. It may therefore be generally the case that a weak interaction facilitates the escape of an RNA polymerase from its promoter."

Injection of PKG Iα-specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (Iα-MO) into two-cell stage medaka fish embryos caused severe abnormalities in the developing embryos, such as the development of a hammer-like head, fusion of the developing eyes, and degeneration of cells around the eyes, whereas injection of PKG Iβ-specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (Iβ-MO) caused fewer abnormalities in the embryos, even when injected at higher concentrations than Iα-MO. The PKG I-overexpressing embryos exhibited smaller eyes and enlargement of the forebrain, a phenotype similar to that observed in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-depressed embryos. In the PKG-deficient embryos, a sonic hedgehog (shh)-target gene, HNF-3β, was expressed weakly, and this phenotype was similar to that observed in the PKA-overexpressing embryos suggesting that the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway is involved in some steps of shh signaling. We also demonstrated that Gli proteins, shh-downstream molecules, are phosphorylated by the NO/cGMP signaling pathway, probably by PKG in NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells. These results imply that PKG and PKA share common substrates and work in an opposite manner during the early embryogenesis of medaka fish.

As the intracellular second messengers, the cyclic nucleotides alter various cellular functions predominantly by activation of specific protein kinases. It is known that natriuretic peptides and/or nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; GC, guanylyl cyclase; cGMP, guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; shh, sonic hedgehog; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; UTR, untranslated region; MO, morpholino antisense oligonucleotides; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. are involved in many biological events, such as the regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone, reabsorption of salt and fluid into the kidney, platelet aggregation, and synaptic transmission (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414PubMed Google Scholar). Natriuretic peptides and/or NO activate guanylyl cyclases (GCs) that catalyze the conversion of GTP to cGMP, followed by activation of downstream effectors like cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), phosphodiesterase, and cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414PubMed Google Scholar). PKG, a member of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase family in which cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is also included, is a major target protein of cGMP. It has been reported that in mammals there are two distinct isoforms of PKG (PKG I and II) (2Wernet W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). PKG I is a soluble protein expressed mainly in blood platelets, smooth muscle, and the cerebellum (3Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and PKG II is a membrane-anchoring enzyme expressed primarily in the intestines, brain, kidney, and bone (4Markert T. Vaandrager A.B. Gambaryan S. Pohler D. Hausler C. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Jarchau T. Lofmann S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To date, cDNAs (PKG Iα and PKG Iβ) for two isoforms of PKG I have been isolated (5Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their primary structures differ only in the N-terminal region, which is considered the essential region for dimerization. Loss of the PKG I gene abolishes NO/cGMP-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle and causes severe vascular and intestinal dysfunction in mice (6Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiß C. Wang G-X. Korth M. Aszódi A. Andersson K-E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fässler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PKG II-deficient mice exhibit heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) resistance and display dwarfism because of a severe defect in endochondrial ossification at the growth plate (7Pfeifer A. Aszódi A. Seidler U. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Fässler R. Science. 1996; 274: 2082-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the mutagenesis of the gene for DG2, a Drosophila homologue of mammalian PKG, demonstrated that PKG is involved in the regulation of complex feeding behavior (8Sokolowski M.B. Behav. Genet. 1980; 10: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, to date there have been only a few papers dealing with the function of PKG in the early development of vertebrate embryos. It has been reported that the PKG I gene is expressed in the spinal cord of early developing mammalian embryos (9Qian Y. Chao D.S. Santillano D.R. Cornwell T.L. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Lincoln T.M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3130-3138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the NO/cGMP signaling pathway, probably via PKG I, is involved in many developmental events, especially in development of the central nervous system (10Yamamoto T. Yao Y. Harumi T. Suzuki N. Zool. Sci. 2003; 20: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to PKG, there are many papers dealing with the roles of PKA in developing embryos, especially in neural patterning and organogenesis (11Joore J. van de Water S. Betist M. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A. Zivkovic D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 12Amieux P.S. Howe D.G. Knickerbocker H. Lee D.C. Su T. Laszlo G.S. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27294-27304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Song B.H. Choi S.C. Han J.K. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It has been reported that in Drosophila PKA participates in patterning of the imaginal disc as a component of the sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling pathway, and the mutation in the catalytic subunit of PKA causes severe defects in the formation of the imaginal disc and in vertebrates, suggesting that PKA participates in the shh-signaling pathway (14Lane M.E. Kalderon D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1229-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 15Jiang J. Struhl G. Cell. 1995; 80: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Loss of the PKA activity causes the cells to be autonomous, Hh-independent, and active in transcription of the Hh target genes (15Jiang J. Struhl G. Cell. 1995; 80: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKA acts as a common negative regulator of the Hh signaling pathway. In zebrafish, it has been demonstrated that injection of mRNA encoding the dominant negative form of PKA leads to the expansion of proximal fates in the eyes, ventral fates in the brain, and irregular somite patterns, whereas injection of the constitutively active form of PKA causes ventral-specific defects in the anterior central nervous system because of the suppression of the Hh signaling pathway (16Hammerschmidt M. Bitgood M.J. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 15: 647-658Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that transcriptional factors, Gli proteins, having a zinc finger motif in the DNA-binding domain, work as downstream molecules in the shh signaling pathway. In vertebrates such as humans, mice, Xenopus, and zebrafish, three gli genes (gli1–gli3) have been identified. Sasaki et al. (17Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that HNF-3β, which is well known as a floor plate-specific Gli-target gene, contains Gli-binding sites, and its translation product determines the dorsal-ventral patterning of the neural tube (17Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that Gli3 and Ci (Cubitus interuptus), the translation products of the Drosophila homologues of the Gli genes, are bipotential transcriptional regulators, and their processing and transcription are regulated through the phosphorylation by PKA (18Koebernick K. Pieler T. Diffferentiation. 2002; 70: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the function of PKG I in medaka fish embryogenesis and examined its temporal and spatial expression patterns and the effects of knockdown and overexpression of PKG Iα and PKG Iβ on the embryogenesis. Here, we report that the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway is involved in phosphorylation of Gli proteins and plays an important role in embryogenesis in a manner opposite to the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, presumably because of different output events from the substrate phosphorylated by PKA and/or PKG. Animals—Mature adults of the orange-red variety of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes were maintained as described previously (19Yamagami S. Suzuki K. Suzuki N. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The medaka fish developmental stage was expressed in the manner described by Iwamatsu (20Iwamatsu T. Zool. Sci. 1994; 11: 825-839Google Scholar). Cell Culture—NG108-15 cells, a hybrid cell line of mouse neuroblastoma (N18TG-2) and rat glioma (C6BU-1), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high-glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mm hypoxanthine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm aminopterin (Sigma), 1.6 mm thymidine (Invitrogen), and 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) in a humidified incubator equilibrated with 10% CO2, 90% air at 37 °C. Culture medium was changed every 2–3 days to fresh medium and the cells were subcultured before reaching ∼70% confluence. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE) of Medaka Fish PKG Iα and PKG Iβ—To obtain the full-length cDNA sequences of PKG Iα and PKG Iβ, the 5′ portion of a cDNA fragment obtained by the procedure described previously (10Yamamoto T. Yao Y. Harumi T. Suzuki N. Zool. Sci. 2003; 20: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was amplified by oligo-capping 5′-RACE with a First Choice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The primers used for the 5′-RACE method were as follows: PKG I 5R-1, 5′-ACAGGGTACATGCAGTCCACGG-3′; PKG I 5′-outer, 5′-GAGTTTCTCTGAACGAATGTGCTCC-3′ for PKG Iα and PKG Iβ, respectively. Nested PCR was performed with a 5′-RACE inner primer and gene-specific primers as follows: PKG I 5r-2, 5′-CATGAAGTCATTATCCAAGATGGC-3′; G1up, 5′-TGAACCAGCTCGACACGTCC-3′ for PKG Iα and PKG Iβ, respectively. PCR conditions were as follows: 30 cycles at 96 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and an additional incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified cDNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—First strand cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from the 4 μg of total RNA obtained from the medaka fish embryos at various developmental stages. The PKG I isoform-specific primers used for reverse transcriptase-PCR were as follows: 5r-1, 5′-ACTGTTGGAGCATCATCGCG-3′; PKG I forward, 5′-CGCGGATCCGAACACTGCGTTTGCTGG-3′ for the detection of PKG Iα and PKG Iβ, respectively. The reverse primer was designed based on the sequences conserved among two PKG I variants: PKG I_5R(ex2)-2nd, 5′-CATGAAGTCATTATCCAAGATGGC-3′. The amplification conditions were 30 s at 96 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 30 cycles. Plasmid Construction—An expression vector of mouse PKA dominant active mutant (PKA*; Ref. 21Orellana S.A. Mcknight G.S. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4726-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was constructed as follows: a 1.2-kilobase pair cDNA containing the coding region and the 110-bp 3′-UTR for the mouse PKA catalytic subunit was amplified from the first strand cDNA of mouse kidney with the primers (mAC Cat-forward, 5′-ACCTTAGCACCCGCCGCGTCGC-3′; mAC Cat-reverse, 5′-CATGGAACTCTAGGGCCCTCTG-3′), and then subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene). A carrying mutation was amplified by PCR with the following primers: H87Q-forward, 5′-AGCAGATCGAGCAAACTCTGAATGA-3′; H87Q-reverse, 5′-TCATTCAGAGTTTGCTCGATCTGCT-3′; T196R-forward, 5′-AAGGCCGTACTAGGACCTTGTGTGG-3′; T196R-reverse, 5′-CCACACAAGGTCCTAGTACGGCCTT-3′. Both the mutated cDNA fragments were ligated with the EcoRI site and subsequently ligated into the BamHI/XhoI site of pCR3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). A mouse PKIα cDNA fragment was amplified with the following primers: mPKIα-Kozak, 5′-GCCACCATGGCTGATGTGGAAACTAGGT-3′; mPKIα-Rev, 5′-ATGACCGTCAGAATGGAGTG-3′. The resultant cDNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) and sequenced, and then it was ligated into the BamHI/XhoI site of the pCR3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). Medaka fish PKG I-Δ93V was constructed as follows: a cDNA fragment including the coding region and 3′-UTR was amplified by the primers synthesized based on the sequences as reported previously (10Yamamoto T. Yao Y. Harumi T. Suzuki N. Zool. Sci. 2003; 20: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These were Δ93V KpnI_Kozak, 5′-GGGGTACCGCCACCATGGTCACCCTGCCTTTCTACCCCAA-3′ and PKG I_3′UTR_EcoRI, 5′-CGGAATTCACATTGTAAATGCTTTATCC-3′. Mouse PKG I-Δ349A containing the coding region was amplified with the following primers: Δ349A/Kozak_KpnI, 5′-GGGGTACCGCCACCATGGCATATGAGGACGCAGAAGCA-3′ and mPKG-Rev/XbaI, 5′-GCTCTGAGTTAGAAGTCTATGTCCCACGG-3′. The amplified cDNA fragment was subcloned into the KpnI/XbaI site of pBluescript II KS(+) with SV40 poly(A) signal sequences, or the same site of pCR3.1 expression vector. Microinjection of Synthesized mRNA or a Morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotide into Medaka Fish Embryo—The plasmids pBS_SV-PKG I Δ349A and pBS_SV-PKG I Δ93V were linearized with BamHI, pCR3.1-PKA* and pCR3.1-mPKIα with XhoI. Capped mRNA was synthesized in vitro using mMESSAGE mMACHINE (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the synthetic RNA was examined by ethidium-agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration was determined spectrometrically. The following morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) targeting the medaka fish PKG Iα and PKG Iβ mRNAs were purchased from GeneTools, LLC (Corvalis, OR): Iα-MO, 5′-CAAAGTCCTCCTCCAGGTCGCTCAT-3′ and Iβ-MO, 5′-ACTGGAGGTCGCGCAAAGTGCCCAT-3′ (the sequence complementary to the predicted start codon is underlined). MOs were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at concentrations from 1.7 to 4.0 μg/μl and injected into 1- or 2-cell stage medaka fish embryos as described previously (22Mikami T. Kusakabe T. Suzuki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18567-18573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Whole-mount in Situ Hybridization—The plasmid vector pBluescript II KS(+) containing the cDNA fragments of PKG Iα, PKGIβ, or HNF-3β was used as a template for labeling the RNA probe. Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (23Yamamoto T. Suzuki N. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 337-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization with HNF-3β was carried out for 16 h at 65 °C, and that with PKG Iα and PKG Iβ was performed for 48 h at 65 °C. After the coloring reaction, the dehydrated embryos were mounted in 87% glycerol or 2% methylcellulose in 0.85× PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20). Construction of FLAG-tagged Gli Expression Plasmids—The N-terminal FLAG-tagged Gli fusion vectors were constructed for the phosphorylation experiments with PKG I. The Gli-coding region was amplified by PCR with total RNA of the mouse newborn brain using the following primers. For Gli1 amplification: gli1Fwd, 5′-AGGTCCCCTCATCCTTCCCTGAGAGC-3′; and gli1Rev, 5′-GAGACACATCCCAATCAGGTCAGGTGAGATGA-3′. For Gli2 amplification: gli2Fwd, 5′-GCCTCTGAGATGGAGACTTCTGCCC-3′; and gli2Rev, 5′-CTAGACCCTCATATTCCCCAAGGGGC-3′. For Gli3 amplification: gli3Fwd, 5′-GACAAGACATTATGGAGGCCCAGGC-3′; and gli3Rev, 5′-AGACACATCCCAATCAGGTGAGATGAC-3′. Amplification conditions were as follows: 30 cycles of 30 s at 96 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The amplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) and sequenced. Then, they were ligated into the HindIII/XbaI site for Gli1, the EcoRI/BamHI site for Gli2, and the NotI/SalI site for Gli3 of p3xFLAG CMV vector (Sigma). All plasmid DNAs were purified with the QIAprep Spin Mini prep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection into NG108-15 Cells and SDS-PAGE—Plasmid DNA was transfected into the cultured cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were plated in a 6-well plate (1.5 × 105 cells per well) on the day before the transfection. Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (10 μl) and the plasmid DNA (4 μg) were mixed, incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then transfected into the cells. The cells were incubated with DNA-lipid complex for 5 h in the CO2 incubator and subsequently replaced with a new medium. The reagent used for treatment of the cells contained S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (100 nm; Sigma), Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (200 μm; Sigma), KT5823 (1 μm; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and 8-Br-cGMP (250 μm; Sigma). After 48 h, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The lysate was homogenized by sonication and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 1 h. The resultant supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 5% gel to separate unphosphorylated Gli from phosphorylated Gli, and then transferred electrophoretically to an Immobilon™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with Block Ace (Dai-nippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), the membrane was incubated in a solution containing 1:2000 diluted anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with PBST several times, and the immunoreacted protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using CDP-star ready-to-use (Roche). Luciferase Assay—For the reporter assay, a reporter construct with intact (GliBS-Luc) or mutated (GlimBS-Luc) sequences containing the repeated Gli-binding sites (the kind gift of Dr. Hiroshi Sasaki, RIKEN CDB, Kobe, Japan) was transfected into NG108-15 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/6-well plate) by the Lipofection method. A lipid/DNA mixture containing 1.5 μg of the effector vector, 1.5 μg of the reporter vector, 0.5 μg of the internal control vector (phRL-TK, Promega), and 1 μgof PKA* or PKG I-Δ349A was transfected into the cells. Five hours later, the medium was exchanged for fresh medium, and the cell culture was continued either with or without addition of 100 μmS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine or 250 μm 8-Br-cGMP. After 36 h, the cells were washed with PBS and then harvested with 250 μl of 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), followed by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 5 min to pellet the residual cellular debris. A dual luciferase assay was performed as described previously (23Yamamoto T. Suzuki N. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 337-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio of activities between firefly luciferase (GL) because of the reporter vector and Renilla luciferase as an internal control. All transfections were carried out in duplicate experiments. Other Methods—The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar) with an Applied Biosystem 3100 Genetic analyzer. Data were analyzed with DNASIS software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Yokohama, Japan) and GENETYX-MAC/version 7.2.0 software (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan). The homology search was performed at the NCBI BLAST Website (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). RNA- or MO-injected embryos and in situ hybridization samples were observed under a light microscope (BX50W1: Olympus, Japan; MZ8: Leica, Switzerland). Cloning of Full-length cDNA of Medaka Fish PKG I—In a previous study, we isolated a partial cDNA fragment of medaka fish PKG I (10Yamamoto T. Yao Y. Harumi T. Suzuki N. Zool. Sci. 2003; 20: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, to obtain the full-length nucleotide sequence of PKG I cDNA for further examination of the expression pattern and the functional analysis during embryogenesis, we performed the 5′-RACE of medaka fish PKG I using the oligo-capping method. Similarly to the case of mammalian PKG I, we obtained two spliced variants (PKG Iα and PKG Iβ) for medaka fish PKG I (EMBL accession numbers AB164050 and AB164051 for PKG Iα and PKG Iβ, respectively). Exon 1α of medaka fish PKG I consisted of a 360-bp 5′-UTR and a 257-bp coding sequence for 85 amino acids, whereas exon 1β consisted of a 239-bp 5′-UTR and a 305-bp coding sequence for 101 amino acids (Fig. 1). Temporal and Spatial Expression of Two PKG I-spliced Variants, PKG Iα and PKG Iβ, during Embryogenesis—To examine the differences in the temporal and spatial expression patterns between two PKG I isoforms, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis using isoform-specific primers and total RNA obtained from embryos at various developmental stages (Fig. 1). Whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments using embryos at various developmental stages and each isoform-specific ribo-probe demonstrated that the expressions of both the PKG Iα and PKG Iβ transcripts were first detected at the late gastrula stage (stage 15/16, Fig. 2), although the maternal mRNA of PKG Iβ was detected weakly at stage 1 (Fig. 2). PKG Iα was expressed in the neural tube and at the lateral side at stage 22 (Fig. 3A), and the expression became detectable at the gill arch and the margin of the otic vesicles at stage 30 (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with our previous results obtained with the probe common to mRNAs for PKG Iα and PKG Iβ (10Yamamoto T. Yao Y. Harumi T. Suzuki N. Zool. Sci. 2003; 20: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The signals because of PKG Iβ were detected only in the otic vesicles (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3Whole mount in situ hybridization of PKG Iα and PKG Iβ during medaka fish embryogenesis. Expressions of the PKG Iα (A and B) and PKG Iβ (C and D) transcripts are shown. Dorsal views of the embryos at stage 20 are shown in A and C and the embryos at stage 30 are shown in B and D. In the early developmental stages the signals corresponding to these genes were weak throughout the embryos. PKG Iα could be detected at the gill arch and the margin of the otic vesicles of the embryos at stage 30, whereas the signals because of PKG Iβ could be detected only in the otic vesicles of the embryos.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Effects of Injection of a PKG-targeted Morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotide on Medaka Fish Embryogenesis—To understand the roles of a major cGMP-target protein, PKG, during embryogenesis, we injected either one of two isoform-specific morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (PKG Iα-MO and PKG Iβ-MO) into two-cell stage embryos and examined its effects on the development of the embryos under a light microscope. As shown in Fig. 4, in the PKG Iα-MO (1.8 μg/μl)-injected embryos the degenerated cells were detected at the lateral side of the embryonic body, especially near the head region, at stage 17/18 (35 of 53 embryos; 66%). At stage 22, most of the embryos injected with PKG Iα-MO (1.5 μg/μl) exhibited hammer-like heads, presumably because of defects of the separation of the forebrain and eye field (44 of 80 embryos; 55%), and some of the embryos showed many malformations, such as fusion of the eyes, irregular somite border, and enlarged otic vesicles (Fig. 4). Moreover, most of the embryos injected with PKG Iα-MO displayed a hook-shaped tail (Fig. 4). In contrast, the embryos injected with PKG Iβ-MO displayed severe defects only when the higher concentrations (over 4 μg/μl) of morpholino antisense oligonucleotide were administered. Co-injection of PKG Iα-MO and PKG Iα mRNA or PKG Iβ-MO and PKG Iβ mRNA into an embryo caused no severe defects in the embryos at later stages (data not shown). The Influences of Overexpression of PKG I Constitutive Active Mutants on Embryogenesis—Gudi et al. (25Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we made Δ93V and Δ349A mutants, which are constitutively active forms of PKG I (Fig. 5A) and injected them into the medaka fish embryos, with the result that the embryos injected with these mutants displayed several abnormal phenotypes (Fig. 5B). The Δ93V-injected embryos (250 ng/μl) displayed the phenotype with the enlarged forebrain and midbrain at stage 22 (52 of 91 embryos: 58%; Fig. 5B). At 7 days after the introduction of the Δ93V construct to embryos, the embryos exhibited the defective otic vesicles and displayed smaller eyes and enlarged tectum (Fig. 5B). The Δ349A-injected embryos (250 ng/μl) displayed defects similar to those observed in the Δ93V-injected embryos, although the degree of defects was more severe in the former. As shown in Fig. 5B, some of the embryos overexpressing the Δ93V or Δ349A mutants showed the double tail phenotype (for Δ93V, 8%, 4 of 51 embryos; for Δ349A, 24%, 21 of 87 embryos) (Fig. 5B). Both of the trunks had distinct somites and notochords (Fig. 5B, f), suggesting that the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway is involved in the formation of the axis during early embryogenesis. The Reduced Expression of the shh-target Genes in the PKG I Knockdown Embryos—As shown in Fig. 5B, g–i, the injection of mRNA for a PKA inhibitor, PKIα, caused the formation of abnormal eyes in the medaka fish embryos. The results obtained with zebrafish and medaka fish suggest that PKA is involved in the patterning of eyes in a manner opposite that of PKG I. It has been reported that PKA modulates the shh-signaling pathway through phosphorylation of an shh-target transcriptional factor, Gli, in vertebrates, and phosphorylation of Ci, a Gli-type zinc finger protein, in Drosophila (18Koebernick K. Pieler T. Diffferentiation. 2002; 70: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not PKG I is involved in the shh-signaling pathway, we examined the expression pattern of an shh-target gene, HNF-3β, in the medaka fish embryos in which the expression of PKA or PKG I was suppressed or ectopical. In the embryos injected with PKIα, the expression of HNF-3β was expanded in almost the entire dorsal region, whereas in the embryos injected with PKG Iα-MO and constitutively active mutant of PKA (PKA*), the expression of HNF-3β was weak and the embryos exhibited severe defects (Fig. 6). However, injection of PKG I did not cause any change in the expression of HNF-3β (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation of Gli by PKG—It is known that the consensus phosphorylation sites (-R/K-X(1–2)-S/T-X-) for PKA are similar to those (-R/K(2–3)-X-S/T-X-) for PKG (26Kennel"

Here we analyze how human Gaa1 and PIG-T, two of the five subunits of the ER-localized glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase complex, are retained in the ER. Neither protein contains a known ER localization signal. Gaa1 is a polytopic membrane glycoprotein with a cytoplasmic N terminus and a large luminal loop between its first two transmembrane spans; PIG-T is a type I membrane glycoprotein. To simplify our analyses, we studied Gaa1 and PIG-T constructs that could not interact with other subunits of the transamidase. We now show that Gaa1282, a truncated protein consisting of the first TM domain and luminal loop of Gaa1, is correctly oriented, N-glycosylated, and ER-localized. Removal of a potential ER localization signal in the form of a triple arginine cluster near the N terminus of Gaa1 or Gaa1282 had no effect on ER localization. Fusion proteins consisting of different elements of Gaa1282 appended to α2,6-sialyltransferase or transferrin receptor could exit the ER, indicating that Gaa1282, and by implication Gaa1, does not contain any dominant ER-sorting determinants. The data suggest that Gaa1 is passively retained in the ER by a signalless mechanism. In contrast, similar analyses of PIG-T revealed that it is ER-localized because of information in its transmembrane span; fusion of the PIG-T transmembrane span to Tac antigen, a plasma membrane-localized protein, caused the fusion protein to remain in the ER.

Possible scenarios to explain ER retention of proteins include trapping of ER residents within a matrix or oligomeric structure, signal-mediated retention, lack of an export signal, and signal-mediated retrieval from post-ER compartments. These scenarios must be viewed in the context of bulk anterograde membrane flow from the ER that has been hypothesized to nonselectively carry membrane and fluid content to post-ER compartments (6Wieland F.T.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 9-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The two best characterized ER localization signals, the KDEL and dilysine motifs, are based on retrieval mechanisms that involve direct or indirect binding of the motif to the COPI coats of vesicles mediating retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER. The KDEL motif is found on soluble proteins that reside within the ER lumen (8Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar, 9Lewis M.J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); the cytoplasmically exposed dilysine motif serves a similar function for ER-resident membrane proteins (12Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 13Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). However, only a small fraction of any given type of molecule bearing a KDEL or dilysine motif appears to exit the ER and needs to be retrieved; the majority appear not to leave the ER at all. The question remains. How do ER resident proteins remain resident in the ER? It is possible that many ER resident proteins are components of hetero- or homo-oligomeric complexes that in turn interact with other complexes to yield an aggregate that is too large to export efficiently. Consistent with this are observations of the slow lateral diffusion of oligosaccharyltransferase complexes that associate with the protein translocon (14Nikonov A.V. Snapp E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Alternatively, some ER residents, like ER chaperones, may be continuously engaged with protein traffic entering the ER such that their own exit is impeded. These interactions or the numerous quasi-interactions that are probably promoted by the high protein density in the ER may be sufficient to retain proteins if the rate of bulk flow of membrane and fluid departing the ER is low and if the proteins lack explicit export signals. We classify these possibilities under the heading of “signalless” retention mechanisms. In contrast, it is possible to consider retention resulting from an explicit signal within the retained protein. For the particular case of ER membrane proteins, it is conceivable that sequence motifs in one or more of the topological domains of the protein (cytoplasmic, transmembrane (TM), or luminal) interact specifically with effectors to block exit of the protein from the ER. However, many ER membrane proteins appear to enjoy relatively unencumbered lateral diffusion in the membrane, suggesting that their presumed exclusion from ER-derived transport vesicles is not due to immobility in the membrane resulting from, for example, cytoskeletal association or large complex formation (15Pentcheva T. Spiliotis E.T. Edidin M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1538-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C.D. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The few experimentally characterized ER retention motifs, such as cytoplasmic N-terminal and internal diarginine sequences, cytoplasmic C-terminal tyrosine-based sequences, or transmembrane domain sequences, are not universal and/or share no sequence similarity between other proteins (1Teasdale R.D.

Many ER-translocated proteins are covalently modified with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (24Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). GPI anchor attachment is catalyzed by GPI transamidase (GPIT), a membrane-bound protein complex composed of at least five subunits: Gpi8, Gaa1, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U (25Hamburger D. Egerton M.

GPIT removes a C-terminal GPI-directing signal peptide from the translocated protein and attaches a preassembled GPI anchor via an amide linkage to the newly exposed C-terminal amino acid residue of the protein (31Udenfriend S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13959-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but all subunits are essential for function. Recent data suggest that Gaa1 and possibly PIG-U may play a role in recruiting GPI to GPIT (28Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Vainauskas S. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6540-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that a β-propeller structure in the luminal domain of PIG-T gates access to the active site of Gpi8 (36Eisenhaber B. Maurer-Stroh S. Novatchkova M. Schneider G. Eisenhaber F. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The role of PIG-S is unknown. Gpi8 and PIG-T are type I transmembrane proteins; the other three subunits have multiple transmembrane spans. Recent studies show that human Gaa1 has a cytoplasmically oriented N terminus and spans the ER membrane seven times (37Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H. Kinoshita T. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30535-30542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); the membrane topology of PIG-S and PIG-U remains to be experimentally determined. We are interested in understanding how the GPIT complex is assembled into a functional unit that is localized to the ER membrane. The individual subunits are presumably independently synthesized and integrated into the ER membrane and must remain in the ER long enough to encounter the other subunits in order to form the GPIT complex. The complex itself, after assembly, must remain in the ER in order to execute its catalytic function. Thus, individual subunits as well as the GPIT complex as a whole must be able to avoid entering the secretory pathway and exiting the ER. To identify the mechanism(s) by which the subunits of GPIT are localized to the ER, we chose initially to analyze Gaa1 and PIG-T. We used fluorescence microscopy and glycosidase digestion to analyze the subcellular localization of epitope-tagged variants of these two proteins as well as that of fusion proteins prepared using elements of Gaa1 or PIG-T combined with sequences from the Golgi protein α2,6-sialyltransferase or the plasma membrane-localized proteins transferrin receptor and Tac antigen. This “cut-and-paste” approach revealed that Gaa1 does not contain any dominant ER localization information, whereas PIG-T is localized to the ER by virtue of a signal contained within its TM domain. These data are discussed in the context of other recent examples of signal-mediated and signalless retention of ER-resident membrane proteins. Antibodies—Anti-Gpi8 and anti-Gaa1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated as described previously (37Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H. Kinoshita T. Menon A.K. J. Biol.

Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 was purchased from Sigma; mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-V5 antibody was a gift from Dr. Karen Colley (University of Illinois at Chicago). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were from Promega (Madison, WI). Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors—C-terminally V5-tagged Gaa1 (pEF/D1V5) and Gaa19-ST7–402 (previously called N19-ST) constructs were generated as described previously (37Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H. Kinoshita T. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30535-30542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To obtain the Gaa1(R→A) construct, sense RA (5′-cgggatccgccatgggcctcctgtcggacccggttgctgcggccgcgctcgcccgcctag-3′) and antisense GAV5 (5′-ctggctctagatgatggtggtggtggtg-3′) primers and pEF/D1V5 as template DNA were used for the PCR amplification. The amplified DNA product was digested with BamHI/XbaI and ligated into BamHI/XbaI pEF6/V-5 His vector (Invitrogen). C-terminally V5-tagged Gaa1282 and Gaa1282(R→ A) constructs were generated using the sense strand T7 primer and the antisense primer LPV5 (5′-ctggctctagatccaatgatgtccagtcc-3′) from the plasmids pEF/D1V5 and pEF/Gaa1(R→ A), respectively. PCR-amplified products were digested with BamHI/XbaI and ligated into BamHI/XbaI pEF6/V-5 His vector. To replace the N-terminal cytoplasmic part and TM domain of rat α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST; the construct we used encoded ST with tyrosine, rather than cysteine, at amino acid 123) with the amino-terminal cytoplasmic part and TM of Gaa1, two PCR fragments were generated: (i) from pEF/D1V5 vector using T7 and GN3 (5′-tgggaattcgaggcgcagcactagg-3′) primers and (ii) from pcDNA3.1/STTYR vector (a gift from Dr. Karen Colley, University of Illinois at Chicago) using primers STLUM (5′-gggcagaattcgagcgactatgaggccct-3′) and BGH (5′-caactagaaggcacagtcgagg-3′). The obtained PCR products were digested with BamHI/EcoRI and EcoRI/XbaI, respectively, and ligated into BamHI/XbaI pEF6/V-5 His vector. The resulting Gaa155-ST30–402 construct includes N-terminal sequence of the Gaa1 (aa 1–55), followed by Glu and Phe and then residues 30–402 of human ST, fused with V5 epitope and His6 sequence. The same strategy was used to generate other chimeric proteins. The Gaa1282-ST30–402 construct contains N-terminal sequence of the Gaa1 (aa 1–282) fused to ectodomain of the ST (aa 30–402). To obtain human transferrin receptor fused at its C terminus with V5 and His6 epitope tags, sense T7 promoter and antisense TFR3 (5′-gccctctagaaactcattgtcaatgtccca-3′) primers were used for PCR amplification from plasmid pSVT7, (bearing human transferrin receptor cDNA) as template DNA (a gift from Dr. Paul Gleeson, University of Melbourne, Australia). The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI/XbaI and ligated into EcoRI/XbaI pEF6/V-5 His vector. To replace the N-terminal part of human transferrin receptor (TfR) with the N-terminal cytoplasmic part of Gaa1, two PCR fragments were generated: (i) from pEF/D1V5 vector using T7 and GN3 (5′-tgggaattcgaggcgcagcactagg-3′) primers and (ii) from pSVT7/TfR vector using primers TFR62 (5′-tgggaattctgtagtggaagtatctgctatgg-3′) and TFR3. Amplified DNA products were digested with BamHI/EcoRI and EcoRI/XbaI, respectively, and ligated into BamHI/XbaI pEF6/V-5 His vector. The resulting Gaa119-TfR63–760 construct includes the N-terminal 19 residues of hGaa1, followed by Glu and Phe followed by residues 63–760 of the human transferrin receptor, fused with V5 epitope and His6 sequence. The same strategy was used to generate other chimeric proteins. The Gaa155-TfR87–760 construct contains N-terminal sequence of the Gaa1 (aa 1–55) fused to the ectodomain of TfR (aa 87–760). Human PIG-T cDNA was obtained from HeLa First Strand cDNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by PCR amplification with a sense primer PT5 (5′-ggaattcgccatggcggcggctatgccgctt-3′) and an antisense primer PT3 (5′-acagagtggggggacacctcg-3′). The PCR-amplified product was ligated into the mammalian expression vector pEF6/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). The resulting pEF/PIG-T-V5 construct encodes PIG-T with C-terminal V5 and His6 epitope tags. To generate truncated PIG-T constructs T545-V5 and T514-FLAG, the primers T545 (5′-ggccctctagatcgatattgtagaaggagccatagca-3′) and T514 (5′-gtaatcgatgacctccgtgtagagccgcaca-3′) were used, respectively. To generate Tace-T516–578 construct, the ectodomain of Tac was obtained by PCR from pEF6/Tac plasmid (38Pottekat A. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15743-15751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using primers T7 and TACLUM3 (5′-gtaatcgattgtaaatatggacgtctccatg-3′), and the C-terminal part of PIG-T was amplified with primers T514F (5′-gtcatcgattacaacctgccgacaccggact-3′) and BGH. The obtained PCR products were digested with BamHI/ClaI and ClaI/XbaI, respectively, and ligated into BamHI/XbaI pEF6/V-5 His vector. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with cDNA constructs by electroporation as described previously (37Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H. Kinoshita T. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30535-30542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots—Transfected HeLa cells (1–2 × 107 cells) were harvested by scraping 48 h post-transfection, washed once with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of MSB buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin or Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)), and solubilized on ice for 30 min. The resulting cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The 10,000 × g supernatant was incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2, or anti-V5 agarose (Sigma) slurry was added and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h with gentle agitation. The beads were pelleted by 15-s centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The samples were washed four times for 5 min each in 1.5 ml of buffer MSB. Bound antigen was released from the beads by incubation with FLAG or V5 peptide (200 μg/ml) in buffer MSB. Immunoprecipitated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Pulse-Chase Labeling—Transfected HeLa cells were analyzed 48 h post-transfection. The cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min with EXPRE35S35S Protein Labeling Mix (1 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in methionine/cysteine-free complete medium and then chased for 2–8 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above. Immunoprecipitated fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and radiolabeled proteins were visualized and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—Transfected HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% (w/v) Triton X-100, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as described previously (37Vainauskas S.

The labeled cells were visualized using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope (type MRC 1000). Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and Peptide:N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) Treatment—Endo H and PNGase F from New England Biolabs was used for carbohydrate digestion. The treatment was done as described previously (35Vainauskas S. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6540-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A Triple Arginine Motif in the Cytoplasmically Oriented N-terminal Sequence of Gaa1 Does Not Control ER Localization of the Protein—We previously suggested that the cytoplasmic N terminus of Gaa1 might function as an ER sorting determinant (37Vainauskas S.

Inspection of the primary sequence of human Gaa1 identified an internal triple arginine cluster (Arg9-Arg10-Arg11) near the N terminus (Fig. 1A). This arginine cluster resembles the Arg-Xaa-Arg ER localization motifs recently identified in subunits of multimeric protein complexes displayed at the cell surface (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B.

Correct assembly of these protein complexes and their transport to the cell surface appears to be regulated through control of the trafficking of individual subunits, such that incompletely assembled complexes are retained in the ER. The secretory transport machinery is able to differentiate between unassembled units and assembled complexes because the Arg-Xaa-Arg motif in individual subunits can be masked after assembly of the protein into the complex or because the ability of the motif to signal ER retention/retrieval can be suppressed in some cases by phosphorylation of adjacent residues. We hypothesized that the Arg9-Arg10-Arg11 motif in Gaa1 acts as an ER localization signal. We tested this hypothesis by preparing a Gaa1 variant (denoted Gaa1(R→ A)) in which the three arginines were replaced with alanine residues. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild type, V5-epitope-tagged Gaa1 (Fig. 1A), or similarly tagged Gaa1(R→ A). The subcellular distribution of the transiently expressed proteins was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-V5 antibodies. Fig. 1B shows that both wild type Gaa1 and Gaa1(R→ A) display a reticular staining pattern consistent with ER localization. Gaa1 and Gaa1(R→ A) were extracted from cells in detergent-containing buffer, treated with glycosidases, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fig. 1C shows that both proteins are modified with a single, endoglycosidase H-susceptible N-glycan, suggesting that the wild-type Gaa1 and Gaa1(R→ A) are not exposed to Golgi N-glycan modification enzymes. We considered the possibility that, without its arginine cluster, Gaa1(R→ A) could potentially be exported from the ER but is unable to leave the compartment as a result of improper folding. Misfolding would mitigate the ability of the protein to pass ER quality control systems for secretion and potentially accelerate its rate of turnover. Thus, compared with wild-type Gaa1, Gaa1(R→ A) may be turned over more rapidly by ER-associated degradation pathways. To test whether this was the case, we used [35S]methionine/cysteine to pulse-label HeLa cells that were transiently expressing wild-type Gaa1 or Gaa1(R→ A) and then chased the cells for various periods of time (up to 8 h), extracted proteins in detergent-containing buffer, and used immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and PhosphorImager analysis to determine the amount of radiolabeled Gaa1 or Gaa1(R→ A) remaining in the cells. The SDS-PAGE/PhosphorImager data for one experiment are shown in Fig. 1D, whereas the quantitation of the rate of decay taken from three independent experiments is shown in Fig. 1E. The data show that Gaa1(R→ A) turns over with a half-time of ∼3.2 h, similar to the rate of turnover of wild-type Gaa1 (a single, monoexponential decay curve is plotted for both proteins in Fig. 1E). This result suggests that it is unlikely that folding/degradation problems underlie the ER retention of Gaa1(R→ A). Together with the immunofluorescence localization of Gaa1(R→ A) to the ER and the Endo H-susceptibility of its N-glycan, these data suggest that the triple arginine motif (Arg9-Arg10-Arg11) is not necessary for ER localization of Gaa1. Gaa1282, a Construct Consisting of the N-terminal Cytoplasmic Tail, First TM Domain, and Part of the N-Glycosylated Luminal Loop of Gaa1, Is ER-localized—Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Gaa1(R→ A), like Gaa1, interacts with Gpi8, PIG-T, and PIG-S (data not shown). It is therefore conceivable that Gaa1(R→ A) is retained in the ER through its interactions with other subunits of the GPI transamidase and that these interactions render potential localization information in the triple arginine motif redundant. Alternatively, it is possible that full-length Gaa1 contains more than one ER localization signal, rendering individual signals redundant. To clarify this issue, we investigated the subcellular localization of Gaa1282, a truncated molecule consisting of the first 282 amino acids of Gaa1 capped with a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (Fig. 2A). Our choice of truncation site was based on previous results that indicated that a similar construct containing a larger stretch of the luminal loop (up to amino acid 367, right before the start of the second TM domain) was proteolytically cleaved in situ to yield a membrane-anchored fragment analogous to Gaa1282; this fragment was ER-localized but not able to bind to Gpi8, PIG-T, and PIG-S (37Vainauskas S. Maeda Y. Kurniawan H. Kinoshita T. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30535-30542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to Gaa1282,we generated a construct, Gaa1282(R→ A), in which the triple arginine cluster (Arg9-Arg10-Arg11) was altered to Ala9-Ala10-Ala11. Neither Gaa1282 nor Gaa1282(R→ A) is expected to interact with other transamidase subunits. We confirmed this via co-immunoprecipitation experiments that showed that the Gaa1282 constructs, unlike full-length Gaa1, could not co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Gpi8 or PIG-T (Fig. 2B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments done on lysates prepared from cells that co-expressed the Gaa1282 constructs with green fluorescent protein-tagged PIG-T similarly demonstrated that the truncated proteins could not co-immunoprecipitate PIG-T-green fluorescent protein (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed that both Gaa1282 and Gaa1282(R→ A) were ER-localized (Fig. 2C), and glycosidase digestion showed that both possessed an Endo H-susceptible N-glycan (Fig. 2D). These results reflect the data obtained with full-length Gaa1 constructs (Fig. 1) and confirm that the arginine cluster in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Gaa1 is not required for correct topological insertion of the protein or for its ER localization. Gaa1282 Does Not Contain a Dominant ER Retention Signal—Our results thus far eliminate a role for the triple arginine cluster (Arg9-Arg10-Arg11) in ER localization of Gaa1 and Gaa1282 b"

This “dynamic interface” model makes biochemical predictions concerning the consequences of truncating specific amino acid side chains and the effects of these truncations on sequence selectivity in DNA binding. The model also makes predictions concerning the effects of DNA sequence context on the apparent energetic contributions to binding made by individual bp. We have tested these predictions, and our results are inconsistent with any significant energetic role being played by the contact of multiple bp by conformationally mobile amino acid side chains. They do, however, show that some individual amino acids affect the recognition of multiple bp through mechanisms other than direct interaction."
