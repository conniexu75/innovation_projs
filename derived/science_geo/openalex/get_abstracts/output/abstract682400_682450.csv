https://openalex.org/W3201934315,"Characterization of the genetic regulation of proteins is essential for understanding disease etiology and developing therapies. We identified 10,674 genetic associations for 3892 plasma proteins to create a cis-anchored gene-protein-disease map of 1859 connections that highlights strong cross-disease biological convergence. This proteo-genomic map provides a framework to connect etiologically related diseases, to provide biological context for new or emerging disorders, and to integrate different biological domains to establish mechanisms for known gene-disease links. Our results identify proteo-genomic connections within and between diseases and establish the value of cis-protein variants for annotation of likely causal disease genes at loci identified in genome-wide association studies, thereby addressing a major barrier to experimental validation and clinical translation of genetic discoveries."
https://openalex.org/W3206212437,"Chemists often use statistical analysis of reaction data with molecular descriptors to identify structure-reactivity relationships, which can enable prediction and mechanistic understanding. In this study, we developed a broadly applicable and quantitative classification workflow that identifies reactivity cliffs in 11 Ni- and Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling datasets using monodentate phosphine ligands. A distinctive ligand steric descriptor, minimum percent buried volume [%Vbur (min)], is found to divide these datasets into active and inactive regions at a similar threshold value. Organometallic studies demonstrate that this threshold corresponds to the binary outcome of bisligated versus monoligated metal and that %Vbur (min) is a physically meaningful and predictive representation of ligand structure in catalysis."

Because they grow from the same material, theory predicts that there should be a relationship between their compositions. In this study, we search for a compositional link between rocky exoplanets and their host stars. We estimate the iron-mass fraction of rocky exoplanets from their masses and radii and compare it with the compositions of their host stars, which we assume reflect the compositions of the protoplanetary disks. We find a correlation (but not a 1:1 relationship) between these two quantities, with a slope of >4, which we interpret as being attributable to planet formation processes. Super-Earths and super-Mercuries appear to be distinct populations with differing compositions, implying differences in their formation processes."
https://openalex.org/W3207096132,"Regeneration of skeletal muscle is a highly synchronized process that requires muscle stem cells (satellite cells). We found that localized injuries, as experienced through exercise, activate a myofiber self-repair mechanism that is independent of satellite cells in mice and humans. Mouse muscle injury triggers a signaling cascade involving calcium, Cdc42, and phosphokinase C that attracts myonuclei to the damaged site via microtubules and dynein. These nuclear movements accelerate sarcomere repair and locally deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) for cellular reconstruction. Myofiber self-repair is a cell-autonomous protective mechanism and represents an alternative model for understanding the restoration of muscle architecture in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3207915479,"In eukaryotes, small RNAs (sRNAs) play critical roles in multiple biological processes. Dicer endonucleases are a central part of sRNA biogenesis. In plants, DICER-LIKE PROTEIN 3 (DCL3) produces 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that determine the specificity of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Here, we determined the structure of a DCL3–pre-siRNA complex in an active dicing-competent state. The 5′-phosphorylated A1 of the guide strand and the 1-nt 3′ overhang of the complementary strand are specifically recognized by a positively charged pocket and an aromatic cap, respectively. The 24-nt siRNA length dependence relies on the separation between the 5′-phosphorylated end of the guide RNA and dual cleavage sites formed by the paired ribonuclease III domains. These structural studies, complemented by functional data, provide insight into the dicing principle for Dicers in general."
https://openalex.org/W3205612217,"Racial inequality is a foundational feature of the criminal justice system in the United States. Here we offer a psychological account for how Americans have come to tolerate a system that is so at odds with their professed egalitarian values. We argue that beliefs about the nature of racism—as being solely due to prejudiced individuals rather than structural factors that disadvantage marginalized racial groups—work to uphold racial stratification in the criminal justice system. Although acknowledging structural racism facilitates the perception of and willingness to reduce racial inequality in criminal justice outcomes, many Americans appear willfully ignorant of structural racism in society. We reflect on the role of psychological science in shaping popular understandings of racism and discuss how to contribute more meaningfully to its reduction."
https://openalex.org/W3206731434,"T cell receptor activation of naïve CD8+ T lymphocytes initiates their maturation into effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which can kill cancer and virally infected cells. Although CTLs show an increased reliance on glycolysis upon acquisition of effector function, we found an essential requirement for mitochondria in target cell–killing. Acute mitochondrial depletion in USP30 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 30)–deficient CTLs markedly diminished killing capacity, although motility, signaling, and secretion were all intact. Unexpectedly, the mitochondrial requirement was linked to mitochondrial translation, inhibition of which impaired CTL killing. Impaired mitochondrial translation triggered attenuated cytosolic translation, precluded replenishment of secreted killing effectors, and reduced the capacity of CTLs to carry out sustained killing. Thus, mitochondria emerge as a previously unappreciated homeostatic regulator of protein translation required for serial CTL killing."
https://openalex.org/W3207070228,"In the brain’s gray matter, astrocytes regulate synapse properties, but their role is unclear for the white matter, where myelinated axons rapidly transmit information between gray matter areas. We found that in rodents, neuronal activity raised the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in astrocyte processes located near action potential–generating sites in the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier of myelinated axons. This released adenosine triphosphate, which was converted extracellularly to adenosine and thus, through A2a receptors, activated HCN2-containing cation channels that regulate two aspects of myelinated axon function: excitability of the AIS and speed of action potential propagation. Variations in astrocyte-derived adenosine level between wake and sleep states or during energy deprivation could thus control white matter information flow and neural circuit function."
https://openalex.org/W3205031126,"Molecular virology tools are critical for basic studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and for developing new therapeutics. Experimental systems that do not rely on viruses capable of spread are needed for potential use in lower-containment settings. In this work, we use a yeast-based reverse genetics system to develop spike-deleted SARS-CoV-2 self-replicating RNAs. These noninfectious self-replicating RNAs, or replicons, can be trans-complemented with viral glycoproteins to generate replicon delivery particles for single-cycle delivery into a range of cell types. This SARS-CoV-2 replicon system represents a convenient and versatile platform for antiviral drug screening, neutralization assays, host factor validation, and viral variant characterization."
https://openalex.org/W3205316755,"Developing cardiovascular systems use mechanical forces to take shape, but how ubiquitous blood flow forces instruct local cardiac cell identity is still unclear. By manipulating mechanical forces in vivo, we show here that shear stress is necessary and sufficient to promote valvulogenesis. We found that valve formation is associated with the activation of an extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent purinergic receptor pathway, specifically triggering calcium ion (Ca2+) pulses and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (Nfatc1) activation. Thus, mechanical forces are converted into discrete bioelectric signals by an ATP-Ca2+-Nfatc1–mechanosensitive pathway to generate positional information and control valve formation."
https://openalex.org/W3206400046,"Over the past 35 years, public and private actors have turned US criminal justice institutions into a vast network of revenue-generating operations. Today, practices such as fines, fees, forfeitures, prison charges, and bail premiums transfer billions of dollars from oppressed communities to governments and corporations. Guided by scholarship on racial capitalism, we argue that to understand how and why criminal justice operates as it does today, one must attend to its predatory dimensions. Analytically and politically, the concept of predation connects diverse forms of criminal legal takings to one another, to the extractive regimes of earlier eras, and to contemporary businesses that financially exploit subjugated communities. Analyses that focus on predatory relations encourage a reconsideration of some dominant understandings in the study of criminal justice today."
https://openalex.org/W3134681913,"Funding and staff formerly dedicated to routine public health tasks (e.g., responding to communicable and non-communicable diseases, investigating foodborne outbreaks, conducting routine surveillance) and services (e.g., environmental health, substance abuse, maternal-child health) may no longer be available in many public health departments due to the COVID-19 response. The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which staffing for essential public health services has been redirected to the COVID-19 response.This is a cross-sectional study using a survey distributed through the Qualtrics platform. Individuals (N = 298) working in public health across governmental and academic public health departments in the U.S. during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response were surveyed. Survey items measured multiple domains including professional experience (i.e., training, years of experience, content expertise, job functions, hours worked), mental and physical health status (i.e., generalized anxiety, depression, burnout), and career plans (i.e., pre-pandemic vs. current career plans).The total number of content expertise areas and programmatic functions covered by individual public health workers increased between January and September of 2020, with 26% (73 of 282) of respondents reporting an increase in both. The total number of respondents working in infectious disease and preparedness remained constant, while declines were reported in program evaluation (-36%) and health education (-27%) and increases were reported in disease investigation (+35%).The provision of many essential public health functions and tasks have been limited or eliminated while the U.S. public health workforce responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight opportunities for funding and professional development of public health systems, both during and after the COVID-19 response, to help ensure the continuity of essential public health services, staffing sustainability, and preparedness for future public health emergencies in the U.S."
https://openalex.org/W3207560695,"In this Review, we assess how mass incarceration, a monumental American policy experiment, has affected families over the past five decades. We reach four conclusions. First, family member incarceration is now common for American families. Second, individuals who will eventually have a family member incarcerated are worse off than those who never will, even before the incarceration takes place. Third, family member incarceration has negative effects on families above and beyond these preexisting disadvantages. And finally, policy interventions that address the precursors to family member incarceration and seek to minimize family member incarceration would best enhance family well-being. If the goal is to help all American families thrive, then the importance of simultaneous changes in social and criminal justice policy cannot be overstated."
https://openalex.org/W3205089560,"Recent studies show the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) as a screening tool to detect COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest x-ray (CXR) images. However, issues on the datasets and study designs from medical and technical perspectives, as well as questions on the vulnerability and robustness of AI algorithms have emerged. In this study, we address these issues with a more realistic development of AI-driven COVID-19 pneumonia detection models by generating our own data through a retrospective clinical study to augment the dataset aggregated from external sources. We optimized five deep learning architectures, implemented development strategies by manipulating data distribution to quantitatively compare study designs, and introduced several detection scenarios to evaluate the robustness and diagnostic performance of the models. At the current level of data availability, the performance of the detection model depends on the hyperparameter tuning and has less dependency on the quantity of data. InceptionV3 attained the highest performance in distinguishing pneumonia from normal CXR in two-class detection scenario with sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and positive predictive value (PPV) of 96%. The models attained higher general performance of 91-96% Sn, 94-98% Sp, and 90-96% PPV in three-class compared to four-class detection scenario. InceptionV3 has the highest general performance with accuracy, F1-score, and g-mean of 96% in the three-class detection scenario. For COVID-19 pneumonia detection, InceptionV3 attained the highest performance with 86% Sn, 99% Sp, and 91% PPV with an AUC of 0.99 in distinguishing pneumonia from normal CXR. Its capability of differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from normal and non-COVID-19 pneumonia attained 0.98 AUC and a micro-average of 0.99 for other classes."
https://openalex.org/W3207711028,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people had to shift their social and work life online. A few researchers and journalists described a new form of fatigue associated with a massive use of technology, including videoconferencing platforms. In this study, this type of fatigue was referred to as Online Fatigue. A new tool (the Online Fatigue Scale) was developed, and its psychometric properties were evaluated. This tool was used to assess Online Fatigue among Italian academics and to examine its associations with psychological and physical health. Methods An online survey was conducted in December 2020 on a sample of Italian academics. Besides the Online Fatigue Scale (11 items) used to assess Online Fatigue, the survey was composed of questionnaires (including validated measures) focused on sociodemographic and job-related information, technostress creators, health status, psychological well-being, and COVID-related perceived distress. The psychometric properties of the Online Fatigue Scale were evaluated, and statistical analyses were conducted to examine the associations between Online Fatigue and all the other variables. Results Participants were 307 academics aged 24–70 years old (mean age = 40.7; SD = 10.1). The Online Fatigue Scale showed good psychometric properties. Two subscales were identified: Off-Balance Fatigue and Virtual Relations Fatigue. High levels of Off-Balance Fatigue were associated with a greater use of technology, female gender, and presence of minor children. Participants with high scores on both subscales reported a greater frequency of psychosomatic symptoms, unhealthy habits, poorer psychological well-being, and greater Covid-related perceived distress. Conclusions The Online Fatigue Scale can be considered a reliable tool to assess Online Fatigue, which was significantly detected in our sample of Italian academics, along with its negative effects on physical and psychological health. Being a woman and having young children represent important risk factors. Universities should promote the separation between work and private life by encouraging self-care activities."
https://openalex.org/W3207016838,"Although dexterity relies on the constant transmission of sensory information, unchecked feedback can be disruptive. Yet how somatosensory feedback from the hands is regulated and whether this modulation influences movement remain unclear. We found that mouse tactile afferents recruit neurons in the brainstem cuneate nucleus, whose activity is modulated by distinct classes of local inhibitory neurons. Manipulation of these inhibitory circuits suppresses or enhances the transmission of tactile information, which affects manual behaviors. Top-down cortical pathways innervate cuneate in a complementary pattern, with somatosensory cortical neurons targeting the core tactile region of cuneate and a large rostral cortical population driving feed-forward inhibition of tactile transmission through an inhibitory shell. These findings identify a circuit basis for tactile feedback modulation that enables the effective execution of dexterous movement."
https://openalex.org/W3207740768,"The Fridays for Future strikes involve students striking for increased action on climate change, and this movement has spread to 185 countries and received widespread media attention. This exploratory study investigates motives for participating or not in the climate strikes and future participation among students in Switzerland. In a sample of N = 638 university students, we found that trust in climate scientists, low trust in governments, response efficacy, protest enjoyment and the perceived success of the strikes predicted participation. Contrary to statements in the public media but consistent with the literature, students who participated in the climate strikes reported consuming less meat, flying less and taking more steps to compensate the CO2 emissions from flights compared to students who did not participate. We discuss how the insights from this study help reveal the determinants of youth collective action on climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3207315930,"Clinical decisions made in the delivery setting are often made under high pressure and great uncertainty, and have serious consequences for mother and baby. Theories of decision-making suggest that individuals in such settings may resort to using heuristics, or simplified decision rules, to aid complex decision-making. This study investigates whether physicians’ delivery mode decisions (i.e., when to perform a vaginal versus a cesarean delivery) are influenced by such a heuristic. Electronic health records spanning 86,000 deliveries suggest that if the prior patient had complications in one delivery mode, the physician will be more likely to switch to the other—and likely inappropriate—delivery mode for the subsequent patient, regardless of patient indications. There is evidence that this heuristic has small, suboptimal effects on patient health."
https://openalex.org/W2989773698,"Observations show that sea surface temperatures along the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current tend to synchronize at decadal time scales. This synchronization, which we refer to as the boundary current synchronization (BCS), is reproduced in global climate models with high spatial resolution. Both in observations and model simulations, BCS is associated with meridional migrations of the atmospheric jet stream. Changes in the strength and path of the ocean currents associated with the jet shifts lead to the synchronicity of surface temperatures. Numerical simulations using a conceptual model and an atmospheric general circulation model are consistent with a notion that BCS is an interbasin air-sea coupled mode. Air temperature patterns similar to the one associated with BCS have been repeatedly observed, including in July of 1994 and 2018."
https://openalex.org/W3205479201,"This paper explores the evolution of research collaboration networks in the 'stakeholder theory and management' (STM) discipline and identifies the longitudinal effect of co-authorship networks on research performance, i.e., research productivity and citation counts. Research articles totaling 6,127 records from 1989 to 2020 were harvested from the Web of Science Database and transformed into bibliometric data using Bibexcel, followed by applying social network analysis to compare and analyze scientific collaboration networks at the author, institution and country levels. This work maps the structure of these networks across three consecutive sub-periods (t1: 1989-1999; t2: 2000-2010; t3: 2011-2020) and explores the association between authors' social network properties and their research performance. The results show that authors collaboration network was fragmented all through the periods, however, with an increase in the number and size of cliques. Similar results were observed in the institutional collaboration network but with less fragmentation between institutions reflected by the increase in network density as time passed. The international collaboration had evolved from an uncondensed, fragmented and highly centralized network, to a highly dense and less fragmented network in t3. Moreover, a positive association was reported between authors' research performance and centrality and structural hole measures in t3 as opposed to ego-density, constraint and tie strength in t1. The findings can be used by policy makers to improve collaboration and develop research programs that can enhance several scientific fields. Central authors identified in the networks are better positioned to receive government funding, maximize research outputs and improve research community reputation. Viewed from a network's perspective, scientists can understand how collaborative relationships influence research performance and consider where to invest their decision and choices."
https://openalex.org/W3206519430,"A growing number of parents refuse vaccination due to concerns about side effects. Influenza vaccine is no exception and remains one of the most controversial vaccines. Data regarding influenza vaccine uptake and parental knowledge, attitude and practice towards vaccination in the Lebanese population is lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the rate of vaccination refusal and potential associated factors among Lebanese parents of school-aged children, in general and with a focus on influenza vaccine.A parent questionnaire was distributed in randomly selected 2 public and 2 private schools from the greater Beirut area during the school year 2017-2018. Questionnaires covered knowledge, attitude (including themes of efficacy, hesitancy and trust), and practice of vaccination in general and influenza vaccine in particular.The response rate was 76.5% (306/400). Overall, 29.4% parents reported vaccinating their children against influenza (62.2% in private and 37.7% in public schools). Younger age, paternal employment and higher household income were associated with higher vaccination rates (p = 0.01, 0.02 and <0.0001 respectively). Lack of vaccine recommendation by the physician was the most common reason for not taking it (47%). Parents who accepted influenza vaccination had higher scores in efficacy, hesitancy and trust and were more compliant with other vaccinations.One third of parents of school aged children in the greater Beirut area vaccinate their children against influenza. This rate is likely lower in rural remote areas. Physician's recommendation is the single most important predictor of such vaccination. Future studies tackling physicians' attitude and practice are needed to help improve influenza vaccination rates in the Lebanese population."
https://openalex.org/W3205114486,"Facial imaging and facial recognition technologies, now common in our daily lives, also are increasingly incorporated into health care processes, enabling touch-free appointment check-in, matching patients accurately, and assisting with the diagnosis of certain medical conditions. The use, sharing, and storage of facial data is expected to expand in coming years, yet little is documented about the perspectives of patients and participants regarding these uses. We developed a pair of surveys to gather public perspectives on uses of facial images and facial recognition technologies in healthcare and in health-related research in the United States. We used Qualtrics Panels to collect responses from general public respondents using two complementary and overlapping survey instruments; one focused on six types of biometrics (including facial images and DNA) and their uses in a wide range of societal contexts (including healthcare and research) and the other focused on facial imaging, facial recognition technology, and related data practices in health and research contexts specifically. We collected responses from a diverse group of 4,048 adults in the United States (2,038 and 2,010, from each survey respectively). A majority of respondents (55.5%) indicated they were equally worried about the privacy of medical records, DNA, and facial images collected for precision health research. A vignette was used to gauge willingness to participate in a hypothetical precision health study, with respondents split as willing to (39.6%), unwilling to (30.1%), and unsure about (30.3%) participating. Nearly one-quarter of respondents (24.8%) reported they would prefer to opt out of the DNA component of a study, and 22.0% reported they would prefer to opt out of both the DNA and facial imaging component of the study. Few indicated willingness to pay a fee to opt-out of the collection of their research data. Finally, respondents were offered options for ideal governance design of their data, as ""open science""; ""gated science""; and ""closed science."" No option elicited a majority response. Our findings indicate that while a majority of research participants might be comfortable with facial images and facial recognition technologies in healthcare and health-related research, a significant fraction expressed concern for the privacy of their own face-based data, similar to the privacy concerns of DNA data and medical records. A nuanced approach to uses of face-based data in healthcare and health-related research is needed, taking into consideration storage protection plans and the contexts of use."
https://openalex.org/W3202822329,"The aim of this study was to estimate genotype by time-lagged heat stress (HS) variance components as well as main and interaction SNP-marker effects for maternal HS during the last eight weeks of cow pregnancy, considering milk production traits recorded in the offspring generation. The HS indicator was the temperature humidity index (THI) for each week. A dummy variable with the code = 1 for the respective week for THI ≥ 60 indicated HS, otherwise, for no HS, the code = 0 was assigned. The dataset included test-day and lactation production traits from 14,188 genotyped first parity Holstein cows. After genotype quality control, 41,139 SNP markers remained for the genomic analyses. Genomic animal models without (model VC_nHS) and with in-utero HS effects (model VC_wHS) were applied to estimate variance components. Accordingly, for genome-wide associations, models GWA_nHS and GWA_wHS, respectively, were applied to estimate main and interaction SNP effects. Common genomic and residual variances for the same traits were very similar from models VC_nHS and VC_wHS. Genotype by HS interaction variances varied, depending on the week with in-utero HS. Among all traits, lactation milk yield with HS from week 5 displayed the largest proportion for interaction variances (0.07). For main effects from model GWA_wHS, 380 SNPs were suggestively associated with all production traits. For the SNP interaction effects from model GWA_wHS, we identified 31 suggestive SNPs, which were located in close distance to 62 potential candidate genes. The inferred candidate genes have various biological functions, including mechanisms of immune response, growth processes and disease resistance. Two biological processes excessively represented in the overrepresentation tests addressed lymphocyte and monocyte chemotaxis, ultimately affecting immune response. The modelling approach considering time-lagged genotype by HS interactions for production traits inferred physiological mechanisms being associated with health and immunity, enabling improvements in selection of robust animals."
https://openalex.org/W3206964058,"J-waves represent a common finding in routine ECGs (5-6%) and are closely linked to ventricular tachycardias. While arrhythmias and non-specific ECG alterations are a frequent finding in COVID-19, an analysis of J-wave incidence in acute COVID-19 is lacking.A total of 386 patients consecutively, hospitalized due to acute COVID-19 pneumonia were included in this retrospective analysis. Admission ECGs were analyzed, screened for J-waves and correlated to clinical characteristics and 28-day mortality.J-waves were present in 12.2% of patients. Factors associated with the presence of J-waves were old age, female sex, a history of stroke and/or heart failure, high CRP levels as well as a high BMI. Mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with J-waves in the admission ECG compared to the non-J-wave cohort (J-wave: 14.9% vs. non-J-wave 3.8%, p = 0.001). After adjusting for confounders using a multivariable cox regression model, the incidence of J-waves was an independent predictor of mortality at 28-days (OR 2.76 95% CI: 1.15-6.63; p = 0.023). J-waves disappeared or declined in 36.4% of COVID-19 survivors with available ECGs for 6-8 months follow-up.J-waves are frequently and often transiently found in the admission ECG of patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19. Furthermore, they seem to be an independent predictor of 28-day mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3207860839,"Conventional testing and diagnostic methods for infections like SARS-CoV-2 have limitations for population health management and public policy. We hypothesize that daily changes in autonomic activity, measured through off-the-shelf technologies together with app-based cognitive assessments, may be used to forecast the onset of symptoms consistent with a viral illness. We describe our strategy using an AI model that can predict, with 82% accuracy (negative predictive value 97%, specificity 83%, sensitivity 79%, precision 34%), the likelihood of developing symptoms consistent with a viral infection three days before symptom onset. The model correctly predicts, almost all of the time (97%), individuals who will not develop viral-like illness symptoms in the next three days. Conversely, the model correctly predicts as positive 34% of the time, individuals who will develop viral-like illness symptoms in the next three days. This model uses a conservative framework, warning potentially pre-symptomatic individuals to socially isolate while minimizing warnings to individuals with a low likelihood of developing viral-like symptoms in the next three days. To our knowledge, this is the first study using wearables and apps with machine learning to predict the occurrence of viral illness-like symptoms. The demonstrated approach to forecasting the onset of viral illness-like symptoms offers a novel, digital decision-making tool for public health safety by potentially limiting viral transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3205408017,"Most knowledge regarding the role of predators is ecological in nature. Here, we report how disturbance generated by sea otters (Enhydra lutris) digging for infaunal prey in eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows increases genetic diversity by promoting conditions for sexual reproduction of plants. Eelgrass allelic richness and genotypic diversity were, respectively, 30 and 6% higher in areas where recovering sea otter populations had been established for 20 to 30 years than in areas where they had been present <10 years or absent >100 years. The influence of sea otter occupancy on the aforementioned measures of genetic diversity was stronger than those of depth, temperature, latitude, or meadow size. Our findings reveal an underappreciated evolutionary process by which megafauna may promote genetic diversity and ecological resilience."
https://openalex.org/W3205521780,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant morbidity and mortality across the US. In this ecological study, we identified county-level variables associated with the COVID-19 case-fatality rate (CFR) using publicly available datasets and a negative binomial generalized linear model. Variables associated with decreased CFR included a greater number of hospitals per 10,000 people, banning religious gatherings, a higher percentage of people living in mobile homes, and a higher percentage of uninsured people. Variables associated with increased CFR included a higher percentage of the population over age 65, a higher percentage of Black or African Americans, a higher asthma prevalence, and a greater number of hospitals in a county. By identifying factors that are associated with COVID-19 CFR in US counties, we hope to help officials target public health interventions and healthcare resources to locations that are at increased risk of COVID-19 fatalities."
https://openalex.org/W3205536195,"The objective of this study is to develop a skeleton model for assessing active marrow dose from bone-seeking beta-emitting radionuclides. This article explains the modeling methodology which accounts for individual variability of the macro- and microstructure of bone tissue. Bone sites with active hematopoiesis are assessed by dividing them into small segments described by simple geometric shapes. Spongiosa, which fills the segments, is modeled as an isotropic three-dimensional grid (framework) of rod-like trabeculae that ""run through"" the bone marrow. Randomized multiple framework deformations are simulated by changing the positions of the grid nodes and the thickness of the rods. Model grid parameters are selected in accordance with the parameters of spongiosa microstructures taken from the published papers. Stochastic modeling of radiation transport in heterogeneous media simulating the distribution of bone tissue and marrow in each of the segments is performed by Monte Carlo methods. Model output for the human femur at different ages is provided as an example. The uncertainty of dosimetric characteristics associated with individual variability of bone structure was evaluated. An advantage of this methodology for the calculation of doses absorbed in the marrow from bone-seeking radionuclides is that it does not require additional studies of autopsy material. The biokinetic model results will be used in the future to calculate individual doses to members of a cohort exposed to 89,90Sr from liquid radioactive waste discharged to the Techa River by the Mayak Production Association in 1949-1956. Further study of these unique cohorts provides an opportunity to gain more in-depth knowledge about the effects of chronic radiation on the hematopoietic system. In addition, the proposed model can be used to assess the doses to active marrow under any other scenarios of 90Sr and 89Sr intake to humans."

The aim of the study was to assess the level of the 2020 final year dental students' self-confidence in performing different dental procedures through specially designed questionnaire and compare it to self-confidence of the 2019 final year students.An anonymous questionnaire consisting of 40 questions regarding self-confidence level in performing 40 different dental procedures and based on five points Likert-like scale was distributed during November 2020 to final year dental students whose studies were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in one semester. The study group comprised their answers. The comparison was done with the control group that consisted of students' answers on the same questionnaire from previous 2019 year conducted as a part of regular internal educational evaluation.Response rate was 74.2% in study group and 89.3% in control group. Mean level of self-confidence reported by 115 students in study group was significantly lower than that reported by 100 students in control group (3.28±1.08 vs. 3.58±0.88, respectively) and the distribution of self-confidence scores were different in observed groups. Graduates from study group felt less confident than those from control in 8 clinical skills.Abrupt changes in teaching modalities caused by COVID-19 pandemic had significant impact on final year dental students' self-confidence indicating additional educational needs in postgraduate period."

However, the deposition of its residues in food of animal origin intended for human consumption at non-permissible levels has generated global health concern and the need to tackle this using the ""One Health Approach"". This study assessed the knowledge and practice of 286 cattle handlers in Kwara State, Nigeria.A web-based cross sectional online survey using a semi-structured questionnaire was conducted from November to December, 2019. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed at 95% confidence interval to determine predictors of good knowledge and practices towards Antibiotic Residues in Meat and Milk among cattle handlers.This study revealed that majority (52.7% n = 165/286) of the cattle handlers were not aware of antibiotic residues. Knowledge and practices regarding antibiotic residues were generally poor among the study population; 36.7% and 35.5% had satisfactory knowledge and practice respectively. The age (p = 0.026), gender (p = 0.006) and business duration (p = 0.001) of participants were significantly associated with their knowledge of antimicrobial residues. The effect of education on knowledge was modified by age. The odds of having poor knowledge on antibiotic residues increased 4 times among participants who were ≤40 years old than those above 40 years (Stratum Specific OR = 3.65; CI = 1.2, 11.1; p = 0.026). Knowledge levels of participants were statistically associated with their practice levels p<0.05 (OR = 2.43; CI = 1.45. 4.06; p = 0.0006).This implies that poor knowledge is a risk factor to having poor practice among cattle handlers. Deliberate efforts towards educating cattle farmers on best farm practices in antibiotic use would prevent antibiotic residues in meat and milk. Also, an effective surveillance system for monitoring the use of veterinary drugs in Kwara State, Nigeria is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W3205900555,"Enteric methane (CH4) emissions are a natural process in ruminants and can result in up to 12% of energy losses. Hence, decreasing enteric CH4 production constitutes an important step towards improving the feed efficiency of Brazilian cattle herds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between performance, residual feed intake (RFI), and enteric CH4 emission in growing Nellore cattle (Bos indicus). Performance, RFI and CH4 emission data were obtained from 489 animals participating in selection programs (mid-test age and body weight: 414±159 days and 356±135 kg, respectively) that were evaluated in 12 performance tests carried out in individual pens (n = 95) or collective paddocks (n = 394) equipped with electronic feed bunks. The sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas technique was used to measure daily CH4 emissions. The following variables were estimated: CH4 emission rate (g/day), residual methane emission and emission expressed per mid-test body weight, metabolic body weight, dry matter intake (CH4/DMI), average daily gain, and ingested gross energy (CH4/GE). Animals classified as negative RFI (RFI<0), i.e., more efficient animals, consumed less dry matter (P <0.0001) and emitted less g CH4/day (P = 0.0022) than positive RFI animals (RFI>0). Nonetheless, more efficient animals emitted more CH4/DMI and CH4/GE (P < 0.0001), suggesting that the difference in daily intake between animals is a determinant factor for the difference in daily enteric CH4 emissions. In addition, animals classified as negative RFI emitted less CH4 per kg mid-test weight and metabolic weight (P = 0.0096 and P = 0.0033, respectively), i.e., most efficient animals could emit less CH4 per kg of carcass. In conclusion, more efficient animals produced less methane when expressed as g/day and per kg mid-test weight than less efficient animals, suggesting lower emissions per kg of carcass produced. However, it is not possible to state that feed efficiency has a direct effect on enteric CH4 emissions since emissions per kg of consumed dry matter and the percentage of gross energy lost as CH4 are higher for more efficient animals."
https://openalex.org/W3205844392,"Health system responsiveness refers to non-financial, non-clinical qualities of care that reflect respect for human dignity and interpersonal aspects of the care process. The non-clinical aspects of the health system are therefore essential to the provision of services to patients. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to assess the responsiveness in maternity care, domain performance and factors associated with responsiveness in maternity care in the Hadiya Zone public Hospitals in Southern Ethiopia.A hospital-based cross-sectional study was employed on 413 participants using a systematic sampling technique from 1 July to 1 August 2020. An exit interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. EpiData (version 3.1) and SPSS (version 24) software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were computed to identify the associated factors of health system responsiveness in maternity care at 95% CI.The findings indicated that 53.0% of users gave high ratings for responsiveness in delivery care. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, mothers aged ≥ 35 (AOR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.1-0.9), urban resident (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.5-4.8), obstetrics complications during the current pregnancy (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.1-3.0), and caesarean delivery (AOR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.2-0.7) were factors associated with poor ratings for responsiveness in maternity care.In the hospitals under investigation, responsiveness in maternity care was found to be good. The findings of this study suggest that the ministry of health and regional health bureau needs to pay attention to health system responsiveness as an indicator of the quality of maternity care."
https://openalex.org/W3206339549,"Lateral patellar dislocation (LPD) frequently causes damage to the knee. Injury patterns and risk factors contributing to such injuries have not yet been examined in detail.We retrospectively analyzed 50 consecutive patients with primary LPD. Two reviewers evaluated the MRI images regarding risk factors for LPD (Dejours classification; Caton-Deschamps Index, CDI; distance from the tibial tuberosity to trochlear groove, TT-TG; trochlear depth, TD) as well as joint damages according to the Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS).33 male and 17 female patients with a mean age of 23.2 (±9.6) years were included in this study. 52% were classified Dejours ≥ B, 34% had a CDI ≥ 1.3, 22% a TT-TG ≥ 20mm and 52% a TD < 3mm. 49 out of 50 patients (98%) showed abnormalities according to WORMS. The most frequently observed abnormalities were synovitis/effusion (49/50, 98%), bone marrow oedema (44/50, 88%) and cartilage damage (42/50, 84%). Most frequently affected subregions were medial (41/50, 82%) and lateral (31/50, 62%) patella as well as the anterior (43/50, 86%), central (42/50, 84%) and posterior (11/50, 22%) portion of the lateral femoral condyle. There was no significant correlation between any of the examined risk factors and joint damages according to WORMS. Male patients had higher scores regarding total cartilage damage (5.11 vs. 2.56, p = 0.029), total score for the lateral femorotibial joint (3.15 vs. 1.65, p = 0.026) and overall total WORMS score (12.15 vs. 8.29, p = 0.038).Risk factors for LPD do not influence the risk of damages to the knee joint after primary LPD. Although LPD is generally known to affect more female than male patients, male patients suffered more severe injuries after primary LPD, particularly of the lateral femorotibial joint. Overall, our results underline the importance of MRI imaging after primary LPD."

Five key results were identified: (1) Overall, 13 different phenolic acids and flavonoids were detected from among the 20 excellent jujube varieties tested, of which 12 were from the fruits, 11 from the leaves, and 10 from the stems. Seven phenolic acids and flavonoids, including (+)-catechin, rutin, quercetin, luteolin, spinosin, gallic acid, and chlorogenic acid, were detected in all tissues. (2) The total and individual phenolic acids and flavonoids contents significantly decreased during fruit development in Ziziphus jujuba cv.Hupingzao. (3) The total phenolic acids and flavonoids content was the highest in the leaves of Ziziphus jujuba cv.Hupingzao, followed by the stems and fruits with significant differences among the content of these tissues. The main composition of the tissues also differed, with quercetin and rutin present in the leaves; (+)-catechin and rutin in the stems; and (+)-catechin, epicatechin, and rutin in the fruits. (4) The total content of phenolic acid and flavonoid ranged from 359.38 to 1041.33 μg/g FW across all examined varieties, with Ziziphus jujuba cv.Jishanbanzao having the highest content, and (+)-catechin as the main composition in all 20 varieties, followed by epicatechin, rutin, and quercetin. (5) Principal component analysis showed that (+)-catechin, epicatechin, gallic acid, and rutin contributed to the first two principal components for each variety. Together, these findings will assist with varietal selection when developing phenolic acids and f lavonoids functional products."
https://openalex.org/W3206661204,"The purposes are to solve the isomorphism encountered while processing hyperspectral remote sensing data and improve the accuracy of hyperspectral remote sensing data in extracting and classifying lithological information. Taking rocks as the research object, Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) is introduced. After the hyperspectral image data are normalized, the lithological spectrum and spatial information are the feature extraction targets to construct a deep learning-based lithological information extraction model. The performance of the model is analyzed using specific instance data. Results demonstrate that the overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient of the lithological information extraction and classification model based on deep learning were 90.58% and 0.8676, respectively. This model can precisely distinguish the properties of rock masses and provide better performance compared with the state of other analysis models. After introducing deep learning, the recognition accuracy and the Kappa coefficient of the proposed BPNN model increased by 8.5% and 0.12, respectively, compared with the traditional BPNN. The proposed extraction and classification model can provide some research values and practical significances for the hyperspectral rock and mineral classification."
https://openalex.org/W3207550311,"Different biological groups can be used for monitoring aquatic ecosystems because they can respond to variations in the environment. However, the evaluation of different bioindicators may demand multiple financial resources and time, especially when abundance quantification and species-level identification are required. In this study, we evaluated whether taxonomic, numerical resolution and cross-taxa can be used to optimize costs and time for stream biomonitoring in Central Brazil (Cerrado biome). For this, we sampled different biological groups (fish, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and periphyton) in stream stretches distributed in a gradient of land conversion dominated by agriculture and livestock. We used the Mantel and Procrustes analyses to test the association among different taxonomic levels (species to class), the association between incidence and abundance data (numerical resolution), and biological groups. We also assessed the relative effect of local environmental and spatial predictors on different groups. The taxonomic levels and numerical resolutions were strongly correlated in all taxonomic groups (r > 0.70). We found no correlations among biological groups. Different sets of environmental variables were the most important to explain the variability in species composition of distinct biological groups. Thus, we conclude that monitoring the streams in this region using bioindicators is more informative through higher taxonomic levels with occurrence data than abundance. However, different biological groups provide complementary information, reinforcing the need for a multi-taxa approach in biomonitoring."

https://openalex.org/W3205344842,"Hypotension in the early stages of life appears in 20% of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The gestational age and birth weight are the risk factors highly related to the postnatal hypotension. Other risk factors slightly differ between different studies. So, we evaluated the risk factors and prognosis that are associated with infants treated with hypotension in the early stages of life, after excluding the influences of gestational age and small for gestational age (SGA). VLBW infants registered in the Korean Neonatal Network between 2013 and 2015 treated for hypotension within a week after their birth were selected as study subjects. The rest were used as a control group. Risk factors and the prevalence of severe complications, including mortality, were investigated and compared after matching for gestational age and SGA. The treatment rate for hypotension within the first postnatal week was inversely related to decreasing gestational ages and birth weights. In particular, 63.4% of preterm infants born at ≤ 24 weeks' gestation and 66.9% of those with a birth weight < 500 g were treated for hypotension within a week of birth. Regression analysis after matching showed that 1-minute Apgar score, neonatal cardiac massage or epinephrine administration, symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus, early onset sepsis, and chorioamnionitis were significantly associated with hypotension. In the hypotension group, mortality, grade 3 or higher intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates were significantly higher after the matching for gestational age and SGA. Hypotension during the first postnatal week is very closely related to the prematurity and the condition of the infant shortly after birth. Regular prenatal care including careful monitoring and appropriate neonatal resuscitation are very crucial to decrease the risk of hypotension in the early stages of life."
https://openalex.org/W3206821249,"Introduction Limited population-based data exist about children with primary nephrotic syndrome (NS). Methods We identified a cohort of children with primary NS receiving care in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated healthcare delivery system caring for &gt;750,000 children. We identified all children &lt;18 years between 1996 and 2012 who had nephrotic range proteinuria (urine ACR&gt;3500 mg/g, urine PCR&gt;3.5 mg/mg, 24-hour urine protein&gt;3500 mg or urine dipstick&gt;300 mg/dL) in laboratory databases or a diagnosis of NS in electronic health records. Nephrologists reviewed health records for clinical presentation and laboratory and biopsy results to confirm primary NS. Results Among 365 cases of confirmed NS, 179 had confirmed primary NS attributed to presumed minimal change disease (MCD) (72%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (23%) or membranous nephropathy (MN) (5%). The overall incidence of primary NS was 1.47 (95% Confidence Interval:1.27–1.70) per 100,000 person-years. Biopsy data were available in 40% of cases. Median age for patients with primary NS was 6.9 (interquartile range:3.7 to 12.9) years, 43% were female and 26% were white, 13% black, 17% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 32% Hispanic. Conclusion This population-based identification of children with primary NS leveraging electronic health records can provide a unique approach and platform for describing the natural history of NS and identifying determinants of outcomes in children with primary NS."

The article aims to examine the diversity of the production potential in the agricultural sectors of the EU candidate countries (CC) and the Eastern Partnership countries (EPC) and its impact on the variety of the achieved productivity, as well as to present changes in the analyzed indicators in the years 2006-2017. A synthetic measure of agricultural development and a linear regression analysis were applied in the article. The research revealed that Belarus may be distinguished with regard to its production potential, as well as the achieved productivity. In most countries (with the exception of Montenegro and Macedonia), an increase in the value of the synthetic measure of the possessed potential has been recorded in the studied period. However, the synthetic measure of the agricultural productivity level displayed an insignificant raise only in half of the countries surveyed."
https://openalex.org/W3205729028,"Isoflurane (ISO) is a widely used inhalation anesthetic in experiments with rodents and humans during surgery. Though ISO has not been reported to impart long-lasting side effects, it is unknown if ISO can influence gene regulation in certain tissues, including the heart. Such changes could have important implications for use of this anesthetic in patients susceptible to heart failure/other cardiac abnormalities. To test if ISO could alter gene regulation/expression in heart tissues, and if such changes were reversible, prolonged, or late onset with time, SHR (spontaneously hypertensive) rats were exposed by intratracheal inhalation to a 97.5% air/2.5% ISO mixture on two consecutive days (2 hr/d). Control rats breathed filtered air only. On Days 1, 30, 240, and 360 post-exposure, rat hearts were collected and total RNA was extracted from the left ventricle for global gene expression analysis. The data revealed differentially-expressed genes (DEG) in response to ISO (compared to naïve control) at all post-exposure timepoints. The data showed acute ISO exposures led to DEG associated with wounding, local immune function, inflammation, and circadian rhythm regulation at Days 1 and 30; these effects dissipated by Day 240. There were other significantly-increased DEG induced by ISO at Day 360; these included changes in expression of genes associated with cell signaling, differentiation, and migration, extracellular matrix organization, cell-substrate adhesion, heart development, and blood pressure regulation. Examination of consistent DEG at Days 240 and 360 indicated late onset DEG reflecting potential long-lasting effects from ISO; these included DEG associated with oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, angiogenesis, mitochondrial translation elongation, and focal adhesion. Together, the data show acute repeated ISO exposures could impart variable effects on gene expression/regulation in the heart. While some alterations self-resolved, others appeared to be long-lasting or late onset. Whether such changes occur in all rat models or in humans remains to be investigated."

Board certified plastic surgeons and societies of plastic surgery play a role in providing accurate, evidence-based information to the public, patients, and colleagues. The aim of this study was to explore the use of social media by European Plastic Surgery Societies.A retrospective analysis of the presence and activity of European Plastic Surgery Societies on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram was conducted between December 12th 2018 and December 12th 2019. The results have been compared to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.Twenty, eleven and nine European societies yielded an active account on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram respectively. Only seven European societies had an account on all three platforms and were therefore considered polypresent. The amount of followers of those seven societies was significantly higher than of the others (p-value = 0.02). Their activity yielded significantly more posts on Facebook (p-value = 0.02). The American Society of Plastic Surgeons had more followers on all three platforms than all European societies combined.Social media are still rather unexploited by European Plastic Surgery Societies. A tendency towards increased visibility can be observed, yet a higher penetration is required to further educate and engage through social media. The quantitative data provided serve as reasonable foundation for further studies and a guide for growth of #PlasticSurgery."

A total of 111 eyes from 111 normal healthy subjects were examined. The subjects were divided into three groups according to the AL: Group 1 (AL: < 24.0 mm; 35 eyes), Group 2 (AL: 24.0-25.99 mm; 37 eyes), and Group 3 (AL: ≥ 26 mm; 39 eyes). Peripapillary OCTA images were acquired using 6× 6 mm angiography scans, and vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) of the superficial capillary plexus were calculated automatically. VD and PD were compared among the three groups according to the distance from the optic disc (inner and outer rings). Linear regression analyses were also performed to identify clinical factors associated with average VD.The average ALs of Groups 1-3 were 23.33± 0.57, 25.05± 0.60, and 27.42± 0.82, respectively. Average VD (P = 0.009) and PD (P = 0.029) in the inner ring increased with increasing AL. However, average VD (P < 0.001) and PD (P < 0.001) in the outer ring decreased with AL increased; the same trends were found for the full areas (VD, p<0.001; PD, p = 0.001). Average VDs in the inner and outer rings were not associated (P = 0.938).Peripapillary VD and PD were significantly associated with AL. Depending on the distance from the disc, peripapillary VDs and PDs of the inner and outer rings were differentially affected by AL. Physicians should therefore consider the effects of AL in the analyses of peripapillary microvasculature."

https://openalex.org/W3205112039,"Static light scattering is a popular physical chemistry technique that enables calculation of physical attributes such as the radius of gyration and the second virial coefficient for a macromolecule (e.g., a polymer or a protein) in solution. The second virial coefficient is a physical quantity that characterizes the magnitude and sign of pairwise interactions between particles, and hence is related to aggregation propensity, a property of considerable scientific and practical interest. Estimating the second virial coefficient from experimental data is challenging due both to the degree of precision required and the complexity of the error structure involved. In contrast to conventional approaches based on heuristic ordinary least squares estimates, Bayesian inference for the second virial coefficient allows explicit modeling of error processes, incorporation of prior information, and the ability to directly test competing physical models. Here, we introduce a fully Bayesian model for static light scattering experiments on small-particle systems, with joint inference for concentration, index of refraction, oligomer size, and the second virial coefficient. We apply our proposed model to study the aggregation behavior of hen egg-white lysozyme and human γ S-crystallin using in-house experimental data. Based on these observations, we also perform a simulation study on the primary drivers of uncertainty in this family of experiments, showing in particular the potential for improved monitoring and control of concentration to aid inference."

To calculate the sample size for a cRCT, an estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) is required. For infectious diseases, shared characteristics and social mixing behaviours may increase susceptibility and exposure, promote transmission and be a source of clustering. We present ICCs from a school-based cRCT assessing the effectiveness of a meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero, GlaxoSmithKline) on reducing oropharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis ( Nm ) in 34,489 adolescents from 237 schools in South Australia in 2017/2018. We also explore the contribution of shared behaviours and characteristics to these ICCs. The ICC for carriage of disease-causing Nm genogroups (primary outcome) pre-vaccination was 0.004 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.007) and for all Nm was 0.007 (95%CI: 0.004, 0.011). Adjustment for social behaviours and personal characteristics reduced the ICC for carriage of disease-causing and all Nm genogroups by 25% (to 0.003) and 43% (to 0.004), respectively. ICCs are also reported for risk factors here, which may be outcomes in future research. Higher ICCs were observed for susceptibility and/or exposure variables related to Nm carriage (having a cold, spending ≥1 night out socializing or kissing ≥1 person in the previous week). In metropolitan areas, nights out socializing was a highly correlated behaviour. By contrast, smoking was a highly correlated behaviour in rural areas. A practical example to inform future cRCT sample size estimates is provided."

https://openalex.org/W3207612888,"Depression in the workplace is a significant factor for reduced personal well-being and productivity. Consequently, this has negative effects on the economic success of the companies in which depressed people are employed. In addition, the economy has to deal with the significant burden of this illness on the health system. In this paper, we investigated how different working contexts-working in a group or individually-influenced depressed individuals towards higher or lower well-being and productivity. We examined this using a laboratory experiment. In this setting, we were also able to analyze how, in turn, a depressive individual impacted the productivity and affective situation of their workgroup, reflecting the company perspective. The experimental design mimicked the very basic processes of a workplace in a stylized way. We used two distinct samples: subclinically and clinically depressed, both working in a group with healthy controls. As expected, we found generally lower performance in the clinically depressed sample, but in the subclinically depressed sample, we only found this in the individual work context. In contrast to our expectations, the performance of subclinically depressed individuals working in groups with healthy controls was even higher than that of healthy controls in homogenously healthy groups. The performance of the entire group with a depressed member was lower for the sample with clinically manifested depression, while the performance of groups with a subclinically depressed participant was significantly higher than the performance of homogeneously non-depressed control groups. We discuss our results with a focus on the design of workplaces to both re-integrate clinically depressed employees and prevent subclinically depressed employees from developing major depression."
