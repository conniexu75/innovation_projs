IRs are variant olfactory-expressed iGluRs essential for odor detection IRs function in combinations of up to three different common and variable subunits IR complex assembly is necessary and sufficient for activity in heterologous cells IR ligand-binding domains function in odor recognition and cilia localization Rapid, specific, and versatile communication between cells and between individuals relies principally on chemical signals. External molecular cues are usually recognized by dedicated cell surface-receptor proteins that can trigger changes in gene expression, physiology, or behavior of both cells and organisms. In nervous systems, intercellular communication occurs between neurons at synapses. Diffusible neurotransmitters are released from presynaptic cell termini in response to action potentials and recognized by receptor proteins in postsynaptic cell membranes to induce neuronal depolarization and continued propagation of action potentials. One of the best characterized synaptic communication mechanisms is that mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), which underly most excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (Gereau and Swanson, 2008Gereau R.W. Swanson G.T. The Glutamate Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.2008Crossref Google Scholar). iGluRs are ligand-gated ion channels comprising an extracellular “Venus fly-trap” ligand-binding domain (LBD) that undergoes conformational changes upon association with glutamate to open a transmembrane channel pore (Mayer, 2006Mayer M.L. Glutamate receptors at atomic resolution.Nature. 2006; 440: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, Sobolevsky et al., 2009Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E. X-ray structure, symmetry and mechanism of an AMPA-subtype glutamate receptor.Nature. 2009; 462: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Several iGluR classes have been defined, including AMPA, Kainate, and NMDA receptors, which assemble into subfamily-specific heteromeric complexes with unique signaling properties in postsynaptic membranes (Gereau and Swanson, 2008Gereau R.W. Swanson G.T. The Glutamate Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.2008Crossref Google Scholar). iGluRs are structurally and functionally conserved in most animals (Tikhonov and Magazanik, 2009Tikhonov D.B. Magazanik L.G. Origin and molecular evolution of ionotropic glutamate receptors.Neurosci. Behav. Physiol. 2009; 39: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), reflecting their fundamental role in synaptic communication. Nervous systems are also responsible for detecting myriad volatile chemicals in the environment (Ache and Young, 2005Ache B.W. Young J.M. Olfaction: diverse species, conserved principles.Neuron. 2005; 48: 417-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Odor detection is mediated by large divergent repertoires of olfactory receptors, which localize to the ciliated dendritic endings of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) (Touhara and Vosshall, 2009Touhara K. Vosshall L.B. Sensing odorants and pheromones with chemosensory receptors.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In most animals, the vast majority of OSNs express a single odorant receptor (OR) gene, which defines the selectivity of OSN responses to odor stimuli (Fuss and Ray, 2009Fuss S.H. Ray A. Mechanisms of odorant receptor gene choice in Drosophila and vertebrates.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 41: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Vertebrate ORs are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and signal through intracellular second messengers to depolarize OSNs (Spehr and Munger, 2009Spehr M. Munger S.D. Olfactory receptors: G protein-coupled receptors and beyond.J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 1570-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We recently described a novel family of olfactory receptors called the Ionotropic Receptors (IRs) (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In contrast to other receptor repertoires, IRs represent a highly divergent subfamily of iGluRs that is present across the protostome branch of the animal kingdom (Croset et al., 2010Croset V. Rytz R. Cummins S.F. Budd A. Brawand D. Kaessmann H. Gibson T.J. Benton R. Ancient protostome origin of chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptors and the evolution of insect taste and olfaction.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001064Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Analysis of IR expression in the principal olfactory organ (antenna) of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, revealed complex combinatorial expression patterns, with individual OSNs expressing 2 to 5 distinct IR genes (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). IRs concentrate in olfactory cilia and not at synapses, and misexpression of IRs in other (IR-containing) neurons is sufficient to confer novel odor responsiveness, supporting the hypothesis that they function directly in odor detection (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The IRs define an intriguing molecular parallel between the chemical communication mechanisms occurring between neurons at synapses and between the external world and olfactory circuits (Shaham, 2010Shaham S. Chemosensory organs as models of neuronal synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 212-217PubMed Google Scholar). Our appreciation of the similarities and differences in how these receptors act in these different neural contexts is, however, hampered by our lack of mechanistic knowledge of IRs as olfactory receptors. Here, we combine molecular genetic, cellular imaging, and electrophysiological approaches to elucidate IR function. Our results provide insights into the transitions that have occurred during the evolution of these diverse chemical detectors from their conserved synaptic iGluR ancestors. Comparative genomic analysis of IR repertoires has defined several classes of receptors (Figure 1A ) (Croset et al., 2010Croset V. Rytz R. Cummins S.F. Budd A. Brawand D. Kaessmann H. Gibson T.J. Benton R. Ancient protostome origin of chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptors and the evolution of insect taste and olfaction.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001064Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). At least 14 “antennal” IRs are conserved across insects and expressed in combinations of up to three different receptors in stereotyped subsets of antennal OSNs in Drosophila (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Forty-five “divergent” IRs are, by contrast, largely specific to drosophilids and at least some of these are implicated in taste detection (Croset et al., 2010Croset V. Rytz R. Cummins S.F. Budd A. Brawand D. Kaessmann H. Gibson T.J. Benton R. Ancient protostome origin of chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptors and the evolution of insect taste and olfaction.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001064Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Finally, two closely related IRs, IR8a and IR25a, are distinguished by their higher sequence identity to iGluRs, the existence of homologous genes across Protostomia, and the broad distribution of their transcripts in antennal IR-expressing OSNs (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, Croset et al., 2010Croset V. Rytz R. Cummins S.F. Budd A. Brawand D. Kaessmann H. Gibson T.J. Benton R. Ancient protostome origin of chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptors and the evolution of insect taste and olfaction.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001064Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These properties suggested that IR8a and IR25a have a conserved and central role in IR function and led us to focus first on these receptors. Double immunofluorescence using IR8a- and IR25a-specific antibodies revealed heterogeneous expression in distinct but partially overlapping populations of neurons in the Drosophila antenna (Figures 1B and 1C). IR25a, but not IR8a, is detected in neurons of the arista, a branched cuticular projection from the antennal surface (Foelix et al., 1989Foelix R.F. Stocker R.F. Steinbrecht R.A. Fine structure of a sensory organ in the arista of Drosophila melanogaster and some other dipterans.Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the sacculus, an internal multichambered pocket (Shanbhag et al., 1995Shanbhag S.R. Singh K. Singh R.N. Fine structure and primary sensory projections of sensilla located in the sacculus of the antenna of Drosophila melanogaster.Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 282: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), IR25a-expressing neurons innervate the first and second chambers, while IR8a is strongly expressed in neurons innervating the third chamber. Throughout the main body of the antenna, many clusters of IR8a- or IR25a-positive neurons are found, corresponding to neurons innervating the coeloconic class of olfactory sensilla (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, Stocker, 2001Stocker R.F.

Tech. 2001; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Yao et al., 2005Yao C.A. Ignell R. Carlson J.R. Chemosensory coding by neurons in the coeloconic sensilla of the Drosophila antenna.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8359-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These clusters contain 2 to 3 neurons and often comprise 1 to 2 cells with stronger IR25a expression and weak or no IR8a expression, and 1 to 2 cells with stronger IR8a expression and weak or no IR25a expression. As previously described for IR25a (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), IR8a is detected in both the cell body and sensory dendritic endings, but not in axon termini, consistent with a role in peripheral odor detection (Figures 1C and 3B; data not shown). To confirm the specificity of these antibodies and initiate functional analysis of these receptors, we generated null mutations in IR8a by the same gene-targeting strategy used for IR25a (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A ). Homozygous IR8a, IR25a, and IR8a/IR25a double mutant animals are viable and fertile, and all corresponding immunoreactivity in the antenna is abolished (Figure 2A). The broad antennal expression and cilia localization of IR8a and IR25a indicated that these receptors might have a widespread role in odor detection in IR neurons. We tested this hypothesis by performing extracellular electrophysiological recordings of odor-evoked neuronal responses in individual coeloconic sensilla in IR8a and IR25a mutants. Four classes of coeloconic sensilla have been defined, named ac1 through ac4 (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, Yao et al., 2005Yao C.A. Ignell R. Carlson J.R. Chemosensory coding by neurons in the coeloconic sensilla of the Drosophila antenna.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8359-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These house neurons that express different combinations of IRs and display distinct odor sensitivities (Figure 2B) (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, Yao et al., 2005Yao C.A. Ignell R. Carlson J.R. Chemosensory coding by neurons in the coeloconic sensilla of the Drosophila antenna.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8359-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), although matching of the specific ligands to receptors has yet to be determined in most cases. We tested a panel of seven odors, representing the best sensilla-specific agonists identified in previous or on-going ligand screens (Yao et al., 2005Yao C.A. Ignell R. Carlson J.R. Chemosensory coding by neurons in the coeloconic sensilla of the Drosophila antenna.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8359-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar; R. Rytz and R. Benton, unpublished data), which we assume are recognized by different IRs. The ac4 sensilla contain three neurons and are stimulated by phenylacetaldehyde and phenylethyl amine (Figure 2B). We observed that IR8a mutant ac4 sensilla lack all responsiveness to phenylacetaldehyde, while phenylethyl amine responses are unchanged (Figures 2B and 2C). Spontaneous activity in IR8a mutant ac4 sensilla (25 ± 4 spikes/s [mean ± SEM]; n = 13) is also markedly reduced compared with the wild-type (82 ± 1 spikes/s; n = 11). These electrophysiological phenotypes resemble those of mutants in IR84a (Y. Grosjean and R.B., unpublished data), suggesting a role for IR8a in acting with this receptor in mediating both basal and evoked responses in IR84a neurons. By contrast, mutation of IR25a had no effect on phenylacetaldehyde responses but abolished phenylethyl amine-evoked activity (Figures 2B and 2C), suggesting an essential function in a different IR neuron. Spontaneous activity in IR25a mutant ac4 sensilla was also reduced (43 ± 6 spikes/s; n = 18). The ac3 sensilla house two neurons, one of which expresses three IRs (IR75a, IR75b, and IR75c) and responds to propionic acid (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, Yao et al., 2005Yao C.A. Ignell R. Carlson J.R. Chemosensory coding by neurons in the coeloconic sensilla of the Drosophila antenna.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8359-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Responses to this ligand are abolished in IR8a, but not IR25a, mutants (Figure 2B). The second neuron is stimulated by many odors, but genetic analysis has ascribed all of these responses to the OR expressed in these cells, OR35a (Yao et al., 2005Yao C.A. Ignell R. Carlson J.R. Chemosensory coding by neurons in the coeloconic sensilla of the Drosophila antenna.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8359-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). OR35a-dependent responses to γ-hexalactone persisted in both IR8a and IR25a mutants (Figures 2B and 2C), indicating independent functioning of this receptor. The ac2 sensilla neurons respond strongly to acetic acid and 1,4-diaminobutane, and these responses are selectively abolished in IR8a and IR25a mutants, respectively (Figures 2B and 2C). Finally, ac1 sensilla contain three IR-expressing neurons, but only one strong agonist, ammonia, has been identified (Yao et al., 2005Yao C.A. Ignell R. Carlson J.R. Chemosensory coding by neurons in the coeloconic sensilla of the Drosophila antenna.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8359-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Responses to this odor were retained in both IR8a and IR25a mutants, as well as in IR8a/IR25a double mutants (Figures 2B and 2C). All defects in odor-evoked responses in IR8a and IR25a mutants were rescued by expression of the corresponding cDNA transgenes using IR8a or IR25a promoters via the GAL4/UAS system (Figures 2B and 2C; see Figure S1 available online) (Brand and Perrimon, 1993Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes.Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sole exception was our failure to restore ac2 1,4-diaminobutane responses in IR25a mutants (data not shown). We ascribe this lack of rescue activity to the poor recapitulation of endogenous IR25a expression by our IR25a-GAL4 line (Figure S1B). Expression of IR25a in IR8a mutant neurons did not rescue electrophysiological responses (data not shown), indicating selective functional properties of these two receptors beyond their distinct expression patterns (Figure 1C). Taken together, the loss of multiple distinct ligand-evoked responses in IR8a and IR25a mutants suggests that these proteins function as coreceptors that act with different subsets of odor-specific IRs. To determine the cellular basis for the loss of electrophysiological responses in these IR coreceptor mutant neurons, we initially focused on the role of IR8a in the correct functioning of the phenylacetaldehyde receptor IR84a (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). An EGFP-tagged version of IR84a localizes to the sensory cilium in its endogenous neurons (Figure 3A), defined by the distal distribution relative to the cilium base marker 21A6 (Husain et al., 2006Husain N. Pellikka M. Hong H. Klimentova T. Choe K.M. Clandinin T.R. Tepass U. The agrin/perlecan-related protein eyes shut is essential for epithelial lumen formation in the Drosophila retina.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Zelhof et al., 2006Zelhof A.C. Hardy R.W. Becker A. Zuker C.S. Transforming the architecture of compound eyes.Nature. 2006; 443: 696-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). By contrast, in IR8a mutants, EGFP:IR84a is restricted to the inner dendritic segment (Figure 3A). Restoration of IR8a expression under the control of the IR84a promoter rescues this localization defect, defining a cell-autonomous function for IR8a in promoting cilia targeting of IR84a (Figure 3A ). We tested the generality of this requirement for IR8a by examining the cilia localization of a second receptor, IR64a, which is coexpressed with IR8a in morphologically distinct grooved peg sensilla in the third chamber of the sacculus (Ai et al., 2010Ai M. Min S. Grosjean Y. Leblanc C. Bell R. Benton R. Suh G.S.B. Acid sensing by the Drosophila olfactory system.Nature. 2010; 468: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). EGFP:IR64a is abundant in the outer dendrite of these neurons in wild-type sensilla, and this localization is abolished in IR8a mutants (Figure S2A). We observed more heterogeneous levels of EGFP:IR64a in IR8a mutant neurons, suggesting that this mislocalized protein is destabilized. Cilia targeting is restored by re-expression of IR8a in this mutant background (Figure S2A). To verify that loss of IRs in the outer dendrite in IR8a mutants was not simply due to a failure in formation of this sensory compartment, we expressed a GFP-tagged tubulin isoform (GFP:α1tub84B) in these neurons, which serves as a robust reporter of the outer segment in ciliated sensory neurons in Drosophila (Avidor-Reiss et al., 2004Avidor-Reiss T. Maer A.M. Koundakjian E. Polyanovsky A. Keil T. Subramaniam S. Zuker C.S. Decoding cilia function: defining specialized genes required for compartmentalized cilia biogenesis.Cell. 2004; 117: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In wild-type and IR8a mutant neurons, GFP:α1tub84B displayed a similar distribution distal to 21A6 in both coeloconic sensilla in the main body of the antenna and grooved peg sensilla in the sacculus (Figures 3B and S2B). Thus, the outer ciliated segment forms correctly in IR8a mutants, supporting a specific role for this receptor in targeting odor-specific IRs to this cellular compartment. We investigated whether there was a reciprocal requirement for IR84a for the localization of IR8a by expressing EGFP:IR8a in IR84a mutant neurons (Figure 3C). The normal cilia distribution of this fusion protein is severely impaired in the absence of IR84a (Figure 3C). Similarly, IR8a cilia localization is abolished in IR64a mutant sacculus neurons (Figure S2C). In both mutant backgrounds, IR8a localization is restored by the expression of corresponding IR rescue transgenes (Figures 3C and S2C). Thus, efficient cilia targeting of IR8a depends upon the presence of an odor-specific partner. Having shown that phenylacetaldehyde responses in ac4 sensilla require two receptors, IR84a and IR8a (Figures 2B and 2C) (Y. Grosjean and R. B., unpublished data), we asked whether these proteins are sufficient for the reconstitution of a functional olfactory receptor in heterologous neurons. We previously showed that ectopic expression of IR84a in ac3 neurons is sufficient to confer responsiveness to phenylacetaldehyde (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S. Gomez-Diaz C. Vosshall L.B. Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 136: 149-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). However, IR8a is also expressed endogenously in these cells (data not shown), raising the possibility that the odor-evoked responses are not due to IR84a alone, but depend on IR84a in combination with IR8a. To resolve this issue, we expressed IR84a in OR22a neurons, which innervate basiconic sensilla and do not express IR8a (Figure 1C). When expressed alone in these neurons, EGFP:IR84a fails to localize to sensory cilia, where OR22a concentrates (Figure 4A ) (Dobritsa et al., 2003Dobritsa A.A. van der Goes van Naters W. Warr C.G. Steinbrecht R.A. Carlson J.R. Integrating the molecular and cellular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Neuron. 2003; 37: 827-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, when EGFP:IR84a is coexpressed with IR8a, the fusion protein is efficiently transported to the ciliated sensory endings (Figure 4A). As in coeloconic sensilla, we observed a reciprocal requirement for IR84a in the cilia localization of IR8a in OR neurons: alone, EGFP:IR8a was absent from sensory cilia, but coexpression of IR84a was sufficient to promote its redistribution to the sensory compartment (Figure 4A). We examined the functionality of these cilia-localized receptors by electrophysiological analysis of phenylacetaldehyde-evoked responses. OR22a neurons expressing EGFP:IR84a or EGFP:IR8a alone do not respond to this odor above basal solvent-evoked activity. By contrast, when coexpressed with their corresponding partner, robust, concentration-dependent responses to phenylacetaldehyde are observed (Figures 4B and 4C). Thus, IR84a and IR8a are together both necessary and sufficient to reconstitute a cilia-localized and physiologically active olfactory receptor in Drosophila neurons. We extended our investigation of the sufficiency of IR84a and IR8a to form a functional receptor by determining their ability to confer phenylacetaldehyde responsiveness in an ex vivo non-neuronal system. We chose Xenopus laevis oocytes, which are commonly used for functional expression of iGluRs (Walker et al., 2006Walker C.S. Brockie P.J. Madsen D.M. Francis M.M. Zheng Y. Koduri S. Mellem J.E. Strutz-Seebohm N. Maricq A.V. Reconstitution of invertebrate glutamate receptor function depends on stargazin-like proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10781-10786Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In these cells, single or combinations of IR complementary RNAs (cRNAs) can be injected, and odor-evoked current responses across the oocyte membrane can be measured by two-electrode voltage clamp. When cRNAs for IR84a or IR8a were injected alone into oocytes, we observed no responses to phenylacetaldehyde (Figures 4D and 4E). By contrast, when IR84a and IR8a cRNAs were coinjected, phenylacetaldehyde induced an inward current of several hundred nA in these cells (Figures 4D and 4E). We further tested the functional properties of a different odor-specific receptor, IR75a, which is expressed in the IR8a-dependent propionic acid-sensitive neuron in ac3 sensilla (Figures 2B and 2C). Oocytes expressing IR75a and IR8a together, but not either receptor alone, exhibited robust propionic acid-evoked current responses (Figures 4D and 4E). Odor-induced current responses were highly specific to each receptor pair and displayed concentration dependency (Figures 4D–4F). The concentration response curves for both phenylacetaldehyde and propionic acid did not saturate at the highest concentrations obtainable without changing the osmolarity of the solution, preventing our determination of 50% effective concentration (EC50) values. Baseline currents measured in the absence of either agonist were similar between IR84a+IR8a-expressing, IR75a+IR8a-expressing, and uninjected oocytes (data not shown), suggesting that these receptors do not have detectable constitutive activity, at least in these cells. The codependency of IR84a and IR8a for cilia localization and odor-evoked responses suggested that these proteins might form a complex. We tested this possibility through optical imaging of fluorescent protein-tagged receptors. We first generated an mCherry-tagged IR8a fusion protein and confirmed that this promotes cilia targeting of EGFP:IR84a in OR22a neurons (Figure 5A ). In these cells, we observed precise colocalization and consistent relative intensities of EGFP and mCherry fluorescence throughout the cell bodies, inner dendrites, and cilia (Figure 5A). Odor-evoked responses conferred on these neurons by the fluorescent protein-tagged IRs were indistinguishable from those generated by untagged receptors (Figure 5B), indicating that the fluorescent tags do not interfere with their function. We next used these tagged IRs in a single molecule optical approach in Xenopus o"
https://openalex.org/W1980798536,"Tinnitus is a common disorder characterized by ringing in the ear in the absence of sound. Converging evidence suggests that tinnitus pathophysiology involves damage to peripheral and/or central auditory pathways. However, whether auditory system dysfunction is sufficient to explain chronic tinnitus is unclear, especially in light of evidence implicating other networks, including the limbic system. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry, we assessed tinnitus-related functional and anatomical anomalies in auditory and limbic networks. Moderate hyperactivity was present in the primary and posterior auditory cortices of tinnitus patients. However, the nucleus accumbens exhibited the greatest degree of hyperactivity, specifically to sounds frequency-matched to patients' tinnitus. Complementary structural differences were identified in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, another limbic structure heavily connected to the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, tinnitus-related anomalies were intercorrelated in the two limbic regions and between limbic and primary auditory areas, indicating the importance of auditory-limbic interactions in tinnitus."
https://openalex.org/W2108260772,"The Hippo pathway restricts the activity of transcriptional co-activators TAZ and YAP by phosphorylating them for cytoplasmic sequestration or degradation. In this report, we describe an independent mechanism for the cell to restrict the activity of TAZ and YAP through interaction with angiomotin (Amot) and angiomotin-like 1 (AmotL1). Amot and AmotL1 were robustly co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged TAZ, and their interaction is dependent on the WW domain of TAZ and the PPXY motif in the N terminus of Amot. Amot and AmotL1 also interact with YAP via the first WW domain of YAP. Overexpression of Amot and AmotL1 caused cytoplasmic retention of TAZ and suppressed its transcriptional outcome such as the expression of CTGF and Cyr61. Hippo refractory TAZ mutant (S89A) is also negatively regulated by Amot and AmotL1. HEK293 cells express the highest level of Amot and AmotL1 among nine cell lines examined, and silencing the expression of endogenous Amot increased the expression of CTGF and Cyr61 either at basal levels or upon overexpression of exogenous S89A. These results reveal a novel mechanism to restrict the activity of TAZ and YAP through physical interaction with Amot and AmotL1."
https://openalex.org/W2052426068,"The late-phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP), the cellular correlate of long-term memory, induced at some synapses facilitates L-LTP expression at other synapses receiving stimulation too weak to induce L-LTP by itself. Using glutamate uncaging and two-photon imaging, we demonstrate that the efficacy of this facilitation decreases with increasing time between stimulations, increasing distance between stimulated spines and with the spines being on different dendritic branches. Paradoxically, stimulated spines compete for L-LTP expression if stimulated too closely together in time. Furthermore, the facilitation is temporally bidirectional but asymmetric. Additionally, L-LTP formation is itself biased toward occurring on spines within a branch. These data support the Clustered Plasticity Hypothesis, which states that such spatial and temporal limits lead to stable engram formation, preferentially at synapses clustered within dendritic branches rather than dispersed throughout the dendritic arbor. Thus, dendritic branches rather than individual synapses are the primary functional units for long-term memory storage."
https://openalex.org/W2095464946,"Mitochondria extrude protons across their inner membrane to generate the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and pH gradient (ΔpHm) that both power ATP synthesis. Mitochondrial uptake and efflux of many ions and metabolites are driven exclusively by ΔpHm, whose in situ regulation is poorly characterized. Here, we report the first dynamic measurements of ΔpHm in living cells, using a mitochondrially targeted, pH-sensitive YFP (SypHer) combined with a cytosolic pH indicator (5-(and 6)-carboxy-SNARF-1). The resting matrix pH (∼7.6) and ΔpHm (∼0.45) of HeLa cells at 37 °C were lower than previously reported. Unexpectedly, mitochondrial pH and ΔpHm decreased during cytosolic Ca2+ elevations. The drop in matrix pH was due to cytosolic acid generated by plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases and transmitted to mitochondria by Pi/H+ symport and K+/H+ exchange, whereas the decrease in ΔpHm reflected the low H+-buffering power of mitochondria (∼5 mm, pH 7.8) compared with the cytosol (∼20 mm, pH 7.4). Upon agonist washout and restoration of cytosolic Ca2+ and pH, mitochondria alkalinized and ΔpHm increased. In permeabilized cells, a decrease in bath pH from 7.4 to 7.2 rapidly decreased mitochondrial pH, whereas the addition of 10 μm Ca2+ caused a delayed and smaller alkalinization. These findings indicate that the mitochondrial matrix pH and ΔpHm are regulated by opposing Ca2+-dependent processes of stimulated mitochondrial respiration and cytosolic acidification.

Mitochondria are mobile intracellular integrators of metabolic and ionic signaling. These multifunctional organelles generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, integrate signaling cascades leading to the release of proapoptotic factors (1Kroemer G. Galluzzi L. Brenner C. Physiol.

Moreover, electrophoretic Ca2+ uptake into the matrix is thought to reduce the electrical resistance for pumping protons out of the matrix (11Talbot J. Barrett J.N. Barrett E.F. David G. J.

Mitochondria are double membrane organelles with an outer membrane permeable to solutes and an inner membrane harboring the respiratory chain complexes. The respiratory chain extrudes protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space to generate a maximal proton-motive force (Δμ̃H+) of ∼220 mV across the inner mitochondrial membrane (12Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The Δμ̃H+ is the sum of the electrical potential across the inner membrane (ΔΨm, negative inside) and the pH gradient between the bulk solutions on either side of the membrane (ΔpHm, alkaline inside). According to Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory, ΔΨm and ΔpHm are thermodynamically equivalent driving forces for the synthesis of ATP by F1F0 ATP-synthase (13Mitchell P. Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 14Nicholls D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, indicate that ATP synthesis by purified F0 complexes reconstituted in liposomes requires a high concentration of protons (pH <6.5) at the source P site of the enzyme (15Wiedenmann A. Dimroth P. von Ballmoos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 16von Ballmoos C. Wiedenmann A. Dimroth P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 649-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Efficient ATP synthesis thus require not only a high driving force for protons but also a low pH within the cristae of mitochondria. These data imply that a ΔpHm of >1 pH unit must be maintained to enable the synthesis of ATP by respiring mitochondria. The mitochondrial pH gradient (ΔpHm) is the sole driving force for the electroneutral transport of many ions and metabolites in and out of the mitochondrial matrix, whereas the activity of several mitochondrial ion exchangers is coupled, directly or indirectly, to the electroneutral movement of protons (17Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). For instance, the mitochondrial Na+ gradient is clamped close to ΔpHm by the electro-neutral mitochondrial 1Na+:1H+ exchanger (mNHE) (reviewed in Ref. 7Demaurex N. Poburko D. Frieden M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The sodium gradient, in turn, drives electrogenic mitochondrial 1Ca+:3Na+ exchange (18Dash R.K. Beard D.A. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 3267-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) by the recently identified protein NCLX (19Palty R. Silverman W.F. Hershfinkel M. Caporale T. Sensi S.L. Parnis J. Nolte C.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) that regulates mitochondrial Ca2+ levels. Electroneutral K+/H+ exchange catalyzed by the protein Letm1 is essential for mitochondrial ionic and volume homeostasis (20Nowikovsky K. Froschauer E.M. Zsurka G. Samaj J. Reipert S. Kolisek M.

The Letm1 protein was recently proposed to be an electrogenic Ca2+/H+ antiporter with a 1:1 stoichiometry (22Jiang D. Zhao L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2009; 326: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), despite earlier studies indicating that Ca2+ enters mitochondria as the fully charged species (23Scarpa A. Azzone G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Rottenberg H. Scarpa A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4811-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Wingrove D.E.

Biochem. 1983; 134: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Regardless of whether Letm1 transports K+ or Ca2+ in exchange for H+, its exchange activity depends on ΔpHm. Finally, ΔpHm also influences the amplitude of [Ca2+]mit elevations in that the mitochondrial Ca2+-buffering power is determined by the mitochondrial phosphate concentration, which is modulated by ΔpHm (27Nicholls D.G. Chalmers S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mitochondria therefore rely on ΔpHm to generate ATP, to move ions and metabolites, and to buffer Ca2+ ions. The regulation of Δμ̃H+ has been extensively studied because it is essential for oxidative phosphorylation. Early approaches to estimate Δμ̃H+ in isolated mitochondria used potassium- and proton-selective electrodes or isotopes to detect changes in the external concentration of these ions in the presence of the K+ ionophore valinomycin to provide a diffusion potential (12Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 28Mitchell P. Moyle J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 471-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed that at low external K+ concentrations, ΔpHm contributes up to 170 mV to the proton-motive force (12Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In physiological conditions, however (i.e. high K+ concentrations and no valinomycin), the situation is reversed, and ΔΨm contributes most of the proton-motive force. These findings were validated by subsequent determinations of ΔΨm in isolated mitochondria and intact cells with fluorescent lipophilic cations (reviewed in Ref. 29Chen L.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Our current knowledge of ΔpHm regulation is largely based on early experiments in isolated mitochondria that employed minimal sucrose buffers and H+/K+ ionophores, such as nigericin (30Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 31Selivanov V.A. Zeak J.A. Roca J. Cascante M. Trucco M. Votyakova T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29292-29300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In intact cells, ΔpHm has been estimated around 1.0–1.2 pH units by isotopic measurements of weak acid or bases (32Hoek J.B. Nicholls D.G. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1458-1464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brand M.D. Felber S.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), thus contributing ∼60 mV to Δμ̃H+. More recent studies using fluorescent indicators yielded ΔpHm values of 0.5–0.9 pH units based on separate static measurements of matrix, cytosolic or inter-membrane space pH in sister cultures of live cells (34Porcelli A.M. Ghelli A. Zanna C. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Rugolo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These studies brought us closer to direct measurement of ΔpHm in live cells but were unable to resolve the dynamic regulation of ΔpHm by factors like Ca2+ uptake, the activity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (35Halestrap A.P. Pasdois P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 1402-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and the presence of uncoupling proteins (36Brand M.D. Esteves T.C. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In this study, we simultaneously measured cytosolic pH using the well characterized dye 5-(and 6)-carboxy-SNARF-1 (SNARF) and matrix pH using a ratiometric circularly permuted YFP. The concurrent measurements of pH in the cytosol (pHcyto) and mitochondrial matrix (pHmito) provided real-time measurement of the cytosol-matrix pH gradient, and thus of ΔpHm, in intact cells. Moreover, this approach enabled us to determine the proton-buffering power of the matrix of intact mitochondria. Unexpectedly, we observed that [Ca2+]cyt elevations were associated with massive cytosolic and matrix pH decreases and consequent decreases in ΔpHm. Minimum essential medium with Glutamax (catalog no. 41090), fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, Lipofectamine 2000, SNARF/AM (C1272), and Fura-2 (F1201) were from Invitrogen. Histamine, 2-APB, orthovanadate, nigericin, monensin, antimycin, oligomycin, and rotenone were from Sigma. Transfast was from Promega. The QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. Mutagenesis primers were from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). HyPer plasmids were from Evrogen (Moscow, Russia). YC3.6cyto and 4mitD3-CPV were kindly provided by Drs. Amy Palmer and Roger Tsien. Culturing of HeLa cells was described previously (37Jousset H. Frieden M. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11456-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For epifluorescence microscopy, cells were plated on 25-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm culture dishes. For high throughput experiments, 5000–8000 cells/well were plated on clear bottom, black-walled 96-well plates (catalog no. 655090, Greiner Bio One). Coverslips were transfected with 2 μg of DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (4 μl) or Transfast (3.5 μl) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells on 96-well plates were treated with 1.1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 and 0.4 μg of DNA in 200 μl of medium/well for 6–24 h and imaged 2 days later. MitoSypHer-expressing HeLa cells were permeabilized on the microscope with a 1-min exposure to digitonin (100 μm) in Ca2+-free intracellular buffer: 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm H2KPO4, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm succinic acid, 1 mm ATP-Mg2+, 0.02 mm ADP-K, 1 mm MgCl2 (1 mm Mg2+-free), 0.5 mm EGTA adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH. After digitonin washout, pH was stepped between 7.4 and 7.2 by turnover of the bath solution. The addition of Ca2+ or drugs was performed by full bath turnover. Total CaCl2 and MgCl2 was 0.327 and 5.5 mm, respectively, at pH 7.4, and 0.326–5.43 mm at pH 7.2 to give ∼10 μm free Ca2+ buffered with 5 mm HEDTA and 1 mm ATP-Mg2+ as calculated with Max Chelator. In their description of HyPer, Belousov et al. (38Belousov V.V. Fradkov A.F. Lukyanov K.A. Staroverov D.B. Shakhbazov K.S. Terskikh A.V. Lukyanov S. Nat.

We mutated the first cysteine in cytosolic and mitochondria-targeted HyPer to make SypHer. Briefly, the C199S mutation was performed with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit as per the manufacturer's instructions using 12 reaction cycles with 5.5 min for elongation in each. Primers were used at 10-fold the suggested concentration, and primers were 5′-agatggtcactctttgcgcgat-3′ (forward) and 5′-atcgcgcaaagagtgaccatct-3′ (reverse), 4Dr. Vsevolod Belousov, personal communication. with underlined nucleotides showing the position of the point mutation. PCRs were transformed into XL1-blue bacteria, and minipreps (Gene Elute, Sigma) were prepared from clonal colonies for sequencing to confirm the C199S mutation and the absence of other mutations. Mutated plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells to confirm their sensitivity of pH and lack of response to H2O2 (200 μm). Experiments were performed in HEPES buffer (HBSS) solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, pH set to 7.4 with NaOH at 37 °C. Ca2+-free solution contained 0.2 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2. Cells grown on glass coverslips were inserted into a thermostatic chamber (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and solutions were changed by hand. Ratiometric pH and Ca2+ images were acquired with a ×40 objective (1.3 numerical aperture, Zeiss Axiovert s100TV) and a cooled CCD camera (MicroMax, Roper Scientific) (37Jousset H. Frieden M. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11456-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For pH imaging, SypHer (cytosolic or mitochondrial) was alternately excited for 200–300 ms at 430 and 480 nm through a 505DCXR dichroic filter and imaged with a 535DF25 band pass filter (Omega Optical). For simultaneous mitochondrial/cytosolic pH measurements, SypHer-expressing cells were loaded with SNARF (5 μm, 0.2% DMSO, 0.01% pluronic F-127, 30 min, ambient temperature) followed by 20 min of de-esterification before 10 min of equilibration on the heated stage. SypHer was imaged as above, and SNARF was excited at 480 nm for 200 ms through the same dichroic filter and imaged with 580DF30 and 640DF35 filters (Omega Optical). Image pairs and quartets were typically acquired every 2–5 s. Fluorescence ratios (F480/430 SypHer, F640/580 SNARF) were calculated in MetaFluor 6.3 (Universal Imaging) and analyzed in Excel (Microsoft) and GraphPad Prism 5.01 (GraphPad). After each experiment, cytosolic and mitochondrial pH was calibrated using nigericin (5 μg/ml) and monensin (5 μm) in 125 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 20 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine (pH 9.5–10.0), Tris (pH 8.0, 9.0), HEPES (pH 7.0–7.5), or MES (pH 5.5–6.5). For each cell, a 6-point calibration curve was fitted to a variable slope sigmoid equation with 1/y weighting and constraining the top of the curve to 30 (GraphPad Prism 5.01). Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured with fura-2 (2 μm) or YC3.6 (39Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial Ca2+ with 4mitD3-CPV on the epifluorescence system described above. Fura-2 was excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm (200–300 ms/λ) through a 430DCLP dichroic filter and 510WB40 emission filter when recording only Fura-2 or through a 505DCXR dichroic filter and 535DF25 filter when measured simultaneously with SypHer. Cameleons were excited at 430 nm through a 455DRLP dichroic filter and alternately imaged with 475DF15 and 535DF25 emission filters (200–400 ms/λ, Omega Optical). Whole cells were lysed in a glass homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the protein content of the supernatant was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). The mitochondrial fraction was obtained by differential centrifugation as reported previously (40De Marchi U. Campello S. Szabò I. Tombola F. Martinou J.C. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37415-37422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total protein (from cytosolic or mitochondrial fraction) was loaded per lane of SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the following antibodies: anti-GFP (sc-9996) and anti-Tom20 (sc-11415) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-α-tubulin (T9026) (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used, followed by detection by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). 48 h after transfection cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldhyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and incubated in blocking buffer IgG (2 μg/ml) for 1 h. Fixed cells were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-Tom20 (1:100) for 10 h at 6 °C and labeled with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) from Sigma for 1 h at room temperature. Confocal images were acquired on a Leica SP5 2 photon microscope using a ×63 oil immersion objective. MitoSypHer was excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence emitted between 510 and 540 nm was collected. Alexa Fluor 568 was excited at 561 nm, and fluorescence emitted between 600 and 630 nm was collected. The confocal pinhole was 154 μm (1 airy disk) for SypHer and 204 μm (1.25 airy disk) for Tom20. Confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM510meta, using a ×63 Achroplan water immersion objective (numerical aperture 0.95) and 12-bit acquisition mode with zoom set to give 130-nm pixels. For mitoSypHer/MitoTracker dual labeling, 2 days after mitoSypHer transfection, cells were incubated with 25 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos for 45 min at 37 °C in normal culture medium. Medium was replaced with HBSS (ambient temperature) immediately before image acquisition. Images were acquired with simultaneous 488/561 nm excitation with sequential 490- and 565-nm dichroic filters and 505–550 nm bandpass emission (SypHer) and 575 nm longpass (MitoTracker Red CMXRos). Cytosolic and mitochondrial H+-buffering powers (β) were calculated by measuring pH changes in cells exposed to permeant weak acid (butyric acid; pKa = 4.82) or weak base (trimethylamine (TMA); pKa = 9.80) and estimating the change in internal acid/base concentration as described previously (41Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). Some investigators assume that weak acids (bases) fully deprotonate (protonate) at physiological pH to simplify calculations. We found that this assumption systematically overestimated the calculated changes in weak acid and base, so we relied on exact calculation by the Henderson-Hasselbach equation. To ensure that we measured intrinsic cytosolic and matrix-buffering power, the Na+/H+ exchanger was inhibited with amiloride (100 μm), and the respiratory chain was inhibited with rotenone (5 μm), antimycin (5 μm), and oligomycin (5 μg/ml). The concentration of TMA in compartment j (cytosol or mitochondria) was estimated by Equation 1, [TMAH+]j=[TMAH++TMA]k1+10(pKa−pHj)×10(pKa−pHj)(Eq. 1) where compartment k (extracellular space or cytosol) is the compartment immediately external to j, and pKaTMA is assumed to be equal in all compartments. For butyric acid, the same equation is used, but (pHj − pKa) replaces (pKa − pHj). Subsequently, β is calculated by Equation 2, βj=Δ[TMAH+]j/ΔpHj(Eq. 2) where Δ[TMAH+]j = [TMAH+]j,final − [TMAH+]j,initial, calculated before and after a change in [TMA]bath, and ΔpHj is measured as the midpoint pH between changes in [TMA]bath. Simultaneous measurements of pHcyto and pHmito permitted βmito to be calculated from Equation 1, where the cytosol is compartment k. Separate halves of a 96-well plate were transfected with SypHer and mitoSypHer. 48 h later, culture medium was replaced with HBSS, and the plate was placed in an ImageXpress Micro plate-reading microscope system (Universal Imaging, Sunnyvale, CA) (humidified, 37 °C). Using laser-assisted autofocusing and automated image acquisition (20× objective, 0.5 numerical aperture), ratio images (F480: ex1 470/45 nm, 500 dichroic1, em1 520/40; F430: ex2 435/25 nm, 465 nm dichroic2, em2 480/35 nm) were acquired over the same grid pattern in each well (4–12 sites/well) with a 12-bit CCD camera. For histamine stimulations, 100 μl of 2× concentrated histamine was added to 100 μl of HBSS in each well with a multichannel pipette, and recording was started within 1 min of the addition. On each plate, SypHer and mitoSypHer ratios were calibrated such that intracellular pH for one well for each probe was clamped at 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 (supplemental Fig. S3A). We created automated algorithms (MetaXpress, Universal Imaging) to define regions around cells in F480 images, to calculate background fluorescence and subtract it from the average F80 and F430 fluorescence intensity in each defined cell region. Single-cell fluorescence values (50–400 per well) were transferred to Excel for sorting and calibration of ratio values. For each well, cells with ratio values greater than two S.D. from the mean value were excluded, and individual ratio values were calibrated against a standard curve generated on each plate. While testing the properties of HyPer, a commercial H2O2-sensing probe based on a circularly permuted YFP (38Belousov V.V. Fradkov A.F. Lukyanov K.A. Staroverov D.B. Shakhbazov K.S. Terskikh A.V. Lukyanov S. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), we observed that HyPer exhibited ratiometric responses to NH4+-induced (30 mm) matrix alkalinization of similar amplitude to its responses to H2O2 (200 μm) (Fig. 1A, top). We reasoned that HyPer could provide the basis for a ratiometric pH sensor with excellent mitochondrial targeting and brightness. We generated a pH-specific version of HyPer that we dubbed SypHer (synthetic pH sensor) by mutating one of the two H2O2-sensing cysteine residues (C199S) of HyPer, as described by Belousov et al. (38Belousov V.V. Fradkov A.F. Lukyanov K.A. Staroverov D.B. Shakhbazov K.S. Terskikh A.V. Lukyanov S. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). As expected, cells expressing cytosolic SypHer still exhibited large fluorescence changes upon the addition of NH4+ but failed to respond to H2O2 (Fig 1A, bottom). We then characterized the properties of the SypHer probe in vitro, using protein extracts from HeLa cells expressing cytosolic SypHer. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, the fluorescence intensity increased markedly with pH at excitation wavelength exceeding 435 nm, with a peak around 490 nm. The 490/420 fluorescence ratio was not altered by the addition of millimolar concentrations of Ca2+, PO4−, and H2O2 (Table 1) but increased by ∼5-fold when the bath pH was increased from 7.0 to 8.0 (supplemental Fig. S1B). MitoSypHer was efficiently targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by tandem mitochondrial localization sequences, as demonstrated by its colocalization with the mitochondrial resident protein TOM20 and with MitoTracker (Fig. 1B, Pearson coefficients 0.88 ± 0.03 and 0.91 ± 0.06, n = 4 and 5 cells, respectively) and enriched reactivity for an anti-GFP antibody in mitochondrial fractions (supplemental Fig. S2A). Mitochondria-targeted SypHer (mitoSypHer) had spectral properties similar to its parental probe (Fig. 1C) and displayed opposite changes in fluorescence at λex = 420 and λex = 490 when the pH of the organelle was varied with H+ ionophores (supplemental Fig. S2B). Using an automated microscope to image cells on 96-well plates, equilibration of the extracellular and organellar pH with H+ ionophores confirmed that the mitoSypHer ratio reported variations in local pH and that resting pHmito in most cells was between 7.5 and 8.0 (supplemental Fig. S3A). pH titration curves generated from different wells of the 96-well plate clamped at specific pH values and with cells expressing cytosolic or mitochondria-targeted SypHer closely overlapped (supplemental Fig. S3B), demonstrating that the pH responses of SypHer were not altered by the matrix environment and that the calibration protocol equilibrated both compartments. In situ calibration of mitoSypHer ratio against pH showed a pKa of 8.71 ± 0.05 and a Hill slope of 0.96 ± 0.05 (Fig. 1D) with an impressive 20-fold increase in ratio when pH increased from 7 to 10. The ratio increased 4-fold in the more physiological pH range of 7–8, (Fig. 1D, inset), permitting accurate measurements of pHmito. Having validated the probe, we next measured resting pHmito on the standard epifluorescence microscope, generating an autonomous calibration curve for each cell imaged. To our surprise, resting pHmito (7.61 ± 0.02, minimum 7.26, maximum 7.91, 79 cells; Fig. 1E) was notably lower than the values of 7.8–8.1 previously reported in intact cells (42Abad M.F.

Both receptors are expressed in the CNS, but how they cooperate during migration has not been elucidated. Here, we used the migration of cortical interneurons as a model to study this process. We found that Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 are coexpressed in migrating interneurons, and that Cxcr7 is essential for chemokine signaling. Intriguingly, this process does not exclusively involve Cxcr7, but most critically the modulation of Cxcr4 function. Thus, Cxcr7 is necessary to regulate Cxcr4 protein levels, thereby adapting chemokine responsiveness in migrating cells. This demonstrates that a chemokine receptor modulates the function of another chemokine receptor by controlling the amount of protein that is made available for signaling at the cell surface.

Several chemokines and their receptors are expressed in the developing CNS, among which Cxcl12 (also known as Stromal cell-derived factor-1, SDF1) is the most studied. Cxcl12 has been shown to promote the migration of granule cells in the cerebellum and hippocampus (Bagri et al., 2002Bagri A. Gurney T. He X. Zou Y.R. Littman D.R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Pleasure S.J.

The best characterized receptor for Cxcl12 is a member of the family of alpha-chemokine receptors, Cxcr4 (Bleul et al., 1996Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J.

Initially identified as a coreceptor for the human immunodeficiency virus, this G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is an essential mediator of the chemotactic responses induced by Cxcl12 in migrating cells. In the brain, loss of Cxcr4 function leads to neuronal defects that are remarkably similar to those found in Cxcl12 mutants (Stumm et al., 2003Stumm R.K. Zhou C. Ara T. Lazarini F. Dubois-Dalcq M.

These results, along with similar observations in other tissues, led to the notion that Cxcr4 was the only physiological receptor for Cxcl12. This view was challenged with the discovery that the orphan receptor RDC1, now designated as Cxcr7, is also able to bind Cxcl12 (Balabanian et al., 2005aBalabanian K. Lagane B. Infantino S. Chow K.Y.

The function of Cxcr7 in cell migration is under intense debate, as it seems to differ depending on the cellular context (Boldajipour et al., 2008Boldajipour B. Mahabaleshwar H. Kardash E.

Thus, while some reports have suggested that Cxcl12 binding to Cxcr7 may induce cell chemotaxis and activate the characteristic intracellular responses triggered by GPCRs (Balabanian et al., 2005aBalabanian K. Lagane B. Infantino S. Chow K.Y. Harriague J. Moepps B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thelen M. Bachelerie F.

Moreover, recent work in zebrafish suggests that while Cxcr4 is expressed by migrating cells, Cxcr7 may function primarily by removing Cxcl12 from nontarget territories (Boldajipour et al., 2008Boldajipour B.

Biol. 2008; 320: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, migrating cells continue to respond to Cxcl12 in the absence of Cxcr7, but end up in undesirable locations because accumulations of Cxcl12 prevent directional migration (Boldajipour et al., 2008Boldajipour B. Mahabaleshwar H. Kardash E. Reichman-Fried M. Blaser H. Minina S. Wilson D. Xu Q. Raz E.

Thus, the most plausible biological function for Cxcr7 reported so far is the regulation of chemokine gradients through a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. The tangential migration of cortical interneurons has been previously used as a model to study the function of chemokines and their receptors in regulating neuronal migration (Li et al., 2008Li G.

Here we have investigated the function of the chemokine receptor Cxcr7 in neuronal migration by using cortical interneurons as a model system. We found that Cxcr7 is transiently expressed by cells of the cortex that are located in regions typically avoided by tangentially migrating interneurons, which is consistent with the previously suggested function of Cxcr7 as a scavenger receptor. However, we also found that most MGE-derived interneurons coexpress both Cxcl12 receptors, indicating that Cxcr7 may also regulate chemokine responsiveness in migrating neurons. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that conditional deletion of Cxcr7 exclusively from migrating interneurons renders then insensitive to Cxcl12, which causes important defects in their migration. These alterations are caused by the loss of Cxcr4 protein in migrating neurons, which is degraded when migrating cells confront Cxcl12 in the absence of Cxcr7. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Cxcr7 modulates chemokine responsiveness in migrating neurons by regulating the levels of Cxcr4 receptors that are available to bind Cxcl12, and that loss of Cxcr7 function results de facto in the generation of neurons that are functionally deficient for both chemokine receptors. Previous studies have shown that numerous cells in the embryonic rat cortex express Cxcr7 (Schonemeier et al., 2008Schonemeier B. Kolodziej A. Schulz S. Jacobs S. Hoellt V. Stumm R. Regional and cellular localization of the CXCl12/SDF-1 chemokine receptor CXCR7 in the developing and adult rat brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 510: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In particular, Cxcr7 was found to be very abundant in neurons forming the CP during initial stages of corticogenesis. To verify that this expression pattern is conserved in mice, we analyzed the distribution of Cxcr7 mRNA at different stages of mouse cortical development. Comparison of the expression patterns of Cxcr7 and NeuroD2, a transcription factor that is strongly expressed in the developing CP, revealed that many cells in this region also express Cxcr7 at embryonic day (E) 13.5 (Figures 1A, 1B, 1D, and 1E ). Detailed analysis of adjacent sections using sensitive radioactive probes confirmed that Cxcr7 transcripts are very abundant in the early CP, from where Cxcr4-expressing cells are largely absent at this stage (Figures 1J–1M). Interestingly, we observed that the expression of Cxcr7 in the CP is very transient, because Cxcr7 is virtually excluded from the CP already at E15.5 (Figures 1C and 1F). We also noticed that many cells outside the CP also express Cxcr7 as early as E13.5 (Figures 1B, 1C, and 1K). Indeed, comparison of the distribution of cells expressing Cxcr7 and Lhx6, a gene encoding for a transcription factor that is exclusively found in neurons derived from the MGE (Lavdas et al., 1999Lavdas A.A. Grigoriou M. Pachnis V. Parnavelas J.G. The medial ganglionic eminence gives rise to a population of early neurons in the developing cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7881-7888PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that this chemokine receptor may also be expressed by tangentially migrating interneurons (Figures 1A–1C and 1G–1I) (Schonemeier et al., 2008Schonemeier B. Kolodziej A. Schulz S. Jacobs S. Hoellt V. Stumm R. Regional and cellular localization of the CXCl12/SDF-1 chemokine receptor CXCR7 in the developing and adult rat brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 510: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, analysis of transgenic mice in which the gene encoding for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under the control of the Cxcr7 promoter (Cxcr7-EGFP) revealed the existence of many cells with the morphology of tangentially migrating interneurons in the developing cortex (Figures 2A and 2A ′). To quantify the expression of chemokine receptors in cortical interneurons, we cultured MGE explants obtained from Lhx6-Cre;Rosa-EYFP embryos on glass coverslips and stained migrating cells with antibodies against Cxcr4 and Cxcr7. We found that the large majority of MGE-derived interneurons express Cxcr4 (97.5% ± 1.0%, n = 879 cells; Figures 2B–2B″) and Cxcr7 (virtually all cells, n = 650 cells; Figures 2C–2C″). In summary, our analysis revealed that Cxcr7 is expressed in at least two populations of cortical neurons: one seems to correspond to pyramidal cells in the early CP, while the other consists of tangentially migrating interneurons that also contain Cxcr4 receptors. While the expression of Cxcr7 in the early CP is consistent with the previously reported function of this receptor as a “scavenger” removing Cxcl12 from undesirable locations (Boldajipour et al., 2008Boldajipour B. Mahabaleshwar H. Kardash E. Reichman-Fried M. Blaser H. Minina S. Wilson D. Xu Q. Raz E. Control of chemokine-guided cell migration by ligand sequestration.Cell. 2008; 132: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), coexpression of Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 in migrating interneurons suggests that the function of this latter receptor in neuronal migration might be more complex than previously anticipated. To study the function of Cxcr7 in the migration of cortical interneurons, we first generated Cxcr7-deficient mice using a conditional approach (Sierro et al., 2007Sierro F. Biben C. Martinez-Munoz L. Mellado M. Ransohoff R.M. Li M. Woehl B. Leung H. Groom J. Batten M. et al.Disrupted cardiac development but normal hematopoiesis in mice deficient in the second CXCL12/SDF-1 receptor, CXCR7.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 14759-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In brief, Cxcr7lox/+ mice were crossed to CMV-Cre transgenic mice (Schwenk et al., 1995Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K. A cre-transgenic mouse strain for the ubiquitous deletion of loxP-flanked gene segments including deletion in germ cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) to produce germ-line deletion of Cxcr7. We then examined the distribution of MGE-derived cortical interneurons as identified by the expression of Lhx6. We found no significant differences in the routes of migration followed by Lhx6-expressing interneurons from the subpallium to the cortex in E16.5 control and Cxcr7 null embryos (data not shown). However, analysis of the distribution of migrating cells within the cortex revealed important differences between both genotypes. Compared with controls, we found that many Lhx6-expressing interneurons deviate from their normal routes of migration within the MZ and SVZ and accumulate within the CP of Cxcr7 null mutants (Figures 3A–3C ). Thus, complete loss of Cxcr7 leads to abnormal intracortical migration of interneurons and premature invasion of the CP. The previous analysis revealed that Cxcr7 function is required for the migration of cortical interneurons. The abnormal distribution of migrating interneurons in the developing cortex, which greatly resembled that previously reported for Cxcr4 mutants (Li et al., 2008Li G. Adesnik H. Li J. Long J. Nicoll R.A. Rubenstein J.L.R. Pleasure S.J. Regional distribution of cortical interneurons and development of inhibitory tone are regulated by Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signaling.J.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13273-13278Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), could be caused by the loss of Cxcr7 in the early CP, migrating interneurons, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated conditional mutants in which Cxcr7 was specifically removed from cortical interneurons. To this end, we crossed Cxcr7lox/+ mice with Dlx5/6-Cre-IRES-Gfp transgenic mice, in which Cre recombinase is expressed by most forebrain GABAergic neurons (Stenman et al., 2003Stenman J. Toresson H. Campbell K. Identification of two distinct progenitor populations in the lateral ganglionic eminence: implications for striatal and olfactory bulb neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar). Compared to control embryos (Dlx5/6-Cre-IRES-Gfp;Cxcr7lox/+ or Dlx5/6-Cre-IRES-Gfp;Cxcr7+/+) analysis of interneuron-specific Cxcr7 mutants (Dlx5/6-Cre-IRES-Gfp;Cxcr7lox/lox, termed here IN-Cxcr7 for brevity) revealed no significant differences in the number of interneurons that reach the embryonic cortex (control: 2563.4 ± 199.0 cells/mm2, n = 4; IN-Cxcr7: 2368.4 ± 179.4 cells/mm2, n = 6). However, we observed that many migrating interneurons fail to maintain their normal routes of migration through the MZ and SVZ in the absence of Cxcr7 function (Figures 4A, 4B, 4E–4G , and S1, available online). Instead, many interneurons were found to be abnormally located within the CP (Figures 4A, 4B, 4E–4G, and S1). In contrast to Cxcr7 null mutant mice, which die soon after birth, IN-Cxcr7 mutants survive into adulthood. This allowed us to study the postnatal consequences of the abnormal intracortical migration of embryonic interneurons. We found that the density of wild-type and mutant interneurons, identified in both cases by the expression of GFP from the Dlx5/6-Cre-IRES-Gfp transgene, was comparable in the motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices of control and IN-Cxcr7 mutant mice at P21 (Figure 4H). However, we observed that the relative density of GFP-expressing interneurons within infragranular and supragranular layers of the somatosensory cortex was significantly different between control and IN-Cxcr7 mutant mice. Specifically, interneurons were abnormally abundant in infragranular layers of IN-Cxcr7 mutant mice compared with controls, whereas the reverse was found for supragranular layers (Figures 4C, 4D, and 4I). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed the distribution of cells expressing Parvalbumin, which identifies the largest population of MGE-derived cortical interneurons (Figure 4J). Thus, Cxcr7 function in interneurons is required for their normal distribution in the adult cortex. The previous experiments indicated that, independently of its possible function in the CP, Cxcr7 is indispensable in cortical interneurons for their correct intracortical migration and final distribution. This suggests that Cxcr7 receptors might be required within cortical interneurons to respond to Cxcl12. To test this hypothesis, we cocultured E13.5 MGE explants obtained from control and IN-Cxcr7 mutant embryos with aggregates of COS cells transfected with Cxcl12 (Figure 5A ). As described before (López-Bendito et al., 2008López-Bendito G. Sánchez-Alcaniz J.A. Pla R. Borrell V. Pico E. Valdeolmillos M. Marín O.

No information is yet available on CXCR7, a newly defined CXCL12 receptor. Here we demonstrated that CXCR7 regulated interneuron migration autonomously, as well as nonautonomously through its expression in immature projection neurons. Migrating cortical interneurons coexpressed Cxcr4 and Cxcr7, and Cxcr7–/– and Cxcr4–/– mutants had similar defects in interneuron positioning. Ectopic CXCL12 expression and pharmacological blockade of CXCR4 in Cxcr7–/– mutants showed that both receptors were essential for responding to CXCL12 during interneuron migration. Furthermore, live imaging revealed that Cxcr4–/– and Cxcr7–/– mutants had opposite defects in interneuron motility and leading process morphology. In vivo inhibition of Gα(i/o) signaling in migrating interneurons phenocopied the interneuron lamination defects of Cxcr4–/– mutants. On the other hand, CXCL12 stimulation of CXCR7, but not CXCR4, promoted MAP kinase signaling.

The specification, differentiation, and migration of these cells are regulated by multiple transcription factors, including the Dlx1,2,5,6 and Lhx6 homeobox genes.

Furthermore, these receptors are also positively regulated by the Lhx6 transcription factor (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao Y. Flandin P. Long J.E. Cuesta M.D. Westphal H. Rubenstein J.L.

CXCR4 and CXCR7 are seven-transmembrane receptors that bind CXCL12, a chemokine also known as Stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1) (Balabanian et al., 2005Balabanian K. Lagane B. Infantino S. Chow K.Y.

CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 triggers Gαi protein-dependent signaling, whereas CXCl12 binding to CXCR7 does not activate Gαi signaling (Levoye et al., 2009Levoye A. Balabanian K. Baleux F. Bachelerie F.

USA. 2007; 104: 14759-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many lines of evidence indicate that CXCR7 has an important role in regulating cell signaling in culture and in vivo. In developing zebrafish, CXCR4 and CXCR7 are both implicated in regulating migration of primordial germ cells (PMGs) and the posterior lateral line primordium, in part through their differential expression patterns (Boldajipour et al., 2008Boldajipour B.

Biol. 2007; 17: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For instance, while CXCR4 is expressed in the germ cells, CXCR7 is expressed in adjacent cells. It has been proposed that CXCR7 functions as a “decoy” receptor to generate a gradient of CXCL12, through ligand sequestration; the CXCL12 gradient would impact CXCR4 signaling through controling ligand availability (Boldajipour et al., 2008Boldajipour B.

Another mode for CXCR7 function has been proposed based on experiments in which transiently transfected cells ectopically express both CXCR4 and CXCR7 (Levoye et al., 2009Levoye A. Balabanian K. Baleux F. Bachelerie F. Lagane B. CXCR7 heterodimerizes with CXCR4 and regulates CXCL12-mediated G protein signaling.Blood. 2009; 113: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, Sierro et al., 2007Sierro F. Biben C.

USA. 2007; 104: 14759-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These studies showed that CXCR7 forms heterodimers with CXCR4. In this context, CXCR7 dampened CXCR4 signaling. More recently, transient transfection studies have provided evidence that CXCR7 is a signaling receptor. Unlike traditional seven-transmembrane receptors, which signal through both G proteins and β-arrestin, CXCR7 may only signal through β-arrestin (Rajagopal et al., 2010Rajagopal S. Kim J. Ahn S. Craig S. Lam C.M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Lefkowitz R.J. Beta-arrestin- but not G protein-mediated signaling by the “decoy” receptor CXCR7.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). β-arrestin activation then leads to stimulation of the MAP kinase casade (Rajagopal et al., 2010Rajagopal S. Kim J. Ahn S.

USA. 2007; 104: 14759-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Here, using both constitutive and conditional null mouse mutants, we report that Cxcr7 is essential for the migratory properties of mouse cortical interneurons. We demonstrated that Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 were coexpressed in migrating cortical interneurons. Each receptor was essential for interneuron migration based on several lines of evidence. First, Cxcr7–/– and Cxcr4–/– null mutants had remarkably similar histological phenotypes. Second, ectopic expression of CXCL12 in the developing cortex, which ordinarily attracts interneurons, did not cause interneuron accumulation in either the Cxcr7–/– or the Cxcr4–/– mutant. Third, pharmacological blockade of CXCR4 in Cxcr7–/– null mutants did not augment their lamination phenotype. Despite their similar phenotypes on static histological preparations, live imaging revealed that migratory Cxcr7–/– and Cxcr4–/– interneurons had opposite abnormalities in interneuron motility and leading process morphology. Finally, we demonstrated that in vivo inhibition of G(i/o) signaling in differentiating interneurons recapitulated the interneuron positioning defects observed in the cortical plate of CXCR4 mutants. Using primary MGE cultures, we also demonstrated that CXCR7 but not CXCR4 promotes MAP kinase signaling in vitro. Cxcr7 mRNA is expressed in the prenatal subpallium and pallium (Long et al., 2009aLong J.E. Cobos I. Potter G.B. Rubenstein J.L. Dlx1 and Mash1 transcription factors control MGE and CGE patterning and differentiation through parallel and overlapping pathways.Cereb. Cortex. 2009; 19: i96-i106Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, Long et al., 2009bLong J.E. Swan C. Liang W.S. Cobos I. Potter G.B. Rubenstein J.L. Dlx1&2 and Mash1 transcription factors control striatal patterning and differentiation through parallel and overlapping pathways.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 512: 556-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the subpallium, Cxcr7 was primarily expressed in progenitor domains of the septum, LGE, MGE, and CGE between E12.5 and E15.5 (Figures 1A–1E and Figures S1A–S1J available online); this expression weakened at E18.5 (Figures S1K–S1O). In the prenatal pallium, Cxcr7 expression strongly labeled the marginal zone (MZ) and subventricular zone/intermediate zone (SVZ/IZ). There were also scattered Cxcr7-expressing cells throughout all layers of the cortical plate (CP) (Figures 1A–1E). To identify the molecular features of Cxcr7-expressing cells, we used Cxcr7-GFP and Lhx6-GFP transgenic mouse lines. The expression pattern of Cxcr7-GFP recapitulated that of Cxcr7 mRNA in both the ventral and dorsal parts of telencephalon at E15.5 (Figures 1F and 1G and Figures S1P–S1T). We performed double labeling of GFP+ cells by using GFP immunohistochemical staining in conjunction with fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization for Cxcl12, Reelin, Cxcr7, Cxcr4, Lhx6, and Dlx1. None of the Cxcr7-GFP+ cells coexpressed their ligand, Cxcl12 (Figure 1H), and ∼5% of the Cxcr7-GFP+ cells coexpressed Reelin (Figure 1I). Furthermore, the vast majority of Cxcr7-GFP+ cells in the MZ and SVZ coexpressed Cxcr7, Cxcr4, Lhx6, and Dlx1 (Figures 1J–1R). Next, we investigated whether Cxcr4 and Cxc7 were expressed in MGE-derived Lhx6-GFP+ cells by performing GFP immunohistochemical staining with fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization for Cxcr7 and Cxcr4. We found that 70%–80% of Lhx6-GFP+ cells in the MZ and SVZ expressed Cxcr4 or Cxcr7 (Figures 1S–1Y). Taken together, these results indicate that Cxcr7-expressing cells in the MZ and SVZ of prenatal pallium are primarily immature interneurons that coexpress Cxcr4 and Cxcr7. Furthermore, almost identical percentages of Lhx6-GFP+ interneurons express either Cxcr4 or Cxcr7. To analyze Cxcr7 function, we generated conditional null mutants in which exon 2 was flanked by LoxP sites; the entire coding region is included within exon 2 (Cxcr7flox allele). By breeding these mice to deleter transgenic mice and then out-crossing to wild-type B6 mice, we established a stably transmitting mouse line with deletion of Cxcr7 exon 2 (Figures 2A–2C ). To examine the cellular localization of CXCR7, we performed CXCR7 antibody staining on the E13.5 MGE cells after 2 DIV. While Cxcr7−/− mutants showed no staining (Figure 2E), wild-type cells showed robust CXCR7 expression that appeared as intracellular aggregates in the close proximity to the nucleus (Figure 2D). The majority of Lhx6-GFP+ MGE cells expressed CXCR7 protein (Figure 2F), consistent with our fluorescent in situ hybridization results (Figure 1Y). We began our analysis with the constitutive null Cxcr7−/− mutants. To examine whether a loss of Cxcr7 function affected interneuron migration, we assessed expression of Lhx6-GFP+ cells by immunohistochemical staining. Lhx6-GFP is expressed in interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (Cobos et al., 2007Cobos I. Borello U. Rubenstein J.L. Dlx transcription factors promote migration through repression of axon and dendrite growth.Neuron. 2007; 54: 873-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We followed the progression of phenotype over different developmental stages. At E13.5, in Cxcr7+/+ brains, Lhx6-GFP+ cells formed the MZ and SVZ migratory streams; most SVZ cells had elongated processes pointing toward the dorsal cortex (Figure 2G). In contrast, Lhx6-GFP+ cells in the Cxcr7−/− cortex did not advance as far dorsally (dotted line in Figure 2H). Furthermore, mutant cells in the MZ and SVZ appeared to be intermingled, and their processes were less polarized along the dorsal (tangential) dimension (Figure 2H). In the E14.5 Cxcr7+/+ cortex, Lhx6-GFP+ cells were mainly found in the MZ and SVZ/IZ (Figure 2I), whereas in the Cxcr7−/− cortex, there were fewer Lhx6-GFP+ cells in the MZ and SVZ and more cells in the cortical plate (Figure 2J). At stages of E16.5 and E18.5, the mutants showed further depletion of Lhx6-GFP+ cells in the cortical MZ and SVZ, and the Lhx6-GFP+ cells continued to accumulate in the CP (Figures 2L, 2N, 2P, and 2R). The remaining Lhx6-GFP+ cells in the SVZ were chaotically oriented and displayed rudimentary processes (Figures 2N and 2R). The distribution of interneurons expressing Lhx6 and Dlx1 RNA showed the same phenotype as the Lhx6-GFP+ cells in Cxcr7−/− mutants (Figure S2). Because Lhx6-GFP+ cells represent MGE-derived interneurons, but not interneurons derived from the dorsal CGE (dCGE; Zhao et al., 2008Zhao Y. Flandin P. Long J.E. Cuesta M.D. Westphal H. Rubenstein J.L. Distinct molecular pathways for development of telencephalic interneuron subtypes revealed through analysis of Lhx6 mutants.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 510: 79-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the Cxcr7 mutation affected Lhx6-GFP− migrating interneurons by using double immunofluorescence labeling with anti-DLX2 and anti-GFP antibodies. In the E14.5 control cortex, ∼55.5% of DLX2+ cells expressed Lhx6-GFP whereas ∼99% of Lhx6-GFP+ cells expressed DLX2 (Figures 2S and 2T). Therefore, DLX2+/Lhx6-GFP+ cells (yellow) represented MGE-derived interneurons, whereas DLX2+/Lhx6-GFP− cells (red) represented dCGE-derived interneurons (Figure 2U). TBR1 antibody staining was used to mark developing cortical projection neurons. We analyzed the number of DLX2+/Lhx6-GFP+ cells and DLX2+/Lhx6-GFP− cells within each layer at E14.5 and E18.5. In Cxcr7−/− mutants at E14.5, Lhx6-GFP+ cells were reduced in the MZ and SVZ and accumulated in the CP; in contrast, Lhx6-GFP− cells had a normal distribution (Figures 2V–2W and 2Z). In Cxcr7−/− mutants at E18.5, both Lhx6-GFP+ and Lhx6-GFP− cells displayed lamination defects in the MZ and SVZ and in the CP (Figures 2X–2Y and 2Z). Therefore, our data indicated that the Cxcr7 mutation preferentially affected Lhx6-GFP+ interneurons at early stages, whereas it affected both Lhx6-GFP+ and Lhx6-GFP− interneurons at later stages. Next, we asked whether Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 mutations affected interneuron migration in the same manner. We first studied Lhx6 mRNA expression in Cxcr4−/− and Cxcr7−/− mutants at E15.5 and quantified the total number of Lhx6+ cells in the lateral neocortex (Figures 3A–3C and 3A ′–3C′). We found that both Cxcr7–/– and Cxcr4−/− mutants had ∼25% fewer Lhx6+ cells in lateral neocortex as compared to controls (Figure 3D). Next, we compared the laminar distribution of Lhx6+ cells in both mutants and we found that they had very similar defects: reduced numbers of Lhx6+ cells in the MZ and SVZ, and an increase in the number of Lhx6+ cells in the CP, especially in the lower CP (Figures 3A″–3C″ and 3E). Thus, both Cxcr7 and Cxcr4 had similar functions in maintaining interneurons within the MZ and SVZ migratory streams and in controlling the timing for interneuron invasion into the cortical plate. While Cxcr4−/− and Cxcr7−/− mutants share very similar interneuron laminar positioning phenotypes in the cortical plate, these deficits may arise from distinct alterations in migration dynamics. To further explore the migration behaviors of Cxcr4−/− and Cxcr7−/− interneurons in vivo, we performed real-time imaging of Lhx6-GFP+ cortices from control (Cxcr4+/− or Cxcr7+/−), Cxcr4−/−, and Cxcr7−/− embryos at E15.5. We first examined the transition from tangential to radial migration as interneurons migrated from either the MZ or the SVZ into the CP. In the MZ, Cxcr4−/− and Cxcr7−/− mutants demonstrated a 3-fold and 2.4-fold increase in the number of Lhx6-GFP+ interneurons switching from tangential to radial migration, respectively (Figures 4A–4C and 4G ; Movies S1–S3). In the SVZ, Cxcr4−/− mutants displayed a 2-fold increase in the number of Lhx6-GFP+ interneurons switching from tangential to radial migration and no effect was detected in the Cxcr7−/− mutants (Figures 4D–4F and 4H; Movies S4–S6). Therefore, the laminar deficits from both mutants were mainly due to an increased number of Lhx6-GFP+ cells moving from either the MZ or the SVZ into the cortical plate. Next, we studied the tangential migration rate of Lhx6-GFP+ cells that were maintained in the MZ and SVZ during the 20-hour live-imaging session. Compared to controls, Cxcr7−/− mutants exhibited a substantial decrease in tangential migration rate in the MZ and SVZ; and Cxcr4−/− mutants displayed a modest decrease in migration rate in the SVZ (Figure 4I). Thus, the decreased migration rate may underlie the reduced extent of interneuron migration into the dorsal cortex observed in both mutants during early embryonic stages. Finally, we explored the migration behaviors of Lhx6-GFP+ cells after they entered into the cortical plate. Cxcr4−/− and Cxcr7−/− mutants displayed major differences in interneuron motility and leading process morphology. Cxcr4−/− mutants exhibited a significant increase in the number of motile cells and in the leading process length of tangent"

https://openalex.org/W2014805096,"Rhodopsin, the visual pigment mediating vision under dim light, is composed of the apoprotein opsin and the chromophore ligand 11-cis-retinal. A P23H mutation in the opsin gene is one of the most prevalent causes of the human blinding disease, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Although P23H cultured cell and transgenic animal models have been developed, there remains controversy over whether they fully mimic the human phenotype; and the exact mechanism by which this mutation leads to photoreceptor cell degeneration remains unknown. By generating P23H opsin knock-in mice, we found that the P23H protein was inadequately glycosylated with levels 1-10% that of wild type opsin. Moreover, the P23H protein failed to accumulate in rod photoreceptor cell endoplasmic reticulum but instead disrupted rod photoreceptor disks. Genetically engineered P23H mice lacking the chromophore showed accelerated photoreceptor cell degeneration. These results indicate that most synthesized P23H protein is degraded, and its retinal cytotoxicity is enhanced by lack of the 11-cis-retinal chromophore during rod outer segment development."

However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The present study shows that the activity of MORs can be enhanced by preventing MORs from DOR-mediated codegradation. Treatment with DOR-specific agonists led to endocytosis of both DORs and MORs. These receptors were further processed for ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, resulting in a reduction of surface MORs. Such effects were attenuated by treatment with an interfering peptide containing the first transmembrane domain of MOR (MORTM1), which interacted with DORs and disrupted the MOR/DOR interaction. Furthermore, the systemically applied fusion protein consisting of MORTM1 and TAT at the C terminus could disrupt the MOR/DOR interaction in the mouse spinal cord, enhance the morphine analgesia, and reduce the antinociceptive tolerance to morphine. Thus, dissociation of MORs from DORs in the cell membrane is a potential strategy to improve opioid analgesic therapies. δ-opioid receptors (DORs) form heteromers with μ-opioid receptors (MORs) and negatively regulate MOR-mediated spinal analgesia.

USA. 2010; 107: 13117-13122Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Additionally, Gupta et al., 2010Gupta A. Mulder J. Gomes I. Rozenfeld R. Bushlin I. Ong E. Lim M. Maillet E. Junek M. Cahill C.M. et al.Increased abundance of opioid receptor heteromers after chronic morphine administration.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra54Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar detected the receptor heteromers in DRG neurons using antibodies that recognize MOR/DOR heteromers. Given that the receptor coexistence is a cellular basis for the modulation of opioid analgesia, the mechanisms underlying the DOR-mediated modulation of the MOR activity in the pain pathway remain largely unclear. Cell biological studies have shown that GPCRs activated by selective agonists are often internalized and processed in either the recycling pathway for resensitization or the degradation pathway that leads to receptor downregulation (Trapaidze et al., 2000Trapaidze N.

Type-specific sorting of G protein-coupled receptors after endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that heteromerized GPCRs may traffic via a postinternalization pathway that is different to the one used when they are expressed alone. Therefore, receptor heteromerization may serve as a regulatory mechanism for controlling receptor availability (Jordan et al., 2001Jordan B.A. Trapaidze N. Gomes I. Nivarthi R. Devi L.A.

It has been shown that internalized MORs and DORs are differentially processed in postendocytotic pathways. Internalized MORs are mainly recycled to the cell surface and re-sensitized after treatment with a MOR-specific agonist, [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO) (Arden et al., 1995Arden J.R.

In contrast, internalized DORs were mainly found to be located in the lysosomal compartments for degradation after treatment with DOR agonists (Hislop et al., 2009Hislop J.N. Henry A.G.

Chem. 2009; 284: 19361-19370Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). MOR/DOR heteromers were also reported to recruit β-arrestin, which modified the dynamics of opioid-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation (Rozenfeld and Devi, 2007Rozenfeld R. Devi L.A. Receptor heterodimerization leads to a switch in signaling: β-arrestin2-mediated ERK activation by μ-δ opioid receptor heterodimers.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2455-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, whether postendocytotic trafficking of MORs can be modulated by DORs remains to be examined. Furthermore, if DORs and MORs were colocalized in sensory afferent fibers, it would be interesting to explore the physical interaction and functional correlation between these two types of opioid receptors in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate the postendocytotic process of the MOR/DOR complex after agonist stimulation and its correlation with the DOR-mediated negative regulation of MOR-mediated spinal analgesia. We found that the activation of DORs in the MOR/DOR complex could target MORs into the postendocytotic degradation pathway, resulting in MOR desensitization. Furthermore, morphine analgesia could be facilitated by disrupting the MOR/DOR interaction with an interfering peptide that corresponds to the first transmembrane domain (TM1) of MOR fused with the TAT peptide, which is the cell membrane transduction domain of the human immunodeficiency virus and used as a cell-penetrating vector to deliver small cargos or large molecules (Schwarze et al., 1999Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. In vivo protein transduction: delivery of a biologically active protein into the mouse.Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). Therefore, physical disassociation of MORs from DORs could be a strategy to enhance MOR-mediated analgesia. To assess whether MOR trafficking could be modulated by activation of DORs, we examined the distribution and translocation of MORs and DORs in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells that were cotransfected with plasmids expressing MOR with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag (HA-MOR) and DOR with an N-terminal Myc tag (Myc-DOR). Because HA and Myc were tagged at the N termini of MOR and DOR, respectively, and exposed to the extracellular space following insertion of the receptors into the plasma membrane, HA-MOR and Myc-DOR on the cell surface of living cells could be prelabeled using rabbit anti-HA and mouse anti-Myc antibodies. Under control conditions, the prelabeled DORs and MORs were mainly present on the surface of the double-transfected HEK293 cells (Figure 1A ). Interestingly, after a 30 min treatment with the selective DOR agonists deltorphin (Delt) I, Delt II, or (+)-4-[(αR)-α-((2S,5R)-4-Allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide (SNC80) (1 μM), the prelabeled DORs and MORs were cointernalized and colocalized in the same vesicular structures (Figure 1A). When DAMGO (1 μM), a selective MOR agonist, was applied for 30 min, the cointernalization of prelabeled MORs and DORs was also observed in the double-transfected HEK293 cells (Figure 1A). The reaction induced by Delt I or DAMGO could be abolished using the DOR antagonist naltrindole (NTI) or the MOR antagonists naloxone and D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Om-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTOP) (Figure 1A), indicating that the receptor cointernalization is induced in a receptor-specific manner. DOR-mediated cointernalization of DORs and MORs was further confirmed by direct measurement of the amount of receptors present on the cell surface using immunoblotting. After agonist treatment, the proteins that remained on the surface of HEK293 cells cotransfected with the plasmids expressing Myc-DOR and MOR fused with a Flag tag at the C terminus (MOR-Flag) were biotinylated and precipitated with immobilized streptavidin. Treatment with Delt I or SNC80 led to a marked reduction of both MORs and DORs on the cell surface (Figure 1B and see Figure S1A available online). These results indicate that a receptor-selective agonist can induce the cointernalization of both types of opioid receptors. Receptor phosphorylation is involved in δ-opioid peptide-induced DOR internalization and DAMGO-induced MOR internalization (Pak et al., 1999Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. Wang J.B. George S.R. Agonist-induced, G protein-dependent and -independent down-regulation of the μ opioid receptor. The receptor is a direct substrate for protein-tyrosine kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27610-27616Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Whistler et al., 2001Whistler J.L. Tsao P. von Zastrow M. A phosphorylation-regulated brake mechanism controls the initial endocytosis of opioid receptors but is not required for post-endocytic sorting to lysosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34331-34338Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We observed that receptor-specific phosphorylation was involved in the agonist-induced cointernalization of MORs and DORs. In HEK293 cells coexpressing Myc-DOR and MOR-Flag, immunoblotting showed that treatment with Delt I (1 μM) or SNC80 (5 μM) for 30 min selectively enhanced DOR phosphorylation, while DAMGO (1 μM) selectively increased MOR phosphorylation (Figures 1C and S1B). Thus, receptor-selective agonists specifically induce phosphorylation of the corresponding type of opioid receptor. This result also suggests that the DOR agonist-induced cointernalization of MORs and DORs is not due to a cross-reaction of the agonist or to a transphosphorylation of MORs by activation of DORs. The role of the phosphorylation and internalization of DORs in the cointernalization of MORs was further evaluated by coexpressing MOR-Flag with a Myc-tagged, phosphorylation-deficient DOR mutant [Myc-DOR (M)] in which all serine and threonine residues (T352, T353, T358, T361, and S363) in the C terminus were mutated to alanine residues (Whistler et al., 2001Whistler J.L. Tsao P. von Zastrow M. A phosphorylation-regulated brake mechanism controls the initial endocytosis of opioid receptors but is not required for post-endocytic sorting to lysosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34331-34338Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In Myc-DOR (M) and MOR-expressing HEK293 cells, neither surface Myc-DOR (M) nor surface MORs were internalized following a Delt I or SNC80 (1 μM) treatment for 30 min (Figures 1D and S1C). These results confirm that activated DORs are required for cointernalization of MORs. Next, we determined the postendocytotic fate of MORs cointernalized with DORs. Using triple-immunofluorescence staining in MOR- and DOR-expressing HEK293 cells, we observed that a 90 min treatment with Delt I (1 μM), but not DAMGO (1 μM), significantly increased the localization of MORs in lysosome-like compartments that were labeled using a LysoTracker probe (Figures 2A and 2B ). An immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment showed that, in HEK293 cells coexpressing MOR-Flag and Myc-DOR, a 30 min treatment with Delt I (1 μM) resulted in a marked increase in the ubiquitination of both MORs and DORs, whereas DAMGO (1 μM) did not noticeably change the ubiquitination level of both MORs and DORs (Figure 2C). We further examined whether the cointernalized MORs were degraded. The surface proteins of transfected HEK293 cells were biotinylated before drug treatment. DORs and MORs that remained intact in the biotinylated proteins were examined 90 min after treatment with 1 μM of Delt I or DAMGO. We observed that the amount of biotinylated DORs and MORs was significantly reduced following the Delt I treatment, but no significant changes were observed following the DAMGO treatment (Figures 2D and 2E). DOR agonist-induced receptor degradation is known to be sensitive to inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis (Tsao and von Zastrow, 2000Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. Type-specific sorting of G protein-coupled receptors after endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and MG132 (Tanowitz and von Zastrow, 2002Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. Ubiquitination-independent trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors to lysosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), a compound that inhibits a number of proteasome-associated proteases and potently suppresses the effect of various cysteine proteases and cathepsins. We did not observe any Delt I-induced reduction of DORs and MORs when using a 4 hr pretreatment with a mixture of MG132 (10 μM) and leupeptin (100 μM), a lysosomal protease inhibitor (Figures 2D and 2E). Our results indicate that the cointernalized MORs and DORs are targeted to lysosomes for degradation. Both DOR binding sites and immunoreactivity were found to be located in the afferent fibers of the lamina I–II of the spinal cord (Besse et al., 1992Besse D. Lombard M.C. Perrot S. Besson J.M.

Using in situ double-hybridization, we found that a large fraction of MOR-positive small DRG neurons (79%, n = 643) expressed DOR1 (Figure 3A ). This result is consistent with our recent report (Wang et al., 2010Wang H.B. Zhao B. Zhong Y.Q. Li K.C. Li Z.Y. Wang Q. Lu Y.J. Zhang Z.N. He S.Q. Zheng H.C. et al.Coexpression of δ- and μ-opioid receptors in nociceptive sensory neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13117-13122Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). DOR13–17 antiserum primarily recognizes DORs, as demonstrated by the detection of Myc-DOR1 expressed in HEK293 cells (Figure S2A) and the lack of DOR-immunoblots in extracts of spinal cords from Oprd1 exon 1-deleted mice (Figure 3B). DOR1 could be detected in the spinal cord of wild-type mice. Moreover, the DOR-immunostaining pattern in the lamina I–II of the mouse spinal cord could be abolished in Oprd1 exon 1-deleted mice and after antiserum preabsorption with the immunogenic peptide (10−6 M) (Figure 3C). Triple-immunofluorescence staining showed that MOR/DOR-containing nerve terminals were frequently found in the lamina I–II of the spinal cord and that many of them immunostained for the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (Figure 3D), which is a marker of peptidergic afferent fibers. In addition, a number of MOR-positive neurons and dendrites were found in the spinal lamina II (Figure 3D). Thus, coexistence of MORs and DORs in sensory afferent fibers provides a cellular basis for the MOR/DOR interaction in the dorsal spinal cord. Coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) showed that the MOR/DOR interaction occurred in the spinal dorsal horn of mice and that it was enhanced by intrathecal injection (i.t.) of Delt I (2 μg) for 15 min (215.2% ± 23.0% of control, p < 0.01, n = 5) (Figure 3E). The specificity of the antibodies against DOR1–60 used for IP was confirmed by the loss of immunoblot and IP signals in the spinal cord of Oprd1 exon 1-deleted mice (Figures 3F and S2B). A 45 min treatment with Delt I or SNC80 or leucine-enkephalin (L-ENK) (5 μg, twice at an interval of 15 min, i.t.), an endogenous DOR agonist expressed in dorsal horn neurons (Cesselin et al., 1989Cesselin F. Bourgoin S. Clot A.M. Hamon M. Le Bars D. Segmental release of Met-enkephalin-like material from the spinal cord of rats, elicited by noxious thermal stimuli.Brain Res. 1989; 484: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), increased the ubiquitination of MORs (Figures 3G and S2C). Immunohistochemistry showed that the intensity of MOR-immunostaining in the spinal lamina I–II was significantly reduced in mice after a 1 hr treatment with Delt I (2 μg/15 min, i.t.) (Figure 3H). These results suggest that the activation of DORs leads to a downregulation of MORs in afferent fibers of the spinal cord. We have further found that the activation of DORs attenuated morphine analgesia. Using a tail-immersion test at 52°C, we found that morphine-induced spinal antinociception was markedly attenuated when mice were pretreated with Delt I (1 μg, i.t.) 30–45 min prior to the morphine treatment (1.5 μg, i.t.) (Figure 3I). We also found that Delt I inhibited the morphine effect in a dose-dependent manner when Delt I or SNC80 was applied 30 min prior to the morphine treatment (Figure 3J; Table S1). A similar effect was induced by pretreatment with L-ENK (2 μg, i.t.) (Figure 3J; Table S1). The Delt I-induced inhibition of morphine antinociception was blocked by cotreatment with NTI (Figure 3J; Table S1). Furthermore, NTI treatment (1 μg, i.t.) facilitated morphine-induced spinal antinociception (Figure 3K; Table S2). This result is consistent with previous findings (Gomes et al., 2004Gomes I. Gupta A. Filipovska J. Szeto H.H. Pintar J.E. Devi L.A. A role for heterodimerization of μ and δ opiate receptors in enhancing morphine analgesia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 5135-5139C"
https://openalex.org/W2035074539,"We have established functions of the stimulus-dependent MAPKs, ERK1/2 and ERK5, in DRG, motor neuron, and Schwann cell development. Surprisingly, many aspects of early DRG and motor neuron development were found to be ERK1/2 independent, and Erk5 deletion had no obvious effect on embryonic PNS. In contrast, Erk1/2 deletion in developing neural crest resulted in peripheral nerves that were devoid of Schwann cell progenitors, and deletion of Erk1/2 in Schwann cell precursors caused disrupted differentiation and marked hypomyelination of axons. The Schwann cell phenotypes are similar to those reported in neuregulin-1 and ErbB mutant mice, and neuregulin effects could not be elicited in glial precursors lacking Erk1/2. ERK/MAPK regulation of myelination was specific to Schwann cells, as deletion in oligodendrocyte precursors did not impair myelin formation, but reduced precursor proliferation. Our data suggest a tight linkage between developmental functions of ERK/MAPK signaling and biological actions of specific RTK-activating factors."
https://openalex.org/W2088386233,"In choosing between different rewards expected after unequal delays, humans and animals often prefer the smaller but more immediate reward, indicating that the subjective value or utility of reward is depreciated according to its delay. Here, we show that neurons in the primate caudate nucleus and ventral striatum modulate their activity according to temporally discounted values of rewards with a similar time course. However, neurons in the caudate nucleus encoded the difference in the temporally discounted values of the two alternative targets more reliably than neurons in the ventral striatum. In contrast, neurons in the ventral striatum largely encoded the sum of the temporally discounted values, and therefore, the overall goodness of available options. These results suggest a more pivotal role for the dorsal striatum in action selection during intertemporal choice."
https://openalex.org/W1974095433,"RNA 2',3'-cyclic phosphate ends play important roles in RNA metabolism as substrates for RNA ligases during tRNA restriction-repair and tRNA splicing. Diverse bacteria from multiple phyla encode a two-component RNA repair cassette, comprising Pnkp (polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase-ligase) and Hen1 (RNA 3'-terminal ribose 2'-O-methyltransferase), that heals and then seals broken tRNAs with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH ends. The Pnkp-Hen1 repair operon is absent in the majority of bacterial species, thereby raising the prospect that other RNA repair systems might be extant. A candidate component is RNA 3'-phosphate cyclase, a widely distributed enzyme that transforms RNA 3'-monophosphate termini into 2',3'-cyclic phosphates but cannot seal the ends it produces. Escherichia coli RNA cyclase (RtcA) is encoded in a σ(54)-regulated operon with RtcB, a protein of unknown function. Taking a cue from Pnkp-Hen1, we purified E. coli RtcB and tested it for RNA ligase activity. We report that RtcB per se seals broken tRNA-like stem-loop structures with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH ends to form a splice junction with a 2'-OH, 3',5'-phosphodiester. We speculate that: (i) RtcB might afford bacteria a means to recover from stress-induced RNA damage; and (ii) RtcB homologs might catalyze tRNA repair or splicing reactions in archaea and eukarya."

The activation of NMDARs has been linked to the modulation of a number of transcriptional factors, with either pro-survival or pro-death activity, suggesting that the alteration of transcription factor activity may crucially contribute to excitotoxic neuronal injuries (Taghibiglou et al., 2009Taghibiglou C.

In particular, we and others have demonstrated that the transcription factor cAMP responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) protected the brain from ischemia mainly via its downstream neuroprotective genes (Hardingham et al., 2002Hardingham G.E.

NMDAR subtypes and localization have attracted much attention because synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs have been shown to exert distinct roles in excitotoxicity (Sattler et al., 2000Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W. MacDonald J. Tymianski M. Distinct roles of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors in excitotoxicity.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 22-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, synaptic NMDARs, predominantly NR2A receptor subtypes, and extrasynaptic NMDARs, mainly NR2B subtypes, have opposite effects on CREB function, gene regulation, and neuronal survival (Hardingham et al., 2002Hardingham G.E.

Moreover, CREB also plays a pivotal role in an ischemic tolerance phenomenon in which brief sublethal ischemic insults (or preconditioning) protect neurons against a subsequent severe ischemic injury (Kitagawa, 2007Kitagawa K.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9204-9213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CREB contributes to neuroprotection by inducing its target genes, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (Ppargc-1α: its product is known as PGC-1α), and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) (Mabuchi et al., 2001Mabuchi T.

In neurons, CREB-dependent gene expression has been implicated in complex and diverse processes, including development and plasticity (Lonze and Ginty, 2002Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Function and regulation of CREB family transcription factors in the nervous system.Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). The activity of CREB is regulated by phosphorylation, and Ser133 was found to be its crucial phosphorylation site (Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cyclic AMP stimulates somatostatin gene transcription by phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133.Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A (PKA) is activated in the cAMP-signaling cascade and phosphorylates CREB at Ser133, enhancing its binding to the coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (Vo and Goodman, 2001Vo N. Goodman R. CREB-binding protein and p300 in transcriptional regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 then promote histone-chromatin remodeling through their intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and recruit basal transcription machinery to CRE-containing promoters (Goodman and Smolik, 2000Goodman R.H. Smolik S. CBP/p300 in cell growth, transformation, and development.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I/IV (CaMK I/IV) are important isoforms of CaMKs in neurons and play pivotal roles in cell survival. Indeed, CaMK IV is recognized as a key mediator of CREB-dependent cell survival in neurons because treatment with a CaMK inhibitor renders neurons vulnerable to ischemia concomitant with the loss of CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 (Mabuchi et al., 2001Mabuchi T. Kitagawa K. Kuwabara K. Takasawa K. Ohtsuki T. Xia Z. Storm D. Yanagihara T. Hori M. Matsumoto M. Phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein in hippocampal neurons as a protective response after exposure to glutamate in vitro and ischemia in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9204-9213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 alone is not sufficient to fully activate the expression of target genes in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that the initiation of transcription of CREB target genes is controlled by CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 and possibly by other mechanisms (Gau et al., 2002Gau D. Lemberger T. von Gall C. Kretz O. Le Minh N. Gass P. Schmid W. Schibler U. Korf H. Schütz G.

The discovery of a family of coactivators named transducer of regulated CREB activity (TORC, also known as CREB regulated transcriptional coactivator [CRTC], with three isoforms TORC1–3) provided new insights on CREB activation (Conkright et al., 2003Conkright M.D. Canettieri G.

USA. 2003; 100: 12147-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Under nonstimulated conditions, TORC is phosphorylated and sequestered in the cytoplasm. Once dephosphorylated in response to Ca2+ and cAMP signals, it translocates to the nucleus (Bittinger et al., 2004Bittinger M.A. McWhinnie E. Meltzer J. Iourgenko V. Latario B. Liu X. Chen C.H.

In contrast to CBP/p300, TORC activates transcription by targeting the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) domain of CREB in a phospho-Ser133-independent manner. TORC1 is abundantly expressed in the brain and plays an important role in hippocampal long-term potentiation at its late phase (Kovács et al., 2007Kovács K.A. Steullet P. Steinmann M. Do K.Q. Magistretti P.J. Halfon O. Cardinaux J.R. TORC1 is a calcium- and cAMP-sensitive coincidence detector involved in hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Requirement of TORC1 for late-phase long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TORC2 is the most abundant TORC isoform in the liver and has been found to be involved in the gene expression of gluconeogenic programs and in the survival of pancreatic β cells (Koo et al., 2005Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. et al.The CREB coactivator TORC2 is a key regulator of fasting glucose metabolism.Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Salt-inducible kinase (SIK) was identified as an enzyme induced in the adrenal glands of rats fed with a high-salt diet (Wang et al., 1999Wang Z. Takemori H. Halder S. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Cloning of a novel kinase (SIK) of the SNF1/AMPK family from high salt diet-treated rat adrenal.FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 135-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SIK isoforms (SIK1–3) belong to a family of AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPKs). SIK1 expression is induced by depolarization in the hippocampus and plays a role in the development of cortical neurons through the regulation of TORC1 (Feldman et al., 2000Feldman J.D. Vician L. Crispino M. Hoe W. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. The salt-inducible kinase, SIK, is induced by depolarization in brain.J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2009Li S. Zhang C. Takemori H. Zhou Y. Xiong Z. TORC1 regulates activity-dependent CREB-target gene transcription and dendritic growth of developing cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be clarified whether the intracellular signaling of SIK-TORC is crucial for CREB-dependent neuronal survival, and if so, what acts as the upstream signaling cascade. In the present study we found high expression levels of SIK2 in neurons. The levels of SIK2 protein were lowered after ischemic injury and were accompanied by the dephosphorylation of TORC1. CaMK I/IV play an important role in the regulation of the SIK2 degradation by phosphorylating SIK2 at Thr484. To assess the importance of SIK2 during ischemic injury in vivo, we generated SIK2 knockout (sik2−/−) mice and found that they showed resistance to ischemic neuronal injury. One hour after OGD in the primary cortical cultures, CREB was phosphorylated, and the level of phosphorylation reached a maximum at 3–6 hr after reoxygenation, then declined to basal levels after 12 hr post-reoxygenation (Figure 1A and S1A available online). To measure CRE activity, neurons were infected with an adenovirus as a CRE reporter. We found a significant enhancement of CRE activity after 3–12 hr post-reoxygenation (Figure 1B). During OGD and early (1 hr) after reoxygenation, CREB phosphorylation was not followed by an increase in CRE activity, but late (12 hr) after reoxygenation, CRE activity remained high, regardless of the basal level of CREB phosphorylation. The results of a reporter assay using Gal4-fusion Ser133-disrupted CREB suggested the presence of the Ser133-independent activation of CREB following OGD (Figure S1B). To examine Ser133-independent regulation in cortical neurons, we performed CRE-reporter assays in the presence of cAMP agonists and a kinase inhibitor. Staurosporine at low dose (10 nM), a nonspecific kinase inhibitor, decreased the level of phospho-Ser133, but it induced the activity of a CRE reporter to comparable levels as the phospho-Ser133-inducer db-cAMP or forskolin (Figure S1C), suggesting the involvement of another type of CREB coactivator, TORC. It has been shown that CREB activity is blocked by the inhibition of calcineurin. Indeed, we found this to be true in neurons after OGD because the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) and FK 506 suppressed CRE activity (Figure 1C), despite the upregulation of CREB phosphorylation by FK 506 (Figure 1C). The mechanism by which calcineurin activates CREB could be the dephosphorylation-dependent nuclear entry of CREB-coactivator TORCs. To examine the activity of endogenous TORCs after OGD, the activity of Gal4-fusion full-length CREB (TORC activatable) and bZIP-less CREB (TORC silent) was monitored. The activity of the full-length CREB, but not bZIP-less CREB, was enhanced after OGD (Figure 1D), suggesting that TORCs may contribute to the Ser 133-independent activation of CREB after OGD reoxygenation. A high level of TORC1 protein and a moderate level of TORC2 protein were detected in primary cortical cultures (Figure S2A). Under basal conditions, endogenous TORC1 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of cortical neurons (Figure 2A , control). Although the phosphorylation levels of CREB at Ser133 were increased during OGD (Figure S1A), TORC1 remained in the cytoplasm before reoxygenation but quickly translocated into the nucleus after reoxygenation (Figure 2A). Indeed, GFP-TORC1 translocated into the nucleus in response to OGD (Figure S2B). Next, we examined the intracellular distribution of TORC1 in response to OGD by separately isolating nuclei from cytoplasmic compartments. OGD followed by reoxygenation induced the nuclear localization of TORC1 (Figure S2C). This process was accompanied by the dephosphorylation of TORC1 at Ser 167 (corresponding Ser residues: Ser171 [TORC2] and Ser163 [TORC3]) (Figure 2B), followed by the enhancement of its coactivator activity (Figure 2C). This reoxygenation-induced activation of TORC1 may be essential for CREB activation because the overexpression of a dominant-negative TORC1 (DN-TORC1, N-terminal 56 amino acids) strongly inhibited CRE activity after OGD (Figure 2D) and aggravated cell injury after OGD (Figure 2E). To elucidate the role of TORC1 in neuronal survival, we determined the relationship between CRE activity and cell death. We found that CRE activity in cortical neurons was enhanced by the overexpression of TORC1, and a constitutively active TORC1 (S167A) further upregulated CRE activity (Figure 2F). The overexpression of TORC1 or the TORC1S167A mutant resulted in a significant decrease of ischemic neuronal death (Figure 2G). The overexpression of TORC1 in cortical neurons induced the mRNA expression of CREB-dependent pro-survival genes, such as Ppargc-1α (PGC-1α) and BDNF (Figure 2H). In contrast, DN-TORC1 inhibited the upregulation of these genes after OGD (Figure S2D). Moreover, the OGD-induced reporter activity of Ppargc-1α and bdnf promoters was impaired by mutating their CREs (Figure S2E), suggesting that TORC1-CREB may actively determine neuronal survival after ischemia. TORC family coactivators are phosphorylated by SIK1, SIK2, and AMPK (Katoh et al., 2006Katoh Y. Takemori H. Lin X. Tamura M. Muraoka M. Satoh T. Tsuchiya Y. Min L. Doi J.

Okamoto M. Regulation of CREB-mediated gene expression by salt inducible kinase.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 108: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and quantitative PCR analyses suggest a high level of SIK1 and SIK2 mRNA in the cortex (Figure S3A). We found that SIK2 protein was expressed in the hippocampus and cortex (Figures S3B and S3C) and was abundant in nonstimulated neurons (Figure S3D); however, SIK1 protein was not detected in these cells (data not shown) with a highly purified anti-SIK1 antibody (Uebi et al., 2010Uebi T. Tamura M. Horike N. Hashimoto Y. Takemori H. Phosphorylation of the CREB-specific coactivator TORC2 at Ser(307) regulates its intracellular localization in COS-7 cells and in the mouse liver.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 299: E413-E425Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the involvement of these kinases in the regulation of TORC1 after OGD in cortical neurons (Figure 3A ). The level of SIK1 remained low during and after OGD. The level of pAMPK increased during OGD but quickly returned to the basal level after reoxygenation. In contrast the level of SIK2 decreased in an early phase of reoxygenation (∼3 hr), and it was maintained at a low level until 24 hr post-reoxygenation, suggesting that this downregulation of SIK2 may be important for the activation of TORC1-CREB after reoxygenation. Therefore, we next determined the contribution of SIK2 to the regulation of TORC1 in cortical neurons. To elucidate the importance of SIK2, we tried to identify small compounds that could inhibit SIK2 activity more selectively than staurosporine. Fortunately, by the use of a small kinase-inhibitor library, we identified Compound C, a potent inhibitor of AMPK, as a SIK2 inhibitor (Figure S3E). The effective dose of Compound C against SIK2 in cultured cells was 10-fold lower than that against SIK1 or AMPK (Figures S3F and S3G). The IC50 of Compound C for the SIK2-dependent suppression of forskolin-induced CRE activity was approximately 0.3 μM, whereas the concentration required to inhibit the AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was greater than 3 μM (Figure S3G). The dose response of Compound C suggested that 0.1–1.0 μM would enable us to distinguish its effect on SIK2 from its effects on SIK1 or AMPK. Indeed, 0.3–0.5 μM of Compound C upregulated CRE activity in cultured neurons after OGD (Figure S3H) and reduced neuronal death (Figure S3I). On the other hand, we demonstrated that Compound C, at the dose used for AMPK inhibition (>3 μM), was toxic to cortical neurons after OGD (Figure S3I). These findings suggested that SIK2 could have a greater effect on TORC1-CREB activity than SIK1 or AMPK. The overexpression of SIK2 and its constitutively active form (S587A) strongly inhibited CRE activity after OGD (Figure 3B), whereas the kinase-defective SIK2 (K49M) failed to suppress CRE activity. In agreement with the CRE-reporter assay, the overexpression of S587A increased cell death, whereas K49M decreased cell death after OGD (Figure 3C). Furthermore, the overexpression of the S587A mutant SIK2 resulted in a substantial amount of TORC1 in the cytoplasm after OGD (Figure 3D). The overexpression of SIK2 also suppressed the TORC1-dependent activation of CRE, and SIK-resistant TORC1 (S167A) blocked this suppression (Figure 3E). When SIK2 was knocked down using SIK2-specific microRNA (miRNA) (Figure 3F), CRE activity was relatively enhanced in the late phase after OGD (after 12 hr; Figure 3G). The knockdown of SIK2 also attenuated neuronal death after OGD (Figure 3H). Although overexpression of TORC1 did not confer an additional protective effect under SIK2 downregulation, the overexpression of DN-TORC1 abolished the protective effect of SIK2-specific miRNA (Figure 3H). These findings suggested that SIK2 plays an essential role in neuronal survival after OGD via a TORC1-dependent pathway. To determine which kinase cascades mediate the activation of CRE-dependent transcription, we pretreated cortical neurons with various kinase inhibitors and found that KN93, a CaMK II/IV inhibitor, blocked CRE-mediated transcription after OGD (Figure 4A ). Gal4-fusion TORC1 activity was also inhibited by KN93 (Figure 4B), and KN-93 also blocked the decrease in the levels of SIK2 protein after OGD (Figure S4A). To identify the specific isoform of CaMK that is implicated in TORC-CREB-dependent transcription, dominant-active forms of CaMKs (DA-CaMK I; dominant-active CaMK I [catalytic domain], DA-CaMK IIA [catalytic domain], and DA-CaMK IV [full-length protein without its auto-inhibitory domain]) were expressed in Gal4-fusion reporter systems (Figure 4C). The activity of TORC-responsive CREB and TORC-non-responsive CREB (Gal4-CREB bZIP-less) were upregulated by the overexpression of CaMK I and IV, but not by CaMK IIA. In addition to CREB, CaMK I and IV upregulate TORC1 activity (Figure 4C). Conversely, DN (dominant negative; kinase-dead form)-CaMK I (K49E) and DN-CaMK IV (K75E) blocked TORC1-mediated transcriptional activity after OGD (Figure 4D) and SIK2 degradation after OGD (Figure S4B). Also, the overexpression of DN-TORC1 resulted in a significant reduction in CRE activity that was enhanced by CaMK I or CaMK IV in cortical neurons under control conditions and after OGD (Figure S4C). This finding suggested that CaMK I and IV may be able to activate CREB (via phosphorylation at Ser133) and TORC. Endogenous CaMK IV is predominantly restricted to the nucleus, whereas overexpressed CaMK IV was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure S4D). To determine the role of endogenous CaMK IV, we confirmed its involvement in the regulation of OGD-induced TORC activation by means of RNA interference (RNAi) experiments. Treatment with rat CaMK IV-specific miRNA decreased the level of CaMK IV, not CaMKI (Figure S4E). We found that the knockdown of CaMK IV resulted in the inhibition of TORC1 activity (Figure S4F) and aggravated cell injury after OGD (Figure S4G). Furthermore, transfection of human CaMK IV, which is resistant to miRNA for rat CaMK IV, reversed the CaMK IV protein level and attenuated the cell injury by CaMK IV knockdown (Figures S4E and S4G). These results suggested that CaMK IV may upregulate CRE-mediated transcription in a CREB Ser133- and TORC1-dependent manner. Indeed, the overexpression of DA-CaMK IV significantly decreased neuronal injury after OGD (Figure 4E). On the basis of these findings, CaMK I and CaMK IV were identified as negative regulators of SIK2. CaMK I and IV are activated by binding elevated Ca2+ levels to calmodulin, Ca2+/calmodulin, and Ca2+ influx, principally through NMDARs, activated cytoplasmic, and nuclear CaMKs. However, it was reported that different subtypes of glutamate receptors have opposite actions on neuronal survival (Hardingham et al., 2002Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H.

https://openalex.org/W2140290331,"The connection between intestinal microbiota and host physiology is increasingly becoming recognized. The details of this dynamic interaction, however, remain to be explored. Toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2) is important for its role in bacterial recognition, intestinal inflammation, and obesity-related metabolic changes. Therefore, we sought to determine the epigenomic and metagenomic consequences of Tlr2 deficiency in the colonic mucosa of mice to gain insights into biological pathways that shape the interface between the gut microbiota and the mammalian host. Colonic mucosa from wild type (WT) and Tlr2(-/-) C57BL/6 mice was interrogated by microarrays specific for DNA methylation and gene expression. The mucosal microbiome was studied by next-generation pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA. The expression of genes involved in immune processes was significantly modified by the absence of Tlr2, a number of which correlated with DNA methylation changes. The epigenomic and transcriptomic modifications associated with alteration in mucosal microbial composition. Several bacterial species, including members of the Firmicutes were significantly different in abundance between WT and Tlr2(-/-) animals. This manuscript highlights the intimate interrelationships between expression of immune-related genes and immunity pathways in the host with compositional and functional differences of the mammalian microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2094013091,"Although a large number of ion channels are now believed to be regulated by phosphoinositides, particularly phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the mechanisms involved in phosphoinositide regulation are unclear. For the TRP superfamily of ion channels, the role and mechanism of PIP2 modulation has been especially difficult to resolve. Outstanding questions include: is PIP2 the endogenous regulatory lipid; does PIP2 potentiate all TRPs or are some TRPs inhibited by PIP2; where does PIP2 interact with TRP channels; and is the mechanism of modulation conserved among disparate subfamilies? We first addressed whether the PIP2 sensor resides within the primary sequence of the channel itself, or, as recently proposed, within an accessory integral membrane protein called Pirt. Here we show that Pirt does not alter the phosphoinositide sensitivity of TRPV1 in HEK-293 cells, that there is no FRET between TRPV1 and Pirt, and that dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons from Pirt knock-out mice have an apparent affinity for PIP2 indistinguishable from that of their wild-type littermates. We followed by focusing on the role of the C terminus of TRPV1 in sensing PIP2. Here, we show that the distal C-terminal region is not required for PIP2 regulation, as PIP2 activation remains intact in channels in which the distal C-terminal has been truncated. Furthermore, we used a novel in vitro binding assay to demonstrate that the proximal C-terminal region of TRPV1 is sufficient for PIP2 binding. Together, our data suggest that the proximal C-terminal region of TRPV1 can interact directly with PIP2 and may play a key role in PIP2 regulation of the channel."

We built a telemetry system to simultaneously record, in freely behaving animals, the activity of the DCMD and of motoneurons involved in jump execution. Cocontraction of antagonistic leg muscles, a required preparatory phase, was triggered after the DCMD firing rate crossed a threshold. Thereafter, the number of DCMD spikes predicted precisely motoneuron activity and jump occurrence. Additionally, the time of DCMD peak firing rate predicted that of jump. Ablation experiments suggest that the DCMD, together with a nearly identical ipsilateral descending neuron, is responsible for the timely execution of the escape. Thus, three distinct features that are multiplexed in a single neuron's sensory response to impending collision—firing rate threshold, peak firing time, and spike count—probably control three distinct motor aspects of escape behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2134066378,"Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2; GPR43) is a G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor for short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that is implicated in inflammatory and metabolic disorders. The SCFA propionate has close to optimal ligand efficiency for FFA2 and can hence be considered as highly potent given its size. Propionate, however, does not discriminate between FFA2 and the closely related receptor FFA3 (GPR41). To identify FFA2-selective ligands and understand the molecular basis for FFA2 selectivity, a targeted library of small carboxylic acids was examined using holistic, label-free dynamic mass redistribution technology for primary screening and the receptor-proximal G protein [35S]guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate activation, inositol phosphate, and cAMP accumulation assays for hit confirmation. Structure-activity relationship analysis allowed formulation of a general rule to predict selectivity for small carboxylic acids at the orthosteric binding site where ligands with substituted sp3-hybridized α-carbons preferentially activate FFA3, whereas ligands with sp2- or sp-hybridized α-carbons prefer FFA2. The orthosteric binding mode was verified by site-directed mutagenesis: replacement of orthosteric site arginine residues by alanine in FFA2 prevented ligand binding, and molecular modeling predicted the detailed mode of binding. Based on this, selective mutation of three residues to their non-conserved counterparts in FFA3 was sufficient to transfer FFA3 selectivity to FFA2. Thus, selective activation of FFA2 via the orthosteric site is achievable with rather small ligands, a finding with significant implications for the rational design of therapeutic compounds selectively targeting the SCFA receptors.

Clifton P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1031-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). The receptor plays a critical role in neutrophil recruitment during intestinal inflammation (3Sina C. Gavrilova O. Förster M. Till A. Derer S. Hildebrand F. Raabe B. Chalaris A. Scheller J. Rehmann A. Franke A. Ott S. Häsler R. Nikolaus S. Fölsch U.R. Rose-John S. Jiang H.P. Li J. Schreiber S.

Vieira A.T. Ng A. Kranich J. Sierro F. Yu D. Schilter H.C. Rolph M.S. Mackay F. Artis D. Xavier R.J. Teixeira M.M. Mackay C.R. Nature. 2009; 461: 1282-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that FFA2 is important in the regulation of intestinal inflammation and that the receptor might represent a new drug target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The receptor is also believed to play a role in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation (5Sleeth M.L. Thompson E.L. Ford H.E. Zac-Varghese S.E. Frost G. Nutr. Res. Rev. 2010; 23: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Further studies, however, are necessary to firmly establish these novel links, and such studies will depend critically on the availability of selective agonists and antagonists for the receptor. FFA2 and the closely related receptor FFA3 (GPR41) respond to SCFAs at high micromolar and millimolar concentrations with propionate being the most potent agonist for both receptors (6Brown A.J. Goldsworthy S.M. Barnes A.A. Eilert M.M. Tcheang L. Daniels D. Muir A.I. Wigglesworth M.J. Kinghorn I. Fraser N.J. Pike N.B. Strum J.C. Steplewski K.M. Murdock P.R. Holder J.C. Marshall F.H.

Together with the medium- and long-chain free fatty acid receptor FFA1 (GPR40), the receptors form a subfamily capable of sensing free fatty acids in concentrations corresponding to elevated physiological levels (1Stoddart L.A. Smith N.J. Milligan G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 9Wellendorph P. Johansen L.D. Bräuner-Osborne H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the molar potency of the SCFAs on FFA2 and FFA3 must be regarded as low, the compounds are also very small. Ligand efficiency (LE) is a recently introduced concept that assists lead selection by calculating binding energy per non-hydrogen atom as smaller, potent leads increase the likelihood of generating drug candidates with appropriate pharmacokinetic characteristics (10Abad-Zapatero C. Metz J.T. Drug. Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 11Hopkins A.L. Groom C.R. Alex A. Drug. Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). LE has become popular in evaluation of early leads and is especially widespread in fragment-based drug discovery where such small ligands are grown or assembled to larger and more potent leads (12Coyne A.G. Scott D.E. Abell C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2010; 14: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13de Kloe G.E. Bailey D. Leurs R. de Esch I.J. Drug. Discov. Today. 2009; 14: 630-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Analysis of successful drugs has suggested that an LE of Δg < −0.3 kcal mol−1 per non-hydrogen atom is desirable, and empirical analysis has concluded that the maximal free energy contribution per heavy atom for non-metal ligands is around −1.5 kcal mol−1 per non-hydrogen atom (14Kuntz I.D. Chen K. Sharp K.A. Kollman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9997-10002Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Notably, acetate (C2) and propionate (C3) already have ligand efficiencies close to this value at FFA2 and FFA3 and can therefore be regarded as highly potent for their size (Table 1). Thus, it is unrealistic to expect that the potency of the SCFAs can be increased without at the same time considerably increasing the size of the compounds. It is unclear, however, whether the orthosteric binding site can accommodate significantly larger ligands. A detailed understanding of the interactions of the SCFAs in the orthosteric binding site is expected to indicate the prospects for this strategy and to assist the rational design of larger, more potent and selective modulators of FFA2 and FFA3.TABLE 1Agonist activities of small carboxylic acids on hFFA2 and hFFA3, calculated ligand efficiencies, and average selectivitiesa DMR assay using the Corning Epic biosensor.b LE is calculated by the formula −Δg = −ΔG/Nnon-hydrogen atoms where −ΔG = RTln(KD) presuming that KD ≈ EC50.

Previous structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have found FFA2 to exhibit a preference for smaller SCFAs than does FFA3 with a rank order of potency of acetate (C2) ∼ propionate (C3) > butyrate (C4) > valerate (C5) ∼ formate (C1) for FFA2 and C3 ∼ C4 ∼ C5 > C2 > caproate (C6) for FFA3 (15Milligan G. Stoddart L.A. Smith N.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 158: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A series of FFA2-selective allosteric agonists that exhibit positive cooperativity with SCFAs has also been disclosed (16Lee T. Schwandner R. Swaminath G. Weiszmann J. Cardozo M. Greenberg J. Jaeckel P. Ge H. Wang Y. Jiao X. Liu J. Kayser F. Tian H. Li Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1599-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Wang Y. Jiao X. Kayser F. Liu J. Wang Z. Wanska M.

Although these compounds certainly represent useful tools for further pharmacological studies of FFA2, because they bind to a site or sites distinct from the orthosteric binding pocket, it is possible that they may generate signals that are not identical to those triggered by SCFAs. The moderate solubility and metabolic liability of these allosteric compounds furthermore represent a limitation to their use (17Wang Y. Jiao X. Kayser F. Liu J. Wang Z. Wanska M. Greenberg J. Weiszmann J. Ge H. Tian H. Wong S. Schwandner R. Lee T. Li Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2010; 20: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study, we explored the potential of small carboxylic acids (SCAs) as pharmacological tools and further investigated their interaction with the orthosteric binding site. To date, only a small number of saturated straight and branched SCAs have been investigated as ligands at these receptors. Here we report the results from structure-activity investigations of an expanded set of SCAs, including carboxylic acids with additional branched, unsaturated, and cyclic tails. The studies led to the identification of selective orthosteric ligands for both FFA2 and FFA3 and to the elucidation of a general rule to predict the FFA2/FFA3 selectivity of SCAs. Furthermore, this rule was validated by molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis at FFA2, resulting in the reversal of selectivity between FFA2 and FFA3 ligands at the mutated receptor. Materials for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell culture-compatible Epic® biosensor microplates and compound source plates were from Corning Inc.

Angelic acid (21) was purchased from ABCR (Karlsruhe, Germany). Cyclopropylacetic acid (8) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. 3-Butynoic acid (10), 3-pentynoic acid (11), and cis-crotonic acid (17) were synthesized as described in the supplemental methods. The identity and purity of all compounds were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR. The Flp recombinase-mediated homologous recombination system (Flp-InTM T-RExTM, Invitrogen) was used to generate cell lines stably expressing human FFA2 and FFA3 in a doxycycline-dependent manner. The coding sequences of FFA2 and FFA3 were subcloned from pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) into the inducible expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) via 5′ HindIII and 3′ XhoI. Veracity of the constructs was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion. Cloning and generation of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged versions of human FFA2 and FFA3 (FFA2-eYFP and FFA3-eYFP) and various binding mutants have been described elsewhere (18Stoddart L.A. Smith N.J. Jenkins L. Brown A.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32913-32924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Flp-In T-REx cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixture, and 15 μg/ml blasticidin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. To generate Flp-In T-REx 293 cells able to inducibly express a receptor of interest, the cells were transfected with a 1:9 mixture of the desired receptor cDNA in pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector and the pOG44 vector (Invitrogen's expression vector for Flp recombinase) using a calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the medium was changed to medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) to initiate selection of stably transfected cells. Expression of the appropriate construct from the Flp-In locus was induced by treatment with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) for 16 h. DMR assays were performed on a beta version of the Corning Epic biosensor. A description and validation of this method is detailed in Schröder et al. (19Schröder R. Janssen N. Schmidt J. Kebig A. Merten N. Hennen S. Müller A. Blättermann S. Mohr-Andrä M. Zahn S. Wenzel J. Smith N.J. Gomeza J. Drewke C. Milligan G. Mohr K. Kostenis E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in Epic microplates, which are equipped with a resonant wave guide grating biosensor. GPCR signaling-induced mass redistribution, due to relocation of cellular constituents, leads to a change of the optical density in cells. This phenomenon can be detected by passing polarized broadband light through the bottom portion of cells and measuring changes in wavelength of the outgoing light. The wavelength shift (in picometers) is directly proportional to the amount of DMR. For Epic assays, HEK Flp-In T-REx cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated 384-well Epic sensor microplates at a density of 15,000 cells/well to obtain confluent monolayers. After cultivation for 20–24 h (at 37 °C and 5% CO2) cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES and kept for 1 h at 28 °C in the Epic reader to allow for temperature equilibration. The sensor plate was then scanned to obtain a base-line optical signature. Finally, compound solutions were transferred into the sensor plate with an integrated liquid handling device, and cell responses were recorded continuously for at least 3600 s. All data were normalized to the responses induced by 300 μm propionic acid, which were set to 100%. Membranes expressing wild type or mutant versions of human FFA2-eYFP or FFA3-eYFP were prepared from stable cell lines using 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline (24 h) as described elsewhere (20Smith N.J. Stoddart L.A. Devine N.M. Jenkins L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17527-17539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS binding assays were performed essentially as described (20Smith N.J. Stoddart L.A. Devine N.M. Jenkins L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17527-17539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of cell membranes were preincubated for 15 min at 25 °C in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm GDP, 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA) containing the indicated concentrations of ligands. Binding was initiated by addition of 50 nCi of [35S]GTPγS to each tube, and the reaction was terminated after 1-h incubation by rapid filtration through GF/C glass filters using a 24-well Brandel cell harvester (Alpha Biotech, Glasgow, UK). Unbound radioligand was washed from filters by three washes with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2), and [35S]GTPγS binding was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Membrane expression of each receptor was assessed by measurement of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) using a PHERAstar FS microplate reader (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 520 nm; BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in FFA3 cells was monitored with the MithrasLB 940 multimode reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) using the HTRF®-cAMP dynamic kit (CIS Bio International, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the assay, cells were resuspended in assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) and transferred to 384-well small volume microplates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 50,000 cells/well. Plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before compounds were added in the presence of 5 μm forskolin. After further incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 1.25% Triton X-100 containing HTRF reagents. Plates were then incubated for 60 min at room temperature, and time-resolved FRET signals were measured after excitation at 320 nm. Both the emission signal from the europium cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP antibody (620 nm) and the FRET signal resulting from the labeled cAMP-d2 (665 nm) were recorded. Results were calculated from the 665/620 nm ratio and expressed as ΔF (ΔF % = ((Standard or sample ratio − Rationeg)/Rationeg) × 100). All data were normalized to the functional response obtained with 300 μm propionic acid. The HTRF-IP One kit (CIS Bio International) was used for measuring IP1 production in cells expressing FFA2. In a 384-well format, the cell suspension was dispensed at 100,000 cells/7 μl/well. After 20-min incubation at 37 °C, 7 μl of stimulation buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm LiCl) containing various concentrations of ligand were added. After further incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 3 μl of IP1-d2 conjugate followed by 3 μl of europium cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody were added. Time-resolved fluorescence at 620 and 665 nm was measured with the Mithras LB 940 multimode reader after incubation at room temperature for 60 min, and the ratios of the signals expressed as ΔF were calculated as described above. Data were normalized to the IP1 response obtained with 300 μm propionic acid. Homology modeling of hFFA2 and hFFA3 receptors using the β2-adrenergic receptor (Protein Data Bank code 2RH1) as a template was conducted using MOE software (Molecular Operating Environment, 2009, Chemical Computing Group, Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) with a default homology modeling protocol. Selection of homology models was based on the location of extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). Only models where ECL2 was located relatively similarly to the available crystal structures of the ligand-bound GPCRs were considered for docking. Thus, ECL2 conformations that prevented entrance to the putative binding cavity were excluded for the next steps. The available model of FFA1 (21Sum C.S. Tikhonova I.G. Costanzi S. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3529-3536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), with the side-chain conformers optimized according to mutagenesis data for HisVI:16/4.56, ArgV:05/5.39, HisVI:20/6.55, and ArgVII:02/7.35, was used to optimize the rough homology models of hFFA2 and hFFA3 obtained. Docking of SCAs into these models and those containing proposed mutants was performed using the Glide module of Schrödinger software (22Schrödinger, LLC Glide. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2009Google Scholar). The Glide docking box included the cavity between transmembrane helices 3, 5, and 6 involving residues at positions V:05/5.39, VII:02/7.35, and VI:20/6.55, which we have shown to be crucial for anchoring the carboxyl group of fatty acids (18Stoddart L.A. Smith N.J. Jenkins L. Brown A.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32913-32924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Glide default settings with the extraprecision scoring option were used for docking. Images were prepared using the Maestro 8.5 interface (23Schrödinger, LLC Maestro 8.5. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2009Google Scholar). All data were quantified, grouped, and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.02 and are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were fit to both three-parameter (fixed Hill slope) and four-parameter non-linear regression isotherms. The three-parameter curve fit was statistically appropriate in all cases. FFA2 and FFA3 clearly mediate distinct physiological and pathological outcomes (1Stoddart L.A. Smith N.J. Milligan G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), yet the absence of selective ligands for these receptors has hampered further pharmacological studies of their individual functions. Both receptors couple to the Pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi/o family of G proteins, whereas FFA2 additionally couples to the Gαq/11 family (6Brown A.J. Goldsworthy S.M. Barnes A.A. Eilert M.M.

To avoid any potential bias in our assay results due to functional selectivity of tested ligands, we used the holistic, label-free Epic DMR assay, which monitors integrated traffic in the cell in real time without the need for epitope tagging or specific receptor probes (19Schröder R. Janssen N. Schmidt J. Kebig A. Merten N. Hennen S. Müller A. Blättermann S. Mohr-Andrä M. Zahn S. Wenzel J. Smith N.J. Gomeza J. Drewke C. Milligan G. Mohr K. Kostenis E. Nat.

Previously, we have demonstrated that DMR is a powerful assay platform for discerning the individual pathways activated by different GPCRs from all four G protein classes (Gαi/o, Gαs, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13) and is therefore unbiased yet also pathway-sensitive (19Schröder R. Janssen N. Schmidt J. Kebig A. Merten N. Hennen S. Müller A. Blättermann S. Mohr-Andrä M. Zahn S. Wenzel J. Smith N.J. Gomeza J. Drewke C. Milligan G. Mohr K. Kostenis E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, we initially tested the standard straight-chain orthosteric FFA2/FFA3 agonists, formate (C1), acetate (C2), propionate (C3), butyrate (C4), and valerate (C5), using the Epic DMR assay and compared these results with those obtained with the traditional [35S]GTPγS binding assay, which measures predominantly Gαi/o G protein activation (and hence is appropriate for both FFA2 and FFA3 signaling). In addition, second messenger accumulation in whole cells was examined using IP1 assays for FFA2 and cAMP accumulation assays for FFA3. Stimulation of Flp-In T-REx 293 cells stably transfected to express human FFA2 on demand resulted in positive deflections in DMR in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), the peaks of which can be converted into log concentration-response curves to determine potency and efficacy for each agonist (Fig. 1C, red symbols, and Table 1).

In this study we evaluate the effect of uremia on LDL carbamylation and the effect of cLDL and oxidized LDL (oxLDL; 200 μg/ml) on number, function, and genomic stability of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) obtained from healthy volunteers. cLDL was generated after incubation of native LDL (nLDL) with uremic serum from patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 2-4. Oxidative stress was measured by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy, mitochondrial depolarization by flow cytometry, senescence by β-galactosidase activity and telomere length, and DNA damage by phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX). The percentage of cLDL by uremic serum was related to the severity of CKD. Compared with nLDL, cLDL induced an increase in oxidative stress (62±5 vs. 8±3%, P<0.001) and cells with mitochondrial depolarization (73±7 vs. 9±5%, P<0.001), and a decrease in EPC proliferation and angiogenesis. cLDL also induced accelerated senescence (73±16 vs. 12±9%, P<0.001), which was associated with a decrease in the expression of γH2AX (62±9 vs. 5±3%, P<0.001). The degree of injury induced by cLDL was comparable to that observed with oxLDL. This study supports the hypothesis that cLDL triggers genomic damage in EPCs, resulting in premature senescence. We can, therefore, hypothesize that EPCs injury by cLDL contributes to an increase in atherosclerotic disease in CKD."

IntroductionIn eukaryotic cells, a variety of different agonists, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors, elicit cellular responses through a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4120) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ can be increased following Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, by Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane via Ca2+-permeable ion channels, or by both processes. In many cell types, the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores opens store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (2Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels activates a range of temporally distinct responses, including exocytosis, enzyme activation, and gene transcription (2Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol.

Targeted RNAi screens first identified STIM1, a single transmembrane-spanning domain protein found predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as being essential for CRAC channel activation (8Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Yeromin A.V. Ohlsen K. Lioudyno M. Zhang S. Safrina O. Kozak J.A. Wagner S.L. Cahalan M.D. Veliçelebi G. Stauderman K.A. J.

STIM1 has a Ca2+-binding EF-hand that faces the lumen of the ER, and site-directed mutagenesis has revealed that this likely senses the Ca2+ content of the store (9Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D.

Upon store depletion, Ca2+ dissociates from STIM1, and this is thought to promote multimerization through the N-terminal sterile α-motif (12Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), a step that is central to CRAC channel activation (13Luik R.M. Wang B. Prakriya M. Wu M.M. Lewis R.S. Nature. 2008; 454: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). STIM1 multimers then migrate to punctate structures <25 nm from the plasma membrane that correspond to ER-PM junctions (14Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). At such sites, STIM1 activates Orai1, a four-transmembrane domain plasma membrane protein that is also required for CRAC channel activity (10Zhang S.L. Yeromin A.V. Zhang X.H. Yu Y. Safrina O.

How is the migration process controlled? One idea is that STIM1 diffuses randomly in the ER but becomes trapped at the ER-PM junctions upon store depletion (24Wu M.M. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that STIM1 reaches the ER-PM junctions by active transport along microtubules (25Smyth J.T. DeHaven W.I. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3762-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and STIM1 binds directly to the microtubule plus-end tracking protein EB1 (26Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. van der Vaart B. Demmers J. Smyth J.T. Honnappa S. Splinter D. Steinmetz M.O. Putney Jr., J.W. Hoogenraad C.C. Akhmanova A. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 177-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interestingly, STIM1 has been found to co-localize with α-tubulin, and microtubule depolymerization reduces STIM1 puncta formation, supporting a role for the microtubule cytoskeleton (25Smyth J.T. DeHaven W.I. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3762-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, STIM1 can form puncta even when intracellular ATP levels have been depleted, suggesting its movement is a passive process (27Chvanov M. Walsh C.M. Haynes L.P. Voronina S.G. Lur G. Gerasimenko O.V. Barraclough R. Rudland P.S. Petersen O.H. Burgoyne R.D. Tepikin A.V. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 457: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).A solid body of evidence has demonstrated that mitochondria control CRAC channel activity (28Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 29Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B.

Although some of the effects of mitochondria arise from their ability to buffer cytoplasmic Ca2+ and thus reduce Ca2+-dependent inactivation of CRAC channels, growing evidence suggests that they might have an additional role in regulating CRAC channels that is unrelated to their ability to take up Ca2+, produce ATP, and generate reactive oxygen species (30Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22704-22714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mitochondria can be positioned adjacent to ER through interactions between proteins on the two organelles, with a major role for the mitochondrion-shaping protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) (35Parekh A.B. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R200-R203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36de Brito O.M. Scorrano L.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Mfn2 display loosened ER-mitochondria tethering and reduced rate of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake following InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER (36de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Whether this physical uncoupling impacts upon spatially more distal events is unclear.We show here that mitochondrial depolarization suppresses STIM1 puncta formation and subsequent Orai1-dependent CRAC currents, and these inhibitory effects can be partially overcome by overexpression of either STIM1 or a STIM1 mutant that occupies ER-PM junctions in nonstimulated cells with intact stores. In cells lacking Mfn2, STIM1 puncta formation and CRAC channel activity were independent of mitochondrial status, and analysis of Mfn2 mutants revealed a major role for mitochondrially targeted Mfn2. Our results identify a new role for mitochondria in cell biology, i.e. these organelles help regulate the movement of an ER-resident multimeric protein complex to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, our findings reveal Mfn2 as an important component in the mechanism whereby mitochondrial depolarization inhibits CRAC channel activity.DISCUSSIONActivation of the ubiquitous store-operated Ca2+ influx pathway by the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1 is a three-step process (12Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 13Luik R.M. Wang B. Prakriya M. Wu M.M. Lewis R.S. Nature. 2008; 454: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). First, upon store depletion STIM1 monomers come together to form multimers in the ER membrane. Second, the oligomers then migrate to specialized ER-PM junctions, resulting in punctate-like structures at the cell periphery. Finally, STIM1 activates the plasma membrane CRAC channels by binding to the N and C termini of Orai1 (20Park C.Y. Hoover P.J. Mullins F.M. Bachhawat P. Covington E.D. Raunser S. Walz T. Garcia K.C. Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Cell. 2009; 136: 876-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 21Yuan J.P. Zeng W. Dorwart M.R. Choi Y.J. Worley P.F. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have provided insight into how STIM1 senses store depletion and interacts with Orai1 channels, little is known about mechanisms that regulate STIM1 migration to the cell periphery. Our new results reveal that mitochondrial depolarization selectively regulates trafficking of STIM1 multimers to the plasma membrane and in a manner dependent on the mitochondrial protein Mfn 2.A substantial body of evidence has established that mitochondrial depolarization inhibits store-operated Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels and that energized mitochondria increase the size of the CRAC current (15Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar, 16Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A major factor contributing to this effect involves mitochondrial buffering of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (42Peinelt C. Vig M. Koomoa D.L. Beck A. Nadler M.J. Koblan-Huberson M. Lis A. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 43Mercer J.C. Dehaven W.I.

Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake reduces the extent of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of CRAC channels and thus leads to an enhanced Ca2+ entry. Our new findings add a further component to mitochondrial gating of CRAC channels that is independent of the Ca2+-buffering action and involves an action on STIM1 trafficking.How might mitochondrial depolarization be relayed to STIM1 proteins in the ER? The two organelles are held in close proximity to one another through interaction between proteins spanning the respective membranes with a major role for the dynamin-related protein Mfn 2 (36de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 37Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Mfn 2 is abundant at contact sites between ER and mitochondria, where it forms transorganellar homotypic and heterotypic interactions. Knock-out of the Mfn 2 gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts uncouples mitochondria from the ER and increases the distance between them (36de Brito O.M. Scorrano L. Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 37Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). By using Mfn 2-deficient cells, we found that STIM1 trafficking and store-operated Ca2+ entry were no longer impaired by mitochondrial depolarization. This suggests that Mfn2 is required to confer sensitivity of store-operated Ca2+ entry to mitochondrial depolarization, at least in MEF cells. Mfn2 is expressed both in the mitochondria and ER. By expressing Mfn 2 constructs in either mitochondria or ER in Mfn 2-deficient MEF cells, we found that mitochondrial Mfn 2 rendered store-operated Ca2+ entry sensitive to mitochondrial depolarization. It is unlikely that Mfn 2 senses mitochondrial depolarization directly because it is expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane (64Rojo M. Legros F. Chateau D. Lombès A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it can interact with inner mitochondrial membrane proteins, including OPA1 (35Parekh A.B. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R200-R203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 65Guillery O. Malka F. Landes T. Guillou E. Blackstone C. Lombès A. Belenguer P. Arnoult D. Rojo M. Biol. Cell. 2008; 100: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Hence, changes in mitochondrial potential could be relayed to the adjacent ER through protein-protein interactions with mitofusin 2 acting as a transducer. How does mitofusin 2 control STIM1 trafficking and thereby CRAC channel activation following mitochondrial depolarization? Strong overexpression of Mfn 2 leads to the formation of aggregates of mitochondria that are uncoupled from one another and clump around the nucleus (61Bach D. Pich S. Soriano F.X. Vega N. Baumgartner B. Oriola J. Daugaard J.R. Lloberas J. Camps M. Zierath J.R. Rabasa-Lhoret R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Laville M. Palacín M. Vidal H. Rivera F. Brand M. Zorzano A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2007; 86: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). De-energized mitochondria are less able to buffer cytosolic Ca2+, and this would result in stronger Ca2+-dependent inactivation of CRAC channels (29Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B.

Although this mechanism can help account for the reduced Ca2+ influx seen upon over expression of Mfn 2, it fails to explain the following: (i) why STIM1 movement after store depletion is impaired by mitochondrial depolarization in the absence of Ca2+ entry and when cytoplasmic Ca2+ is buffered with BAPTA, conditions that would prevent Ca2+-dependent inactivation of CRAC channels; and (ii) why STIM1 overexpression, at least partially, rescues Ca2+ entry in Mfn 2-overexpressing cells. An alternative mechanism involves a direct or indirect physical block on STIM1 movement by Mfn 2. This could be due either to steric hindrance whereby mitofusin 2 needs to be displaced from a site in order for STIM1 multimers to migrate toward ER-PM junctions or that a component of the mitochondrial tethering complex (which includes Mfn 2, voltage-dependent anion channel, Grp75, σ1 receptor, and PACS-2 (35Parekh A.B. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R200-R203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) binds to STIM1, thus impeding its movement toward the periphery. In either case, mitochondrial depolarization would be predicted to stabilize this interaction. Loss of Mfn 2 might therefore be expected to increase the number of STIM1 multimers that successfully migrate to ER-PM junctions, resulting in increased Ca2+ entry. Consistent with this, the rate of Ca2+ influx was slightly higher in Mfn 2-deficient cells (Fig. 7E).Although overexpression of STIM1 led to partial recovery of store-operated Ca2+ influx in HEK293 cells with depolarized mitochondria, the pattern of puncta formation was strikingly different from that seen in normal cells. After mitochondrial depolarization, electron micrograph analysis revealed that ∼40% less STIM1 migrated to the cell periphery after store depletion (Fig. 5D). TIRF measurements showed that although fewer puncta formed, they had a higher STIM1 intensity suggesting coalescence of individual puncta into larger structures. Despite such changes, store-operated Ca2+ influx still developed, albeit to a lesser extent. Hence, it would appear that formation of puncta per se is sufficient to activate several Orai1 channels, in that numerous discrete puncta are only moderately (∼2-fold) more effective in evoking Ca2+ entry that larger, merged structures. This would be consistent with the finding that disaggregation of microfilaments results in fewer, larger puncta being formed but without any effect on CRAC channel activity (66Luik R.M. Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar).What might be the physiological relevance for Mfn 2 regulation of STIM1 movement? Mfn 2 is not essential for the store-operated pathway because store-operated Ca2+ entry in both MEF fibroblasts and RBL cells (data not shown) was prominent despite its knockdown. Therefore, Mfn 2 has a regulatory role but not an essential one. Rather, its effects are manifest only after mitochondrial depolarization. Our results suggest Mfn 2 might serve as a brake, inhibiting Ca2+ entry only after mitochondria depolarize. Although significant fluctuations in the mitochondrial membrane potential have been reported in some intact cells, the sustained mitochondrial depolarization we have evoked is more typically seen following glutamate excitotoxicity in neurons. From a teleological standpoint, Mfn 2 regulation of STIM1 migration and subsequent CRAC channel opening might serve to oppose Ca2+ overload under conditions where mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering is compromised, due to collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Precisely how Mfn 2 controls migration of STIM1, its impact, if any, on Ca2+ entry under physiological levels of stimulation, and whether this mechanism contributes to mitofusin-related diseases such as Charcot-Marie tooth neuropathy await further study. IntroductionIn eukaryotic cells, a variety of different agonists, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors, elicit cellular responses through a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4120) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ can be increased following Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, by Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane via Ca2+-permeable ion channels, or by both processes. In many cell types, the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores opens store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (2Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 4Lewis R.S. Adv.

The best characterized store-operated Ca2+ channel is the CRAC 2The abbreviations used are: CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PM, plasma membrane; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; ActA, antimycin A; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; eYFP, enhanced YFP; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast. channel, which constitutes the major Ca2+ entry pathway in immune cells (5Hoth M.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels activates a range of temporally distinct responses, including exocytosis, enzyme activation, and gene transcription (2Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar, 7Parekh A.B. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Recently, the molecular basis of store-operated Ca2+ entry has been teased apart. Targeted RNAi screens first identified STIM1, a single transmembrane-spanning domain protein found predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as being essential for CRAC channel activation (8Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Yeromin A.V. Ohlsen K. Lioudyno M. Zhang S. Safrina O. Kozak J.A. Wagner S.L. Cahalan M.D. Veliçelebi G. Stauderman K.A. J.

STIM1 has a Ca2+-binding EF-hand that faces the lumen of the ER, and site-directed mutagenesis has revealed that this likely senses the Ca2+ content of the store (9Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D.

Upon store depletion, Ca2+ dissociates from STIM1, and this is thought to promote multimerization through the N-terminal sterile α-motif (12Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), a step that is central to CRAC channel activation (13Luik R.M. Wang B. Prakriya M. Wu M.M. Lewis R.S. Nature. 2008; 454: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). STIM1 multimers then migrate to punctate structures <25 nm from the plasma membrane that correspond to ER-PM junctions (14Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). At such sites, STIM1 activates Orai1, a four-transmembrane domain plasma membrane protein that is also required for CRAC channel activity (10Zhang S.L. Yeromin A.V. Zhang X.H. Yu Y. Safrina O.

In septic patients, Toll-like receptor tolerance is thought to underlie decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in response to LPS and increased incidence of microbial infections. The impact of endotoxin tolerance on recruitment, post-translational modifications and signalosome assembly of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 4, IRAK1, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK) 1, and IκB kinase (IKK) γ is largely unknown. We report that endotoxin tolerization of THP1 cells and human monocytes impairs LPS-mediated receptor recruitment and activation of IRAK4, ablates K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1 and TRAF6, compromises assembly of IRAK1-TRAF6 and IRAK1-IKKγ platforms, and inhibits TAK1 activation. Deficiencies in these signaling events in LPS-tolerant cells coincided with increased expression of A20, an essential deubiquitination enzyme, and sustained A20-IRAK1 associations. Overexpression of A20 inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and ablated NF-κB reporter activation driven by ectopic expression of MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK2, TRAF6, and TAK1/TAB1, while not affecting the responses induced by IKKβ and p65. A20 shRNA knockdown abolished LPS tolerization of THP1 cells, mechanistically linking A20 and endotoxin tolerance. Thus, deficient LPS-induced activation of IRAK4 and TAK1, K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1 and TRAF6, and disrupted IRAK1-TRAF6 and IRAK1-IKKγ assembly associated with increased A20 expression and A20-IRAK1 interactions are new determinants of endotoxin tolerance."

This regulatory process may be relevant to normal physiology and to disease states, as patients exposed chronically to excess glucocorticoids develop increased adiposity (4Orth D.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Thus, glucocorticoids together with their cognate glucocorticoid receptor protein serve as powerful biological probes of the molecular pathways that govern this subset of cell fate and differentiation decisions. Studies of glucocorticoid receptor action in physiologic processes might eventually advance development of novel therapeutic agents for a broad array of diseases, including those that accompany obesity, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia) (5Phinney D.G. Prockop D.J. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2896-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). Therefore, to discern molecular mechanisms driving adipocyte fate and differentiation, we sought to identify glucocorticoid-regulated target genes whose products participate directly in these decisions and to characterize their activities. Mesenchymal stem cells, also called mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), 6The abbreviations used are: MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; qPCR, quantitative PCR; IP, immunoprecipitation; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-response element. are progenitor cells that reside in the bone marrow and vascular wall and are capable of differentiating into cells that form cartilage, muscle, bone, or fat (6Pittenger M.F.

Induction of MSC fate determination into distinct lineages can be initiated with defined reagents and monitored at the molecular level. In particular, glucocorticoids potently induce the adipocyte cell fate in these cells, thus, providing a well defined experimental starting point for analyses of mammalian cell fate decisions (10Hong J.H.

Interestingly, clock components affect adipogenesis (18Shimba S. Ishii N. Ohta Y. Ohno T. Watabe Y. Hayashi M. Wada T. Aoyagi T. Tezuka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In view of these findings, we were curious to determine whether clock components play functional roles in the glucocorticoid cell fate decision that commits MSCs to adipogenesis. Here we show that the Period 3 gene (Per3), previously known for a minor role in modulating circadian rhythms, is regulated by glucocorticoids in primary MSCs and is a potent inhibitor of the adipocyte cell fate decision. We demonstrate that this function is achieved through interactions with PPARγ and the formation of a transcriptional regulatory complex. Consistent with these results in isolated cells, our in vivo studies demonstrate that Per3 knock-out mice display altered body composition (increased adipose and decreased muscle) as well as glucose intolerance. Mouse MSCs were harvested from the femurs and tibias of mice between 2 and 3 months of age. The ends of the bone were cut off, and the bone marrow was ejected by inserting a 23-gauge needle into the bone marrow cavity and flushing out the marrow with ∼2 ml of Iscove's media with 2% fetal bovine serum per bone. Flushed bone marrow was filtered and placed in culture flasks with mesenchymal stem cell enrichment media (Stem Cell Technologies). Media was changed every day for 3 days to remove the hematopoietic/non-adherent cells and then every other day thereafter. When large circular colonies of MSCs grew in flasks, the cells were trypsinized and passaged to enrich for MSCs. 3T3-L1 cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Equal amounts of RNA were reverse-transcribed (∼500 ng of RNA for a 20-μl reverse transcription reaction) using random priming, and the relative transcript level was measured by quantitative PCR using a 7300 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) or a CFX96 system (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are available in supplemental Table S1. MSCs were seeded into 12-well plates (Falcon) and allowed to grow to confluence. Cells were maintained at confluence for 2 days and then induced with the glucocorticoid mixture (1 μm dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.115 mg/ml 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine) and 25 μm indomethacin) for 3 days followed by 1 day in basal media and then a second induction with glucocorticoid mixture. Thereafter, cells were maintained in basal media, which was changed every other day. Adipogenesis was allowed to continue for a total of 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of culture, cells were photographed under a phase microscope (Nikon), and RNA was extracted as described above. 3T3-L1 cells were passaged fewer than 10 times before experiments. For differentiation, cells were grown to confluence and then switched to DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum with a glucocorticoid mixture (described above) for 2 days. Cells were then cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 6 more days. MSCs were seeded in 12-well plates (Falcon). After cells grew to confluence, media were replaced with mesenchymal stem cell enrichment media (Stem Cell Technologies) containing either vehicle (DMSO) or 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) (which has previously been shown to synchronize the clock in confluent cell culture by bringing all cells into the same phase (20Balsalobre A.

Cells were harvested at each time point, and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). ChIP from 3T3-L1 cells was performed according to So et al. (17So A.Y. Bernal T.U. Pillsbury M.L. Yamamoto K.R. Feldman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17582-17587Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). 12 μg of Per3 antibody (Alpha Diagnostic) or PPARγ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG control (Sigma) were conjugated to 50 μl of Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for each ChIP sample. ChiP-quantitative PCR (qPCR) signals were calculated as percent of input using the formula 100 × 29(adjusted Ct of input − Ct of ChIP)9 to compare with the IgG control and using the ΔΔCt method to compare with other DNA elements. Sequential ChIPs were performed on 3T3-L1 cells grown in 5 × 15-cm diameter dishes and exposed to glucocorticoid mixture for 12 h. COS-7 cells were grown in 24-well plates (Falcon) to 95% confluence. Cells were transfected with a 3X-PPRE-luc reporter construct (Addgene, submitted by Bruce Spiegelman) as well as pcDNA3.1 expression plasmids with Per3 and PPARγ or an empty pcDNA3.1 control vector. A co-transfected Renilla expression plasmid was used for normalization. 36 h after transfection, cells were lysed, and dual luciferase assays (Promega) were performed. COS-7 cells were grown to confluence and transfected with Pparγ (pCMX backbone) or Per3 (pEF6/V5-His backbone) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA). Anti-PPARγ antibody (H-100, Santa Cruz) or control IgG (10 μg each) was pre-bound to Dynabeads (Invitrogen), and proteins were immunoprecipitated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocomplexes were eluted in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. PER3 was detected using an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) followed by goat anti-mouse HRP (Santa Cruz) and PPARγ using the H-100 antibody (Santa Cruz) followed by Clean-Blot IP Detection Reagent-HRP (Thermo Scientific). For assays using in vitro transcribed and translated protein, PER3 was produced and labeled with [35S]methionine, and PPARγ was generated using unlabeled methionine in vitro using the TNT T7 Quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Reactions were then mixed with binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) overnight at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Protein complexes were then precipitated as described above. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes followed by autoradiography. PPARγ was detected by Western blot. The N-terminal region of Per3 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX5 to generate GST fusion proteins. Expression plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli and induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Recombinant 35S-labeled PPARγ, RXRα and luciferase proteins were generated as above. Pulldown assays were carried out using the MagneGST Pull-Down System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that binding/wash buffer was supplemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 200 mm NaCl. The Per3 knock-out allele was made congenic on a C57Bl6/2J background by greater than 10 backcrosses to this strain. Animals were maintained in 12-h light/12-h dark cycles. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Per3−/− (n = 8) and wild-type (n = 8) mice were fasted for 15 h (overnight). Fasting blood sugar was measured using a One Touch Ultra 2 glucometer (Johnson & Johnson) with blood from a nicked tail vein. Two mg/kg of glucose was injected into the peritoneal cavity of each animal. Blood sugar was measured at times 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min using the glucometer. Similar age male C57Bl6/2J mice (wild type (n = 7) and Per3−/− (n = 7)) were fasted for 4 h and anesthetized with isoflurane before scanning. The lean, fat, and total masses were measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar PIXImus2). The percentage of lean and fat in mice was calculated as the corresponding tissue mass divided by the total animal mass. Period 3 (Per3) has been classified as a circadian rhythm gene. However, the function of Per3 is poorly understood, and knock-out mice have been reported to have only subtle alterations in circadian rhythmicity (21Shearman L.P. Jin X. Lee C. Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6269-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In a previous microarray study performed in the C3H10T1/2 cell line, which possesses some MSC-like properties, we found that Per3 is differentially expressed in cells exposed to glucocorticoids compared with control (22So A.Y. Cooper S.B. Feldman B.J. Manuchehri M. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5745-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As glucocorticoids are essential for selecting the adipocyte cell fate in MSCs, we hypothesized that Per3 plays a role in mediating the cell fate actions of glucocorticoids. To begin to assess the significance of the Per3 response to glucocorticoids, we performed time-course qPCR expression studies in primary mouse MSCs. We found that the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone triggers a circadian reduction of Per3 transcript levels in primary mouse MSCs (Fig. 1A). Knock-out of Per3 in mice has a minimal effect on circadian rhythmicity (21Shearman L.P. Jin X. Lee C. Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6269-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, because of previous indications of a link between circadian clock components and adipogenesis and because glucocorticoids are essential for selecting the adipocyte fate in MSCs, we tested whether Per3 might control a cell fate decision in MSCs despite little effect on circadian rhythm. Indeed, we found that constitutive overexpression of PER3 in transfected primary mouse and human MSCs dramatically blocked adipogenesis, whereas control cells maintained competency (Fig. 1B). Adipocyte formation was visualized under phase microscopy by the appearance of large rounded cells, each containing lipid droplets, which is the classic, unique morphology of an adipocyte. Confirmation of the presence of lipid droplets was obtained by staining the cells with Oil Red O, which stains neutral lipids (Fig. 1B, upper and middle panels). In a process that may be related to their effect on MSCs, glucocorticoids are also an essential component of a mixture of factors that induces adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 cell line. Therefore, we also tested the effect of constitutive PER3 overexpression on dexamethasone mixture-induced adipogenesis in 3T3-L1. Again, PER3 robustly blocked adipogenesis (Fig. 1B, bottom panels). Thus, enforced PER3 expression inhibits adipocyte formation, suggesting that down-regulation of PER3 expression may be an essential step in the adipocyte cell fate decision. Given the efficacy of PER3 in blocking adipogenesis, we speculated that decreasing PER3 expression might result in an enhancement of the adipocyte fate decision. Indeed, 2 weeks post-induction with glucocorticoid mixture, primary MSCs isolated from Per3 knock-out (Per3−/−) mice had a significantly higher level of adipogenesis than MSCs from wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). As an objective measure of adipogenesis in these assays, we assessed the expression levels of the adipocyte markers aP2 and Pparγ and found that Per3−/− cells had ∼4-fold higher transcript levels of the adipocyte marker aP2 and over 2-fold higher Pparγ levels than wild-type MSCs (Fig. 2, B and C), whereas expression of non-adipocyte control genes was unaffected. These results indicate that endogenous Per3 inhibits the adipocyte fate decision in MSCs and that elimination of Per3 expression enhances adipogenesis. Because certain core clock components other than Per3 are known to impact adipogenesis in murine cell lines (18Shimba S. Ishii N. Ohta Y. Ohno T. Watabe Y. Hayashi M. Wada T. Aoyagi T. Tezuka M.

Biol. 2008; 28: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and in mice (23Liu C. Li S. Liu T. Borjigin J. Lin J.D. Nature. 2007; 447: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 24Turek F.W. Joshu C. Kohsaka A. Lin E. Ivanova G. McDearmon E. Laposky A. Losee-Olson S. Easton A. Jensen D.R. Eckel R.H.

PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e377Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), perhaps the effect of Per3 on MSC cell fate is secondary to its actions on those other clock components. We, therefore, tested whether Per3 deletion in MSCs produces a global disruption of the greater circadian clock. To this end we synchronized the circadian clock in wild-type and Per3−/− MSCs with glucocorticoids. We then measured the expression levels of the core clock components Cry1 and Rev-erbα at multiple time points over 48 h. We found that the expression levels of these core clock components were indistinguishable between wild-type and Per3−/− MSCs (data not shown). Thus, Per3 deletion increases adipogenesis in MSCs without dramatically disturbing the core clock, implying that the cell fate regulation function of Per3 could be “off pathway” and uncoupled from its role in the circadian clock. In any case, it is apparent that the Per3 effect on cell fate is not merely secondary to an effect on circadian cycling. PPARγ is a nuclear receptor that is both necessary and sufficient for adipocyte fate determination (26Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3073) Google Scholar). Given our finding that PER3 potently blocks this fate decision (Fig. 1B), we speculated that PER3 might directly affect PPARγ activity, perhaps via protein-protein interaction; such an interaction would parallel the finding that the PER2 protein interacts with nuclear receptors PPARα and REV-ERBα and serves as a coregulator (27Schmutz I. Ripperger J.A. Baeriswyl-Aebischer S. Albrecht U. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between PER3 and PPARγ, we first tested whether they could interact in cell extracts. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed on cell lysates from COS-7 cells overexpressing PER3 and PPARγ. Indeed, we found that PER3 formed a complex with PPARγ (Fig. 3A). PER3 contains conserved Per-ARNT-SIM (PAS) protein-protein interaction motifs at the N-terminal region (28Huang Z.J. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Therefore, we co-expressed amino acids 1–378 of PER3 with PPARγ to test if the interaction specifically mapped to this region. We found that this region of PER3 did co-IP with PPARγ, whereas a truncated PER3 protein with this region deleted failed to precipitate (Fig. 3B). We then tested the interaction between PER3 and PPARγ recombinant proteins, generated from in vitro transcription and translation. We confirmed that the recombinant proteins co-IP with cognate but not control IgG antibodies (Fig. 3C). As with the co-IP in cells, the recombinant N-terminal region of PER3 specifically precipitated with PPARγ, whereas PER3 with this region deleted failed to co-IP (Fig. 3D). To test this interaction with a third approach, we generated a GST fusion with amino acids 1–378 of PER3 and expressed this fusion protein in E. coli. This PER3 fusion protein recovered recombinant PPARγ in a GST pulldown assay, whereas GST alone did not pull down PPARγ (Fig. 3E). As specificity controls, we also tested if the PER3 fusion protein would interact with the nuclear receptor RXRα or the presumably unrelated luciferase protein. PER3 failed to pull down either of these proteins, demonstrating the specificity of the PPARγ-PER3 interaction (Fig. 3E). To investigate if the domain that interacts with PPARγ is necessary for the adipocyte fate regulatory activity of PER3, we compared the activity of a mutant lacking this domain to full-length PER3 in a 3T3-L1 adipogenesis assay. We found that this domain was necessary for PER3 to block adipogenesis (Fig. 3F). However, expression of the interaction domain alone was not sufficient to block adipogenesis (Fig. 3F), indicating that other parts of the PER3 protein participate in coordinating the activity upon PER3 binding to PPARγ. PPARγ is a nuclear receptor that binds to well characterized response elements (PPREs) and modulates transcription (29Lefterova M.I. Zhang Y. Steger D.J. Schupp M. Schug J. Cristancho A. Feng D. Zhuo D. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Liu X.S. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2941-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 30Nielsen R. Pedersen T.A. Hagenbeek D. Moulos P. Siersbaek R. Megens E. Denissov S. Børgesen M. Francoijs K.J. Mandrup S. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2953-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To test whether PER3 modulates PPARγ transcriptional regulatory activity, we utilized a reporter system with three tandem PPARγ DNA binding motifs upstream of a minimal promoter. As expected and previously described (31Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar), luciferase reporter activity was induced by PPARγ expression (Fig. 4A). Importantly, co-expression of PER3 with PPARγ blocked the induction of the reporter activity both in the basal state and after stimulation with the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone (Fig. 4A). Thus, PER3 can inhibit PPARγ activity in this context, consistent with the view that PER3 might function by this mechanism to block adipocyte cell fate and differentiation. We next sought to test whether PER3 could inhibit PPARγ-regulated transcription at an endogenous PPARγ target gene. The adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein gene (aP2, also called Fabp4) was selected for these studies because it is regulated by endogenous levels of PPARγ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (30Nielsen R. Pedersen T.A. Hagenbeek D. Moulos P. Siersbaek R. Megens E. Denissov S. Børgesen M. Francoijs K.J. Mandrup S. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2953-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and is induced by PPARγ during adipogenesis (32Graves R.A. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1202-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PPRE regulating aP2 expression has been mapped and characterized (33Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar), and we were able to confirm enrichment of PPARγ at this site in preadipocytes (data not shown). Therefore, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of PER3 in 3T3-L1 cells followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) in the region of this PPRE and found a significant enrichment of PER3 around the aP2 PPRE (Fig. 4B). We also assessed PER3 occupancy in the region of a PPARγ binding site identified by Lefterova et al. (29Lefterova M.I. Zhang Y. Steger D.J. Schupp M. Schug J. Cristancho A. Feng D. Zhuo D. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Liu X.S. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2941-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) (PPRE_472) that is located within the third intron of the Lamb3 gene but failed to detect a significant enrichment of PER3 near that site (Fig. 4B), suggesting that PER3 associates with select PPARγ binding sites. To investigate if PER3 and PPARγ co-occupy the aP2 PPRE, we performed a sequential ChIP experiment with PER3 followed by PPARγ. We detected significant co-enrichment of PER3 and PPARγ at the aP2 PPRE compared with trivial levels at the site in Lamb3 (Fig. 4C), indicating that PER3 and PPARγ form a complex at select PPARγ DNA binding sites. We next tested the functional implications of PER3 enrichment at an endogenous PPRE in the regulation of aP2 expression. Using qRT-PCR, we measured endogenous transcript levels of aP2 in 3T3-L1 cells with overexpression of Per3. We found that overexpression of Per3 inhibited aP2 expression compared with control (Fig. 4D). In addition, we found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of Per3 resulted in the opposite trend, with increased levels of aP2 expression compared with the scramble shRNA control (data not shown). On the other hand, Lamb3 expression levels were not significantly altered by either overexpression or shRNA knockdown of Per3 (Fig. 4D and data not shown). We also measured the expression levels of two other known direct PPARγ target genes and found that Per3 statistically significantly inhibited one (Gpd1) but not the other (Srebf1) (Fig. 4D). Together, these results indicate that Per3 functions as an inhibitor of PPARγ activity at select endogenous response elements. To investigate whether these results have physiological relevance, we then studied the systemic implications of deleting Per3. As mentioned, prior evaluations of Per3−/− mice had identified a slight shortening of the circadian cycle length without change in activity level (21Shearman L.P. Jin X. Lee C. Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6269-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 34Bae K. Weaver D.R. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2007; 22: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our findings, that Per3 functions as a regulator of cell fate prompted us to investigate the impact of deleting Per3 on overall body composition. Therefore, we placed Per3−/− and wild-type littermate mice on a 9% fat diet and monitored total body composition using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning, which quantifies both lean and fat mass (35Brommage R. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E454-E459Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Others have shown that Per3−/− mice do not have altered food intake (36Dallmann R. Weaver D.R. Chronobiol. Int. 2010; 27: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, although we found that whereas the total body weights of the Per3−/− mice were similar to their wild-type littermates, the body composition of the animals was strikingly distinct (Fig. 5A). Whereas 45% of the total body mass of the Per3−/− animals was adipose tissue, only 30% was present in the wild-type controls. Interestingly, the adipocyte size was similar across the genotypes (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the increased mass was most likely caused by an increased number of adipocytes. Per3−/− mice had only 55% lean mass, whereas wild-type mice were composed of 70% lean mass (Fig. 5A). This demonstrates that not only do Per3−/− mice have increased total adipose tissue, they also have a concomitant decrease in their lean mass. Lean mass is primarily composed of muscle. Therefore, we conclude that this phenotype is consistent with alterations in stem cell fate decisions occurring in vivo. Adipose and muscle are critical tissues for systemic energy utilization and storage. Muscle is a major site for glucose uptake and increased adipose results in glucose intolerance and diabetes (37Lazar M.A. Science. 2005; 307: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 38Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. Obesity. 2006; 14: 34S-40SCrossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the alterations in body composition in Per3−/− animals would correlate with altered glucose tolerance. In fact, Per3−/− mice were glucose intolerant compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 5C), demonstrating a physiological significance of our findings. Stem cell fate decisions can be influenced and manipulated, opening up the potential for therapeutic interventions. Glucocorticoids have been shown to dramatically influence fate decisions, most notably the induction of adipocyte fate. Studies utilizing this potent effect have revealed critical pathways involved in adipogenesis (39Rosen E.D. MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). However, very little is understood about the initial molecular events regulated by glucocorticoids that trigger these differentiation pathways. By focusing on events regulated by glucocorticoids, we discovered a novel function for Per3 as a potent regulator of the adipocyte cell fate decision. It will be interesting in future studies to determine whether Per3 participates in other glucocorticoid-regulated cell fate decisions (40Anderson D.J. Axel R. Cell. 1986; 47: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate whether the regulation of cell fate by Per3 is connected to the circadian clock or if this is an off pathway function. Prior studies have demonstrated that circadian rhythmicity has an important influence on stem cells (41Méndez-Ferrer S. Lucas D. Battista M. Frenette P.S. Nature. 2008; 452: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), making the former scenario highly plausible. However, Per3 appears to be excluded from core clock functions, and in vivo deletion of Per3 results in only subtle effects on period (21Shearman L.P. Jin X. Lee C. Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6269-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 42Bae K. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Neuron. 2001; 30: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In addition, our data indicate that Per3 has some unique properties that may fall outside these pathways. For example, we found that deletion and overexpression of Per3 confer opposite effects on cell fate. If disruption of oscillation were the primary important effect, one would predict both interventions should have similar impacts. Furthermore, disruption of Per3 did not appear to affect oscillation of core clock components. One unifying model is that Per3 is circadian-regulated but is not itself a clock component. This is also consistent with prior reports indicating that Per3 does not play an important role in the circadian clock mechanism regulating locomotor activity (42Bae K. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Neuron. 2001; 30: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In this model, Per3 could serve as a downstream target of the circadian clock in regulating cell fate. This hypothesis is appealing because it provides a further molecular mechanism to the physiological connections between circadian rhythms and cell fate. Our studies also provide an initial model for the mechanism by which Per3 regulates cell fate; we found that PPARγ can interact with PER3 in cell extracts under conditions of overexpression and that endogenous PER3 and PPARγ co-localize at an endogenous PPRE. We also found that overexpression of Per3 inhibits expression of an endogenous target gene that Per3 and PPARγ co-occupy. We propose that PER3 serves as a co-regulator of PPRE-bound PPARγ, inhibiting its activity and thereby inhibiting the promotion of adipocyte fate by PPARγ. In this model repression is relieved by pro-adipogenic signals that down-regulate Per3 expression, such as glucocorticoids. The significance of the PPARγ-PER3 interaction in extracts remains to be determined. However, it is clear that PER3 and PPARγ co-occupy genomic regions near some PPARγ binding motifs and not others; the selectivity of PER3 occupancy may reflect sequence-specific allosteric effects on DNA-binding protein activity and co-factor association (43Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). As predicted from our ex vivo results, Per3−/− mice have systemic alterations consistent with altered cell fate lineage determination including changes in body composition with increased adipose and decreased muscle. In addition, Per3−/− mice have abnormalities in glucose homeostasis. Therefore, in addition to extending our understanding of stem cell biology and the mechanisms that regulate cell fate decisions, these results also have implications for systemic physiology and pathophysiology. While this manuscript was in post-submission revision, Grimaldi et al. (44Grimaldi B. Bellet M.M. Katada S. Astarita G. Hirayama J. Amin R.H. Granneman J.G. Piomelli D. Leff T. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell Metab. 2010; 12: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) reported that the period paralog protein PER2 regulated lipid metabolism at least in part by inhibiting PPARγ activity. Interestingly, they found that PER2 blocked PPARγ from occupying PPREs as opposed to inhibiting PPARγ activity at response elements as we show occurs with PER3 regulation of adipocyte fate decision. Together, these studies suggest the Per paralogs modulate PPARγ activity in multiple contexts and by using potentially synergistic mechanisms.

The transactivator protein Tat is essential for HIV-1 transcription. Tat enhances HIV-1 transcription elongation through binding to the transactivation-responsive RNA (TAR) 2The abbreviations used are: TAR, transactivation-responsive RNA; CycT1, cyclin T1; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; HDAC, histone deacetylase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. structure, a stem-loop formed at the 5′-end of viral transcripts (1Feng S.

The interaction of Tat with TAR is in concert with cyclin T1 (CycT1), a component of positive transcription elongation factor b. CycT1 associates with both Tat and TAR to form a ternary complex and recruits Cdk9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9), another component of positive transcription elongation factor b, to the vicinity of the HIV-1 LTR (3Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Cdk9 then phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, resulting in increased efficiency of HIV-1 transcription elongation (4Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The transactivation activity of Tat is regulated by acetylation (5Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C.

Tat is acetylated at Lys-28 by p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and the acetylation enhances HIV-1 transcription elongation by strengthening assembly of the Tat-CycT1-TAR complex (5Kiernan R.E.

Lys-50 in Tat is deacetylated by the class III protein deacetylase SIRT1 (sirtuin 1), which allows Tat to be recycled to TAR for subsequent rounds of HIV-1 transcription (12Pagans S. Pedal A. North B.J. Kaehlcke K. Marshall B.L. Dorr A. Hetzer-Egger C. Henklein P. Frye R. McBurney M.W. Hruby H. Jung M. Verdin E. Ott M. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, SIRT2 and SIRT3, two other deacetylases in the class III family, have been shown to deacetylate Tat at Lys-50 (12Pagans S. Pedal A. North B.J. Kaehlcke K. Marshall B.L. Dorr A.

The deacetylase that mediates Lys-28 deacetylation has not yet been identified. Trichostatin A, a pan-inhibitor of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs), has been shown to enhance Tat acetylation, and this action of trichostatin A is preserved when Lys-50 is mutated to an unacetylatable residue (5Kiernan R.E.

In this study, we provide the first evidence that HDAC6, a member of the class II HDAC family, is a Tat deacetylase. Our data reveal that HDAC6 binds Tat and deacetylates Tat at Lys-28 in a microtubule-dependent manner and thereby regulates Tat transactivation activity.

Fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. The mammalian expression plasmids pEGFPC1-Tat, pcDNA3-FLAG-HDAC6, pCMV-HA-HDAC6, and pcDNA3-FLAG-CycT1 were generated by PCR, and pCMV-FLAG-Tat has been described previously (13Huo L. Li D. Sun L.

The CMV promoter-driven luciferase plasmid was generated by cloning luciferase cDNA into the pCMV plasmid, and the HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase plasmid has been described previously (12Pagans S.

GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and His fusion proteins were purified with the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow system (Qiagen). HEK293 and Jurkat cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. HDAC6+/+ and HDAC6−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have been described previously (14Gao Y.S. Hubbert C.C. Lu J. Lee Y.S. Lee J.Y. Yao T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8637-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells in RPMI 1640 medium and other cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were cultured in the indicated media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Plasmid transfections were performed using polyethyleneimine reagent (Sigma). siRNAs were synthesized by RiboBio and transfected into cells with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). HIV-1 viruses pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) were generated by cotransfection of HEK293 cells with the pSG3ΔEnv proviral vector and pCMV-VSV-G, and virus-containing supernatants were used to infect cells. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using the Matchmaker Gal4 two-hybrid system following the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). The yeast strain AH109 was transformed with the bait plasmid pGBT9-Tat, which encodes Tat fused to the DNA-binding domain of Ga14, and a pACT2 vector-based human leukocyte cDNA library encoding proteins fused to the activation domain of Ga14. The activity of β-galactosidase was measured by standard protocols. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with antibodies against FLAG and HDAC6 and then with fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by staining with the nuclear dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. Coverslips were mounted with 90% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline and examined with a TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with antibody-coated agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. For GST pulldown, GST fusion proteins immobilized on Sepharose beads were incubated with purified His fusion proteins at 4 °C for 2 h. Proteins present on the beads of immunocomplexes or pulldown preparations were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Samples were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked and incubated with primary antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Specific proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Millipore). Lys-28- or Lys-50-acetylated Tat was synthesized by Invitrogen and immobilized on anti-Tat antibody-coated agarose beads. The beads were incubated with purified His-HDAC6 in the absence or presence of preformed microtubules and immunoblotted with anti-Ack and anti-Tat antibodies. RNA was isolated from HIV-1-infected Jurkat cells using RNAwiz reagent (Ambion). HIV-1 transcripts were then quantified by real-time RT-PCR with the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with the HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase plasmid or the CMV promoter-driven luciferase plasmid and a β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid. The luciferase activity was measured using an FB12 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. To measure the transactivation activity of Tat, cells were transfected with the GFP-Tat expression plasmid or empty vector in addition to the above plasmids, and the extent of transactivation -fold) was determined. To identify Tat-interacting proteins, we screened a human leukocyte cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system with Tat as bait. We obtained three positive clones containing HDAC6 cDNA fragments of different length. Yeast cells transformed with HDAC6 showed strong β-galactosidase activity in a Tat-dependent pattern (Fig. 1A), indicating an interaction of HDAC6 with Tat in yeast. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GFP-Tat interacted with HA-HDAC6 but not with HA-HDAC5 in mammalian cells (Fig. 1, B and C), demonstrating specificity of the Tat-HDAC6 interaction. We further found that GFP-Tat interacted with endogenous HDAC6 in mammalian cells (Fig. 1D). In addition, GFP-Tat interacted with FLAG-tagged H216A/H611A, an inactive mutant of HDAC6, in a manner similar to its interaction with wild-type HDAC6 (Fig. 1E), indicating that the Tat-HDAC6 interaction is independent of the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. By GST pulldown assay, we further found that purified His-HDAC6 did not interact with purified GST-Tat, although it could interact with purified GST-cortactin as described previously (Fig. 1F) (15Zhang X. Yuan Z. Zhang Y. Yong S. Salas-Burgos A. Koomen J. Olashaw N. Parsons J.T. Yang X.J. Dent S.R. Yao T.P. Lane W.S. Seto E. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 197-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the interaction between Tat and HDAC6 in cells is mediated by an indirect mechanism. To identify the Tat interaction domain on HDAC6, cells were transfected with GFP-Tat and FLAG-tagged wild-type HDAC6 or deletion mutants. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that Tat interacted with sequence 411–1215 of HDAC6, similar to its interaction with wild-type HDAC6 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Tat did not interact with sequence 1–1091 (lacking the ubiquitin-binding zinc finger, Buz), 1–840, 1–503, or 841–1215 of HDAC6. These data indicate that both the second catalytic domain and the Buz domain of HDAC6 are critical for its interaction with Tat. Similarly, by deletion mutant analysis, we found that the cysteine-rich domain of Tat is important for HDAC6 binding (Fig. 2B). To identify the cellular location of the Tat-HDAC6 interaction, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates. We found that HDAC6 interacted with Tat in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). In contrast, in agreement with previous findings (16Gautier V.W. Gu L. O'Donoghue N. Pennington S. Sheehy N. Hall W.W. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Vardabasso C. Manganaro L. Lusic M. Marcello A. Giacca M. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18De Marco A. Dans P.D. Knezevich A. Maiuri P. Pantano S. Marcello A. Amino Acids. 2010; 38: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), CycT1, lamin B, SIN3A, and human NAP-1 were seen in the nuclear immunoprecipitates of Tat (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy further revealed a significant colocalization of cytoplasmic Tat and HDAC6 (Fig. 3C), providing additional support for their interaction in the cytoplasm. We then investigated the molecular mechanism mediating the Tat-HDAC6 interaction. To this end, we first examined the possibility that these two proteins might interact in the cytoplasm through Hic, a protein known to contribute to the cytoplasmic localization of Tat (19Gautier V.W. Sheehy N. Duffy M. Hashimoto K. Hall W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16362-16367Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitation assays, we found that the Tat-HDAC6 interaction was compromised by siRNAs against HDAC6 but not Hic (Fig. 3D), thus ruling out this possibility. Another possible way for Tat and HDAC6 to interact lies in the microtubule cytoskeleton because both HDAC6 and Tat possess microtubule-binding capacity (20Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 21Chen D. Wang M. Zhou S. Zhou Q. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6801-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and tubulin association was detected for all the deletion mutants of Tat that could interact with HDAC6 (Fig. 2B). We tested this possibility by treating cells with nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent. We observed that nocodazole attenuated the interaction of Tat with HDAC6 (Fig. 3E). We further found that Tat(36–39)A, a previously described Tat mutant that does not associate with microtubules/tubulin (21Chen D. Wang M. Zhou S. Zhou Q. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6801-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), failed to interact with HDAC6 (Fig. 3F). In addition, in agreement with previous results (22Egelé C. Barbier P. Didier P. Piémont E. Allegro D. Chaloin O. Muller S. Peyrot V. Mély Y. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), TatΔ(22–37), a zinc binding-defective Tat mutant, did not interact with tubulin or HDAC6 (Fig. 3F). GST pulldown assay showed that Tat interacted with HDAC6 in vitro upon addition of preformed microtubules (Fig. 3G), providing additional evidence for a role of microtubules in mediating the Tat-HDAC6 interaction. Collectively, these data indicate that Tat and HDAC6 interact in the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent manner. We then examined whether HDAC6 is a deacetylase of Tat. As shown in Fig. 4A, knockdown of HDAC6 increased the acetylation level of Tat without changing its expression. Conversely, overexpression of HA-HDAC6 or FLAG-HDAC6 reduced Tat acetylation (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, the ΔBuz mutant of HDAC6, which was unable to interact with Tat (Fig. 2A), did not affect Tat acetylation (Fig. 4C). In addition, the inactive mutant of HDAC6 did not alter Tat acetylation (Fig. 4C), although this mutant was able to interact with Tat (Fig. 1E). To verify Tat deacetylation by HDAC6, cells were transfected with GFP-Tat in the presence of tubacin, a specific inhibitor of HDAC6 (23Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4389-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). We found that tubacin increased Tat acetylation in a dose-dependent manner without altering Tat expression (Fig. 4D). To further study the effect of HDAC6 on Tat acetylation, we used MEFs derived from HDAC6 wild-type and knock-out mice (14Gao Y.S. Hubbert C.C. Lu J. Lee Y.S. Lee J.Y. Yao T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8637-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). HDAC6−/− MEFs showed higher Tat acetylation levels compared with HDAC6+/+ MEFs, and tubacin increased Tat acetylation in HDAC6+/+ MEFs but not in HDAC6−/− MEFs (Fig. 4E). In addition, Tat deacetylation by HDAC6 was blocked by nocodazole (Fig. 4F). Thus, microtubules are critical for Tat deacetylation by HDAC6. To identify the lysine residue in Tat that is deacetylated by HDAC6, we mutated individually Lys-28 and Lys-50 to alanine, which eliminates possible acetylation. Tubacin increased the acetylation of wild-type and K50A Tat to a similar extent (∼4.4-fold) (Fig. 4G). In contrast, tubacin induced only a slight increase in the acetylation of K28A (1.5-fold). Furthermore, in the presence of microtubules, purified His-HDAC6 was able to deacetylate synthetic Lys-28-acetylated Tat but not Lys-50-acetylated Tat (Fig. 4H). Taken together, these results indicate that HDAC6 deacetylates Tat at Lys-28. Using an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase plasmid, we found that HA-HDAC6 decreased the transactivation activity of Tat, and this effect of HDAC6 was blocked by nocodazole (Fig. 5A). We also found that HDAC6 could decrease the transactivation activity of Tat when cells were transfected with different amounts of GFP-Tat (Fig. 5B). Importantly, HDAC6 did not affect the transcription activity of the CMV promoter, a promoter used to drive the expression of GFP-Tat and HA-HDAC6 in these cotransfection experiments (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrate the specificity of the inhibitory effect of HDAC6 on Tat-mediated HIV-1 transcriptional transactivation. We also found that Tat transactivation activity was reduced by FLAG-tagged wild-type HDAC6 but not by the inactive mutant or the ΔBuz mutant (Fig. 5C). In addition, transfection of cells with HDAC6 siRNAs or treatment of cells with tubacin increased Tat transactivation activity (Fig. 5, D and E). We next sought to examine the role of HDAC6 in HIV-1 infection. Jurkat T cells were transfected with HA-HDAC6 and then infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1. The VSV-G envelope, instead of the HIV-1 envelope, was used to restrict analysis to a single infection cycle and to eliminate the negative effect of HDAC6 on HIV-1 entry as reported previously (24Valenzuela-Fernández A. Alvarez S. Gordon-Alonso M. Barrero M. Ursa A. Cabrero J.R. Fernández G. Naranjo-Suárez S. Yáñez-Mo M. Serrador J.M. Muñoz-Fernández M.A. Sánchez-Madrid F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Viral infection was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of HIV-1 transcripts. As shown in Fig. 5F, overexpression of HDAC6 in Jurkat cells reduced HIV-1 gene expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC6 expression or inhibition of HDAC6 activity by tubacin enhanced HIV-1 gene expression (Fig. 5, G and H). These results are consistent with the negative effect of HDAC6 on Tat transactivation activity. We then used HDAC6+/+ and HDAC6−/− MEFs to further examine the ability of HDAC6 to inhibit Tat transactivation activity. Human CycT1 was introduced into these cells because Tat does not functionally interact with mouse CycT1 (25Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 26Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the presence of human CycT1, Tat transactivation activity was significantly increased in HDAC6−/− MEFs compared with HDAC6+/+ MEFs, and this effect was blocked by reconstitution of HDAC6 in HDAC6−/− MEFs (Fig. 6A). HDAC6+/+ and HDAC6−/− MEFs did not exhibit an obvious difference in Tat transactivation activity when the K28A mutant of Tat was used (Fig. 6B). Together, these data provide further evidence for a role of HDAC6 in the negative regulation of Tat transactivation activity and implicate CycT1 in this action. By immunoprecipitation assay, we found that tubacin increased the interaction of Tat with CycT1, and this effect of tubacin was abolished when the K28A mutant of Tat was used (Fig. 6C). These data show additional evidence that HDAC6-mediated Lys-28 deacetylation inhibits Tat transactivation activity by affecting Tat interaction with CycT1. HDAC6 is a member of the class II HDAC family with a predominant localization in the cytoplasm. It regulates cell motility by deacetylating α-tubulin and cortactin (15Zhang X. Yuan Z. Zhang Y. Yong S. Salas-Burgos A. Koomen J. Olashaw N. Parsons J.T. Yang X.J. Dent S.R. Yao T.P. Lane W.S. Seto E. Mol.

Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). HDAC6 also acts as a deacetylase of Hsp90 and modulates Hsp90-dependent activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (27Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J. Gaillard S. Zhao X. Wu J.T. Nicchitta C.V. Yoshida M. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. Yao T.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 601-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). In addition, HDAC6 plays a role in modulating cellular redox activities by deacetylating peroxiredoxins (28Parmigiani R.B. Xu W.S. Venta-Perez G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Yaneva M. Tempst P. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9633-9638Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified, by yeast two-hybrid screening, HDAC6 as an interacting protein of the HIV-1 transactivator Tat. Importantly, we demonstrated that HDAC6 functions as a Tat deacetylase. Tat thus joins a growing list of HDAC6 substrates and represents the first exogenous pathogenic protein identified to be deacetylated by HDAC6. Lys-28 in Tat is essential for its transactivation activity, and Lys-28 acetylation by PCAF stimulates HIV-1 transcription by promoting Tat-CycT1-TAR complex assembly (5Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 6D'Orso I. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a balance between Lys-28 acetylation and deacetylation exists to allow for fine-tuning of HIV-1 transcription (6D'Orso I. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using multiple approaches, we have shown that HDAC6 deacetylates Tat at Lys-28. Especially, inactivation of HDAC6 by its specific inhibitor tubacin markedly increased the acetylation of wild-type Tat but not the K28A mutant. Unlike trichostatin A, the pan-inhibitor of class I/II HDACs, tubacin enhanced Tat acetylation and transactivation activity without altering Tat expression. Our results thus help solve the long-standing ambiguity as to whether Tat acetylation is under the control of a class I or II HDAC. Despite the primary location and function of Tat in the nucleus, our data show that Tat interacts with and is deacetylated by HDAC6 in the cytoplasm. At present, the source of cytoplasmic Lys-28-acetylated Tat is unclear. Our data reveal that Lys-28-acetylated Tat undergoes nucleocytoplasmic trafficking similarly to unacetylated Tat (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, it is possible that cytoplasmic Lys-28-acetylated Tat may derive from the export of Lys-28-acetylated Tat from the nucleus. It is also possible that the acetyltransferase PCAF may simply acetylate Tat at Lys-28 in the cytoplasm, in a manner similar to its acetylation of Tat in the nucleus. This notion is supported by the recent observation that PCAF localizes in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (15Zhang X. Yuan Z. Zhang Y. Yong S. Salas-Burgos A. Koomen J. Olashaw N. Parsons J.T. Yang X.J. Dent S.R. Yao T.P. Lane W.S. Seto E. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 197-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Additional studies are warranted to examine the source of cytoplasmic Lys-28-acetylated Tat and to elucidate how the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pattern of Lys-28-acetylated and unacetylated forms of Tat affects its transactivation activity. Our results show that microtubules are crucial for HDAC6 to interact with Tat and for the subsequent actions of HDAC6 to deacetylate Tat and to suppress HIV-1 transactivation. It should be noted, however, that the binding of microtubules/tubulin to Tat does not entirely mirror the binding of HDAC6 to Tat. Whereas the binding of microtubules/tubulin involves primarily the core domain of Tat, the binding of HDAC6 involves more the cysteine-rich domain, with an overlap of both binding domains at residue 36 and possibly residue 37. Although the precise mechanism of how microtubules are involved in the Tat-HDAC6 interaction remains to be investigated, our results suggest a model for a scaffolding role of microtubules. In this model, the outer surface of microtubules may function as a platform to facilitate the interaction between HDAC6 and Tat. One protein, either HDAC6 or Tat, may acquire conformational changes upon binding to microtubules, generating a binding pocket for the other protein. This study reveals that HDAC6-mediated Tat deacetylation leads to an inhibition of Tat transactivation activity toward HIV-1 transcription. However, the connection between HDAC6 and HIV-1 is not unprecedented. HDAC6 has been reported to inhibit HIV-1 entry into cells by suppressing the viral envelope-mediated cell fusion process (24Valenzuela-Fernández A. Alvarez S. Gordon-Alonso M. Barrero M. Ursa A. Cabrero J.R. Fernández G. Naranjo-Suárez S. Yáñez-Mo M. Serrador J.M. Muñoz-Fernández M.A. Sánchez-Madrid F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Those findings, together with ours, suggest HDAC6 as a potential therapeutic target for HIV-1 management. The identification of agents such as chemical compounds or small peptides that are able to enhance HDAC6 expression or activity would be instrumental in the design of HDAC6-based therapeutics against HIV-1.

https://openalex.org/W2018575693,"Haptoglobin (Hp) is known to play a role in angiogenesis as well as in anti-inflammation. STAT3 is a major transcription factor for expression of human Hp. We investigated whether hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a key mediator of angiogenesis, participates in Hp gene expression. HIF-1α overexpression by gene transfection or hypoxia augmented Hp transcription in HepG2 human hepatoma cells. Conversely, knockdown of HIF-1α by specific siRNA transfection diminished Hp expression, although the level of STAT3 phosphorylation remained unchanged. A luciferase reporter assay using mutant Hp promoters demonstrated that two adjacent DNA elements, a STAT3-binding element (SBE) and a cAMP-response element (CRE)-like site in human Hp promoter -120/-97, were required for HIF-1α-stimulated transactivation of the Hp gene. HIF-1α, STAT3, and p300/CBP were simultaneously bound to the SBE/CRE as a complex form. When HIF-1α was knocked down, STAT3 binding to the SBE in the Hp promoter was attenuated. Our findings suggest that HIF-1α assists STAT3 in strong binding to the proximal SBE in the Hp promoter. The CRE-like site located near the SBE may contribute to the formation of a stable complex of STAT3, HIF-1α, and p300/CBP, which leads to maximum transcription of the Hp gene."
https://openalex.org/W1990493097,"NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a flavoenzyme that is important in maintaining the cellular redox state and regulating protein degradation. The NQO1 polymorphism C609T has been associated with increased susceptibility to various age-related pathologies. We show here that NQO1 protein level is regulated by the E3 ligase STUB1/CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein). NQO1 binds STUB1 via the Hsc70-interacting domain (tetratricopeptide repeat domain) and undergoes ubiquitination and degradation. We demonstrate here that the product of the C609T polymorphism (P187S) is a stronger STUB1 interactor with increased susceptibility to ubiquitination by the E3 ligase STUB1. Furthermore, age-dependent decrease of STUB1 correlates with increased NQO1 accumulation. Remarkably, examination of hippocampi from Alzheimer disease patients revealed that in half of the cases examined the NQO1 protein level was undetectable due to C609T polymorphism, suggesting that the age-dependent accumulation of NQO1 is impaired in certain Alzheimer disease patients."

Although an alteration in type I collagen glycosylation has been implicated in several osteogenic disorders, the role of LH3 in bone physiology has never been investigated. To elucidate the function of LH3 in bone type I collagen modifications, we used a short hairpin RNA technology in a mouse osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1; generated single cell-derived clones stably suppressing LH3 (short hairpin (Sh) clones); and characterized the phenotype. Plod3 expression and the LH3 protein levels in the Sh clones were significantly suppressed when compared with the controls, MC3T3-E1, and the clone transfected with an empty vector. In comparison with controls, type I collagen synthesized by Sh clones (Sh collagen) showed a significant decrease in the extent of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine with a concomitant increase of galactosylhydroxylysine, whereas the total number of hydroxylysine residues was essentially unchanged. In an in vitro fibrillogenesis assay, Sh collagen showed accelerated fibrillogenesis compared with the controls. In addition, when recombinant LH3-V5/His protein was generated in 293 cells and subjected to GGT/GT activity assay, it showed GGT but not GT activity against denatured type I collagen. The results from this study clearly indicate that the major function of LH3 in osteoblasts is to glucosylate galactosylhydroxylysine residues in type I collagen and that an impairment of this LH3 function significantly affects type I collagen fibrillogenesis."

A key gating process of the three Orai channel isoforms to prevent Ca2+ overload is fast inactivation, most pronounced in Orai3. A subsequent reactivation is a unique gating characteristic of Orai1 channels, whereas Orai2 and Orai3 currents display a second, slow inactivation phase. Employing a chimeric approach by sequential swapping of respective intra- and extracellular regions between Orai1 and Orai3, we show here that Orai1 specific proline/arginine-rich domains in the N terminus mediate reactivation, whereas the second, intracellular loop modulates fast and slow gating processes. Swapping C-terminal strands lacks a significant impact. However, simultaneous transfer of Orai3 N terminus and its second loop or C terminus in an Orai1 chimera substantially increases fast inactivation centered between wild-type channels. Concomitant swap of all three cytosolic strands from Orai3 onto Orai1 fully conveys Orai3-like gating characteristics, in a strongly cooperative manner.

https://openalex.org/W2022432195,"Neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4 (Nedd4) proteins are ubiquitin ligases, which attach ubiquitin moieties to their target proteins, a post-translational modification that is most commonly associated with protein degradation. Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases have been shown to down-regulate both potassium and sodium channels. In this study, we investigated whether Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases also regulate Ca(v) calcium channels. We expressed three Nedd4 family members, Nedd4-1, Nedd4-2, and WWP2, together with Ca(v)1.2 channels in tsA-201 cells. We found that Nedd4-1 dramatically decreased Ca(v) whole-cell currents, whereas Nedd4-2 and WWP2 failed to regulate the current. Surface biotinylation assays revealed that Nedd4-1 decreased the number of channels inserted at the plasma membrane. Western blots also showed a concomitant decrease in the total expression of the channels. Surprisingly, however, neither the Ca(v) pore-forming α1 subunit nor the associated Ca(v)β and Ca(v)α(2)δ subunits were ubiquitylated by Nedd4-1. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented the degradation of Ca(v) channels, whereas monodansylcadaverine and chloroquine partially antagonized the Nedd4-1-induced regulation of Ca(v) currents. Remarkably, the effect of Nedd4-1 was fully prevented by brefeldin A. These data suggest that Nedd4-1 promotes the sorting of newly synthesized Ca(v) channels for degradation by both the proteasome and the lysosome. Most importantly, Nedd4-1-induced regulation required the co-expression of Ca(v)β subunits, known to antagonize the retention of the channels in the endoplasmic reticulum. Altogether, our results suggest that Nedd4-1 interferes with the chaperon role of Ca(v)β at the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi level to prevent the delivery of Ca(v) channels at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2090245546,"The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways are highly organized signaling systems that transduce extracellular signals into a variety of intracellular responses. In this context, it is currently poorly understood how kinases constituting these signaling cascades are assembled and activated in response to receptor stimulation to generate specific cellular responses. Here, we show that AKAP-Lbc, an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) with an intrinsic Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, is critically involved in the activation of the p38α MAPK downstream of α(1b)-adrenergic receptors (α(1b)-ARs). Our results indicate that AKAP-Lbc can assemble a novel transduction complex containing the RhoA effector PKNα, MLTK, MKK3, and p38α, which integrates signals from α(1b)-ARs to promote RhoA-dependent activation of p38α. In particular, silencing of AKAP-Lbc expression or disrupting the formation of the AKAP-Lbc·p38α signaling complex specifically reduces α(1)-AR-mediated p38α activation without affecting receptor-mediated activation of other MAPK pathways. These findings provide a novel mechanistic hypothesis explaining how assembly of macromolecular complexes can specify MAPK signaling downstream of α(1)-ARs."

It has been recently reported that the partial inactivation of GME induced growth defects affecting both cell division and cell expansion (Gilbert, L., Alhagdow, M., Nunes-Nesi, A., Quemener, B., Guillon, F., Bouchet, B., Faurobert, M., Gouble, B., Page, D., Garcia, V., Petit, J., Stevens, R., Causse, M., Fernie, A. R., Lahaye, M., Rothan, C., and Baldet, P. (2009) Plant J. 60, 499-508). In the present study, we show that the silencing of the two GME genes in tomato leaves resulted in approximately a 60% decrease in terminal L-Gal content in the side chain A of RG-II as well as in a lower capacity of RG-II to perform in muro cross-linking. In addition, we show that unlike supplementation with L-Gal or ascorbate, supplementation of GME-silenced lines with boric acid was able to restore both the wild-type growth phenotype of tomato seedlings and an efficient in muro boron-mediated cross-linking of RG-II. Our findings suggest that developmental phenotypes in GME-deficient lines are due to the structural alteration of RG-II and further underline the crucial role of the cross-linking of RG-II in the formation of the pectic network required for normal plant growth and development."

Here, we show that the self-association-defective mutant of Swi6 does not interact with Clr4. It not only fails to localize to heterochromatin loci but also interferes with heterochromatic localization of H3-Lys-9-Me2 (and thereby Clr4) and the endogenous Swi6 in a dominant negative manner.

https://openalex.org/W2023173160,"Protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) is a recently identified member of the serpin superfamily that functions as a cofactor-dependent regulator of blood coagulation factors Xa and XIa. Here we provide evidence that, in addition to the established cofactors, protein Z, lipid, and calcium, heparin is an important cofactor of ZPI anticoagulant function. Heparin produced 20-100-fold accelerations of ZPI reactions with factor Xa and factor XIa to yield second order rate constants approaching the physiologically significant diffusion limit (k(a) = 10(6) to 10(7) M(-1) s(-1)). The dependence of heparin accelerating effects on heparin concentration was bell-shaped for ZPI reactions with both factors Xa and XIa, consistent with a template-bridging mechanism of heparin rate enhancement. Maximal accelerations of ZPI-factor Xa reactions required calcium, which augmented the heparin acceleration by relieving Gla domain inhibition as previously shown for heparin bridging of the antithrombin-factor Xa reaction. Heparin acceleration of both ZPI-protease reactions was optimal at heparin concentrations and heparin chain lengths comparable with those that produce physiologically significant rate enhancements of other serpin-protease reactions. Protein Z binding to ZPI minimally affected heparin rate enhancements, indicating that heparin binds to a distinct site on ZPI and activates ZPI in its physiologically relevant complex with protein Z. Taken together, these results suggest that whereas protein Z, lipid, and calcium cofactors promote ZPI inhibition of membrane-associated factor Xa, heparin activates ZPI to inhibit free factor Xa as well as factor XIa and therefore may play a physiologically and pharmacologically important role in ZPI anticoagulant function."

Inhibition is relieved upon PLM phosphorylation. Phosphorylation may alter how PLM interacts with NKA and/or itself, but details of these interactions are unknown. To address this, we quantified FRET between PLM and its regulatory target NKA in live cells. Phosphorylation of PLM was mimicked by mutation S63E (PKC site), S68E (PKA/PKC site), or S63E/S68E. The dependence of FRET on protein expression in live cells yielded information about the structure and binding affinity of the PLM-NKA regulatory complex. PLM phosphomimetic mutations altered the quaternary structure of the regulatory complex and reduced the apparent affinity of the PLM-NKA interaction. The latter effect was likely due to increased oligomerization of PLM phosphomimetic mutants, as suggested by PLM-PLM FRET measurements. Distance constraints obtained by FRET suggest that phosphomimetic mutations slightly alter the oligomer quaternary conformation.

Recently, much progress has been made elucidating the structural basis for the functional regulation of NKA by PLM. NMR studies showed that PLM adopts an L-shaped structure with a single membrane span (14Franzin C.M. Gong X.M. Teriete P. Marassi F.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of the protein consists of an extracellular domain containing the signature Phe-X-Tyr-Asp (FXYD) motif, followed by a transmembrane α-helix. Another helical domain on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane contains the phosphate-accepting residues Ser-63 (PKC site) and Ser-68 (PKA/PKC site) (9Shattock M.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2009; 9: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Franzin C.M. Gong X.M. Teriete P. Marassi F.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This positively charged domain appears to associate with the surface of the bilayer, but phosphorylation may trigger helix reorientation and thereby tune the interaction of PLM with NKA (14Franzin C.M. Gong X.M. Teriete P. Marassi F.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PLM also interacts with itself to form oligomers; in vitro experiments suggest these are tetramers (15Beevers A.J. Kukol A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Wong A. Beevers A.J. Kukol A. Dupree R. Smith M.E. Solid State Nucl. Magn. Reson. 2008; 33: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although no major phosphorylation-dependent PLM structure changes were detected in NMR studies (17Teriete P. Thai K. Choi J. Marassi F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we previously found that FRET from PLM to PLM was increased upon PLM phosphorylation (18Bossuyt J. Despa S. Han F. Hou Z.

Chem. 2006; 281: 32765-32773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These previous FRET studies suggest that phosphorylation of PLM affects its binding interactions or the quaternary conformation of the bound complexes. The relative contributions of changed binding affinity and altered structure have not yet been dissected from one another. In a previous study, we demonstrated that phosphomimetic mutations of phospholamban (PLB) increased its self-binding affinity and altered the structure of its regulatory complex with the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (20Hou Z. Kelly E.M. Robia S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28996-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although they are localized to different membrane structures and have different ion selectivity, the PLB/SERCA proteins are analogous to PLM/NKA. The secondary/tertiary structure and regulatory function of PLB are similar to those of PLM (although opposite in orientation). Likewise, SERCA closely resembles NKA. Possibly the mechanisms of PLM/NKA regulation parallel those of PLB/SERCA regulation. In this study, we quantify the effect of phosphorylation-mimicking mutations on the structure and affinity of PLM regulatory complexes in live cells. PLM tagged with either cyan fluorescent protein (PLM-CFP) or YFP (PLM-YFP) at the intracellular C terminus and the CFP-NKAα1 construct (in which CFP is attached at the NKA intracellular N terminus) were described previously (18Bossuyt J.

The fluorescent proteins used were monomeric variants containing the A206K mutation (21Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). The pseudo-phosphorylation mutants S63E (PKC site), S68E (PKA/PKC site), and S63E/S68E (both sites) were created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Phosphomimetic mutants were compared with the non-phosphorylatable controls S63A and S68A. Stable 293 cell lines expressing CFP-NKAα1 fusion proteins were cultured in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum in 60-mm dishes for 24 h to achieve ∼60% confluency. 15 μg of plasmid DNA encoding PLM-YFP was transfected into the stable CFP-NKAα1 cells using a mammalian cell transfection kit (Stratagene) as described previously (20Hou Z.

AAV-293 cells were transfected with PLM-YFP plasmid DNA (0.1 μg) or cotransfected with plasmid DNA encoding PLM-CFP (1 μg) and PLM-YFP (5 μg). 20–24 h after transfection, cells were detached via mild trypsinization and replated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass bottom culture dishes. After adhering to the surface for 1 h, the cells in DMEM were imaged for quantitative FRET or photon-counting histogram analysis. Cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (Nikon TE2000-U) equipped with a metal halide lamp, an APO 60×/1.49 numerical aperture objective, and a back-thinned CCD camera (iXon 887, Andor Technology, Belfast, Northern Ireland) as described previously (20Hou Z.

FRET between CFP- and YFP-labeled proteins was quantified by progressive acceptor-selective photobleaching of the entire microscopic field of observation as described previously (20Hou Z. Kelly E.M.

The progressive photobleaching protocol was as follows: 100-ms acquisition of CFP image and 40-ms acquisition of YFP image, followed by 10-s exposure to YFP-selective photobleaching (504/12 nm). The FRET efficiency (E) was calculated for each cell according to the percentile change of CFP intensity (F) after YFP-selective photobleaching, i.e. E = 1 − (Fpre-bleach/Fpost-bleach), and the FRET efficiency was plotted cell-by-cell according to the pre-bleach YFP fluorescence, which was taken as an index of the relative protein concentration of each cell. The protein concentration dependence of FRET efficiency was fit to a hyperbolic curve of the form Y = (FRETmax)X/(KD + X), where Y is the FRET efficiency observed, and X is the protein concentration in the cell in arbitrary units. The maximal FRET (FRETmax) represents the intrinsic FRET of the protein complex. KD is the dissociation constant (in arbitrary units) of the complexes, which measures their apparent binding affinity. KD1 is the dissociation constant of the PLM-PLM oligomer, and KD2 is the apparent dissociation constant of the PLM-NKA regulatory complex. For each mutant, values of KD and FRETmax were summarized as a weighted mean (Equation 1), where SE is the standard error of the hyperbolic fit with respect to that parameter.χ¯=∑i=1n(χi/SEi2)∑i=1n(1/SEi2)(Eq.1) The standard error of the weighted mean was calculated according to Equation 2.SEx¯=1∑i=1n(1/SEi2)(Eq.2) The z-score for a standard normal distribution was calculated for statistical comparisons between mutants according to Equation 3, where p < 0.05 was considered significant.z=x¯1−x¯2(SEx¯1)2+(SEx¯2)2(Eq.3) For the regulatory complex, the donor-acceptor separation distance was calculated according to R = R0((1/FRETmax) − 1)1/6 (24Forster T. Ann. Phys. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4788) Google Scholar). For the PLM oligomer, the average donor-acceptor separation distance was calculated from FRETmax using a computational model of intra-oligomeric FRET (25Li M. Reddy L.G. Bennett R. Silva Jr., N.D. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2587-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Hou Z. Kelly E.M. Robia S.L. J. Biol.

This model assumes a ring-shaped arrangement of subunits, which we regard as the most likely geometry (26Beevers A.J. Kukol A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32742-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For values of R ≥ R0, FRET efficiency is strongly dependent on donor-acceptor separation distance and only weakly dependent on the number of subunits in the complex (25Li M. Reddy L.G. Bennett R. Silva Jr., N.D. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2587-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The ratio of donors and acceptors in the oligomer was determined from the relative intensities of pre-photobleaching YFP emission and post-photobleaching CFP emission as described previously (20Hou Z. Kelly E.M. Robia S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28996-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Photon counting of PLM-YFP in live AAV-293 cells was performed with a confocal microscope (TCS-SP5, Leica Microsystems) using 512 nm excitation with an argon ion continuous wave laser that was attenuated to prevent photobleaching. Fluorescence emission was collected with a 63× water immersion objective (HCX PL APO, 1.2 numerical aperture) and band-pass filter (535–585 nm). Detection was performed with an avalanche photodiode (SPCM-AQRH, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a photon-counting card (ISS Inc.). Photon-counting histograms (PCH) were generated by ISS Vista software using a time bin width of 100 μs, which was much shorter than the translational diffusion time of the molecule in the cell. Fluorescence traces were integrated for 100 s for each PCH curve. The excitation beam was parked at several different subcellular positions for each of many cells. The average fluorescence intensity at the point of measurement was taken as an indicator of the protein concentration at that position. PCH curves were fitted with a nonlinear curve fitting routine using a one- or two-species model (27Chen Y. Wei L.N. Müller J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15492-15497Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A one-photon three-dimensional Gaussian model was assumed for the excitation volume in our experiments. Resolution of diffusible species was accomplished by global analysis of several measurements of similar average fluorescence intensity, yielding molecular brightness (ϵ) and the concentration of each species (28Chen Y. Müller J.D. So P.T. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 553-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 29Müller J.D. Chen Y. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 474-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cell autofluorescence was determined to be negligible for this analysis. Fig. 1 (A–C) shows that the fluorescence of the PLM fusion construct S63A was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, with a small amount detectable in internal membrane structures. All other PLM variants showed the same localization pattern (data not shown). CFP-NKAα1 fusion proteins stably expressed in HEK293 cells also showed predominantly plasma membrane localization (Fig. 1D), and in cells transfected with PLM S63A-YFP (Fig. 1E), the proteins were highly co-localized (Fig. 1F). To investigate the effect of pseudo-phosphorylation mutations on the structure and apparent affinity of the PLM-NKA regulatory complex, we measured FRET between CFP-NKAα1 and PLM mutants labeled with YFP. Consistent with our previous study (18Bossuyt J. Despa S. Han F. Hou Z. Robia S.L. Lingrel J.B. Bers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26749-26757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Bossuyt J. Despa S. Martin J.L. Bers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32765-32773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the mean FRET (average FRET observed for a large population of cells) was reduced for phosphomimetic mutants compared with non-phosphorylatable controls (Table 1). To dissect the relative contributions of changes in structure and binding affinity, we compared the FRET efficiency measured for each cell with the pre-bleach YFP fluorescence intensity (an index of protein concentration). Cell-to-cell variation in expression resulted in a wide range of protein concentrations. FRET increased with protein expression level, approaching a maximum (Fig. 2, A and B). Fitting with a hyperbola yielded FRETmax and the concentration at which half-maximal FRET was observed (KD2). The latter is the apparent dissociation constant and is inversely related to the affinity of PLM-NKA. The measured values of FRETmax and KD2 are summarized in Fig. 2 (C and D) and Table 1. KD2 was increased by 75% by phosphomimetic mutations of the PKC site (S63E), the PKA/PKC site (S68E), or both sites (S63E/S68E) compared with the non-phosphorylatable mutants (S63A and S68A). This is evident in Fig. 2 (A and B) as a right-shifted dependence of FRET on protein expression relative to non-phosphorylatable controls. A comparison of measured KD2 values is provided in Fig. 2D. The results suggest that PLM binding to NKA is reduced by phosphomimetic mutations. Notably, FRETmax was decreased by 20% by phosphomimetic mutations (Fig. 2C). The changes in FRETmax are consistent with a conformational change in the regulatory complex.TABLE 1Summary of effects of phosphomimetic mutations of PLMS63AS63ES68AS68ES63E/S68EPLM-NKA complexMean FRET (%)14.5 ± 1.39.3 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 versus S63A.15.3 ± 1.110.5 ± 1.2bp < 0.05 versus S68A.9.4 ± 1.1bp < 0.05 versus S68A.FRETmax (%)19.9 ± 0.616.0 ± 0.7ap < 0.05 versus S63A.19.9 ± 1.016.1 ± 1.0bp < 0.05 versus S68A.15.8 ± 0.9bp < 0.05 versus S68A.Acceptor mole fraction0.93 ± 0.040.90 ± 0.040.91 ± 0.020.91 ± 0.030.93 ± 0.05CFP-YFP separation distance (Å)64.6 ± 0.568.2 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 versus S63A.64.6 ± 0.868.1 ± 1.1bp < 0.05 versus S68A.68.4 ± 1.0bp < 0.05 versus S68A.Apparent KD2 (a.u.)6.8 ± 0.712.2 ± 1.0ap < 0.05 versus S63A.7.6 ± 1.013.2 ± 1.5bp < 0.05 versus S68A.12.4 ± 1.7bp < 0.05 versus S68A.n (set of experiments)33433N (number of cells)390313296273439PLM oligomerMean FRET (%)38.3 ± 1.732.4 ± 0.7ap < 0.05 versus S63A.37.7 ± 0.534.2 ± 0.4bp < 0.05 versus S68A.29.8 ± 0.8bp < 0.05 versus S68A.FRETmax (%)50.2 ± 2.146.2 ± 1.1ap < 0.05 versus S63A.50.6 ± 1.644.6 ± 1.3bp < 0.05 versus S68A.46.4 ± 1.4bp < 0.05 versus S68A.Acceptor mole fraction0.89 ± 0.050.92 ± 0.030.93 ± 0.010.91 ± 0.010.94 ± 0.01CFP-YFP separation distance (Å)57.5 ± 0.459.2 ± 0.2ap < 0.05 versus S63A.57.9 ± 0.359.7 ± 0.2bp < 0.05 versus S68A.59.4 ± 0.3bp < 0.05 versus S68A.KD1 (a.u.)10.4 ± 1.55.4 ± 0.6ap < 0.05 versus S63A.11.6 ± 0.96.4 ± 0.6bp < 0.05 versus S68A.6.5 ± 0.5bp < 0.05 versus S68A.n (set of experiments)33867N (number of cells)354274479423223PLM oligomer PCHϵ1 (species 1; counts/bin)0.22 ± 0.010.23 ± 0.010.23 ± 0.010.23 ± 0.010.23 ± 0.01ϵ2 (species 2; counts/bin)0.88 ± 0.040.87 ± 0.040.85 ± 0.040.85 ± 0.040.85 ± 0.04Brightness ratio (ϵ2/ϵ1)43.83.73.73.7a p < 0.05 versus S63A.b p < 0.05 versus S68A. Open table in a new tab To investigate the effect of pseudo-phosphorylation mutations on the structure and affinity of the PLM oligomer, we measured FRET between PLM-CFP and PLM-YFP. Intra-oligomer FRET efficiency increased with protein concentration as shown in Fig. 3 (A and B). FRETmax of PLM phosphomimetic mutants was modestly reduced by 9% (Fig. 3C). The PLM oligomer dissociation constant (KD1) was reduced by 45% by phosphomimetic mutations as shown in Fig. 3D and Table 1. The data suggest increased PLM oligomerization after pseudo-phosphorylation, combined with a small change in the conformation of the oligomeric complex. To investigate PLM oligomerization at very low concentrations, we generated PCHs of PLM-YFP expressed in live cells. Fig. 4A shows representative histograms of PLM mutants labeled with YFP. Although these data were obtained from subcellular regions with similar average fluorescence intensities, phosphomimetic mutants showed right-shifted histograms (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Histograms generated from dim cells (expressing a low concentration of protein) were well described by a single-species model with a molecular brightness of 0.23 counts/bin for all PLM mutants tested (Table 1). Bright cells (expressing a higher concentration of protein) gave PCH curves that were best described by a two-species model. A comparison of residuals from one- and two-species fits is provided in Fig. 4A (lower panel). The second species was characterized by a 4-fold higher molecular brightness (0.86 counts/bin), consistent with a tetramer (Table 1). Fig. 4B shows the number of bright species that were detected versus the average fluorescence intensity (photon counts/s) in the detection volume. The number of tetramers increased with fluorescence intensity, suggesting that tetramerization increases with protein concentration. A similar trend was observed whether measurements were taken from different cells (Fig. 4B, black closed circles) or from regions of differential brightness within the same cell (black open circles). The apparent effect of phosphomimetic mutations was to reduce the critical concentration at which the tetrameric species began to be observed. The present observations relating to PLM structure and affinity provide insight into the mechanism of kinase regulation of NKA inhibition by PLM. We propose that relief of pump inhibition is due to a combination of conformational changes (Fig. 5, A and C) and dynamic shifts in regulatory binding equilibria (Fig. 5, B and D). The effects of phosphorylation include the following: a conformational change in the PLM-NKA regulatory complex (Fig. 5A), decreased binding of PLM to NKA (Fig. 5B), a conformational change in the PLM tetramer (Fig. 5C), and increased oligomerization of PLM (Fig. 5D). The concentration dependence of PLM-NKAα1 FRET provides FRETmax of the regulatory complex, which is taken to represent the intrinsic FRET efficiency of the complex. As far as can be detected by FRET, CFP-NKAα1 and PLM-YFP compose a bimolecular complex (18Bossuyt J. Despa S. Han F. Hou Z. Robia S.L. Lingrel J.B. Bers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26749-26757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, the donor-acceptor separation distance can be obtained from FRETmax by the relationship R = R0((1/FRETmax) − 1)1/6 (24Forster T. Ann. Phys. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4788) Google Scholar). Assuming random relative dipolar orientations (κ2 = 2/3) and accounting for 4% nonspecific energy transfer, the measured intrinsic FRET efficiencies correspond to CFP-YFP separation distances of 64.6 Å for the non-phosphorylatable mutants. The phosphomimetic mutants S63E, S68E, and S63E/S68E had an average donor-acceptor separation distance of 68.3 Å. We conclude that phosphomimetic mutations alter the structure of the bound PLM-NKA complex. This putative structure change is similar in magnitude to other conformational changes measured by FRET (30Karasawa A. Tsuboi Y. Inoue H. Kinoshita R. Nakamura N. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41900-41911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Marcaggi P. Mutoh H. Dimitrov D. Beato M. Knöpfel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The structure transition is represented schematically in Fig. 5A as a change from an inactive (blue) to an active (orange) PLM-NKA complex. The uncertain disposition of the fluorescent protein tags limits quantitative interpretation of FRET constraints. However, the large probe separation distances determined here (∼65 Å) are compatible with crystal structures (33Shinoda T. Ogawa H. Cornelius F. Toyoshima C. Nature. 2009; 459: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and computational models (14Franzin C.M. Gong X.M. Teriete P. Marassi F.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in which the PLM-binding site and the NKA N terminus (CFP fusion site) are on opposite sides of NKA. A similar arrangement has been proposed for the analogous regulatory complex of SERCA with its conjugate regulatory partner PLB (34Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have previously determined probe separation distances of 58–65 Å for the PLB-SERCA complex (20Hou Z. Kelly E.M. Robia S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28996-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Hou Z. Robia S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 402: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Kelly E.M. Hou Z. Bossuyt J. Bers D.M. Robia S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12202-12211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, the magnitude and direction of the distance change after phosphomimetic mutations were the same (+4 Å) for both regulatory complexes (20Hou Z. Kelly E.M. Robia S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28996-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The data underscore the structural similarity of the respective regulatory complexes and suggest that similar regulatory mechanisms may govern both pumps. All PLM phosphomimetic mutants showed saturable binding to NKAα1 (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that relief of NKA inhibition with phosphorylation does not require complete dissociation of the regulatory complex. However, the right-shifted concentration dependence for phosphomimetic mutants (versus S68A or S63A) indicates a reduced apparent affinity for NKA (higher KD2). It is noteworthy that single phosphomimetic mutants showed the same magnitude of KD2 shift and structure change as the double mutant S63E/S68E, suggesting that the Ser-63 and Ser-68 phosphorylation sites are redundant. Both the structure change (decreased FRETmax) (Fig. 2C) and apparent affinity change (increased KD2) (Fig. 2D) may contribute to the regulation of NKA by PLM phosphorylation. The relative functional prominence of the two mechanisms in vivo is unknown. It is important to note that the YFP fluorescence intensity measurements used as an index of protein concentration (Fig. 2, A and B) include both the monomeric and oligomeric forms of PLM-YFP. Thus, the PLM-NKAα1 equilibrium may be influenced by changes in the PLM oligomerization equilibrium. To determine whether the observed increase in KD2 was a direct change in the intrinsic affinity of monomeric PLM for NKA (Fig. 5B) or an indirect result of decreased KD1 (Fig. 5D), we also measured FRET between fluorescent probes on different subunits of the PLM oligomer. Using a computational model (20Hou Z. Kelly E.M. Robia S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28996-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) of FRET within a ring-shaped oligomer (25Li M. Reddy L.G. Bennett R. Silva Jr., N.D. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2587-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we calculated an average probe separation distance of 58 Å for the non-phosphorylatable PLM mutants. This is a rather large distance, as may be expected from the L-shaped structure of PLM that was determined by NMR (35Teriete P. Franzin C.M. Choi J. Marassi F.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6774-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The PLM oligomer may assume a structure analogous to the PLB pentamer (36Robia S.L. Flohr N.C. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4302-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Traaseth N.J. Verardi R. Torgersen K.D. Karim C.B. Thomas D.D. Veglia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14676-14681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), in which the cytoplasmic domains point outward from a central hub of transmembrane helices. However, the relative positions of the PLM cytoplasmic domain and the fluorescent protein chromophore are not known precisely, so we cannot rule out alternative conformations. The observed decrease in PLM oligomer FRETmax after phosphomimetic mutations (Fig. 3C) is consistent with a modest increase in average probe separation distance from 58 to 60 Å. This represents a very small change in the oligomeric architecture. The results underscore the value of long-range distance constraints for measuring subtle conformational changes in macromolecules. For simplicity, the change in the structure with phosphorylation is represented schematically in Fig. 5C as shifting away from a “compact” conformation, but other structural effects could be envisioned. For example, phosphorylation may cause increased membrane association or a change in the dynamics of the PLM cytoplasmic domain (14Franzin C.M. Gong X.M. Teriete P. Marassi F.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the apparent conformational change is unclear because the role of the oligomer is not proven. One possibility is that the oligomeric species is a reserve pool, which does not bind or regulate NKA (19Bossuyt J. Despa S. Martin J.L. Bers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32765-32773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The role of the putative structure change may be to stabilize the assembled complex, increasing the oligomer population at the expense of the inhibitory monomeric species. We found that all three phosphomimetic mutations favor PLM oligomerization in the membranes of live cells, increasing binding affinity by ∼2-fold (Fig. 3D). As we observed for the regulatory complex (Fig. 2D), there was no additional effect for the double mutant compared with single mutations. The data suggest that phosphorylation of either site is sufficient for full regulation of PLM oligomerization. It is noteworthy that the changes in KD1 (Fig. 3D) and KD2 (Fig. 2D) are of similar magnitude and opposite direction (1.8-fold difference) (Table 1). The data suggest that unbinding of PLM from NKA (Fig. 5B) is not a consequence of a change in the intrinsic affinity of PLM monomers for the pump (KD2) but rather is an indirect effect of increased PLM oligomerization (Fig. 5D). A similar concerted change in linked equilibria was observed for PLB-binding interactions (20Hou Z. Kelly E.M. Robia S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28996-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In response to analogous phosphomimetic mutations, PLB KD1 and KD2 showed 2.1- and 1.9-fold changes, respectively (20Hou Z. Kelly E.M. Robia S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28996-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PLB oligomerization interactions are apparently more avid than those of PLM. This may be why PLB oligomers are visible by SDS-PAGE, whereas PLM runs as a monomer. Conclusions derived from FRET experiments were supported by the results of complementary PCH experiments (Fig. 4). A PCH is generated by counting photons emitted from diffusible fluorescent species as they pass through the excitation/detection volume of a parked laser beam of a confocal microscope. This method allows determination of the molecular brightness (ϵ) and the absolute concentration of the fluorescent species in the observation volume (28Chen Y. Müller J.D. So P.T. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 553-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). It is useful for probing the oligomerization states of proteins in living cells (27Chen Y. Wei L.N. Müller J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15492-15497Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 29Müller J.D. Chen Y. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 474-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with submicron spatial resolution. In these experiments, two diffusible species were observed, with an ∼4-fold difference in molecular brightness (Table 1). The data are compatible with a mixture of monomers and tetramers. That the major oligomeric species is a tetramer was previously suggested by in vitro experiments of another group (15Beevers A.J. Kukol A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Wong A. Beevers A.J. Kukol A. Dupree R. Smith M.E. Solid State Nucl. Magn. Reson. 2008; 33: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Beevers A.J. Kukol A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32742-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and is consistent with our own observation (in FRET experiments) that the oligomer size is three or more protomers (18Bossuyt J. Despa S. Han F. Hou Z. Robia S.L. Lingrel J.B. Bers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26749-26757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found that the concentration of tetramers increased with average fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4B). These data are analogous to the FRET efficiency versus concentration binding curves given in Fig. 3 (A and B), although the PCH technique is applicable to a much lower concentration range. The effect of phosphomimetic mutations was to reduce the threshold concentration at which the tetrameric species were observed. Notably, differential oligomerization was observed in different subcellular regions of the same cell (Fig. 4B, black open circles). The results mimicked the pattern of concentration-dependent oligomerization observed by sampling separate cells with different fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4B, black closed circles). Subcellular regions with the highest fluorescence intensity had the highest numbers of tetramers and the highest tetramer/monomer ratio. Dim regions were dominated by the monomeric species. The final balance of tetramers and monomers in vivo must be determined by the steady-state concentration at the plasma membrane. In this regard, tetramers began to be detected at a fluorescence intensity of 1 × 105 photon counts/s, which corresponds to an average concentration of ∼25 YFP molecules in the excitation volume. Assuming that the plane of the bilayer bisects the excitation volume, this suggests a membrane density of 30 PLM-YFP molecules/μm2. Although the concentration of PLM in vivo is unknown, it is probably similar to the density of NKA in cardiac myocyte sarcolemma, which has been variously estimated as 320 (39Colvin R.A. Ashavaid T.F. Herbette L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), 1200 (40Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002: 90Google Scholar), and 2600 (41Dobretsov M. Hastings S.L. Stimers J.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) pumps/μm2. We conclude that oligomerization of PLM occurs at expression levels that are well below the expected in vivo concentration. Taken together with the observation that PLM-PLM binding affinity is comparable with the affinity of the PLM-NKA interaction (Table 1), the results suggest that PLM oligomerization does occur in vivo. The conclusions of this study are summarized in Fig. 5. We propose that the major PLM oligomeric species is a tetramer. After phosphorylation of either Ser-63 or Ser-68, the PLM tetramer undergoes a structure transition (Fig. 5C), slightly increasing the separation of the cytoplasmic domains and enhancing tetramer stability. This increases PLM oligomerization (Fig. 5D), which is observed as a reduction in KD1. As a consequence of increased PLM oligomerization, the pool of monomeric PLM is depleted, which indirectly affects apparent KD2. The result is reduced binding of PLM to NKA (Fig. 5B) and therefore reduced inhibition of NKA by PLM. Phosphorylation of PLM also alters the conformation of the PLM-NKA regulatory complex (Fig. 5A), increasing the separation of the PLM cytoplasmic domain and the NKA N terminus by 4 Å. Of these effects, we regard the structural rearrangement of the regulatory complex (Fig. 5A) and the unbinding of PLM from NKA (Fig. 5B) as most directly relevant to NKA regulation.

Here, to elucidate this mechanism, we investigated biochemical properties of Ndi1 and its mutants in which highly conserved amino acid residues (presumably involved in NADH and/or UQ binding sites) were replaced. We found that wild-type Ndi1 formed a stable charge transfer (CT) complex (around 740 nm) with NADH, but not with NADPH, under anaerobic conditions.

They are commonly found in the respiratory chain of bacteria, fungi, and plant mitochondria but not in mammalian mitochondria (1Yagi T. Di Bernardo S. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Kao M.C. Seo B.B.

Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The NDH-2 enzyme is generally composed of a single polypeptide and can be classified into three groups: A, B, and C. Group A has two adenine dinucleotide (ADP)-binding motifs and is involved in the non-covalent binding of NAD(P)H and FAD. Group B has the same two ADP-binding motifs and an additional conserved EF-hand. Group C has only one conserved ADP-binding motif where flavin is covalently bound (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The yeast Ndi1 enzyme belongs to group A (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and catalyzes NADH oxidation on the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane (3Moller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 561-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) like the energy-transducing NADH dehydrogenase complex I (4Yagi T. Seo B.B. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Marella M. Barber-Singh J. Yamashita T. Kao M.C. Matsuno-Yagi A. Rejuvenation Res. 2006; 9: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The physiological electron acceptor of NDH-2 is quinone, which is broadly classified into two types: naphthoquinone (menaquinone) and benzoquinone (ubiquinone (UQ)). Ndi1 utilizes the latter as an electron acceptor (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Both quinones have a hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic isoprenoid side chains and ensure electron transfer between several membrane-bound respiratory enzymes. Ndi1 does not react with oxygen in the presence of UQ. In the absence of quinone, NADH-reduced Ndi1 reacts with oxygen and produces H2O2, although intrinsic NADH oxidase activity is extremely low (about 300-fold less) compared with NADH-UQ1 oxidoreductase activity (5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our previous biochemical studies of Ndi1 suggest that Ndi1 has enzyme-bound UQ (bound UQ), which is distinct from the catalytic UQ (electron acceptor). Kinetic studies have indicated the physiological importance of bound UQ in Ndi1. When Ndi1 was incorporated into bovine heart submitochondrial particles, only the UQ-bound form established NADH-linked respiratory activity and did not produce H2O2 (5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In other experiments, NDI1 (which encodes the Ndi1 protein)-transduced cells did not produce detectable levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (6Seo B.B. Marella M. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6105-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Marella M. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24146-24156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it was postulated that the presence of bound UQ in Ndi1 is physiologically important in its enzymatic reaction and that Ndi1 bears at least two distinct UQ binding sites: one for bound UQ and another for catalytic UQ (5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the function of bound UQ in Ndi1 and the general reaction mechanism of NDH-2 have yet to be elucidated (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8Eschemann A. Galkin A. Oettmeier W. Brandt U. Kerscher S. J. Biol.

Using these mutants and/or various inhibitors, we examined the reaction mechanism of Ndi1 and the role of bound UQ in this reaction.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we uncovered the catalytic mechanism of Ndi1 and the function of bound UQ against ROS production. Contrary to our previous assumption, our current data strongly suggest that the Ndi1 reaction proceeds through a ternary complex mechanism under physiological conditions. This was an unexpected result because it is generally accepted that NDH-2, including Ndi1, operates by a ping-pong mechanism (8Eschemann A. Galkin A. Oettmeier W. Brandt U. Kerscher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3138-3142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Velázquez I. Pardo J.P. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11456-11463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Quinones can be a one- or two-electron acceptor. In general, flavin-dependent quinone reductases, including NDH-2, afford the strict two-electron reduction of the quinone to its hydroquinone form and avoid the generation of the semiquinone anion, which is prone to react with molecular oxygen, leading to the generation of ROS (34Kozlov A.V. Nohl H. Gille L. Bioorg. Chem. 1998; 26: 334-344Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear how NDH-2 interacts with their hydrophobic substrate quinones. To be more precise, in Ndi1, the bound UQ seems to play a key role in the prevention of ROS generation (5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but the mechanism underlying ROS suppression by the bound UQ has not been disclosed.We found that Ndi1 forms a stable CT complex with NADH and UQ under anaerobic conditions, displaying a fairly broad absorbance band between 500 and 900 nm with a peak at around 740 nm. The formation of the CT complex itself is common among many flavin enzymes. It is known that the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family, such as DmTR and PpLipDH, forms the CT complex under aerobic conditions (35Schirmer R.H. Schulz G.E. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. Vol. IIB. Wiley, New York1987: 333-379Google Scholar, 36Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. III. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the mitochondrial flavoprotein apoptosis-inducing factor, which shares relatively high sequence homology with Ndi1, also produces air-stable FADH2-NAD(P) CT complexes (37Churbanova I.Y. Sevrioukova I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5622-5631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The CT complex of apoptosis-inducing factor was similar to that of Ndi1, showing an absorption maximum at 770 nm, which is much longer than that usually observed in the CT complex of other flavin enzymes. The greater the interaction between the reacting molecules, the longer the wavelength of the CT complex absorption band (19Sakurai T. Hosoya H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 459-468Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction among NADH, FAD, and UQ in Ndi1 is very strong.Bound UQ accepts an electron from reduced FAD in the CT complex of Ndi1. Therefore, the formation of the CT complex might result in the formation of a semiquinone radical. The semiquinone radical does not react with molecular oxygen because the oxygen molecule may not enter the catalytic site of Ndi1 when the ternary complex, in which the substrate binding sites are completely occupied with NADH and UQ, is formed. This is supported by the previous observation that hydrogen peroxide was not produced during the catalysis when UQ-bound Ndi1, but not UQ-free Ndi1, was incorporated into bovine heart submitochondrial particles (see Fig. 8 in Ref. 5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, NDI1-transfected cells, in which Ndi1 harboring endogenously bound UQ is overexpressed, did not produce reactive oxygen species as control non-transfected cells (6Seo B.B. Marella M. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6105-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Marella M. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24146-24156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the electron transfer from flavin radical to UQ radical may occur on a millisecond time scale based on the report that in E. coli membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase the electron transfer rate between two semiquinone radicals of pyrroloquinoline quinone (which corresponds to FAD in Ndi1) and UQ was 1.2 × 103 s−1 (38Kobayashi K. Mustafa G. Tagawa S. Yamada M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, it is highly likely that a semiquinone radical formed in the ternary complex will be immediately converted into a fully reduced form before reacting with molecular oxygen.We strongly believe that our data shown in this study are all important circumstantial evidence to support a ternary complex mechanism for the Ndi1 reaction, which cannot be explained by a ping-pong mechanism. First, Ndi1 forms a CT complex with only NADH (Fig. 2). The specificity to NADH was also evident by the proteolytic digestion experiment (Fig. 3). Under anaerobic conditions, the bound UQ remained attached when Ndi1 was reduced with NADH but not with NADPH (see Fig. 7 in Ref. 5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Second, the kinetic study with inhibitors (RB-2 and UQ1H2) clearly indicated there is no overlap between NADH and UQ binding sites (Fig. 6). Especially, the inhibition mode of ubiquinol clearly showed a non-competitive inhibition with respect to NADH (Fig. 6 C), allowing the formation of the ternary complex with NADH and ubiquinol. This piece of information itself is against a ping-pong mechanism. Third, in the oxidized state of Ndi1, the bound UQ can reversibly dissociate and be replaced with other quinones in the membrane (Fig. 7). Fourth, our proteolytic digestion analysis supports the conformational change induced by NADH (Fig. 3), which is essential for the formation of the ternary complex.Consequently, a question immediately arises. Why was it concluded that the reaction of Ndi1 with NADH and UQ was a ping-pong mechanism in our previous study? This was partly because we did not consider the reaction environment of purified Ndi1. Our previous data showed a typical ping-pong reaction in the hydrophilic artificial reaction environment where Ndi1 is simply surrounded by detergent micelle and UQ1 molecules in a disorganized way. This is completely different from the physiological, hydrophobic membrane environment where Ndi1 provides an ordered and limited entrance for quinone to access the catalytic pocket. UQ1 is much more hydrophilic and smaller than physiological UQ6 and can easily enter through the entry port for NADH. In this case, NADH and UQ1 compete and enter alternately. Therefore, even though NADH and UQ binding sites in Ndi1 are different, apparent bisubstrate kinetics could give consistent results that support a ping-pong reaction. The same behavior of UQ1 was also reported recently in mitochondrial complex I (39King M.S. Sharpley M.S. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 40Birrell J.A. Yakovlev G. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 12005-12013Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hydrophilic quinines, such as UQ1, can be reduced by the flavin mononucleotide cofactor in the active site for NADH oxidation of complex I through a non-energy-transducing pathway (which is insensitive to quinone binding site inhibitors, such as rotenone and piericidin A). This inhibitor-insensitive UQ reduction occurs by a ping-pong type mechanism (39King M.S. Sharpley M.S. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 40Birrell J.A. Yakovlev G. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 12005-12013Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, we have further experimental evidence that the reaction environment could drastically affect the Ndi1 catalytic properties and mode of action. The apparent rate constant for the release of bound UQ (UQ6) from the purified Ndi1 in the aqueous solution was extremely slow (∼0.14 s−1) compared with the turnover rate of the NADH oxidase reaction of Ndi1 incorporated into submitochondrial particles, which contain endogenous UQ10 (∼8.3 s−1) (5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A possible explanation is that the dissociation of UQ6 from the purified enzyme becomes very slow in an aqueous environment because UQ6 cannot freely diffuse into the hydrophilic solvent due to its hydrophobicity. This can lead to underestimation of the rate constant of the release of bound UQ6. The reaction environment is extremely important and should not be undermined for the mechanistic study of membrane-bound respiratory enzymes that involves quinone.We previously postulated that Ndi1 bears two different UQ (bound UQ and catalytic UQ) binding sites (5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This speculation was made based on the ping-pong mechanism of Ndi1 (5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Miyoshi H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6012-6020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in which the binding of substrate UQ to the catalytic site occurs only after a sequence of events related to NADH binding and subsequent NAD+ release. However, because the reaction mechanism of Ndi1 is now considered a ternary complex mechanism (described above), it became unnecessary to assume two different sites for bound UQ and catalytic UQ. In fact, all of our results from previous and current studies favor only one UQ binding site in Ndi1. (i) The bound UQ is freely replaced with other quinones available in the membrane and also during the turnover. (ii) The kinetic data with competitive inhibitors (RB-2 and UQ1H2) clearly indicated that there is no additional UQ binding site in Ndi1. (iii) In fact, the C-terminal 26 amino acids (Gly374–Glu399) containing Asp383 was identified recently as the sole UQ binding site by a photoaffinity labeling experiment (41Murai M. Yamashita T. Senoh M. Mashimo Y. Kataoka M. Kosaka H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Miyoshi H. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2973-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All of these data lead us to the more realistic conclusion that the bound UQ site in Ndi1 is identical to the catalytic UQ site (41Murai M. Yamashita T. Senoh M. Mashimo Y. Kataoka M. Kosaka H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Miyoshi H. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2973-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In summary, our current study revealed that Ndi1 exists as a UQ-bound form in the membrane. The UQ-bound form prevents oxygen from accessing the FAD site in Ndi1. At the same time, the bound UQ facilitates the formation of a ternary complex with NADH and safely accepts two electrons from the NADH-reduced FAD. After the resulting ubiquinol leaves Ndi1, the UQ binding site is immediately occupied with UQ from the quinone pool. This whole reaction mechanism contributes to the suppression of ROS generation from Ndi1.

They are commonly found in the respiratory chain of bacteria, fungi, and plant mitochondria but not in mammalian mitochondria (1Yagi T. Di Bernardo S. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Kao M.C. Seo B.B.

Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and catalyzes NADH oxidation on the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane (3Moller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.

Barber-Singh J. Yamashita T. Kao M.C. Matsuno-Yagi A. Rejuvenation Res. 2006; 9: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The physiological electron acceptor of NDH-2 is quinone, which is broadly classified into two types: naphthoquinone (menaquinone) and benzoquinone (ubiquinone (UQ)). Ndi1 utilizes the latter as an electron acceptor (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Both quinones have a hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic isoprenoid side chains and ensure electron transfer between several membrane-bound respiratory enzymes. Ndi1 does not react with oxygen in the presence of UQ. In the absence of quinone, NADH-reduced Ndi1 reacts with oxygen and produces H2O2, although intrinsic NADH oxidase activity is extremely low (about 300-fold less) compared with NADH-UQ1 oxidoreductase activity (5Yamashita T.

Our previous biochemical studies of Ndi1 suggest that Ndi1 has enzyme-bound UQ (bound UQ), which is distinct from the catalytic UQ (electron acceptor). Kinetic studies have indicated the physiological importance of bound UQ in Ndi1. When Ndi1 was incorporated into bovine heart submitochondrial particles, only the UQ-bound form established NADH-linked respiratory activity and did not produce H2O2 (5Yamashita T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E.

In other experiments, NDI1 (which encodes the Ndi1 protein)-transduced cells did not produce detectable levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (6Seo B.B. Marella M. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A.

Thus, it was postulated that the presence of bound UQ in Ndi1 is physiologically important in its enzymatic reaction and that Ndi1 bears at least two distinct UQ binding sites: one for bound UQ and another for catalytic UQ (5Yamashita T.

Group A has two adenine dinucleotide (ADP)-binding motifs and is involved in the non-covalent binding of NAD(P)H and FAD. Group B has the same two ADP-binding motifs and an additional conserved EF-hand. Group C has only one conserved ADP-binding motif where flavin is covalently bound (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The yeast Ndi1 enzyme belongs to group A (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and catalyzes NADH oxidation on the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane (3Moller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.

Barber-Singh J. Yamashita T. Kao M.C. Matsuno-Yagi A. Rejuvenation Res. 2006; 9: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The physiological electron acceptor of NDH-2 is quinone, which is broadly classified into two types: naphthoquinone (menaquinone) and benzoquinone (ubiquinone (UQ)). Ndi1 utilizes the latter as an electron acceptor (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Both quinones have a hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic isoprenoid side chains and ensure electron transfer between several membrane-bound respiratory enzymes. Ndi1 does not react with oxygen in the presence of UQ. In the absence of quinone, NADH-reduced Ndi1 reacts with oxygen and produces H2O2, although intrinsic NADH oxidase activity is extremely low (about 300-fold less) compared with NADH-UQ1 oxidoreductase activity (5Yamashita T.

Our previous biochemical studies of Ndi1 suggest that Ndi1 has enzyme-bound UQ (bound UQ), which is distinct from the catalytic UQ (electron acceptor). Kinetic studies have indicated the physiological importance of bound UQ in Ndi1. When Ndi1 was incorporated into bovine heart submitochondrial particles, only the UQ-bound form established NADH-linked respiratory activity and did not produc"
https://openalex.org/W2086362820,"In the TLR4 signaling pathways, we previously characterized a signal regulator, LRRFIP2, that modulates the time course-dependent changes in NF-κB activity through its dynamic interaction with the TLR adaptor protein, MyD88. However, little is known about the driving force behind the LPS-inducible dynamics between LRRFIP2 and MyD88. We have therefore designed a multiplex label-free quantitative proteomics method to investigate dynamic changes of LRRFIP2 phosphorylation upon LPS stimulation. Given our observation that LRRFIP2 binds to MyD88 through its serine-rich domain in which most of serine residues have the propensity to be phosphorylated, we used collision-activated dissociation- and electron transfer dissociation-based methods in a complementary manner to unambiguously localize phosphorylation sites in the peptides constituting the serine-rich domain. Among 23 phosphorylation sites identified and first quantified by the label-free approach and then verified by the AACT/SILAC (amino acid-coded tagging/stable isotope labeling in cell culture)-based quantitation method, phosphorylation at serine 202 showed a significant LPS-induced dynamic change during the full-course cellular response to LPS stimulation. The substitution of serine 202 with nonphosphorylated residues by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a weakened LRRFIP2-MyD88 interaction and a concurrently reduced activity in downstream NF-κB. Taking these results together, phosphorylation at serine 202 was found to regulate the dynamics of the LRRFIP2-MyD88 interaction, which in turn modulated the strength and duration of TLR4 signaling. Strategically, we have demonstrated the importance of precise identification of the biologically relevant phosphorylation site(s) using comprehensive mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics approaches in guiding downstream biological characterization experiments, which could otherwise be both time- and cost-consuming for a large number of phosphorylation possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W2016995614,"The β subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are best known for their roles in regulating surface expression and gating of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel α1 subunits. Recent evidence, however, indicates that these proteins have a variety of Ca2+ channel-independent functions. For example, on the molecular level, they regulate gene expression, and on the whole animal level, they regulate early cell movements in zebrafish development. In the present study, an alternatively spliced, truncated β4 subunit (β4c) is identified in the human brain and shown to be highly expressed in nuclei of vestibular neurons. Pull-down assays, nuclear magnetic resonance, and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrate that the protein interacts with the chromo shadow domain (CSD) of heterochromatin protein 1γ. Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that the primary CSD interaction occurs through a β4c C-terminal PXVXL consensus motif, adding the β4c subunit to a growing PXVXL protein family with epigenetic responsibilities. These proteins have multiple nuclear functions, including transcription regulation (TIF1α) and nucleosome assembly (CAF1). An NMR-based two-site docking model of β4c in complex with dimerized CSD is presented. Possible roles for the interaction are discussed.

An NMR-based two-site docking model of β4c in complex with dimerized CSD is presented. Possible roles for the interaction are discussed. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels play critical roles in a number of cellular events including excitation-contraction coupling, neurotransmitter release, and Ca2+-dependent gene transcription (1Dolphin A.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are multisubunit proteins composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit, a two-part α2δ/γ integral membrane subunit, and a soluble cytosolic β subunit (2Dolphin A.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The auxiliary β subunit functions both as a chaperone in trafficking the channel complex to the plasma membrane and as a major regulator of channel gating (opening and closing). These functions are thought to occur mainly through a specific interaction between the β subunit and the α1 interaction domain of the intracellular loop between α1 repeat motifs I and II (3De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). More recently, reports of Ca2+ channel-independent functions for β subunits have begun to emerge that appear to be centered in the nucleus. We showed recently, for example, that zebrafish embryos lacking β4 subunits failed to initiate epiboly and that the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon may be related to the high levels of β4 expression in yolk syncytial nuclei (4Ebert A.M.

Other studies have shown that β subunit functions in the nucleus may be cell type- and splice variant-specific (5Subramanyam P. Obermair G.J. Baumgartner S. Gebhart M. Striessnig J. Kaufmann W.A. Geley S. Flucher B.E. Channels. 2009; 3: 343-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Voltage-gated Ca2+ channel β4 subunit structures are composed of multiple domains. Sequence comparisons led to the initial discovery that Ca2+ channel β subunits are membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins consisting of core Src homology 3 and guanylate kinase (GK) 2The abbreviations used are: GK, guanylate kinase; CSD, chromo shadow domain; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. domains connected by a large variable loop (HOOK) (6Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Wallace B.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The core is flanked by highly variable N- and C-terminal domains. High resolution x-ray crystallographic studies further confirmed the structure of the β subunit core domains and determined that the interaction between the β and α1 subunits occurs via GK domain binding with high affinity to the α1 interaction domain of α1 (7Chen Y.H.

The β subunits are encoded by four non-allelic genes, and multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of each gene have been identified (11Helton T.D. Horne W.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Foell J.D. Balijepalli R.C. Delisle B.P. Yunker A.M. Robia S.L. Walker J.W. McEnery M.W. January C.T. Kamp T.J. Physiol.

Alternative splicing of different full-length β subunit isoforms not only generates variable coding sequences for N-terminal, HOOK, and C-terminal domains but also generates shorter variants with truncated Src homology 3 and/or GK domains. These variants result from splicing-induced frameshifts and subsequent early stop codons (12Foell J.D. Balijepalli R.C. Delisle B.P. Yunker A.M. Robia S.L. Walker J.W. McEnery M.W. January C.T.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a previous yeast two-hybrid study (14Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Rousset M. Charnet P. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showed that a truncated β4 splice variant, β4c, isolated from chicken cochlear sensory epithelia (but not full-length β4a), interacted with nuclear protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). The interaction was shown to attenuate the gene silencing activity by HP1 in vitro. This preliminary study did not identify the specific binding mechanism and concluded, based on RT-PCR, that the protein was not expressed in the rat brain. Consequently, there have been no subsequent studies of the β4c-HP1γ interaction. Our results show that alternative splicing of exon 9 of β4 RNA does indeed occur in the human brain, that the resultant human β4c protein is nearly identical to chicken β4c, and that β4c is almost exclusively found in the nuclei of vestibular and deep cerebellar neurons. Using multiple in vitro biochemical and biophysical techniques, we show that β4c interacts with the chromo shadow domains (CSDs) of HP1 dimers and that the interaction occurs via two β4c sites, the primary of which is a C-terminal PXVXL consensus sequence. A docking model of the complex formed by β4c and the CSD dimer (referred to as CSD throughout) is presented, and the possible mechanisms of gene regulation are discussed. Our results open up new and interesting research avenues that may be especially important for our understanding of the function of the vestibular system in health and disease. PCR primers designed based on genomic human β4 sequence were used to amplify exon 9 splice variants. The four primers used for PCR reactions were as follows: exon 8 forward (5′-TATCATATGGCCACCCCTTACGATGTTGTACCGTCAAT-3′); exon 12 reverse (5′-CTGCTCGAGCTATTAATCAACCGCTGTAAAAC-3′); β4a forward (5′-TCACATATGATGTATGACAATTTGTACCTGCATGG-3′); and β4c reverse (5′-CTGCTCGAGTCAGCTGTCACTCTCGTTATTGAAATCCTCG-3′). NdeI and XhoI restriction sequences were added to the 5′-end of primers for ligation into the vector pET-15b. Human brain first-strand cDNA was purchased from Biochain (Hayward, CA), and 10 ng of cDNA was used as templates for PCR amplification. The thermal cycling program was as follows: 1 cycle of 98 °C for 30 s and 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 25 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. A final step of 72 °C for 5 min was used for the final extension. All PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. For protein expression, PCR fragments were excised and purified from the gel, digested with NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes, and ligated into the similarly digested hexahistidine pET-15b (Novagen) vector. Human β4c 38–184 (β4cΔ184), β4c 38–199 (β4cΔ199), and the CSD of human HP1γ (residues 113–183) were constructed in this manner. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Snap-frozen cerebellum and brainstem from adult (>2 months) C57BL/6 mice were thawed and homogenized (10% w/v) in ice-cold 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm benzamidine, containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). The crude cerebellar/brainstem homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 900 × g to obtain the nuclear pellet. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g to obtain the crude membrane pellet (P2), which was then resuspended in the same buffer. The resulting suspension was layered on a solution of homogenization buffer containing 1.6 m sucrose and centrifuged for 2 h at 60,000 × g to obtain the synaptosomal fraction (floating layer). This fraction was centrifuged for 1 h at 60,000 × g through 0.8 m sucrose in homogenization buffer to obtain the P4, synaptosome pellet. Proteins from cerebellar/brainstem, nuclear, and synaptosome fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred at 30 V to Immun-BlotTM PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked with TBST plus 5% milk (Blotto) and incubated with rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (anti-β4aA; 1:5000) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with Blotto prior to a 2-h incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) at 26 °C. Membranes were washed four times with Blotto and two times with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, prior to development with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Novagen) at 26 °C. Adult (>2 months) C57BL/6 mice anesthetized with xylazine (4 mg/kg) and ketamine (21 mg/kg) were transcardially perfused with 10 ml (5 ml/min) of heparanized saline (0.9%), followed by 25 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. For light microscopy, brains were removed and post-fixed overnight in the same fixative at 4 °C. Brains were washed repeatedly in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Cerebellum with attached brainstem was isolated, embedded in 5% agarose, sectioned at 50 μm with a vibratome (Leica VT1000S, E. Licht, Denver, CO), and collected into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.5. Sections were subjected to the following antigen retrieval procedures prior to antibody treatments: a 30-min soak in 0.1 m glycine in PBS, followed by three washes in PBS at 4 °C; a 15-min soak in 0.5% sodium borohydride in PBS, followed by four washes in PBS at 4 °C; a 60-min soak in 0.05 sodium citrate, pH 8.6, at 26 °C; and a 30-min soak in 0.05 sodium citrate, pH 8.6, at 80 °C, followed by a 30-min slow cool to 24 °C and three washes in PBS. Cerebellar sections were blocked with PBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1% hydrogen peroxide at 4 °C. Sections were incubated for 36 h at 4 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of primary affinity-purified rabbit anti-β4a polyclonal antibody. Following incubation with primary antibody, sections were washed four times with PBS and then incubated with biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse (1:2500; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in 1% normal goat serum, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 24 °C. Immunoreactions were detected using a Vectastain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Some sections were lightly counterstained with 1% basic fuschin to visualize nuclei. All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 Rosetta (DE3) pLysS. A single colony of freshly transformed E. coli was inoculated into 20 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight culture was further inoculated into 1 liter of LB or isotope (15N or 15N/13C)-containing medium (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6 absorbance units. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and protein expression was induced for 3 h (for unlabeled protein) or 4 h (for labeled protein) before the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 20 min. The harvested cells were resuspended in a binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was incubated with 50 units of DNase I (Bio-Rad) and 12.5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min and further centrifuged at 17,000 RPM for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered and collected. The supernatant was then loaded onto a 15-ml Ni2+ resin column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with 100 ml of binding buffer. After washing with eight column volumes of binding buffer, the desired protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole (up to 300 mm). For Δ199 or Δ184 β4c proteins used for pull-down experiments, fractions eluted from the Ni2+ column were further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75HR column or a Sephacryl S-200 HR column on an AKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0. For CSD and β4c proteins used for other experiments, after the Ni2+ column, the His6 tag was removed by overnight thrombin cleavage (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The His6 tag-cleaved proteins were further purified by gel filtration using the same protocols. Protein purity was analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the protein samples were concentrated via centrifugal filtration. Protein concentrations were determined by the UV absorbance at 280 nm using predicted extinction coefficients. Purified His6-tagged β4cΔ199 was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with fresh Ni2+ resin beads (Bio-Rad) and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and beads were washed with binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.0). β4cΔ199-bound beads were incubated for 1 h in loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0) with 20 μm untagged CSD in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and subsequently centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and beads were washed with 1 ml of binding buffer five times. Elution buffer (500 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) was added, and the sample was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min. Contents of the supernatant were analyzed using SDS-PAGE. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were carried out at 298 K with a MicroCal (Northampton, MA) VP-ITC microcalorimeter. All proteins were dialyzed against the same buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm DTT), and all buffers were degassed before experiments. For all measurements, 28 injections of 10 μl of CSD dimer were titrated into 1.4-ml solutions of either β4cΔ199 or β4cΔ184 proteins (or, for base-line correction, buffer alone) to a stoichiometric ratio of 2.1:1. Data were processed and analyzed with MicroCal Origin 7.0. All NMR experiments were conducted at 298 K with a Varian Inova 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance, z-gradient cryogenic probe. For the first set of titration experiments, NMR protein samples, 15N-labeled β4cΔ199 or β4cΔ184 and unlabeled CSD, were dissolved in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Glu/Arg, 10% D2O, pH 7.0. Aliquots of 2 mm CSD dimer were titrated into 300 μm 15N β4cΔ199 or β4cΔ184 to a final molar ratio of 1.25; 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded following each aliquot. For CSD resonance assignments, 15N,13C-double-labeled CSD dimer was dissolved in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 10% D2O, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 0.8 mm. The 15N HSQC backbone amide assignments of the CSD were completed with standard three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments (15Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York2006: 613-654Google Scholar), including CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCA, and HN(CO)CA, and confirmed by a three-dimensional 15N HSQC nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiment. An HSQC of 15N-labeled CSD in complex with unlabeled β4cΔ199 in excess was also recorded to confirm the complex formation. For peptide binding experiments, a 17-mer peptide, PSMRPVVLVGPSLKGYE (>95% purity), derived from the C-terminal sequence of β4cΔ199 was synthesized by Invitrogen. The peptide was dissolved in sodium phosphate NMR buffer and used in NMR titrations without further purification (concentration was determined by an extinction coefficient, ϵ280 = 1490 m−1 cm−1). In peptide titration experiments, 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded with samples of 0.8 mm 15N-labeled CSD dimer into which 5-μl aliquots of unlabeled 17-mer peptide were titrated. The final molar ratio of peptide over CSD dimer was 2:1. The backbone amide assignments of 15N,13C-labeled CSD in complex with the β4c peptide were finished via the connectivity of Cα chemical shifts with a pair of three-dimensional experiments, HNCA and HN(CO)CA. Protein NMR data processing was performed using NMRPipe (16Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11259) Google Scholar), and the spectra were analyzed in CCPNMR (17Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar) and Sparky (18Kneller D.G. Kuntz I.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 254Google Scholar). The structure coordinates of β4cΔ199 were modeled (Modeler 7.0) (19Eswar N. John B. Mirkovic N. Fiser A. Ilyin V.A. Pieper U. Stuart A.C. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Yerkovich B. Sali A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) based on the structure of the β4 core protein (Protein Data Bank entry 1VYV). Using default parameters of the program, the structure of human HP1γ CSD dimer was modeled based on mouse HP1β CSD in a complex with CAF1 peptide (Protein Data Bank entry 1S4Z) (20Thiru A. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Okuwaki M. Lyon D. Nielsen P.R. Hirshberg M. Verreault A. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). HADDOCK (high ambiguity-driven docking) (21Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar) was used for the docking of β4cΔ199 with CSD dimer. Based on homology modeling using the structure of the complex CAF1·CSD (Protein Data Bank entry 1S4Z) as a template, a set of distance restraints describing the contact between β4cΔ199 residues Pro187–Val191 and C-terminal residues of the CSD dimer were applied. Another group of CSD residues (Gly128, Ala129, and Trp173 for each monomer of the dimer) with large chemical shift changes in the peptide titration experiments were used for ambiguous restraints. These residues are surface-exposed in the free proteins and thought to be at the interface of the complex, thus showing large chemical shift changes upon complex formation. These residues can be restrained within 6–8 Å of any residue (ambiguous) on the interacting partner during docking (21Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). During the first cycle docking calculation, 2000 structures were generated, followed by a refinement step for 200 structures. These 200 structures were subsequently subjected to a cycle of simulated annealing during which the C-terminal of CSD and the HOOK region and residues Pro183–Arg186 of β4cΔ199 were allowed to be flexible to optimize the contact. Finally, all the structures were scored and clustered using a root mean square deviation value of 2.0 Å. The first model from the highest scored cluster is used to represent the structure model of the complex β4cΔ199·CSD. A truncated Ca2+ channel β4 subunit spice variant, termed β4c, was previously shown to be expressed in chicken cochlea (14Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Rousset M. Charnet P. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This variant results from splicing out exon 9 from β4a subtype mRNA (Fig. 1). To determine whether the same alternative splicing event occurs in human RNA, we performed PCR with exon 9-flanking primers (exon 8F and exon 12R) using whole brain and cerebellum cDNA as templates. Two PCR products could clearly be identified (Fig. 1A, right). DNA sequencing confirmed the identities of both fragments: the bright 433 bp upper band is the amplification product of full-length β4; the lower 374 bp band is the product of an alternatively spliced β4 that lacks exon 9. We previously reported that alternative splicing of human β4 N-terminal exons creates β4a and β4b subtypes (11Helton T.D. Horne W.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the published chicken β4c sequence contained the β4a N terminus, we chose to amplify human full-length β4c using a forward primer that contained the start codon of β4a (in exon 2a) and a reverse primer that bridged exon 8 and exon 10 (Fig. 1B). We used cDNA from a variety of brain regions as template and found an especially high level of amplification from pons (Fig. 1B, right). The resulting 639-bp PCR product was ligated into pET-15b vector, sequenced, and subsequently expressed as protein in bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that skipping exon 9 in human β4 RNA causes a frameshift and premature stop codon that creates a truncated β4c protein with 207 amino acids (∼23 kDa). Sequence alignment of human and chicken β4c shows that these two proteins are nearly identical (Fig. 1C). Both proteins contain the β4a N terminus, the Src homology 3 domain and HOOK sequence, a truncated GK domain, and additional C-terminal sequence resulting from the frameshift. To determine whether or not β4c is found in the nucleus, we used a well characterized antibody directed toward the N terminus of β4a (22Vendel A.C. Terry M.D. Striegel A.R. Iverson N.M. Leuranguer V. Rithner C.D. Lyons B.A. Pickard G.E. Tobet S.A. Horne W.A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2635-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in Western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments (Fig. 2). Fig. 2A shows that the β4a antibody labels two bands in crude cerebellar/brainstem membranes (CB), one corresponding to a 52-kDa protein and the other to a ∼20-kDa protein. The 52-kDa protein co-purifies with synaptosomes (Fig. 2, S) and represents full-length β4a; the 20 kDa band co-purifies with nuclei (N) and is probably β4c. The β4c protein is a highly acidic protein (pI = 5.16) and therefore highly negatively charged at the pH (8.3) of the SDS running buffer. This can account for the mobility shift and size anomaly (predicted size is 23 kDa) compared with the neutral charged standards used for SDS-PAGE. It is also possible that the protein undergoes post-translational modification. Fig. 2B shows comparisons of antibody and fuschin-stained cross-sections of mouse cerebellar cortex (molecular layer (ML), Purkinje cell layer (P), and granule cell layer (GCL)), dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), and medial vestibular nucleus (MVN). The fuschin staining provides an approximate count of the total number of nuclei present in each section. Interestingly, there is no antibody staining in the granule cell layer of the cerebellar cortex, which contains the highest number of cells, and no staining in Purkinje cells (Fig. 2B, a). The staining in the molecular layer corresponds to full-length β4a localized to synapses (22Vendel A.C. Terry M.D. Striegel A.R. Iverson N.M. Leuranguer V. Rithner C.D. Lyons B.A. Pickard G.E. Tobet S.A. Horne W.A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2635-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is sparse staining within the dorsal cochlear nucleus (Fig. 2B, c), where β4c was reported to be the only β4 subunit splice variant expressed in chicken (14Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Rousset M. Charnet P. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The medial vestibular nucleus contains the most antibody staining, where nearly half of all nuclei are labeled (the slightly higher number of fuschin-stained cells may be due to higher stain penetrability compared with the antibody), and the structures identified appear to be variably labeled nuclei (Fig. 2B, e). A closer view (e, inset) shows a staining pattern that is nearly identical to that revealed for HP1 in other cells (23Festenstein R. Pagakis S.N. Hiragami K. Lyon D. Verreault A. Sekkali B. Kioussis D. Science. 2003; 299: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and suggests that β4c may be located along with HP1 in heterochromatin foci. Taken together, our results suggest the intriguing possibility that β4c plays an epigenetic role in regulating nuclear transcription in specific neuronal cell types. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that we saw β4a antibody staining in the nuclei of deep cerebellar neurons and that we could not amplify β4c from human cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, or thalamus (not shown). The CSD is highly conserved among all HP1 isoforms (Fig. 3A) and is the binding partner for a variety of proteins involved in transcription. These proteins have recently been classified into four groups according to their binding profiles (24Nozawa R.S. Nagao K. Masuda H.T. Iwasaki O. Hirota T. Nozaki N. Kimura H. Obuse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The majority of HP1-interacting proteins fall into group I and contain a consensus PXVXL motif. Phage display and NMR studies have revealed that the PXVXL pentapeptide motif contained in these proteins binds specifically to a surface formed by a CSD dimer (25Smothers J.F. Henikoff S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 27-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the study by Hibino et al. (14Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Rousset M. Charnet P. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the yeast two-hybrid method was used to identify the region of β4c responsible for interacting with the HP1γ CSD. The results demonstrated that the 170–199 sequence of β4c contains critical residues for the interaction with CSD. On further examination of the sequence of β4c, we found a candidate CSD binding motif, PVVLV, located at residues 187–191 of the C terminus (Fig. 3B). Although the flanking sequences of PVVLV do not show high homology to other PXVXL motif-containing proteins, such as transcriptional intermediary factor 1 (TIF1α) and chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1), the PVVLV sequence itself contains the three most important hydrophobic residues essential for the CSD dimer interaction. The finding of a PXVXL motif at positions 187–191 is consistent with the general findings of Hibino et al. (14Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Rousset M. Charnet P. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that the interaction occurs in the last 29 amino acids of the β4c sequence. The discovery of the PXVXL sequence prompted us to design further experiments to characterize the physical interaction of β4c with CSD. We hypothesized that the C terminus of β4c binds to the CSD dimer in a manner similar to the CAF1 peptide (Fig. 3C). Guided by the structure of the β4a A domain (26Vendel A.C. Rithner C.D. Lyons B.A. Horne W.A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we created an N-terminal truncation construct, β4c 38–199 (β4cΔ199; see underlined sequence in Fig. 1C), to characterize further the"
https://openalex.org/W2043418934,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a central element of eukaryotic gene expression. Its deregulation can lead to disease, and methods to change splice site selection are developed as potential therapies. Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by the loss of the SMN1 (survival of motoneuron 1) gene. A therapeutic avenue for spinal muscular atrophy treatment is to promote exon 7 inclusion of the almost identical SMN2 (survival of motoneuron 2) gene. The splicing factor tra2-beta1 promotes inclusion of this exon and is antagonized by protein phosphatase (PP) 1. To identify new compounds that promote exon 7 inclusion, we synthesized analogs of cantharidin, an inhibitor of PP1, and PP2A. Three classes of compounds emerged from these studies. The first class blocks PP1 and PP2A activity, blocks constitutive splicing in vitro, and promotes exon 7 inclusion in vivo. The second class has no measurable effect on PP1 activity but activates PP2A. This class represents the first compounds described with these properties. These compounds cause a dephosphorylation of Thr-33 of tra2-beta1, which promotes exon 7 inclusion. The third class had no detectable effect on phosphatase activity and could promote exon 7 via allosteric effects. Our data show that subtle changes in similar compounds can turn a phosphatase inhibitor into an activator. These chemically related compounds influence alternative splicing by distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1999335100,"Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) represents a ubiquitous Ca2+ influx pathway activated by the filling state of intracellular Ca2+ stores. SOCE is mediated by coupling of STIM1, the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor, to the Orai1 channel. SOCE inactivates during meiosis, partly because of the inability of STIM1 to cluster in response to store depletion. STIM1 has several functional domains, including the Orai1 interaction domain (STIM1 Orai Activating Region (SOAR) or CRAC Activation Domain (CAD)) and STIM1 homomerization domain. When Ca2+ stores are full, these domains are inactive to prevent constitutive Ca2+ entry. Here we show, using the Xenopus oocyte as an expression system, that the C-terminal 200 residues of STIM1 are important to maintain STIM1 in an inactive state when Ca2+ stores are full, through predicted intramolecular shielding of the active STIM1 domains (SOAR/CAD and STIM1 homomerization domain). Interestingly, our data argue that the C-terminal 200 residues accomplish this through a steric hindrance mechanism because they can be substituted by GFP or mCherry while maintaining all aspects of STIM1 function.

SOCE mediates a slow sustained entry of extracellular Ca2+ that is important for various homeostatic and signaling functions, including store refilling, T-cell activation, modulation of Ca2+ signal dynamics, and apoptosis (2Parekh A.B.

Current evidence argues that at low luminal Ca2+, STIM1 loses its bound Ca2+, producing a conformational change that leads to STIM1 clustering into large puncta.

However, this modulation depends on the length of the soluble fragment used, arguing for differential folding and exposure of the SOAR/CAD domain.

Interestingly, STIM1 loses its ability to cluster in response to store depletion during cell division (23Smyth J.T. Petranka J.G. Boyles R.R. DeHaven W.I. Fukushima M. Johnson K.L. Williams J.G.

(23Smyth J.T. Petranka J.G. Boyles R.R. DeHaven W.I. Fukushima M. Johnson K.L. Williams J.G. Putney Jr., J.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have argued that STIM1 clustering inhibition in mitosis is due to phosphorylation, whereas Yu et al. (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17401-17406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have shown that phosphorylation of residues in the C-terminal end of STIM1 during meiosis does not affect STIM1 clustering. To better define the role of this C-terminal STIM1 domain in STIM1 clustering inhibition during meiosis, we generated a STIM1 deletion downstream of residue 485. Surprisingly, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, STIM1-485 constitutively interacts with Orai1 and traps it intracellularly, hence inhibiting SOCE. STIM1-485 also disrupts the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Replacing the C-terminal domain of STIM1(486–669) with nonspecific sequences of similar length (GFP or mCherry) produces a chimeric protein that replicates wild-type STIM1 function in terms of its ability to form puncta, translocate to the cortical ER, and bind to and gate Orai1. These results are consistent with a model in which the C-terminal end of STIM1 sterically shields the SOAR/CAD domain from constitutively interacting with Orai1 when Ca2+ stores are full. Furthermore, the STIM1-485-mCherry chimera is unable to form clusters in response to Ca2+ store depletion during meiosis, showing that inhibition of STIM1 clustering does not involve the C-terminal 200 residues of STIM1. The pSGEM-mCherry-STIM1, pSGEM-mCherry-STIM1-D76A, and pSGEM-GFP-Orai1 plasmids were described previously (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For confocal imaging, cells were injected with 5 ng of GFP-KDEL RNA, 2 ng of GFP-Orai1 RNA, and/or 10 ng of STIM1 or the different mutants. Ca2+-activated Cl− currents were used to monitor intracellular calcium elevation as described previously (25Machaca K. Haun S. J. Biol.

Briefly, ICl-1 (activated by intracellular calcium release) is measured during a first voltage step from −30 to +40 mV. Next, a hyperpolarizing pulse to −140 mV increases the driving force for extracellular calcium entry. The third voltage step to +40 mV consequently allows the measure of the development of ICl-T that depends only on extracellular calcium influx. The value for ICl-T was corrected for the remaining ICl-1 current (end of the first pulse). To measure the SOCE current (ISOC) independently of the chloride currents, cells were injected with BAPTA (1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) (∼7 mm), and ISOC was measured in a solution containing 5 mm Ca2+. Current-voltage relationships were obtained using voltage ramps lasting 1.5 s from −120 to +40 mV applied every 10s. Ionomycin (10 μm) was perfused for 20 s to deplete Ca2+ stores. The amplitude of ISOC was corrected from the leak measured after inhibiting the current with 100 μm La3+. Current amplitudes are expressed as means ± S.E. Significance was tested using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Cells were impaled with sharp microelectrodes (1–5 megohms) filled with 3 m KCl. Standard extracellular Ringer's solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The 5 mm Ca2+ Ringer's solution to measure ISOC contained 91.2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Live cell imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal using a Plan Apo 63×/1.4 oil DIC II objective. Cells were scanned in OR2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) except for experiments on Ca2+ store depletion with 5 mm TPEN (Sigma) or 10 μm ionomycin (Invitrogen) in Ca2+-free OR2 solution for 5–30 min at room temperature. Images were analyzed using ZEN 2008 software (Zeiss), and figures were compiled using Adobe Photoshop. For the time course of STIM1 punctum formation, imaging was performed on the LSM 710 confocal microscope using an EC Plan Neofluar 40×/1.30 oil DIC M27 objective with the pinhole fully open. A 744 × 744-pixel image was taken every 3 s from oocytes expressing GFP-Orai1 with STIM1-485-Ch or Ch-STIM1 or from oocytes expressing GFP-KDEL with STIM1-485-Ch-K or Ch-STIM1. Oocytes were scanned in Ca2+-free OR2 solution and store-depleted with 10 μm ionomycin. The data were collected and analyzed using ZEN2008 software. A region of interest of 300 × 300 pixels was chosen, and mCherry intensity was analyzed over time as an indicator of punctum formation. Xenopus oocytes are arrested at the G2-M transition of the cell cycle (referred to as oocytes) and progress to metaphase of meiosis II during maturation (referred to as eggs). This maturation period is essential for the egg to activate at fertilization. During meiosis, the ER restructures into large patches that are enriched in STIM1 (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17401-17406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Terasaki M. Runft L.L. Hand A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This is illustrated in Fig. 1, A (oocyte) and B (egg), in cells that coexpress the ER marker GFP-KDEL and STIM1 tagged with mCherry at its N terminus (see schematic in Fig. 1, A and B). Compare the reticular ER structure observed in oocytes (Fig. 1A) with that after oocyte maturation in eggs (B), where large ER patches were formed in addition to the oocyte-like reticular ER distribution. In both oocytes and eggs, STIM1 co-localized with GFP-KDEL (Fig. 1, A and B). We have shown previously that activation of Cdk1 during meiosis is necessary and sufficient to down-regulate SOCE (30Machaca K. Haun S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because consensus Cdk1 phosphorylation sites cluster in the C-terminal 200 residues of STIM1 and because STIM1 is hyperphosphorylated during meiosis (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17401-17406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we were interested in testing the role of the C-terminal 200 residues of STIM1 in its clustering inhibition during meiosis. Alanine substitution and phosphomimetic mutations in various combinations in the Ser/Pro-rich region of STIM1 had no effect on modulating its clustering behavior during meiosis (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17401-17406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the role of the C-terminal 200 residues in STIM1 clustering, we generated a STIM1 deletion mutant that encompasses residues 1–485 with an mCherry tag at the luminal N terminus: Ch-STIM1-485 (see schematic in Fig. 1, C and D). Expression of STIM1-485 in oocytes resulted in disruption of ER structure (Fig. 1C), producing large amorphous structures only in areas enriched with STIM1-485. Compare the irregular white outlined shape in Fig. 1C, where STIM1-485 is enriched and ER structure is disrupted, with the white box with little STIM1-485 expression and normal ER distribution. Fig. 1C also shows an orthogonal section across the stack of z-section confocal images, with the planes displayed in the upper panel, indicated by the blue and red tabs, respectively. As illustrated in the deeper focal plane, ER regions with no significant accumulation of STIM1-485 maintain their normal structure (Fig. 1C). In eggs expressing STIM1-485, a similar disruption of ER structure was observed, with amorphous ER in areas enriched in STIM1-485 (Fig. 1D, irregular white outline) compared with areas with low STIM1-485 (white box). In addition, no ER patches were observed in areas enriched in STIM1-485 compared with the rest of the ER (Fig. 1D). As in the oocyte, deep confocal sections exhibited little STIM1-485 and normal ER structure (Fig. 1D). We interpret these data in the context of functional domains within STIM1, particularly the SHD, which has been postulated to be responsible for STIM1-STIM1 interaction following store depletion (18Muik M. Fahrner M. Derler I. Schindl R. Bergsmann J. Frischauf I. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8421-8426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). STIM1-485 may have the SHD exposed, potentially leading to self-association of STIM1 molecules in trans on opposite membranes of the ER, resulting in a disrupted ER structure. Expressing STIM1 with Orai1 shows Orai1 localization to the cell membrane (Fig. 2A, orthogonal section (Ortho)) and in recycling endosomes as illustrated in the xy focal plane view. Orai1 is removed from the cell membrane into an endosomal compartment in the egg (Fig. 2B). The recycling of Orai1 and its internalization during meiosis have been characterized previously in significant detail (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17401-17406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Depletion of Ca2+ stores with TPEN resulted in coincident STIM1-Orai1 puncta in oocytes (Fig. 2A) but not in eggs (Fig. 2B). Hence, store depletion in oocytes leads to STIM1 clustering into large puncta, whereas in eggs, STIM1 does not alter its subcellular distribution following store depletion (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17401-17406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When Orai1 was coexpressed with STIM1-485, a dramatically different picture emerged. Orai1 co-localized with STIM1-485, leading to trapping of Orai1 intracellularly and preventing its enrichment at the cell membrane (Fig. 2C). This was also true in eggs (Fig. 2D). As is the case with cells expressing STIM1-485 alone, store depletion did not significantly alter STIM1-485 distribution or Orai1 distribution (Fig. 2, C and D). The fact that STIM1-485 is capable of trapping Orai1 intracellularly shows that this mutant interacts with Orai1 in a constitutive fashion independently of store depletion, arguing that the SOAR/CAD domain is exposed and can interact constitutively with Orai1. This observation is consistent with the STIM1-485 self-association model, as it would prevent STIM1-485 from relocalizing to puncta following store depletion. These results suggest that in the absence of the C-terminal 200 residues, STIM1-485 in oocytes can self-associate and interact with Orai1 in a constitutive fashion. To test whether the C-terminal 200 residues of STIM1 can rescue this phenotype, we overexpressed a peptide encompassing this domain of STIM1 as a separate peptide with STIM1-485 (Fig. 3A). This did not rescue the ER disruption phenotype or the constitutive interaction between STIM1-485 and Orai1 (Fig. 3A). This suggests that a soluble STIM1(486–685) fragment cannot associate with STIM1-485 to rescue its constitutive association with itself and Orai1. Our data so far argue that STIM1-485 constitutively interacts with Orai1 and traps it intracellularly. If this interpretation is correct, then expression of Orai1 before STIM1-485 should allow it to reach the cell membrane. This is indeed the case, as shown in Fig. 3B, where Orai1 expressed 1 day before STIM1-485 was enriched at the cell membrane (Fig. 3B). A proportion of the total cellular Orai1 in this case was trapped intracellularly and co-localized with STIM1-485 (Fig. 3B). This is likely due to Orai1 going through the biogenesis pathway and Orai1 recycling between the cell membrane and endosomal compartments (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17401-17406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We then tested the distribution and effect on ER structure of a shorter C-terminal deletion, STIM1-535. The structure of the ER in oocytes expressing STIM1-535 was similar to that in control oocytes injected with wild-type STIM1 (supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore, STIM1-535 responded normally to store depletion by co-clustering with Orai1 at the cell membrane focal plane. These results show that a C-terminal domain of STIM1 extending to residue 535 contains the necessary structural features necessary to maintain STIM1 in an inactive state when Ca2+ stores are full. Given the subcellular localization of STIM1-485 in oocytes, it was important to characterize the effect on ISOC. Coexpression of Orai1 with STIM1-485 produced a significantly smaller ISOC than when Orai1 was expressed with full-length STIM1 (Fig. 4A). However, the STIM1-485-mediated current maintained the SOCE signature inward rectification and sensitivity to La3+ (Fig. 4A), arguing that STIM1-485 is functional but not effective. The smaller ISOC is supported by the disrupted ER phenotype following STIM1-485 expression, the ineffective formation of puncta in response to store depletion in STIM1-485-expressing cells, and the intracellular trapping of Orai1 when coexpressed with STIM1-485 (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). In addition, the constitutive association of STIM1-485 with Orai1 argues that with sufficient Orai1 at the cell membrane, STIM1-485 should function as a constitutively active mutant to some extent. To further explore this possibility, we used the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− current (ICl-T). ICl-T faithfully reproduces the dynamics and amplitude of ISOC in oocytes (29Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As observed with ISOC, STIM1-485 expression produced a smaller ICl-T when coexpressed with Orai1 or when Orai1 was expressed 1 day earlier (Fig. 4B, left panel). However, in a small number of cells, a large constitutive Ca2+ influx was observed (Fig. 4B, middle panel). In addition, long-term recordings following store depletion show an increased percentage of STIM1-485 cells producing Ca2+ influx (Fig. 4B, right panel). Examples of the subcellular distribution of Orai1 and STIM1-485 from cells producing small (Fig. 4C) and large (Fig. 4D) ICl-T with the corresponding current traces (Fig. 4E) are shown. The cell with a small SOCE exhibited few STIM1-Orai1 puncta, consistent with the low current amplitude (Fig. 4C). This argues that prolonged store depletion allows a fraction of STIM1-485 to escape from the disrupted ER structures at low efficiency and form puncta to recruit Orai1 and activate ISOC. In contrast, the cell with a large ICl-T exhibited striking invaginations at the cell membrane that brought Orai1 into physical proximity to STIM1-485 in the ER, resulting in SOCE (Fig. 4, D and E). This is an interesting phenotype, which argues that, in some rare instances, invaginations of the cell membrane may be stabilized through interactions between Orai1 and STIM1-485. Together, these results suggest that STIM1-485 is still capable of sensing Ca2+ store depletion but cannot easily translocate to the cortical ER, as it appears to be trapped in amorphous ER structures (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). To test whether STIM1-485 interferes with full-length STIM1 function, we coexpressed both proteins in addition to Orai1 and measured ICl-T as a readout of functionality. Coexpression of full-length STIM1 with STIM1-485 did not significantly affect the levels of Ca2+ influx, with expression of full-length STIM1 alone producing an ICl-T of 5.73 ± 0.8 μA and full-length STIM1 + STIM1-485 producing a current of 4.1 ± 0.9 μA (n = 5). This argues that STIM1-485 does not interfere significantly with full-length STIM1 function. Several groups have expressed in mammalian cells STIM1 deletions similar to STIM1-485 that are anchored in the ER membrane but have not reported any defects in ISOC levels or the subcellular distribution of these mutants (19Mullins F.M.

Williams J.G. Putney Jr., J.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of STIM1-485 in Xenopus oocytes results in a small current and disrupted ER structure. One possibility for the disparate behavior of STIM1-485 in these expression systems is the potential absence in Xenopus oocytes of accessory proteins that would interact with STIM1 deletions in mammalian cells, allowing it to function somewhat normally. This would not be unusual, as there are several precedents showing that the behavior of proteins is very much dependent on the cellular context. This is well recognized for G-protein-coupled receptors, where the same receptor links to different signaling modules depending on the cell type and expression of specific downstream interacting proteins (32Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1159-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). For example, expression of the pore-forming subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels in different mammalian cells leads to distinct voltage dependence and activation and inactivation kinetics because of association with an endogenous β-subunit expressed in a cell type-specific fashion (33Uebele V.N. England S.K. Chaudhary A. Tamkun M.M. Snyders D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2406-2412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 34Petersen K.R. Nerbonne J.M. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein function can be modulated in a cell type-specific fashion based on the endogenous complement of interacting proteins. It is therefore not surprising that STIM1 deletions behave differently in the Xenopus oocyte versus mammalian expression systems. Nonetheless, the phenotype of STIM1-485 in Xenopus oocytes offers an opportunity to better understand STIM1 dynamics and intramolecular interactions. The fact that expression of the STIM1(486–685) domain does not rescue STIM1-485 suggests that this domain needs to be physically attached to the STIM1 molecule to perform its function. This raises the interesting question of whether this domain acts by physically shielding the SOAR/CAD domain and SHD and whether this effect is sequence-specific. To test this idea, we replaced this region of STIM1 with nonspecific sequences, GFP or mCherry, as both have a similar length to the STIM1 C-terminal 200 residues. Strikingly, STIM1-485-Ch with a C-terminal mCherry tag after residue 485 rescued the defects observed in the STIM1-485 deletion mutant (Fig. 5). STIM1-485-Ch did not disrupt ER structure, did not constitutively interact with Orai1, formed puncta in response to store depletion when expressed with Orai1, and was able to recruit Orai1 in a similar fashion to wild-type STIM1 (Fig. 5A). The time course of punctum formation is similar when Orai1 was expressed with either STIM1 or STIM1-485-Ch (Fig. 5B). STIM1-485-Ch produced normal SOCE when tested using either ICl-T (Fig. 5C) or ISOC (Fig. 5D) in terms of current development time course, amplitude, and current-voltage relationship. These data suggest that the C-terminal end of STIM1 maintains the SOAR/CAD domain and SHD inactive in a sequence-nonspecific fashion through a steric hindrance mechanism. Interestingly, however, when STIM1-485-Ch was expressed without Orai1, it was not able to form stable puncta efficiently as compared with the full-length protein (Fig. 6, A and B). Following store depletion, the number of STIM1 puncta in cells expressing STIM1-485-Ch was significantly decreased (Fig. 6B) compared with cells expressing full-length STIM1 (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, a significant percentage of the STIM1-485-Ch protein remained in the deep ER and did not translocate to the cortical region (Fig. 6B). In contrast, full-length STIM1 was no longer detectable in the deep ER after store depletion (Fig. 6A). In addition, in the absence of Orai1 expression, maximal development of STIM1-485-Ch cortical puncta required ∼30 min of TPEN treatment, compared with ∼5 min when full-length STIM1 was expressed. Interestingly, however, coexpression of STIM1-485-Ch with Orai1 rescued this delay, leading to rapid punctum formation after store depletion with TPEN in ∼5 min. Similar results were observed following store depletion with ionomycin (data not shown). This phenotype is reminiscent of a STIM1 mutant missing the polybasic domain at the end of the molecule, which has been implicated in stabilizing STIM1 interactions with the cell membrane (6Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9301-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 15Park C.Y. Hoover P.J. Mullins F.M. Bachhawat P. Covington E.D. Raunser S.

Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 159-168Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This would argue that the delay and inefficiency in punctum formation observed with the STIM1-485-Ch mutant are due to the lack of the polybasic domain. This is indeed the case because addition of a polybasic domain at the end of STIM1-485-Ch rescued this phenotype (see below and Fig. 7).FIGURE 7The polylysine domain stabilizes STIM1 puncta.

Importantly, however, during meiosis, STIM1-485-GFP did not form puncta in response to store depletion (Fig. 6C, Egg+TPEN). Therefore, even in the absence of the last 200 residues of STIM1, clustering of STIM1 in response to store depletion remains inhibited, showing that clustering inhibition during meiosis is not dependent on this domain. This demonstrates that STIM1 clustering inhibition during meiosis is independent of phosphorylation within the C-terminal 200 residues of STIM1. Interestingly, coexpression of Orai1 with STIM1-485-Ch in the egg showed trapping of Orai1 intracellularly in a manner reminiscent of that observed when STIM1-485 was expressed with Orai1 (Fig. 6D). In contrast, in the oocyte, STIM1-485-Ch behaved like full-length STIM1 (Fig. 5A). This suggests that during meiosis (egg), STIM1-485-Ch assumes a different conformation than in interphase (oocyte), leading to exposure of the SOAR/CAD domain and allowing interactions with Orai1. Consistent with these results, we have previously shown that STIM1-Orai1 interaction remains functional during meiosis (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17401-17406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To test whether the delay in punctum formation for the STIM1-485-Ch construct in the absence of Orai1 is due to the absence of the polybasic domain, we added the polylysine domain to the end of STIM1-485-Ch, thus generating a construct with residues 486–669 of STIM1 replaced with mCherry (STIM1-485-Ch-K). STIM1-485-Ch-K localized to the ER in oocytes and formed puncta with a similar time course to full-length STIM1 in the absence of Orai1 coexpression (Fig. 7, A and C). When expressed with Orai1, STIM1-485-Ch-K was able to recruit Orai1 into coincident puncta (Fig. 7B) and produced an ISOC with a similar development time course and current-voltage relationship to full-length STIM1 (Fig. 7D). During meiosis, STIM1-485-Ch-K localized to the ER and did not constitutively interact with Orai1, which was internalized and localized to endosomes (Fig. 7E) (24Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17401-17406Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31Yu F. Sun L. Machaca K. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, addition of the polybasic domain at the end of STIM1-485-Ch is sufficient to stabilize the conformation of this construct during meiosis. Interestingly, when Ca2+ stores were depleted in the egg, STIM1-485-Ch-K efficiently translocated to the subcell membrane focal plane (Fig. 7F). This argues that in the egg, STIM1-485-Ch-K is able to sense Ca2+ store depletion, resulting in a conformational change in the protein that exposes the polylysine domain, allowing it to interact with cell membrane lipids. However, under these conditions, STIM1-485-Ch-K did not form puncta, and a small percentage of the protein interacted with Orai1 in the endosomal compartment (Fig. 7F). This is consistent with the idea that the SOAR/CAD domain becomes available for interaction with Orai1. The lack of punctum formation demonstrates that STIM1 clustering inhibition is due to modifications outside domain 486–669, again supporting the conclusion that phosphorylation within this domain does not contribute to STIM1 clustering inhibition during meiosis. In summary, our data support a model in which STIM1 is maintained in an inactive state in interphase with full Ca2+ stores through intramolecular shielding of the active domains (SOAR/CAD and SHD) by the C-terminal end of the molecule (positions 486–669). Surprisingly, replacing these residues (positions 486–669) with GFP or mCherry does not affect the function of STIM1, including its ability to sense Ca2+ store depletion, form puncta, translocate to the cortical ER, and bind to and gate Orai1. This would be consistent with a steric hindrance model. We have further shown that STIM1 clustering inhibition during meiosis does not require the C-terminal 200 residues of STIM1 and as such cannot be dependent on any modifications within this domain.

https://openalex.org/W2095359388,"Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) are potent proinflammatory mediators with particular relevance for asthma. However, control of cysLT biosynthesis in the time period after onset of acute inflammation has not been extensively studied. As a model for later phases of inflammation, we investigated regulation of leukotriene (LT) C4 synthase (LTC4S) in differentiating monocytes, exposed for several days to fungal zymosan. Incubations with LTA4 revealed 20-fold increased LTC4S activity during differentiation of monocytic Mono Mac 6 (MM6) cells, which was reduced by 80% in the presence of zymosan (25 µg/ml, 96 h). Zymosan (48 h) similarly attenuated LTC4S activity of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. Several findings indicate phosphoregulation of LTC4S: increased activity during MM6 cell differentiation correlated with reduced phosphorylation of 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), which could phosphorylate purified LTC4S; the p70S6K inhibitor rapamycin (20 nM) doubled LTC4S activity of undifferentiated MM6 cells, and protein kinase A and C inhibitors (H-89, CGP-53353, and staurosporine) reversed the zymosan-induced suppression of LTC4S activity. Finally, zymosan (48 h) up-regulated PGE2 biosynthesis, and aspirin (10 µM) or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor antagonists counteracted the zymosan effect. Our results suggest a late PGE2-mediated phosphoregulation of LTC4S during microbial exposure, which may contribute to resolution of inflammation, with implications for aspirin hypersensitivity.—Esser, J., Gehrmann, U., Salvado, M.

In addition, siRNA targeted knock-down of HSP70 expression enhanced the Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G. A co-immunoprecipitation study revealed that overexpression of HSP70 inhibited APOBEC3G binding to HIV-1 Vif. Thus, we provide evidence for a host protein-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication in an APOBEC3G-dependent manner.

However, Vif-deficient virions produced by non-permissive cells, including CD4+ T cells and immortalized lines, such as Hut78 or CEM, are non-infections, whereas virions produced in permissive cells, such as SupT1 or CEM-SS, are infectious (1Gabuzda D.H.

The C to U conversion in the HIV-1 minus strand leads to a G to A hypermutation, preferentially at CCCA sequences.

Vif predominant mechanism for overcoming the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G is to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase with cullin 5 (Cul5), elongin B (EloB), and elongin C (EloC) and target these proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (13Yu X.

J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the formation of the P-TEFb/Tat/TAR complex is required to stabilize the CDK9/cyclinT1 heterodimer by HSP70 and HSP90 (25O'Keeffe B. Fong Y. Chen D. Zhou S. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 279-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To better develop potential novel therapeutic strategies to exploit the APOBEC3G antiviral function, we investigated the role of HSP70 in APOBEC3G function. We found that siRNA against HSP70 significantly reduced the level of APOBEC3G in the presence of HIV-1 Vif, but not in the absence of Vif. In addition, overexpression of HSP70 in 293T cells reduced the Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G by inhibiting APOBEC3G polyubiquitination. This effect is attributed to the impairment of APOBEC3G-Vif binding. Furthermore, overexpression of HSP70 in the presence, but not in the absence, of APOBEC3G clearly suppressed the infectivity of virions in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that HSP70 acts as a potential antiviral host factor through interaction with APOBEC3G and may form the basis for new anti-HIV-1 therapies. 293T cells (5 × 105) were transfected with 1.0 μg of each Vif expression plasmid using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were suspended in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) and incubated with 5 μl of anti-HSP70 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 30 μl of Dynabeads-protein G (Invitrogen). The beads were washed with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20. The immunocomplex was eluted by boiling with 20 μl of 5× sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. 293T cells (5 × 105) were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA and 0.5 μg of a GFP expression plasmid (CS-CDF-CG-PRE), or 1.0 μg of pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA, 0.5 μg of CS-CDF-CG-PRE and 0.5 μg of pcDNA-Vif along with either 2.0 μg of pFLAG-HSP70 or an empty plasmid. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide. Cells were harvested, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics) and anti-GFP antibody (Medical & Biological Laboratories). The blots were semi-quantified using ImageJ 1.43u software. 293T cells (3 × 106) were co-transfected with 2.0 μg of pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA, 2.0 μg of pVif-V5, 4.0 μg of pFLAG-HSP70, and 2.0 μg of pCMV-Myc-Ubi (26Ryo A.

At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 5 μm MG-132 for 24 h. Cells were suspended in a lysis buffer. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling) followed by Western blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody. MAGI cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1 × 104 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day, cells were infected with dilutions of the virus in a total volume of 50 μl in the presence of 20 μg/ml DEAE-dextran for 2 h. At 2 days post-infection, cells were fixed with 100 μl of fix solution (1% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS) at room temperature for 5 min and then washed twice with PBS. Cells were incubated with 100 μl of staining solution (4 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mm potassium ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mg/ml X-Gal) for 50 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by removing the staining solution, and blue cells were counted under a microscope. To generate pcDNA-Vif, HIV-1 Vif fragments were amplified from pNL4-3 by PCR with the following primers: forward 5′-GAT ATC ATG GAA AAC AGA TGG CAG GTG ATG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTC GAG CTA GTG TCC ATT CAT TGT ATG CT-3′. The PCR products were inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To construct pFLAG-HSP70, whole RNA was isolated from 293T cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and amplified by RT-PCR with the following primers: forward 5′-GTT GAA TTC CGC CAA AGC CGC GGC GAT-3′ and reverse 5′-CGC GGA TCC CTA ATC TAC CTC CTC AAT-3′. The products were inserted into pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). To generate pVif-V5, HIV-1 Vif fragments were amplified from pNL4-3. The PCR products were inserted into pENTR using TOPO Cloning kits (Invitrogen) and transferred into pLenti6/V5-DEST (Invitrogen) by LR recombination. This construct contains the β-globin intron sequence of pMDL-g/p-RRE downstream of the CMV promoter. A plasmid construct encoding human APOBEC3G tagged with the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) sequence was a kind gift from Darlene Chen (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies). Vif-defective variants of NL4-3 have been described previously (27Karczewski M.K. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 494-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate pCS-U6, the U6 promoter was amplified by PCR. The resulting products were inserted into pCS-CDF-CG-PRE. pCS-U6-shControl or pCS-U6-shHSP70 was constructed by ligating the annealed product of sense oligonucleotide 5′-GAT CCT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT TTC AAG AGA ACG TGA CAC GTT CGG AGA ATT T-3′ and antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CTA GAA ATT CTC CGA ACG TGT CAC GTT CTC TTG AAA CGT GAC ACG TTC GGA GAA G-3′ or sense oligonucleotide 5′-GAT CCC ACG GCA AGG TGG AGA TCA TTC AAG AGA TGA TCT CCA CCT TGC CGT GTT T-3′ and antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CTA GAA ACA CGG CAA GGT GGA GAT CAT CTC TTG AAT GAT CTC CAC CTT GCC GTG G-3′, respectively, with the BamHI-XbaI fragment from pCS-U6. These plasmids contain a transcriptional termination signal sequence downstream of the shControl and shHSP70 sequences. 293T cells (3 × 106) were transfected with siRNAs (100 nm) using Lipofectamine2000. Control siRNA (5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UdTdT-3′) and HSP70-siRNA (5′-CAC GGC AAG GUG GAG AUC AdTdT-3′) were purchased from B-Bridge International. 293T cells (5 × 105) were cotransfected with the lentiviral vector (1.6 μg), vesicular stomatitis virus G expression vector pMD.G (0.4 μg), rev expression vector pRSV-Rev (0.8 μg), and gag-pol expression vector pMDLg/pRRE (1.2 μg) using Lipofectamine2000. At 48 h after transfection, culture supernatants were harvested and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. In all experiments, H9 cells (3 × 105) were transduced with equal amounts of the lentivirus vector. The results are shown as means ± S.D., and statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. At least three replicates were performed for each experiment. HSPs are induced by a variety of stress-related stimuli, including heat, UV radiation, and microbial/viral infections (28Neidhardt F.C. VanBogelen R.A. Vaughn V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 295-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). HSPs are involved in the folding and translocation of cellular proteins under normal conditions, whereas under stressful conditions, HSPs bind to proteins and inhibit their misfolding or irreversible aggregation (29Bukau B. Weissman J. Horwich A. Cell. 2006; 125: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that the binding of HSPs to HIV-1 proteins enhances antiviral immunity (30SenGupta D. Norris P.J. Suscovich T.J. Hassan-Zahraee M. Moffett H.F. Trocha A. Draenert R. Goulder P.J. Binder R.J. Levey D.L. Walker B.D. Srivastava P.K. Brander C. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1987-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HSP70 is selectively expressed soon after HIV-1 infection, suggesting that these proteins might be involved in the innate cellular antiviral immune response (31Wainberg Z. Oliveira M. Lerner S. Tao Y. Brenner B.G. Virology. 1997; 233: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the specific targets of HSPs and their role in the response to HIV infection remain unclear. HIV-1 Vif targets APOBEC3G for ubiquitination by forming an Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF)-like complex, which subsequently leads to the degradation of APOBEC3G. To evaluate how HSP70 affects Vif-dependent ubiquitination and degradation, we examined the steady-state level of APOBEC3G in 293T cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged HSP70 (FLAG-HSP70) and pNL4-3. The expression of HSP70 in 293T cells significantly increased the amount of APOBEC3G in a dose-dependent manner but not the amount of the HIV-1 Gag p24 antigen (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4 and Fig. 1B). Importantly, HSP70 had no effect on the expression level of APOBEC3G in 293T cells transfected with Vif-deleted HIV-1 proviral plasmid (Fig. 1, C, lanes 1–4 and D). Our results suggest that HSP70 may inhibit the degradation of APOBEC3G by HIV-1 Vif. Next, we investigated whether expression of HSP70 directly blocks APOBEC3G degradation by HIV-1 Vif. 293T cells were co-transfected with pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA and pFLAG-HSP70 in the absence or presence of pcDNA-Vif. We found that the steady-state levels of APOBEC3G in the presence of pcDNA-Vif were increased by the expression of HSP70 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A, lanes 6–10 and B, right panel). By contrast, HSP70 did not significantly affect the amount of APOBEC3G expression in the absence of pcDNA-Vif (Fig. 2, A, lanes 1–5 and B, left panel). These data indicate that the effects of HSP70 on APOBEC3G expression depend on HIV-1 Vif. Previous studies have reported that microbial HSP70 up-regulates APOBEC3G mRNA (32Pido-Lopez J. Whittall T. Wang Y. Bergmeier L.A. Babaahmady K. Singh M. Lehner T. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Babaahmady K. Oehlmann W. Singh M. Lehner T. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3354-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To rule out this possibility, pulse-chase experiments were performed using 293T cells that were co-transfected with pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA, pVif-V5, pFLAG-HSP70, and a GFP expression plasmid (CS-CDF-CG-PRE). Cycloheximide was used to block protein synthesis. When 293T cells were transfected with pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA alone, there was no change in the level of APOBEC3G (Fig. 2, C, lanes 1–4 and D, left panel). Consistent with previous reports, degradation of APOBEC3G-HA was induced in the presence of HIV-1 Vif (Fig. 2, C, lanes 5–8 and D, middle panel). In contrast, HSP70 expression significantly suppressed the degradation of APOBEC3G by HIV-1 Vif (Fig. 2, C, lanes 9–12 and D, right panel). To further evaluate whether HSP70 expression inhibits the ubiquitination of APOBEC3G by HIV-1 Vif, we performed ubiquitination assays. Lysates of cells co-expressing pVif-V5, Myc-tagged ubiquitin (Myc-Ub), pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA and either empty plasmid or pFLAG-HSP70 were analyzed for the polyubiquitination of APOBEC3G. We detected the ubiquitination of APOBEC3G as a ladder band (Fig. 2E, lane 2). The expression of HSP70 resulted in a significant reduction in polyubiquitinated APOBEC3G (Fig. 2E, lane 1). Thus, the expression of HSP70 causes an increase in the steady-state levels of APOBEC3G by blocking the Vif-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of APOBEC3G. We performed an immunoprecipitation assay to evaluate the binding between HSP70 and APOBEC3G or HIV-1 Vif (Fig. 3). 293T cells were transfected with pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA, pcDNA-Vif, pNL4-3, or pNL4-3-delta-Vif. Cell lysates were precipitated with anti-HSP70 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-ApoC17 or anti-Vif antibody. HSP70 interacted with both APOBEC3G (Fig. 3A) and HIV-1 Vif (Fig. 3B). These interactions and the intracellular localization of HSP70 and HA-tagged APOBEC3G were confirmed by immunostaining assays (data not shown). To further investigate the role of HSP70 in APOBEC3G-Vif interactions, 293T cells were co-transfected with pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA and pVif-V5 along with either an empty plasmid or pFLAG-HSP70 in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (MG-132). Consistent with previous studies, HIV-1 Vif was bound to APOBEC3G (Fig. 3C, lane 2). Strikingly, the expression of HSP70 in 293T cells led to the inhibition of APOBEC3G-Vif binding. (Fig. 3C, lane 1). Because a previous study reported that APOBEC3G binds the N-terminal region of HIV-1 Vif (34Mehle A. Wilson H. Zhang C. Brazier A.J. McPike M. Pery E. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 13235-13241Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that HSP70 competes with APOBEC3G for binding to the N-terminal region of HIV-1 Vif. We found that FLAG-HSP70 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with the N-terminal region of Vif (amino acids 1–107) (Fig. 3D, lane 1). However, the C-terminal region of Vif (amino acids 108–192) exhibited no detectable interaction with FLAG-HSP70 (Fig. 3D, lane 2). These results suggest that APOBEC3G-Vif binding is reduced by HSP70 through an interaction with the N-terminal region of Vif, resulting in the inhibition of the Vif-mediated ubiquitination and the degradation of APOBEC3G. To further investigate the effect of endogenous HSP70 on the stability of APOBEC3G, we silenced endogenous HSP70 expression by RNA interference. 293T cells were transfected with control siRNA (siCtrl) or HSP70-specific siRNA (siHSP70) for 4 h prior to transfection along with pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA and either pNL4-3 or pNL4-3-delta-Vif. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting. As expected, the level of APOBEC3G in pNL4-3-transfected cells was less stable than that in the pNL4-3-delta-Vif transfected cells (Fig. 4A, compare lane 1 to lane 3). Quantification of the relative intensities revealed that transfection with pNL4-3 induced APOBEC3G degradation with a potency ∼1.8 times higher than that of pNL4-3-delta-Vif (Fig. 4B). Moreover, in the case of transfection with pNL4-3, the level of APOBEC3G, but not the level of HIV-1 Gag, in the siHSP70-transduced cells were lower than in the siCtrl-transduced cells (Fig. 4A, compare lane 1 to lane 2). The amount of APOBEC3G in HSP70 knock-down cells decreased to half the amount in the control cells (Fig. 4B). However, in terms of transfection with pNL4-3-delta-Vif, treatment with siHSP70 had no effect on the stability of APOBEC3G (Fig. 4A, compare lane 3 to lane 4). These data indicate that depletion of HSP70 facilitates Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G. Most experiments in this study used permissive cells. To investigate whether our findings have physiologic relevance in non-permissive cells, we used a lentiviral vector encoding FLAG-HSP70 or HIV-1 Vif-V5. In the absence of Vif-V5, there was no significant effect of FLAG-HSP70 on the level of endogenous APOBEC3G in H9 cells (Fig. 5A, compare lane 1 to lane 2). When Vif-V5 was expressed in H9 cells, expression of FLAG-HSP70 increased the amount of endogenous APOBEC3G (Fig. 5A, compare lane 3 to lane 4). Next, we suppressed the expression of HSP70 using a lentiviral vector to express shHSP70 under the control of the human U6 promoter in H9 cells. APOBEC3G expression in shHSP70-transduced H9 cells was similar to that in shControl-transduced H9 cells (Fig. 5B, compare lane 1 to lane 2). The level of endogenous APOBEC3G was lower in H9 cells transduced with shHSP70 than in H9 cells transduced with shControl by expression of Vif-V5 (Fig. 5B, compare lane 3 to lane 4). Therefore, HSP70 suppresses Vif-mediated degradation of endogenous APOBEC3G in non-permissive cells. To examine whether HSP70 expression influences the function of APOBEC3G, pNL4-3, or pNL4-3-delta-Vif was transfected into 293T cells along with either pFLAG-HSP70 alone or pFLAG-HSP70 and pc-Hu-APOBEC3G-HA. The viral infectivity was measured by MAGI assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, expression of FLAG-HSP70 clearly suppressed the infectivity of wild-type HIV-1 in the presence of APOBEC3G in a dose-dependent manner. In the absence of APOBEC3G, FLAG-HSP70 did not affect the infectivity of the wild-type HIV-1. Unexpectedly, HSP70 expression in APOBEC3G-HA-transfected 293T cells led to a dose-dependent inhibition of the infectivity of Vif-deficient HIV-1 particles (Fig. 6A). Moreover, no effect of HSP70 expression on the infectivity of the Vif-deficient HIV-1 particles produced by mock-transfected 293T cells was observed. To further demonstrate whether expression of HSP70 affects virion packaging of APOBEC3G, viral particles produced by 293T cells expressing HSP70 were analyzed for APOBEC3G expression by Western blotting. We found that expression of HSP70 significantly increased the amount of intracellular and wild type virion-associated APOBEC3G (Fig. 6, B and C). Interestingly, HSP70 expression enhanced the level of APOBEC3G packaging in Vif-deficient virions, but had no effect on intracellular APOBEC3G and viral release (Fig. 6, D and E). These results indicate that HSP70 blocks Vif-mediated APOBEC3G degradation and enhances the incorporation of APOBEC3G into both wild type and Vif-deficient virions, which result from inhibition of HIV-1 replication through HSP70 interaction with APOBEC3G. APOBEC3G, which is incorporated into progeny virus particles, restricts the replication of Vif-deficient HIV-1 through cytidine deamination-dependent and independent mechanisms (3Sheehy A.M.

This restriction can be overcome by HIV-1 Vif, which induces the polyubiquitination of APOBEC3G through recruitment of a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex composed of cullin 5, elongin B, elongin C, and Ring box-1 and facilitates the proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3G (13Yu X.

Thus, mechanistic insights into the quality control of APOBEC3G protein are important for understanding the molecular basis of APOBEC3G-mediated HIV-1 restriction. In this study, we showed that HSP70 suppressed Vif-mediated APOBEC3G degradation. In contrast to our results for HSP70, Pin1 suppresses the HIV restriction activity of APOBEC3G (46Watashi K. Khan M. Yedavalli V.R. Yeung M.L. Strebel K. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 9928-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Pin1 reduces the levels of intracellular APOBEC3G. One possibility is that HSP70 regulates Pin1 function, which results in the stimulation of APOBEC3G function, although further analysis is needed to properly address this question. Pido-Lopez et al. (32Pido-Lopez J. Whittall T. Wang Y. Bergmeier L.A. Babaahmady K. Singh M. Lehner T. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have reported that microbial HSP70 up-regulates APOBEC3G mRNA and protein expression in human CD4+ T cells. Our data indicate that in 293T cells, overexpression of human HSP70 in the absence of HIV-1 Vif did not affect the amount of APOBEC3G protein. The stabilization of APOBEC3G is attributed to a reduction in the Vif-dependent polyubiquitination of APOBEC3G (Fig. 2E). Whereas we have focused on human HSP70 activity on APOBEC3G stability, it would be interesting to investigate whether human HSP70 can affect the level of endogenous APOBEC3G mRNA. APOBEC3G associates with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes and is not only dispersed throughout the cytoplasm but is also markedly concentrated in cytoplasmic foci that are identified as mRNA-processing bodies (P bodies) (47Gallois-Montbrun S. Kramer B. Swanson C.M. Byers H. Lynham S. Ward M. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Localization of APOBEC3G in P bodies is not important for its LINE-1 suppression activity (48Niewiadomska A.M. Tian C. Tan L. Wang T. Sarkis P.T. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 9577-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, Y3 and 7SL RNAs, which compose RNP complexes, are required for efficient APOBEC3G packaging (49Wang T. Tian C. Zhang W. Luo K. Sarkis P.T. Yu L. Liu B. Yu Y. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 13112-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells at 44 °C induces the rapid accumulation of APOBEC3G and many cellular RNA-binding proteins (50Gallois-Montbrun S. Holmes R.K. Swanson C.M. Fernández-Ocaña M. Byers H.L. Ward M.A. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We examined whether HSP70 plays a role in packaging APOBEC3G into virus particles and found that overexpression of HSP70 enhanced APOBEC3G packaging in the absence of Vif (Fig. 6E). It is possible that HSP70 interacts with cytoplasmic APOBEC3G, but it remains unclear whether HSP70 induces the accumulation of APOBEC3G in P bodies and increases the association of APOBEC3G with RNP complexes. Further studies will be required to clarify the details of how, where and when HSP70 and APOBEC3G co-localize within cells. Recently, Nathans et al. (51Nathans R. Cao H. Sharova N. Ali A. Sharkey M. Stranska R. Stevenson M. Rana T.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1187-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) have identified a small molecule, termed RN-18, that degrades HIV-1 Vif only in the presence of APOBEC3G, resulting in enhanced APOBEC3G abundance and virion incorporation, similar to the function of HSP70. The possibility has been raised that HSP70 may be the target of RN-18. However, HSP70 has no significant effect on HIV-1 Vif expression and leads to the increase of APOBEC3G packaging into virions in a Vif-independent manner. Moreover, RN-18 exhibits a strong dependence on APOBEC3G, whereas HSP70 can interact directly with both HIV-1 Vif and APOBEC3G. Thus, RN-18 probably does not target HSP70. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that stimulation of innate immunity, such as that mediated by APOBEC3G, may aid in the development of antiviral therapies.

The product of the SALL2 gene was first identified as a binding partner of the mouse polyoma virus large T antigen and later shown to possess tumor suppressor-like functions. Independent studies identified SALL2 as a factor regulating the quiescent state in human fibroblasts. Here, we investigate factors that regulate the expression of SALL2 and turnover of p150Sal2 in growing vs. resting cells. The transcription factor AP4 increases along with SALL2 in quiescent cells and positively regulates SALL2 expression. TGFβ effectively inhibits expression of SALL2 and its regulator AP4 when added to quiescent fibroblasts. TGFβ repression of SALL2 and AP4 is independent of the induction of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) by TGFβ. p150Sal2 disappears rapidly on restoration of serum. In both growing fibroblasts and established ovarian surface epithelial cells, p150Sal2 undergoes polyubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. A CUL4/DDB1 E3 ligase containing RBBP7 as the p150Sal2 receptor has been identified as mediating the destruction of p150Sal2 as cells transition from a quiescent to an actively growing state.—Sung, C.

We report a relationship between a representation of time and an expression of learned timing in neurons in the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields (FEFSEM). During prelearning pursuit of target motion at a constant velocity, each FEFSEM neuron is most active at a distinct time relative to the onset of pursuit tracking. In response to an instructive change in target direction, a neuron expresses the most learning when the instruction occurs near the time of its maximal participation in prelearning pursuit. Different neurons are most active, and undergo the most learning, at distinct times during pursuit.

Precise timing is critical to all aspects of motor control at levels ranging from the coordination of joints and muscles during simple reflexive movements to the acquisition of complex skills such as playing a musical instrument. Indeed, timing is so important for motor control that it can be learned. There now are multiple demonstrations that the motor system can learn not just what to do but also when to do it (Mauk and Ruiz, 1992Mauk M.D. Ruiz B.P.

In the smooth pursuit system, repeated presentations of a precisely timed instructive change in the direction of a moving target elicits a learned smooth pursuit eye movement that peaks near the time when the instructive motion is expected to occur (Medina et al., 2005Medina J.F.

The ability to learn timing in motor control requires a representation of time during movements. The most relevant temporal signals for motor control are typically on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds (Buonomano and Karmarkar, 2002Buonomano D.V. Karmarkar U.R.

In eyelid conditioning and smooth pursuit eye movements, learning is largest for an instructive signal that occurs in the range from 200–400 ms after the onset of a conditioned stimulus that references time (Mauk and Ruiz, 1992Mauk M.D. Ruiz B.P.

Shadlen M.N. Representation of time by neurons in the posterior parietal cortex of the macaque.Neuron. 2003; 38: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The next step is to establish a link between a representation of time and a neural expression of learning. A prior paper from our laboratory reported a representation of time in the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields (FEFSEM) (Schoppik et al., 2008Schoppik D. Nagel K.I. Lisberger S.G. Cortical mechanisms of smooth eye movements revealed by dynamic covariations of neural and behavioral responses.Neuron. 2008; 58: 248-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Each neuron in the FEFSEM reaches its maximal firing rate at a particular time during pursuit, and the peak responses of the full population tile the entire duration of pursuit. Thus, the representation of smooth pursuit in the FEFSEM is such that each neuron primarily contributes to a particular moment in the eye movement. In contrast, most of the brain regions in the pursuit circuit have stereotyped responses as a function of time during pursuit. Neurons in middle temporal visual area (MT) tend to have transient responses that are driven by, and time-locked to, the visual motion signals caused by the initial target motion (Newsome et al., 1988Newsome W.T. Wurtz R.H. Komatsu H. Relation of cortical areas MT and MST to pursuit eye movements. II. Differentiation of retinal from extraretinal inputs.J. Neurophysiol. 1988; 60: 604-620PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Purkinje cells in the cerebellar flocculus show transient responses that are well timed to the onset of target motion, followed by sustained responses that are monotonically related to the smooth eye velocity (Stone and Lisberger, 1990Stone L.S. Lisberger S.G. Visual responses of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar flocculus during smooth-pursuit eye movements in monkeys. I. Simple spikes.J. Neurophysiol. 1990; 63: 1241-1261PubMed Google Scholar, Krauzlis and Lisberger, 1994Krauzlis R.J. Lisberger S.G. Simple spike responses of gaze velocity Purkinje cells in the floccular lobe of the monkey during the onset and offset of pursuit eye movements.J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 72: 2045-2050PubMed Google Scholar). The unique, temporally-selective representation of pursuit in the FEFSEM raises the possibility we tested here, that this cortical area plays a temporally specific role in the modulation of pursuit through learning. We recorded changes in the responses of FEFSEM neurons during pursuit learning induced by a precisely timed instructive change in target direction to ask whether the learned eye movement would be driven selectively by neurons that contribute to pursuit around the time of the instruction. In agreement with this prediction, we found that the magnitude of learning in any given neuron is correlated with how strongly the same neuron would have responded (during prelearning pursuit) at the time of the instructive change in target trajectory. We suggest that the representation of time within the FEFSEM may be harnessed to guide the temporal specificity of pursuit learning and that temporally specific modulation of motor behavior could be a general function of the motor regions of the cerebral cortex. We recorded from 100 FEFSEM neurons in two monkeys during directional smooth pursuit learning. The neurons we selected for investigation responded vigorously during pursuit prior to learning and were tuned for the direction of pursuit. In the prelearning behavioral block, we characterized the direction tuning of each FEFSEM neuron by measuring its mean firing rate during pursuit in each of eight directions spaced 45° apart. The neuron in Figure 1A responded most strongly for pursuit that was upward or obliquely up and left and therefore had a preferred direction between 90° and 135°. The neuron was only weakly active for purely horizontal pursuit to the right or left. The tuning of the neuron under study specified the direction parameters of the learning experiment (see schematic in Figure 1B). We chose the learning direction to be the cardinal direction closest to the neuron's preferred direction: 90° in Figure 1. The cardinal axis orthogonal to the learning direction defined the probe and control directions: 360° and 180° in Figure 1. Each learning experiment began with a baseline block of trials that used step-ramp target motions in the probe and the control direction to establish the baseline pursuit response prior to learning. After the monkey fixated a stationary central target, the target stepped 2° or 3° in one direction and ramped immediately in the opposite direction at 20°/s (Figure 1H). For the probe trials in Figures 1F and 1H, the mean horizontal eye velocity was zero for almost 100 ms after target motion onset, accelerated to the right for 100 to 200 ms, and then approximated the target speed of 20°/s for the remainder of the 750 ms target motion. Vertical target velocity was zero throughout the trial as was the mean vertical eye velocity prior to learning. The subsequent learning block introduced learning trials that started like probe trials with a step-ramp of target motion in the probe direction but underwent a predictable change in target direction at a fixed time. In Figures 1E and 1G, the initial 20°/s ramp motion took the target to the right. After 250 ms, an upward motion at 30°/s began so that the target moved up and to the right for 500 ms. The direction of the added component of target motion defines the learning direction; the 250 ms delay between the onset of target motion and the change in target direction defines the instruction time. Both the learning direction and instruction time were fixed for a given learning experiment. Learning trials comprised 45% of the trials in a learning block. The remaining 55% consisted of control trials (45%) and probe trials (10%), which were identical to the control and probe trials in the baseline block. The average vertical eye velocity from the learning trials (Figure 1E, lower, red traces) shows a small upward deflection that starts before the instructive change in target direction and represents the learned response. The initial, early response is followed by a later, more abrupt, “visually-driven” change in eye velocity that is the immediate consequence of the instructive upward target motion. The learned response is not present in the first few learning trials but grows rapidly and asymptotes after about 20–40 learning trials. This early, upward response reflects behavioral learning because it (1) precedes the onset of the instructive stimulus, and (2) occurs in the infrequent probe trials interspersed in the learning block even though they lack an instructive change in target motion (Figure 1F, lower, blue trace). As reported before, the peak of the learned vertical eye velocity deflection in the probe trials coincides with the instruction time (Medina et al., 2005Medina J.F. Carey M.R. Lisberger S.G. The representation of time for motor learning.Neuron. 2005; 45: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our learning paradigm elicits robust, but short-term behavioral changes. For any given learning experiment, behavioral learning was quantified as the difference in mean eye velocity between the learning trials and the baseline probe trials integrated across 100 to 320 ms (Figure 1E, gray shaded region). Integrating eye velocity yields the change in eye position. Behavioral learning averaged 0.8° in Monkey G (standard deviation [SD]: 0.2°; range: 0.4° to 1.2°) and 2.1° in Monkey S (SD: 0.7°; range: 0.7° to 4.5°) and was significantly different from zero in all experiments (Mann-Whitney U test: p < 0.001). Residual behavioral learning did not persist across learning experiments; the mean eye velocity measured in the sessions following training on a particular learning direction was not significantly different from the mean eye velocity in the sessions following learning in the opposite direction (Monkey G: p = 0.80, Monkey S: p = 0.88, Mann-Whitney U test). The rate of behavioral learning also did not vary as the study progressed. Behavioral changes continued to reach a plateau after about 20 to 40 learning trials. We conclude that learning proceeded anew for each experiment so that we could pool neural data across recording sessions to assess the effect of directional pursuit learning on the activity of the population of neurons in the FEFSEM. The example neuron in Figure 1 produced only a few spikes during the baseline block probe trials (Figure 1D, black raster) because the probe direction was orthogonal to the neuron's preferred direction. During learning trials, the neuron produced the expected vigorous response to the visually-driven eye movement in the learning direction and also acquired a small learned response that appeared before the instructive change in target direction (Figure 1C, red raster). The learned neural response also appeared in probe trials during the later part of the learning block (Figure 1D, blue raster) and, like the learned eye velocity, began before the time when the instructive change in target direction would have occurred in learning trials. Different neurons expressed varying degrees of learning. The two neurons whose responses appear in Figure 2 were recorded on different days with strong behavioral learning that reached almost 4°/s by the time of the instructive change in target direction in both experiments (Figures 2C and 2D). However, neuron #1 exhibited a large learned change in mean firing rate, while neuron #2 did not. Neuron #2 did respond strongly to the instructive change in target direction but only after the visual latency of 70 ms typically found in the FEFSEM (Figure 2B, red trace; Gottlieb et al., 1994Gottlieb J.P. MacAvoy M.G. Bruce C.J. Neural responses related to smooth-pursuit eye movements and their correspondence with electrically elicited smooth eye movements in the primate frontal eye field.J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 72: 1634-1653PubMed Google Scholar). The learned change in firing rate, when present, had several important features. First, it appeared in temporal register with the learned change in eye velocity in the interval preceding the visual input caused by the instructive target motion. Second, it was present in the probe trials in the learning block (Figure 2A, blue trace) and had a transient time course that peaked near the instruction time. Third, it appeared during target motion in a direction that did not evoke much neural activity before learning, as seen by comparison of the blue and black traces in Figure 2A. Therefore, the learned firing rate is related to the acquisition of a vertical response to the horizontal target motion and not to the horizontal eye movement itself, which changed very little as a consequence of learning (Figure 1F, top). Figure 2 shows an important feature of the data that motivated our analysis procedures. The averages of both eye velocity and firing rate followed the same trajectory during learning trials and the interleaved probe trials, up to about 70 ms after the instruction time (Figure 2). Thereafter, the mean eye velocity and firing rate in the learning trials, but not the probe trials, showed large visually-driven reactions to the instructive change in target direction. The sequence of identical responses followed by divergence due to the visual stimulus is expected because the learning and probe trials were interleaved randomly. It allowed us to assess neural changes related purely to learning from the more frequent learning trials in the 220 ms interval from 100 ms after the onset of target motion to 70 ms after the instruction time. We showed in Figure 2 that the size of the learned response could be very different across FEFSEM neurons even when the concomitant behavioral changes were similar. Only 35% of neurons (15/55 in Monkey G, 20/45 in Monkey S) exhibited a significant learned change in firing rate (Mann-Whitney U test: p < 0.001). All neurons with statistically significant changes in firing rate showed increases in activity as a result of learning. Because the firing rate in the preceding fixation period almost always remained stable in spite of learning, we argue that the neural changes in the analysis interval probably are due to learning and not to fatigue, decreases in motivation, or recording instabilities. Finally, learning did not affect eye velocity during control trials and only five neurons showed significant changes in firing rate during the control trials from the baseline and learning blocks: 4/55 in Monkey G, 1/45 in Monkey S. Excluding neurons with significant changes in response amplitude during pursuit in the control direction did not alter any of our conclusions. Each neuron's response during pursuit of a ramp target motion at constant velocity showed a distinct and repeatable trajectory as a function of time (e.g., Figure 3A ). The smoothed firing rate for this FEFSEM neuron increased rapidly after the onset of pursuit, peaked approximately 340 ms after the onset of target motion, and declined gradually thereafter. We defined the neural preference for a particular time during the pursuit trial as the firing rate at that time normalized for the peak firing rate. At 250 ms after the onset of target motion (intersection of dashed lines), this particular neuron had a neural preference of 0.7, indicating that it fired at 70% of its maximum. The neuron's preferred time was 340 ms after the onset of target motion. We measured neural preference from data acquired in the prelearning pursuit block using step-ramp target motion in the direction subsequently chosen to be the learning direction. The preferred time varied widely across the full sample of FEFSEM neurons. In Figure 3B, each row uses color to depict the neural preference for a single FEFSEM neuron as a function of time. Neurons are ordered by the latency to 95% of their peak response. The narrowness of the red diagonal band indicates that the time of maximal neural activity is well defined, and its distribution across the full duration of the pursuit movement indicates that the population of FEFSEM neurons shows a wide range of preferred times. Thus, individual neurons are most active during limited distinct temporal chunks of the eye movement, only a fraction of the population is close to maximal response at any given time, and the population of FEFSEM neurons encodes all times throughout the entire movement. In our sample, preferred times were fairly evenly distributed across the full pursuit movement duration, with some preponderance of neurons that preferred the initiation of pursuit, from 100 to 200 ms after the onset of target motion (Figure 3C). Much of the variation in the magnitude of learning across neurons was related to the wide range of neural preferences at the time of the instructive change in target direction. When we plotted the size of the mean learned response in each neuron as a function of its neural preference for the instruction time of 250 ms (Figure 3E), we obtained positive correlations that were statistically significant in both monkeys (Monkey G: r = 0.50, p < 0.0001; Monkey S: r = 0.58, p < 0.0001). Figure 3E uses the mean response averaged across all learning trials as an index of the magnitude of learning, but we obtained similar correlations when we estimated the magnitude of learning from the first or last 40 learning trials within each learning block. Figure 3E shows the relationship between the neural preference at the single time of 250 ms during prelearning pursuit and the magnitude of neural learning. For this one time point, the correlation coefficients were quite high. To judge the importance of neural preference at the time of the instructive change in target direction in determining the neuron's susceptibility to learning, we performed the same analysis shown in Figure 3E, except that we varied systematically the time used to obtain neural preference from 0 to 750 ms relative to the onset of target motion, and computed the correlation between neural preference at each time and the magnitude of neural learning for instructions delivered at 250 ms. For each monkey (Figure 3F), the size of learning across our sample of FEFSEM neurons showed the highest correlation with the neural preference near 250 ms, the time of instruction, and lower correlations with neural preference at earlier or later times. Thus, learning with an instruction time of 250 ms engages neurons that specifically prefer 250 ms. The temporally-selective relationship between neural preference and the magnitude of neural learning in Figure 3F provides evidence that the distributed representation of time within the FEFSEM may be used to regulate the temporal specificity of pursuit learning. As an alternate way to examine the relationship between the amount of neural learning in an FEFSEM neuron and its temporal preference during pursuit, we plotted the magnitude of neural learning as a function of the difference between the neuron's preferred time and 250 ms (Figure 3D). There is considerable scatter in the plot, but for the population as a whole learning is largest in neurons with preferred times close to 250 ms, and is smaller in neurons with earlier or later preferred times. A small subpopulation of neurons exhibited negative learned responses, but the preferred times of these neurons were evenly distributed before and after the instruction time. The size of neural learning also was positively correlated with the size of the learned eye velocity and the opponent response of the neuron, defined as the difference in mean firing rate between prelearning pursuit in the probe direction versus in the learning direction, measured in the interval from 100 to 320 ms after the onset of target motion. Partial correlation analysis (Table 1) revealed that a strong correlation between the magnitude of neural learning and the neural preference for 250 ms persisted even when the correlations with the other variables were taken into account. The size of the opponent response during prelearning pursuit was not a statistically significant predictor of the magnitude of learning. Not surprisingly, the magnitude of the learned eye velocity was a strong predictor of the magnitude of neural learning in Monkey S, who had wider variation in the size of his behavioral learning.Table 1Partial Correlation Coefficients between the Magnitude of Neural Learning and other Neural or Behavioral ParametersMonkey GMonkey SCorrelation, SignificanceMean [Range]Correlation, SignificanceMean [Range]Neural Preference for 250 ms0.43, p = 0.0010.63 , [0.06 to 0.98]0.36, p = 0.020.50, [0.01 to 0.98]Opponent Firing Rate0.22, p = 0.1119.2 spikes/s, [0.6 to 88.7]0.27, p = 0.0819.0 spikes/s, [−1.9 to 77.1]Behavioral Learning0.18, p = 0.190.8°, [0.4 to 1.2]0.47, p = 0.012.1°, [0.7 to 4.5]For assistance in interpreting the correlations, the table also shows the mean and range of each variable in the two monkeys.

We now ask whether the magnitude of neural learning varies systematically within an individual neuron when we alter the instruction time. The same neuron was exposed to two learning experiments featuring different instruction times associated with disparate neural preferences. The results in Figure 3 predict that the example neuron in Figure 4A should show larger learning for an instruction time of 150 ms, when its neural preference was 1.0, versus an instruction time of 250 ms, when its neural preference was 0.6. The prediction was borne out by performing two different learning experiments with instruction times of 250 and 150 ms, respectively. The amount of neural learning was greater when the instruction time was 150 ms (Figure 4B, top), even though the learned change in eye velocity was somewhat larger when the instruction time was 250 ms (Figure 4B, bottom). We studied the activity of 31 neurons (11 in Monkey G, 20 in Monkey S) during two sequential learning experiments that were identical in all respects except the instruction time. The instruction time for one experiment was always 250 ms; the instruction time for the other experiment was chosen among 150 ms, 350 ms, or 450 ms. We sorted the 31 neurons into two groups based on whether their neural preference for 250 ms was larger or smaller than for the other instruction time. Then, we computed the size of learning for a 250 ms instruction time minus that for the other instruction time. These values would be positive or negative depending on whether neural learning was larger or smaller when the instruction occurred at 250 ms. Neurons with larger preferences for 250 ms showed more learning for an instruction time of 250 ms than for the other instruction time, while neurons with larger preferences for the other instruction time showed less learning for an instruction time of 250 ms, results that were confirmed statistically (Figure 4C; Monkey G: p = 0.01; Monkey S: p = 0.01; Mann-Whitney U test). The magnitude of neural learning did not depend significantly on alternative explanatory variables, such as the disparity in the sizes of the mean learned behavior elicited by the two instruction times (Monkey G: p = 0.76; Monkey S: p = 0.88), or the order of presentation of the two instruction times (Monkey G: p = 0.24; Monkey S: p = 0.28). Finally, the magnitude of neural learning produced with the most frequently used other instruction time, 150 ms, was correlated much better with neural preference for 150 ms (Monkey G: r = 0.61, p = 0.11, 8 neurons; Monkey S: r = 0.75, p = 0.001, 15 neurons), than with neural preference for 250 ms (Monkey G: r = 0.075; Monkey S: r = 0.31).

https://openalex.org/W2078014471,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a homodimeric transmembrane mucin on leukocytes. During inflammation, reversible interactions of PSGL-1 with selectins mediate leukocyte rolling on vascular surfaces. The transmembrane domain of PSGL-1 is required for dimerization, and the cytoplasmic domain propagates signals that activate β(2) integrins to slow rolling on integrin ligands. Leukocytes from knock-in ""ΔCD"" mice express a truncated PSGL-1 that lacks the cytoplasmic domain. Unexpectedly, they have 10-fold less PSGL-1 on their surfaces than WT leukocytes. Using glycosidases, proteases, Western blotting, confocal microscopy, cell-surface cross-linking, FRET, and pulse-chase metabolic labeling, we demonstrate that deleting the cytoplasmic domain impaired dimerization and delayed export of PSGL-1 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), markedly increasing a monomeric precursor in the ER and decreasing mature PSGL-1 on the cell surface. A monomeric full-length PSGL-1 made by substituting the transmembrane domain with that of CD43 exited the ER normally, revealing that dimerization was not required for ER export. Thus, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains cooperate to promote dimerization of PSGL-1. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domain provides a key signal to export precursors of PSGL-1 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus en route to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2158760894,"It is well established that developmental maturity is a key factor regulating the response of lower motor neurons to injury. The influence of age on the survival of motor neuron cell somata following axotomy is well documented, but it remains unclear whether maturity also influences the degeneration of axonal and synaptic compartments at the neuromuscular junction. Such information is important for our interpretation of data suggesting that neonatal neuro-muscular junctions are particularly vulnerable in neurodegenerative conditions that affect the developing postnatal nervous system, such as spinal muscular atrophy. Here, we have examined the role of development in regulating the vulnerability of mouse neuromuscular junctions to two mechanistically distinct degenerative insults: hypoxia and peripheral nerve injury. We report that neuromuscular junctions in neonatal mice are significantly more resistant to both hypoxia and nerve injury than those in adult mice, with a transition from the neonatal to adult phenotype occurring at 2–3 wk of age. We also demonstrate that the reduced vulnerability of neuromuscular junctions observed in neonatal mice is not determined by the maturity of the synapse per se, suggesting that properties associated with the neonatal environment and/or age of the neuron are responsible for modulating vulnerability. Our results are in stark contrast to previous studies showing that motor neuron cell somata are markedly more vulnerable to axotomy in neonatal mice. We conclude that neonatal neuromuscular junctions are resistant to a range of neurodegenerative insults in vivo and that this resistance is develop-mentally regulated.—Murray, L. M., Comley, L.
