https://openalex.org/W4285400585,"Wheat crops are frequently devastated by pandemic stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Here, we identify and characterize a wheat receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene, TaPsIPK1, that confers susceptibility to this pathogen. PsSpg1, a secreted fungal effector vital for Pst virulence, can bind TaPsIPK1, enhance its kinase activity, and promote its nuclear localization, where it phosphorylates the transcription factor TaCBF1d for gene regulation. The phosphorylation of TaCBF1d switches its transcriptional activity on the downstream genes. CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation of TaPsIPK1 in wheat confers broad-spectrum resistance against Pst without impacting important agronomic traits in two years of field tests. The disruption of TaPsIPK1 leads to immune priming without constitutive activation of defense responses. Taken together, TaPsIPK1 is a susceptibility gene known to be targeted by rust effectors, and it has great potential for developing durable resistance against rust by genetic modifications."

https://openalex.org/W4285729253,"In early pregnancy, as the embryo arrives in the uterus, intensive communication between the embryo and uterus begins. Hundreds of molecules are known to be involved, but despite numerous findings, full understanding of the complexity of the embryo–maternal dialog remains elusive. Recently, extracellular vesicles, nanoparticles able to transfer functionally active cargo between cells, have emerged as important players in cell–cell communication, and as such, they have gained great attention over the past decade also in reproductive biology. Here, we use a domestic animal model (Sus scrofa) with an epitheliochorial, superficial type of placentation because of its advantage in studding uterine luminal fluid extracellular vesicles. We show that during early pregnancy, the uterine lumen is abundant with extracellular vesicles that carry a plethora of miRNAs able to target genes involved in embryonic and organismal development. These extracellular vesicles, upon the delivery to primary trophoblast cells, affect genes governing development as well as cell-to-cell signaling and interactions, consequently having an impact on trophoblast cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We conclude that the exchange of a unique population of extracellular vesicles and their molecular cargo at the maternal–embryo interface is the key to the success of embryo implantation and pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4285727852,"Variety advancement decisions for root quality and yield-related traits in cassava are complex due to the variable patterns of genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI). Therefore, studies focused on the dissection of the existing patterns of GEI using linear-bilinear models such as Finlay-Wilkinson (FW), additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI), and genotype and genotype-by-environment (GGE) interaction models are critical in defining the target population of environments (TPEs) for future testing, selection, and advancement. This study assessed 36 elite cassava clones in 11 locations over three cropping seasons in the cassava breeding program of IITA based in Nigeria to quantify the GEI effects for root quality and yield-related traits. Genetic correlation coefficients and heritability estimates among environments found mostly intermediate to high values indicating high correlations with the major TPE. There was a differential clonal ranking among the environments indicating the existence of GEI as also revealed by the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which further confirmed the statistical model with the heterogeneity of error variances across the environments fit better. For all fitted models, we found the main effects of environment, genotype, and interaction significant for all observed traits except for dry matter content whose GEI sensitivity was marginally significant as found using the FW model. We identified TMS14F1297P0019 and TMEB419 as two topmost stable clones with a sensitivity values of 0.63 and 0.66 respectively using the FW model. However, GGE and AMMI stability value in conjunction with genotype selection index revealed that IITA-TMS-IBA000070 and TMS14F1036P0007 were the top-ranking clones combining both stability and yield performance measures. The AMMI-2 model clustered the testing environments into 6 mega-environments based on winning genotypes for fresh root yield. Alternatively, we identified 3 clusters of testing environments based on genotypic BLUPs derived from the random GEI component."

This study examined the associations of MVPA and SB with all-cause mortality in HF patients using a nationally representative survey data.National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2007-2014) were used. 711 adults with self-reported congestive HF, linked to 2015 mortality data were analyzed. Self-reported MVPA and SB minutes were used to create the three MVPA [No-MVPA, insufficient (I-MVPA; <150 min/wk), and sufficient (S-MVPA; ≥150 min/wk)] and two SB (<8 and ≥8 hrs/d) groups. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to test the associations of MVPA and SB with all-cause mortality.119 deaths occurred over an average of 4.9 years of follow-up. Lower MVPA and higher SB were independently associated with poor survival (P < .001). Joint and stratified analyses showed that the protective effect of MVPA was most pronounced among patients with SB<8 hrs/d. There was no difference in the mortality risk by SB levels within I-MVPA and S-MVPA groups; however, in the No-MVPA group, those with SB≥8 hrs/d had a greater risk of mortality compared to those with <8 hrs/d (Hazard ratio = 1.60).In this HF cohort, MVPA and SB were independently and jointly associated with all-cause mortality. The beneficial effect of MVPA is attenuated by excessive SB; however, engaging in some amount of MVPA may provide a protective effect and attenuates the detrimental effects associated with excessive SB."
https://openalex.org/W4285492627,"Introduction Attitudes towards cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) among in-hospital healthcare professionals (HCPs) are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate attitudes towards CPR situations among in-hospital HCPs and assess associations with potential influencing factors. Materials and methods A questionnaire was distributed to 3,085 HCPs in 2009 and 2,970 HCPs in 2015–2016. The associations of influencing factors were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Results In the event of a possible cardiac arrest situation, 61% of the HCPs would feel confident in their CPR knowledge, 86% would know what to do, and 60% would be able to take command if necessary. In the latest real-life CPR situation, 30% had been worried about making mistakes or causing complications, 57% had been stressed, and 27% had been anxious. A short time since the latest real-life CPR performance and a high number of previous real-life CPR performances were associated with lower odds of worrying about making mistakes/causing complications, lower odds of feeling stressed or anxious, and higher odds of feeling calm. Regardless of previous real-life CPR experience, there were differences in attitudes between groups of professions, where physicians showed increased odds of worrying about making mistakes/causing complications and nurses showed increased odds of stress. Working on a non-monitored ward meant increased odds of stress and worrying about making mistakes/causing complications. Twelve months or more having passed since the latest CPR training course was associated with increased odds of anxiety. Conclusions Despite HCPs’ generally positive attitudes towards performing CPR in the event of a possible cardiac arrest situation, feelings of stress and anxiety were common in real-life CPR situations. Regular CPR training among all HCPs is a key factor to maintain competence and reduce anxiety. The possible effects of attitudes on performing CPR need to be studied further."
https://openalex.org/W4285493215,"Background Vulnerable populations such as rural and urban-slum dwellers are more likely to suffer greatly from the deleterious effects of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, in Ghana, most COVID-19 mitigating packages are not focused on vulnerable populations. Methods Concurrent mixed methods design was used to examine the socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19 among rural and urban-slum dwellers in Ghana. Four hundred respondents were sampled for the quantitative arm of the study, while 46 In-depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted with community members and government officials. Sixty-four community members participated in Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and non-participant observation was carried out for three months. Quantitative data were analysed using frequencies, percentages, Pearson Chi2 and ordered logistic regression. Interviews were recorded using digital recorders and later transcribed. Transcribed data (IDIs, FGDs) and observation notes were uploaded onto a computer and transferred to qualitative software NVivo 12 to support thematic coding and analysis. Results Majority of the respondents confirmed the deleterious socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19 on jobs and prices of food. Other effects were fear of visiting a health facility even when unwell, depression and anxiety. Young people (18–32 years), males, urban-slum dwellers, married individuals, the employed and low-income earners (those who earn GHC10/$1.7 to GHC100/ $17), were more likely to suffer from the socio-economic and health effects of COVID-19. Urban-slum dwellers coped by relying on family and social networks for food and other basic necessities, while rural dwellers created locally appropriate washing aids to facilitate hand washing in the rural communities. Conclusion COVID-19 and the government’s mitigation measures had negative socio-economic and health effects on vulnerable communities. While vulnerable populations should be targeted for the government’s COVID-19 mitigating packages, special attention should be given to young people (18–32 years), males, urban-slum dwellers, married individuals and low-income earners. Communities should be encouraged to maintain coping strategies adopted even after COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W4285493745,"Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia (E.) coli have been widely described as the cause of treatment failures in humans around the world. The origin of human infections with these microorganisms is discussed controversially and in most cases hard to identify. Since they pose a relevant risk to human health, it becomes crucial to understand their sources and the transmission pathways. In this study, we analyzed data from different studies in Germany and grouped ESBL-producing E. coli from different sources and human cases into subtypes based on their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics (ESBL-genotype, E. coli phylogenetic group and phenotypic antimicrobial resistance pattern). Then, a source attribution model was developed in order to attribute the human cases to the considered sources. The sources were from different animal species (cattle, pig, chicken, dog and horse) and also from patients with nosocomial infections. The human isolates were gathered from community cases which showed to be colonized with ESBL-producing E. coli. We used the attribution model first with only the animal sources (Approach A) and then additionally with the nosocomial infections (Approach B). We observed that all sources contributed to the human cases, nevertheless, isolates from nosocomial infections were more related to those from human cases than any of the other sources. We identified subtypes that were only detected in the considered animal species and others that were observed only in the human population. Some subtypes from the human cases could not be allocated to any of the sources from this study and were attributed to an unknown source. Our study emphasizes the importance of human-to-human transmission of ESBL-producing E. coli and the different role that pets, livestock and healthcare facilities may play in the transmission of these resistant bacteria. The developed source attribution model can be further used to monitor future trends. A One Health approach is necessary to develop source attribution models further to integrate also wildlife, environmental as well as food sources in addition to human and animal data."
https://openalex.org/W4285491000,"In this study, the effects of in ovo feeding of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and embryonic thermal manipulation (TM) on plasma biochemical parameters, organ weights, and hepatic gene expression in broilers exposed to cyclic heat stress (32 ± 1°C for 8 days) (HS) were investigated. A total of 175 chicks were assigned to five treatments: chicks hatched from control eggs (CON); chicks hatched from control eggs but exposed to HS (CON+HS); chicks hatched from eggs injected at 17.5 days of incubation with 0.6mL of 10% GABA and exposed to HS (G10+HS); chicks hatched from thermally manipulated eggs (39.6°C, 6h/d from embryonic days 10 to 18) and exposed to HS (TM+HS); chicks hatched from eggs that received both previous treatments during incubation and exposed to HS (G10+TM+HS). Results revealed that on day 36 post-hatch, hepatic NADPH oxidase 1 (P = 0.034) and 4 (P = 0.021) genes were downregulated in the TM+HS and G10+TM+HS compared to the CON+HS group. In addition, while acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene expression was reduced (P = 0.002) in the G10+TM group, gene expression of extracellular fatty acid-binding protein and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ was lower (P = 0.045) in the TM+HS group than in the CON+HS group. HS led to higher gene expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and 90 (HSP90) (P = 0.005, and P = 0.022). On the other hand, the TM+HS group exhibited lower expression of both HSP70 (P = 0.031) and HSP90 (P = 0.043) whereas the G10+TM+HS group had a reduced (P = 0.016) HSP90 expression compared to the CON+HS. MANOVA on different gene sets highlighted an overall lower (P = 0.034) oxidative stress and lower (P = 0.035) heat shock protein expression in the G10+TM+HS group compared to the CON+HS group. Taken together, the current results suggest that the combination of in ovo feeding of GABA with TM can modulate HSPs and antioxidant-related gene expression in heat-stressed broilers."
https://openalex.org/W4285492076,"We previously showed in a 6-month randomized controlled trial that resistance training and protein supplementation after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, RYGB) improved muscle strength without significant effect on weight loss and body composition changes. We performed a 5-year follow-up study in these subjects with the aim 1) to assess the long-term effect of this exercise training intervention and 2) to analyze associations between habitual physical activity (PA) and weight regain at 5 years.Fifty-four out of 76 initial participants (follow-up rate of 71%) completed the 5-year follow-up examination (controls, n = 17; protein supplementation, n = 22; protein supplementation and resistance training, n = 15). We measured body weight and composition (DXA), lower-limb strength (leg-press one-repetition maximum) and habitual PA (Actigraph accelerometers and self-report). Weight regain at 5 years was considered low when <10% of 12-month weight loss.Mean (SD) time elapse since RYGB was 5.7 (0.9) y. At 5 years, weight loss was 32.8 (10.1) kg, with a mean weight regain of 5.4 (SD 5.9) kg compared with the 12-month assessment. Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) assessed by accelerometry did not change significantly compared with pre-surgery values (+5.2 [SD 21.7] min/d, P = 0.059), and only 4 (8.2%) patients reported participation in resistance training. Muscle strength decreased over time (overall mean [SD]: -49.9 [53.5] kg, respectively, P<0.001), with no statistically significant difference between exercise training intervention groups. An interquartile increase in MVPA levels was positively associated with lower weight regain (OR [95% CI]: 3.27 [1.41;9.86]).Early postoperative participation in a resistance training protocol after bariatric surgery was not associated with improved muscle strength after 5 years of follow-up; however, increasing physical activity of at least moderate intensity may promote weight maintenance after surgery. PA may therefore play an important role in the long-term management of patients with obesity after undergoing bariatric procedure."
https://openalex.org/W4285492305,"The covid-19 global pandemic has significantly impacted on the daily lives of people across the world. One consequence of this has been significant distortion to the speed at which time feels like it is passing during day-to-day life in comparison with prior to the pandemic. The current study sought to further understanding of the impact of the pandemic on temporal experience by exploring individual differences in the subjective length of the first 12 months of the pandemic in the UK. Using an online questionnaire, subjective judgments of the perceived length of the preceding 12 months were taken. In addition, measures of affect, task load and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction, physical activity, conformity with regulations, perceived covid risk and shielding status were taken. The results showed that only 9% of participants reported that the preceding 12 months felt like 12 months. The majority of participants (57%) reported that it felt like the pandemic had lasted for longer than 12 months, and this feeling was stronger for those who indicated greater levels of depression and anxiety, reduced physical activity, reduced satisfaction with social interaction and being advised to shield."
https://openalex.org/W4285493191,"The clinical sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 infection are in part dependent upon age and pre-existing health conditions. Although the use of tobacco products decreases cardiorespiratory fitness while increasing susceptibility to microbial infections, limited information is available on how smoking affects COVID-19 severity. Therefore, we examined whether smokers hospitalized for COVID-19 are at a greater risk for developing severe complications than non-smokers. Data were from all hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection from the American Heart Association's Get-With-The-Guidelines COVID-19 Registry, from January 2020 to March 2021, which is a hospital-based voluntary national registry initiated in 2019 with 122 participating hospitals across the United States. Patients who reported smoking at the time of admission were classified as smokers. Severe outcome was defined as either death or the use of mechanical ventilation. Of the 31,545 patients in the cohort, 6,717 patients were 1:2 propensity matched (for age, sex, race, medical history, medications, and time-frame of hospital admission) and classified as current smokers or non-smokers according to admission data. In multivariable analyses, after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, medication use, and the time of hospital admission, patients self-identified as current smokers had higher adjusted odds of death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.21-1.64), the use of mechanical ventilation (aOR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01-1.32), and increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI 1.05-1.52). Independent of sociodemographic characteristics and medical history, smoking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19, including death."
https://openalex.org/W4285405585,"The structural changes of airway smooth muscle (ASM) that characterize airway remodeling (AR) are crucial to the pathogenesis of asthma. During AR, ASM cells dedifferentiate from a quiescent to a proliferative, migratory, and secretory phenotype. Calcium (Ca2+) is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates many cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, contraction, and metabolism. Furthermore, mitochondria have emerged as major Ca2+ signaling organelles that buffer Ca2+ through uptake by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and extrude it through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX/Slc8b1). Here, we show using mitochondrial Ca2+-sensitive dyes that NCLX only partially contributes to mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion in ASM cells. Yet, NCLX is necessary for ASM cell proliferation and migration. Through cellular imaging, RNA-Seq, and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that NCLX regulates these processes by preventing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and supporting store-operated Ca2+ entry, activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming. Using small animal respiratory mechanic measurements and immunohistochemistry, we show that smooth muscle-specific NCLX KO mice are protected against AR, fibrosis, and hyperresponsiveness in an experimental model of asthma. Our findings support NCLX as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W4285490932,"The first documented chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) occurred in 2012-2013. Since then, several imported and a few autochthonous cases were identified by the national arbovirus surveillance network. The present study aimed to summarize the main genetic features of the CHIKV strains detected in Lao PDR between 2014 and 2020. Samples from Lao patients presenting symptoms compatible with a CHIKV infection were centralized in Vientiane Capital city for real-time RT-PCR screening. Molecular epidemiology was performed by sequencing the E2-6K-E1 region. From 2014 to 2020, two Asian lineage isolates (e.g. French Polynesia; Indonesia), one ECSA-IOL lineage isolate (e.g. Thailand) and one unclassified (e.g. Myanmar) were imported in Vientiane Capital city. Sequences from the autochthonous cases recorded in the Central and Southern parts of the country between July and September 2020 belonged to the ECSA-IOL lineage and clustered with CHIKV strains recently detected in neighboring countries. These results demonstrate the multiple CHIKV introductions in Lao PDR since 2014 and provide evidence for sporadic and time-limited circulation of CHIKV in the country. Even if the circulation of CHIKV seems to be geographically and temporally limited in Lao PDR, the development of international tourism and trade may cause future outbreaks of CHIKV in the country and at the regional level."
https://openalex.org/W4285492289,"Nucleic acid extraction is the first and foremost step in molecular biology studies. Extraction of DNA from small, soft-bodied insects is often time-consuming and costly. A fast, easy, and cost-effective DNA extraction method with greater yield and purity of DNA would aid in the rapid diagnostics, screening of large populations, and other routine PCR-based applications. The present study evaluated and standardized a rapid and zero-cost DNA extraction from soft-bodied small insects for routine molecular studies. Five rapid DNA extraction methods viz. extraction in sterile distilled water (SDW), 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), 1.4 M sodium chloride (NaCl), 20 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, pH 8.0), and elution from blotted nitrocellulose membrane (NCM) were compared with standard CTAB extraction buffer and DNeasy® Blood and Tissue Kit methods. The average yield, purity, storage stability, time, and cost of extraction were assessed for all the methods and compared. A method of DNA extraction by simply crushing the soft-bodied insects in SDW was ideal in terms of yield, purity, storability, and performing routine PCR-based applications including detection of pathogens from vector species. The extraction could be accomplished in 2.5 min only with zero-reagent cost. The method would be useful in rapid molecular diagnostics and screening large populations of soft-bodied insects."
https://openalex.org/W4285492945,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent cause of death worldwide, and in sub-Saharan Africa particularly. Human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) influence pathogen distribution in patients with CAP. Previous studies in sub-Saharan Africa have shown different frequencies of respiratory pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility compared to studies outside Africa. This study aimed to investigate the aetiology, presentation, and treatment outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia in adults at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia.Three-hundred-and-twenty-seven patients were enrolled at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka between March 2018 and December 2018. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected. Sputum samples were tested by microscopy, other TB diagnostics, and bacterial cultures.The commonest presenting complaint was cough (96%), followed by chest pain (60.6%), fever (59.3%), and breathlessness (58.4%). The most common finding on auscultation of the lungs was chest crackles (51.7%). Seventy percent of the study participants had complaints lasting at least a week before enrolment. The prevalence of HIV was 71%. Sputum samples were tested for 286 patients. The diagnostic yield was 59%. The most common isolate was Mycobacterium tuberculosis (20%), followed by Candida species (18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in only four patients. There were no statistically significant differences between the rates of specific pathogens identified in HIV-infected patients compared with the HIV-uninfected. Thirty-day mortality was 30%. Patients with TB had higher 30-day mortality than patients without TB (p = 0.047).Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the most common cause of CAP isolated in adults at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Gram-negative organisms were frequently isolated. A high mortality rate was observed, as 30% of the followed-up study population had died after 30 days."
https://openalex.org/W4285403486,"Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) is a serine/threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that promotes the activation of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and is required for invasion and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Inhibition of MLK activity causes G2/M arrest in HeLa cells; however, the regulation of MLK3 during ovarian cancer cell cycle progression is not known. Here, we found that MLK3 is phosphorylated in mitosis and that inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) prevented MLK3 phosphorylation. In addition, we observed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase, a downstream target of MLK3 and a direct target of MKK4 (SEK1), was activated in G2 phase when CDK2 activity is increased and then inactivated at the beginning of mitosis concurrent with the increase in CDK1 and MLK3 phosphorylation. Using in vitro kinase assays and phosphomutants, we determined that CDK1 phosphorylates MLK3 on Ser548 and decreases MLK3 activity during mitosis, whereas CDK2 phosphorylates MLK3 on Ser770 and increases MLK3 activity during G1/S and G2 phases. We also found that MLK3 inhibition causes a reduction in cell proliferation and a cell cycle arrest in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that MLK3 is required for ovarian cancer cell cycle progression. Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of MLK3 by CDK1 and CDK2 is important for the regulation of MLK3 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activities during G1/S, G2, and M phases in ovarian cancer cell division."
https://openalex.org/W4285490636,"Forensic facial reconstruction aims to assemble and provide the appearance of a face over a skull, in order to lead to recognition of that individual, making possible the application of primary identification methods. The scientific literature presents facial soft tissue thickness (FSTT) tables for reference from a range of different geographic regions. However, the consensus on its importance or on how to use specific population data related to FSTT is not unanimous. Brazil is formed by geographic regions with diverse populations, which are reflected in facial features. This paper aimed to measure and compare FSTT of distinct Brazilian samples to ascertain the need for specific data sets for different regions. A specific protocol for cone beam computed tomography was used to standardize measurement, and it was applied in a sample of 101 subjects. The FSTT measurements of a Brazilian population from the Midwest Region was compared to a previous sample from Southeast, which was collected using the same protocol. High compatibility was observed when comparing the averages of FSTT among samples of these two different geographic regions. Regarding age groups, notable differences on the medium and inferior face were observed in females. Minor variances found are unlikely to affect the practice of forensic facial reconstruction. Facial features, such as eyes, lips, nose, and skin may also be relevant in the differentiation of people from these two areas in Brazil. Therefore, concerning the Southeast and Midwest Brazilian regions, the need to apply different data sets is unnecessary."
https://openalex.org/W4285491024,"Background Incontinence is a complex health and social issue, which involves the involuntary loss of urine or faeces or both. Individuals with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to incontinence. The management of incontinence has largely been overlooked in low and middle-income settings (LMICs). This study aimed to explore the incontinence management strategies employed by disabled people with severe incontinence and their caregivers in Sindh Province, Pakistan. Methods Incontinence management was explored through in-depth interviews with people with incontinence (PWI) and their caregivers, photovoice, and a market survey and product attribute assessment. Data was analysed thematically through inductive coding and evaluated against existing disability and caregiver frameworks. Results Incontinence management affected all aspects of daily life for PWI and caregivers. Effective management of incontinence was prioritised because caregivers viewed it to be part of their familial duty and a requirement for the household to remain pure in the eyes of God. Coping strategies included strict adherence to routines, reducing food and drink intake, creative uses of locally available natural resources, and a heavy reliance on soap and water for maintaining hygiene. Products such as adult diapers were largely unavailable, costly and were not deemed suitable for regular use. There were no social or medical interventions in the region to support incontinence management. The main impacts of incontinence on the household were social isolation, stigma, role shifts within the family, the development of physical ailments among caregivers, and decreased income. Conclusion The complex health, psychological, social, economic, and cultural impacts of incontinence are exacerbated in LMICs due a lack of recognition of the condition, the absence of social or medical interventions and limited access to basic WASH infrastructure, and assistive devices or products. Appropriate solutions need to be developed in partnership with PWI and caregivers and need to be contextualised, affordable and sustainable."
https://openalex.org/W4285492245,"Background Knowledge of the challenges unpaid caregivers faced providing care to older people during the COVID-19 pandemic is limited. Challenges may be especially pronounced for those experiencing inequitable access to health and social care. This participatory action research study, located in New Zealand, has four main objectives, (i) to understand the challenges and rewards associated with caregiving to older care recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions; (ii) to map and collate resources developed (or mobilised) by organisations during the pandemic; (iii) to co-produce policy recommendations, identify useful caregiver resources and practices, prioritise unmet needs (challenges); and, (iv) to use project results in knowledge translation, in order to improve caregivers access to resources, and raise the profile and recognition of caregivers contribution to society. Methods and analysis Māori, Pacific and rural-dwelling caregivers to 30 older care-recipients, and 30 representatives from organisations supporting caregivers in New Zealand will be interviewed. Combining data from the interviews and caregivers letters (from an archive of older people’s pandemic experiences), framework analysis will be used to examine the interrelated systems of the human ecological model and the impact on caregiving experiences during the pandemic. Resources that service providers had created or used for caregivers and older people will be collated and categorised. Through co-production with caregivers and community partners we will produce three short films describing caregivers’ pandemic experiences; identify a suite of resources for caregivers to use in future events requiring self-isolation, and in everyday life; and generate ideas to address unresolved issues."
https://openalex.org/W4285493520,"Background Bluetooth-enabled smartphone apps have been developed and implemented in different sites globally to help overcome capacity limitations of traditional interview-based COVID-19 contact tracing. Two apps are currently available in Canada: ABTraceTogether exclusively in Alberta and COVID Alert in nine other provinces and territories. This study aims to examine factors associated with downloading of these apps to inform targeted promotion and marketing to increase app uptake. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey with adult participants (≥18 years old) from an online national panel. Participants were asked if they had downloaded an app and, if applicable, reasons for not downloading. Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic factors and trusted information sources associated with downloading and reasons for not downloading. Results Of the included 4,503 respondents (36% response rate), 1,394 (31%) had downloaded an app. Demographic and socioeconomic factors positively associated with app download were: 1) being female, 2) higher household income, 3) higher education level attained, and 4) more liberal political views. The odds of downloading an app were higher for participants who trusted health-related information sources, and lower for those who trusted internet searches, family and friend, or Facebook. The most cited reasons for not downloading were related to data security concerns and perceived lack of benefit from the apps. Interpretation These findings identify sociodemographic segments with the lowest app uptake, reasons for not downloading and trusted information sources to inform targeted promotion and marketing strategies to improve uptake of apps to facilitate contact tracing."

Phosphoinositides (PIPns) in the membrane inner leaflet only account for a small percentage of the total membrane lipids but modulate the functions of various membrane proteins, including ion channels, which play important roles in cell signaling. KcsA, a prototypical K+ channel that is small, simple, and easy to handle, has been broadly examined regarding its crystallography, in silico molecular analysis, and electrophysiology. It has been reported that KcsA activity is regulated by membrane phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol. However, there has been no quantitative analysis of the correlation between direct lipid binding and the functional modification of KcsA, and it is unknown whether PIPns modulate KcsA function. Here, using contact bubble bilayer recording, we observed that the open probability of KcsA increased significantly (from about 10% to 90%) when the membrane inner leaflet contained only a small percentage of PIPns. In addition, we found an increase in the electrophysiological activity of KcsA correlated with a larger number of negative charges on PIPns. We further analyzed the affinity of the direct interaction between PIPns and KcsA using microscale thermophoresis and observed a strong correlation between direct lipid binding and the functional modification of KcsA. In conclusion, our approach was able to reconstruct the direct modification of KcsA by PIPns, and we propose that it can also be applied to elucidate the mechanism of modification of other ion channels by PIPns."
https://openalex.org/W4285098342,"The propagation and accumulation of pathological α-synuclein protein is thought to underlie the clinical symptoms of the neurodegenerative movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD). Consequently, there is significant interest in identifying the mechanisms that contribute to α-synuclein pathology, as these may inform therapeutic targets for the treatment of PD. One protein that appears to contribute to α-synuclein pathology is the innate immune pathogen recognition receptor, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). TLR2 is expressed on neurons, and its activation results in the accumulation of α-synuclein protein; however, the precise mechanism by which TLR2 contributes to α-synuclein pathology is unclear. Herein we demonstrate using human cell models that neuronal TLR2 activation acutely impairs the autophagy lysosomal pathway and markedly potentiates α-synuclein pathology seeded with α-synuclein preformed fibrils. Moreover, α-synuclein pathology could be ameliorated with a novel small molecule TLR2 inhibitor, including in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from a patient with PD. These results provide further insight into how TLR2 activation may promote α-synuclein pathology in PD and support that TLR2 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PD."
https://openalex.org/W4285491951,"Climate change is one of the 21st century's biggest public health issues and health care contributes up to 10% of the emissions of greenhouse gases in developed countries. About 15 million laparoscopic procedures are performed annually worldwide and single-use medical equipment is increasingly used during these procedures. Little is known about costs and environmental footprint of this change in practice.We employed Life Cycle Assessment method to evaluate and compare the environmental impacts of single-use, reusable, and mixed trocar systems used for laparoscopic cholecystectomies at three hospitals in southern Sweden. The environmental impacts were calculated using the IMPACT 2002+ method and a functional unit of 500 procedures. Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate differences between trocar systems. Data are presented as medians and 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles. Financial costs were calculated using Life Cycle Costing.The single-use system had a 182% higher impact on resources than the reusable system [difference: 5160 MJ primary (4400-5770)]. The single-use system had a 379% higher impact on climate change than the reusable system [difference: 446 kg CO2eq (413-483)]. The single-use system had an 83% higher impact than the reusable system on ecosystem quality [difference: 79 PDF*m2*yr (24-112)] and a 240% higher impact on human health [difference: 2.4x10-4 DALY/person/yr (2.2x10-4-2.6x10-4)]. The mixed and single-use systems had a similar environmental impact. Differences between single-use and reusable trocars with regard to resource use and ecosystem quality were found to be sensitive to lower filling of machines in the sterilization process. For ecosystem quality the difference between the two were further sensitive to a 50% decrease in number of reuses, and to using a fossil fuel intensive electricity mix. Differences regarding effects on climate change and human health were robust in the sensitivity analyses. The reusable and mixed trocar systems were approximately half as expensive as the single-use systems (17360 € and 18560 € versus 37600 €, respectively).In the Swedish healthcare system the reusable trocar system offers a robust opportunity to reduce both the environmental impact and financial costs for laparoscopic surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4285492170,"In recent years, climate change has greatly affected rainfall and air temperature levels leading to a reduction in water resources in Southern Europe. This fact has emphasized the need to focus on the use of non-conventional water resources for agricultural irrigation. The reuse of treated wastewater (TWW) can represent a sustainable solution, reducing the consumption of freshwater (FW) and the need for mineral fertilisers. The main aim of this study was to assess, in a three-year period, the effects of TWW irrigation compared to FW on the biomass production of bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] plants and soil characteristics and to estimate the nutritional input provided by TWW irrigation. TWW was obtained by a constructed wetland system (CWs) which was used to treat urban wastewater. The system had a total surface area of 100 m2. An experimental field of bermudagrass was set up close to the system in a Sicilian location (Italy), using a split-plot design for a two-factor experiment with three replications. Results highlighted a high organic pollutant removal [five days biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5): 61%, chemical oxygen demand (COD): 65%] and a good efficiency in nutrients [total nitrogen (TN): 50%, total phosphorus (TP): 42%] of the CWs. Plants irrigated with TWW showed higher dry aboveground dry-weight (1259.3 kg ha-1) than those irrigated with FW (942.2 kg ha-1), on average. TWW irrigation approximately allowed a saving of 50.0 kg TN ha-1 year-1, 24.0 kg TP ha-1 year-1 and 29.0 kg K ha-1 year-1 on average with respect to commonly used N-P-K fertilisation programme for bermudagrass in the Mediterranean region. Soil salinity increased significantly (p ≤ 0.01) over the years and was detected to be higher in TWW-irrigated plots (+6.34%) in comparison with FW-irrigated plots. Our findings demonstrate that medium-term TWW irrigation increases the biomass production of bermudagrass turf and contributes to save significant amounts of nutrients, providing a series of agronomic and environmental benefits."
https://openalex.org/W4285493273,"Frailty is a biological syndrome arising from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems. Although recent reports have described elevated frailty levels in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) with minimal to moderate disability, very little is known about frailty in individuals with severe disability. The objective of the current investigation was to evaluate frailty through the deficit accumulation model and to explore the relationship of frailty with MS clinical subtypes, disease duration and fall-history in wheelchair users living with MS.Standard validated procedures were used to calculate a frailty index in 45 wheelchair and scooter users living with MS (median age = 60.0[16.0] years, 82.2% female, patient determined disease steps score = 7.0). Information on demographics, MS clinical subtypes, disease duration, and six-month fall-history were collected as part of a standardized medical survey.The mean frailty index score was 0.54 (standard deviation = 0.13). Overall, 91.1% and 8.9% of participants met objective diagnostic criteria for severe and moderate frailty, respectively. A one-way ANOVA revealed no significant differences (F = 0.054, p = 0.948) in the frailty index among participants with relapsing-remitting MS, primary progressive, and secondary progressive MS. No relationship between frailty and disease duration (r = -0.058, p = 0.706) was found. A univariable negative binomial regression analysis revealed a significant association between frailty index scores and the number of falls experienced in the previous six months (IRR = 1.75, 95% CI [1.06-2.91], p = 0.030).The current study suggests that individuals with MS with advanced disability also live with coexisting frailty and that the frailty index may be a valuable tool in evaluating fall-risk in wheelchair users living with MS. The significant overlap observed between severe disability and severe frailty highlights the emerging need to untangle this bi-directional relationship to identify appropriate therapeutic pathways in the MS population living with advanced disability."
https://openalex.org/W4285493667,"Although Corbicula fluminea has been one of the more prolific freshwater invasive species in the world, previous studies have suggested a low probability for overwinter survival in northern latitudes without an artificially created thermal refuge. The discovery of live C. fluminea in a central Minnesota lake absent any known thermal refuge in 2020 presented an opportunity to further evaluate the overwinter survival and population structure of C. fluminea at the presumed edge of their potential range. The population was monitored from December 2020 through September 2021 alongside water temperature to better understand at which temperatures C. fluminea survived and if the population structure suggested reproduction occurring in the lake. We documented live C. fluminea in temperatures as low as 0.3°C. Shell size of recovered individuals suggested multiple cohorts, and the appearance of a new cohort at the end of the study, indicating active reproduction in the lake and suggesting the population had likely been present in the lake for at least two winters by the conclusion of the study period. Our findings provide evidence of the survival below historically documented lower lethal temperature limits and suggests adaptations to modeling predicting suitable habitat, both present and in a changing climate, are necessary to better assess risk of invasion by this species."
https://openalex.org/W4285493756,"Swellings of the ribs result from severe injury and affected animals are subjected to considerable and prolonged pain and suffering. The knowledge on rib swellings in dairy cows has yet been very limited. Therefore, the present study aimed at determining the prevalence of rib swellings in tie stall housed dairy cows in Germany as well as at identifying associated factors. Mean animal-level prevalence of rib swellings for 2,134 cows was 7.54% with a mean of 7.00% on farm level (range 0.00% - 37.49%). Multivariable mixed logistic regression models including nested random effects were built and factors associated with swellings of the ribs were evaluated for 1,740 dairy cows on 96 farms in Germany. Out of the initial 22 predictors, 8 factors were selected for the final model. Managing dairy cows on a part-time basis (OR 0.49 [CI 0.25-0.98]) appeared to decrease the odds for rib swellings compared with full-time farming. Cattle breeds other than Simmental entailed lower odds for rib swellings (OR 0.29 [CI 0.14-0.59]). Lame cows (OR 2.59 [CI 1.71-3.93]) and cows with wounds and/or swellings of the hocks (OR 2.77 [CI 1.32-5.84]) had more than two times the odds for rib swellings compared with sound animals. The results of the present study can help raising awareness of rib swellings in dairy cows and contribute to the body of evidence on this condition."
https://openalex.org/W4285499210,"Nuclear lamins maintain the nuclear envelope structure by forming long linear filaments via two alternating molecular arrangements of coiled-coil dimers, known as A11 and A22 binding modes. The A11 binding mode is characterized by the antiparallel interactions between coil 1b domains, whereas the A22 binding mode is facilitated by interactions between the coil 2 domains of lamin. The junction between A11- and A22-interacting dimers in the lamin tetramer produces another parallel head-tail interaction between coil 1a and the C-terminal region of coil 2, called the ACN interaction. During mitosis, phosphorylation in the lamin N-terminal head region by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex triggers depolymerization of lamin filaments, but the associated mechanisms remain unknown at the molecular level. In this study, we revealed using the purified proteins that phosphorylation by the CDK1 complex promotes disassembly of lamin filaments by directly abolishing the ACN interaction between coil 1a and the C-terminal portion of coil 2. We further observed that this interaction was disrupted as a result of alteration of the ionic interactions between coil 1a and coil 2. Combined with molecular modeling, we propose a mechanism for CDK1-dependent disassembly of the lamin filaments. Our results will help to elucidate the cell cycle-dependent regulation of nuclear morphology at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W4285403560,"Bacteria adapt to their constantly changing environments largely by transcriptional regulation through the activities of various transcription factors (TFs). However, techniques that monitor TF-promoter interactions in situ in living bacteria are lacking. Herein, we developed a whole-cell TF-promoter binding assay based on the intermolecular FRET between an unnatural amino acid, l-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine, which labels TFs with bright fluorescence through genetic encoding (donor fluorophore) and the live cell nucleic acid stain SYTO 9 (acceptor fluorophore). We show that this new FRET pair monitors the intricate TF-promoter interactions elicited by various types of signal transduction systems, including one-component (CueR) and two-component systems (BasSR and PhoPQ), in bacteria with high specificity and sensitivity. We demonstrate that robust CouA incorporation and FRET occurrence is achieved in all these regulatory systems based on either the crystal structures of TFs or their simulated structures, if 3D structures of the TFs were unavailable. Furthermore, using CueR and PhoPQ systems as models, we demonstrate that the whole-cell FRET assay is applicable for the identification and validation of complex regulatory circuit and novel modulators of regulatory systems of interest. Finally, we show that the FRET system is applicable for single-cell analysis and monitoring TF activities in Escherichia coli colonizing a Caenorhabditis elegans host. In conclusion, we established a tractable and sensitive TF-promoter binding assay, which not only complements currently available approaches for DNA-protein interactions but also provides novel opportunities for functional annotation of bacterial signal transduction systems and studies of the bacteria-host interface."
https://openalex.org/W4285405337,"TransMEMbrane 16A (TMEM16A) is a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel that plays critical roles in regulating diverse physiologic processes, including vascular tone, sensory signal transduction, and mucosal secretion. In addition to Ca2+, TMEM16A activation requires the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). However, the structural determinants mediating this interaction are not clear. Here, we interrogated the parts of the PI(4,5)P2 head group that mediate its interaction with TMEM16A by using patch- and two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings on oocytes from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, which endogenously express TMEM16A channels. During continuous application of Ca2+ to excised inside-out patches, we found that TMEM16A-conducted currents decayed shortly after patch excision. Following this rundown, we show that the application of a synthetic PI(4,5)P2 analog produced current recovery. Furthermore, inducible dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 reduces TMEM16A-conducted currents. Application of PIP2 analogs with different phosphate orientations yielded distinct amounts of current recovery, and only lipids that include a phosphate at the 4' position effectively recovered TMEM16A currents. Taken together, these findings improve our understanding of how PI(4,5)P2 binds to and potentiates TMEM16A channels."
https://openalex.org/W4285491190,"Human rhinovirus is a major cause of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) worldwide. Epidemiological data on human rhinovirus (RV) in Peru is still scarce, as well as its role in respiratory infections in children. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of rhinovirus and to identify the circulating species in nasopharyngeal swabs from children with acute respiratory infections.We analyzed nasopharyngeal swab samples that were collected from children younger than 17 years old, who had a clinical diagnosis of ARI from the ""Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia"" between May 2009 and December 2010. The original study recruited 767 inpatients with ARI, 559 samples of which were included and analyzed in the current study. Detection of rhinovirus and determination of rhinovirus species were characterized by PCR.Rhinovirus was detected in 42.22% samples (236/559), RV-A was detected in 10.17% (24/236) of the cases, RV-B in 16.53% (39/236), and RV-C in 73.31% (173/236). The age group with the highest number of cases was the 0-5 months group with 45.97%, followed by the 1-5 years group with 25.22%. Most of the positive RV cases, i.e., 86.44% (204/236), were hospitalized. The most common signs and symptoms found in patients who tested positive for RV were cough (72.88%), fever (68.64%), rhinorrhea (68.22%), and respiratory distress (61.44%). Infection with RV-A was associated with wheezing (p = 0.02). Furthermore, RV-C was related to cough (p = 0.01), wheezing (p = 0.002), and conjunctival injection (p = 0.03). A peak in RV-C cases was found in March (32 cases in 2010); June (18 cases in 2009 and 12 cases in 2010), which corresponds to the fall season in Peru; and also November (17 cases in 2009 and 4 cases in 2010), which corresponds to spring. RV-A and RV-B cases were constant throughout the year.In conclusion, we found a high prevalence of rhinovirus C infection among pediatric patients with acute respiratory infections in Lima, Peru. This viral infection was more common in children between 0 to 5 months old, and was associated with cough, wheezing, and conjunctival injection. Epidemiological surveillance of this virus should be strengthened/encouraged in Peru to determine its real impact on respiratory infections."

These programmes entail wide-ranging domestic policy reforms that influence local health and welfare systems. Using novel panel data from 187 countries between 1990 and 2017 and an instrumental variable technique, we find that IMF programmes lead to over 70 excess deaths from respiratory diseases and tuberculosis per 100,000 population and that IMF-mandated privatisation reforms lead to over 90 excess deaths per 100,000 population. Thus structural adjustment programmes, as currently designed and implemented, are harmful to population health and increase global infectious disease burdens."

Yet, the effect of aging on left atrial (LA) function, and its interaction with left ventricular (LV) adaptation, remain less described when combined with high-intensity chronic training. We aimed to analyze the effects of aging on LA and LV functions in trained athletes.Ninety-five healthy highly-trained athletes referred for resting echocardiography were included. Two groups of athletes were retrospectively defined based on age: young athletes aged <35 years (n = 54), and master athletes aged ≥35 years (n = 41). All subjects were questioned about their sports practice. Echocardiographic analysis of LV systolic and diastolic functions (2D-echo, 3D-echo, and Doppler), as well as LA 2D dimensions and phasic deformations assessed by speckle tracking, were analyzed. Master athletes (mean age = 46.3 ± 8.3 years, mean duration of sustained training = 13.7 ± 8.9 years) exhibited significantly stiffer LV and LA with reduced LV early diastolic functional parameters (ratio E/A, peak e', and ratio e'/a'), LA reservoir and conduit strain, whereas LA volume, LA contractile strain and LV peak a' were higher, compared to young athletes. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that age was predictive of peak e', LA reservoir strain and LA conduit strain, independently of training variables. LA phasic strains were strongly associated with LV diastolic function.Regardless of chronic sports practice, master athletes exhibited age-related changes in LA function closely coupled to LV diastolic properties, which led to LV filling shifts to late diastole."

This inside attribution, in turn, may worsen the restaurant evaluation. Two experiments (Study 1 and 2) examine this mechanism using different stimuli. In both experiments, consumers exposed to high (vs. low) mentioning-frequency reviews attributed the issue more inside the restaurant and evaluated the restaurant lower. Additionally, the paper considers the role of consumer analytical processing (Study 1) and perceived review helpfulness (Study 2) in the relationships between mentioning frequency and issue attribution. The paper extends the existing literature by applying the attribution theory to the context of frequency information in online reviews. The results guide marketers dealing with negative online reviews by suggesting the way to deal with high-mentioning-frequency negative reviews."
https://openalex.org/W4285493363,"A fault detection method using skeleton extraction based on orientation field consistency is proposed to improve the efficiency of fault detection, reduce the influence of transverse nonstructural factors on fault detection, and realize automatic fault extraction. In fingerprint image processing, the consistency of the orientation field reaches a maximum value when all orientations are parallel and takes a smaller value when not all orientations are parallel. The orientation field ceases to be parallel in the presence of a stratigraphic discontinuity, and the consistency of the orientation field in the corresponding region is lower than that in parallel regions. This characteristic can be exploited to extract discontinuous regions from seismic data. Then, binarization and closing operations are used to extract fault areas and increase fault continuity. Finally, a skeleton extraction method based on extracting the longitudinal center point is used to identify the fault lines. Compared with the classical ant tracking method, the proposed method requires the adjustment of fewer parameters, thus simplifying fault identification process to a certain extent. Moreover, the proposed method effectively suppresses transverse discontinuities, highlights the longitudinal fault characteristics, and strengthens fault continuity."

Seven sub-themes were identified to describe the transitions within these three phases: phase 1: receiving and accepting a diagnosis; navigating reactions; phase 2: changing social interactions and maintaining sense of self; information: wanting to know but not wanting to know; finding a place within the healthcare system; and 3: changes in roles and relationships; and increasingly dependent.This study has identified points of change and means of supporting key transitions such as diagnosis, changes in social connections, and increased use of secondary healthcare services so that comprehensive, holistic, individualised and well-timed support can be put in place to maintain well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4285404574,"Regulation of protein synthesis is critical for control of gene expression in all cells. Ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein machines responsible for translating cellular proteins. Defects in ribosome production, function, or regulation are detrimental to the cell and cause human diseases, such as progressive encephalopathy with edema, hypsarrhythmia, and optic atrophy (PEHO) syndrome. PEHO syndrome is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the ZNHIT3 gene, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved nuclear protein. The precise mechanisms by which ZNHIT3 mutations lead to PEHO syndrome are currently unclear. Studies of the human zinc finger HIT-type containing protein 3 homolog in budding yeast (Hit1) revealed that this protein is critical for formation of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes that are required for rRNA processing and 2'-O-methylation. Here, we use budding yeast as a model system to reveal the basis for the molecular pathogenesis of PEHO syndrome. We show that missense mutations modeling those found in PEHO syndrome patients cause a decrease in steady-state Hit1 protein levels, a significant reduction of box C/D snoRNA levels, and subsequent defects in rRNA processing and altered cellular translation. Using RiboMethSeq analysis of rRNAs isolated from actively translating ribosomes, we reveal site-specific changes in the rRNA modification pattern of PEHO syndrome mutant yeast cells. Our data suggest that PEHO syndrome is a ribosomopathy and reveal potential new aspects of the molecular basis of this disease in translation dysregulation."

This study aimed to investigate the association of CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367), CYP3A5*3 (rs776746) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with response to simvastatin in hypercholesterolemia patients conducted at King Abdulaziz University hospital (KAUH) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.A total of 274 participants were registered in the current study. Hypercholesterolemic patients taking simvastatin 20 mg (n = 148) and control subjects (n = 126) were tested for rs35599367 and rs776746 genotypes using Custom Taqman ® Assay Probes. Response to simvastatin in these patients was assessed by determination of low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and by measuring statin plasma levels using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).None of the participants carried a homozygous CYP3A4*22 mutant genotype, while 12 (4.4%) individuals had a heterozygous genotype and 262 (95.6%) had a wild homozygous genotype. The CYP3A5*3 allele was detected in the homozygous mutant form in 16 (5.8%) individuals, while 74 (27.0%) individuals carried the heterozygous genotype and 184 (67.2%) carried the wildtype homozygous genotype. Of the patient group, 15 (11%) were classified as intermediate metabolizers (IMs) and 133 (89%) as extensive metabolizers (EMs). Plasma simvastatin concentrations for the combined CYP3A4/5 genotypes were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the IMs group than in the EMs group. TC and plasma LDL-C levels were also significantly (P<0.05) higher in IMs than in EMs.The present study showed associations between CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367) and CYP3A5*3 (rs776746) SNP combination genotypes with response to statins in hypercholesterolemia. Patients who had either a mutant homozygous allele for CYP3A5*3 or mutant homozygous and heterozygous alleles for CYP3A4*22 showed increased response to lower TC and LDL-C levels."
https://openalex.org/W4285490997,"Glucocorticoids are often used illegally in food-producing animals for the growth promotion of livestock animals. In accordance to official chemical methods for glucocorticoid detection, an animal is declared as non-compliant when a residue is identified in the sample. Neverthless, growth promoting molecules can often escape identification due to their rapid elimination or due to the use of non-detectable new generation drugs. Therefore, an indirect screening method able to detect the biological effect of long-term administration of low doses of dexamethasone and prednisolone on livestock has been developed to support official methods. As already described, FKBP5 (FKBP prolyl isomerase 5) expression in bovine thymus is regulated by glucocorticoids, and this specific regulation can be exploited in an indirect screening assay. In the present study, male veal calves and young bulls were considered in three different trials in which estradiol, dexamethasone, and prednisolone were administered alone or in combination with Revalor-200 subcutaneous pellets. Thoracic thymus was sampled from all animals and molecular analysis was performed. A duplex droplet digital PCR assay with EvaGreen® was employed to detect the target gene expression using absolute quantification. The developed droplet digital PCR assay was precise, showing intra- and inter-assay mean coefficient of variation values of about 6.16% and 3.17%, respectively. It was also highly specific (100%) with Youden's index of 76.92% and 53.57% applied to veal calves and young bulls, respectively. The lowest detection limit in which the target gene expression level was kept constant, was 0.05 ng/μl of cDNA with 1 copies/μL and 0.5 copies/μL for target and reference gene, respectively. This study establishes the basis for using a digital PCR-based assay as an efficient test to identify animals illegally treated with glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W4285491069,"Decreased platelet count is an early phenomenon in asexual Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia, but its association with acute or long-term functional changes in platelets and coagulation is unknown. Moreover, the impact of gametocytemia on platelets and coagulation remains unclear. We investigated the changes in platelet number and function during early asexual parasitemia, gametocytemia and convalescence in 16 individuals participating in a controlled human malaria infection study, and studied its relationship with changes in total and active von Willebrand factor levels (VWF) and the coagulation system. Platelet activation and reactivity were determined by flow cytometry, and the coagulation system was assessed using different representative assays including antigen assays, activity assays and global functional assays. Platelet count was decreased during asexual blood stage infection but normalized during gametocytemia. Platelet P-selectin expression was slightly increased during asexual parasitemia, gametocytemia and at day 64. In contrast, platelet reactivity to different agonists remained unchanged, except a marked decrease in reactivity to low dose collagen-related peptide-XL. Thrombin generation and antigen assays did not show a clear activation of the coagulation during asexual parasitemia, whereas total and active VWF levels were markedly increased. During gametocytemia and on day 64, the endogenous thrombin potential, thrombin peak and velocity index were increased and prothrombin conversion and plasma prothrombin levels were decreased. We conclude that the decreased platelet count during asexual parasitemia is associated with increased active VWF levels (i.e. endothelial activation), but not platelet hyperreactivity or hypercoagulability, and that the increased platelet clearance in asexual parasitemia could cause spontaneous VWF-platelet complexes formation."
https://openalex.org/W4285491959,"Isocyanate chemicals known to cause adverse health effects when inhaled are essential to making important products and are used in multiple industries. Glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant of the lower airways with a well described role in xenobiotic metabolism, is a primary reaction target for di-isocyantes. However, GSHs reactivity with poly-isocyanates which have largely replaced diisocyanates (particularly aliphatic) in most end-user settings remains uncertain. We hypothesized aliphatic polyisocyanates would readily react with glutathione under physiologic conditions and the products could be identified using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled-mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS/MS. The data identified (tris)GSH-isocyanate adducts as the major reaction product of GSH with the most commonly used contemporary polymeric (tri-isocyanate) formulations of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), the isocyanurate and biuret, as [M+H]+ ions of 1426.53 and 1400.55 m/z respectively in reverse phase LC-MS using electrospray in positive ion mode. The uretdione form of HDI, a stabilized dimer, formed two reaction products with GSH, a tris(GSH)-isocyanate reaction product recognized as a 1258.44 m/z [M+H]+ ion, and a bis(GSH)-isocyanate product identified as a 951.36 m/z [M+H]+ ion. Predicted structures for the newly described GSH-polyisocyanate reaction products, modeled based on collision induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation patterns in tandem MS/MS, support S-linkage of the GSH to N = C = O groups. In summary, industrially-used aliphatic polyisocyanates readily react with GSH to form primarily S-linked tris(GSH)-conjugates, a process that may play an important role in response to respiratory tract exposure."

This study aimed to demonstrate potential underlying mechanisms using experimental canine models and computer simulations.A canine model of MR was created by cauterization of mitral chordae followed by radiofrequency ablation-induced left bundle-branch block (LBBB) after 4 weeks (MR-LBBB group). Animals with LBBB alone served as control. Echocardiography was performed at baseline, acutely after MR induction, and at 4 and 20 weeks, and correlated with histology and computer simulations.Acute MR augmented LA reservoir and contractile strain (40±4 to 53±6% and -11±5 to -22±9% respectively, p<0.05). LA fractional area change increased significantly (47±4 to 56±4%, p<0.05) while LA end-systolic area remained unchanged (7.2±1.1 versus 7.9±1.1 cm2 respectively, p = 0.08). LA strain 'pseudonormalized' after 4 weeks and decompensated at 20 weeks with both strains decreasing to 25±6% and -3±2% respectively (p<0.05) together with a progressive increase in LA end-systolic area (7.2±1.1 to 14.0±6.3 cm2, p<0.05). In the LBBB-group, LA remodeling was less pronounced. Histology showed a trend towards increased interstitial fibrosis in the LA of the MR-LBBB group. Computer simulations indicated that the progressive changes in LA structure and function are a combination of progressive eccentric remodeling and fibrosis.MR augmented LA strain acutely to supranormal values without significant LA dilation. However, over time, LA strain gradually decreases (pseudornormal and decompensated) with LA dilation. Histology and computer simulations indicated a correlation to a varying degree of LA eccentric remodeling and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4285492606,"Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a life threatening disease and leading cause of opportunistic fungal-related mortality in HIV/AIDS. Most CM infections are caused by C. neoformans species complexes but the prevalence of Cryptococcus gattii species complexes in Uganda is unknown however, it is known in a few other parts of Africa. We estimated the prevalence of C. gattii in patients living with HIV and a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in Uganda.Cryptococcus isolates (n = 200) obtained from cerebrospinal fluid of patients with CM recruited at the Infectious Diseases Institute, Kampala, Uganda, were tested by phenotypic methods. The Cryptococcus isolates were sub-cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar plates for 48 hours. The yeast colonies were examined by India ink stain, urea hydrolysis, and C. gattii was identified by blue pigmentation on CGB agar. The results were analyzed for frequency of C. gattii. Patient demographic characteristics were collected from the case record forms.From the 200 patients' case record forms, 87 (43.5%) were female and 113 (56.5%) were male. The median age was 35 (19-64) years. Most patients, 93% (187/200) were from Central Uganda in the districts of Kampala and Wakiso. 97.51% (157/161) of the patients had absolute CD4 lymphocyte counts of less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter; 1.86% (3/161) 200-350 cells per cubic millimeter and 0.62% (1/161) above 500 cells per cubic millimeter. 45.4% (74/163) were not yet on HAART and 54.6% (89/163) were on HAART. 66.7% (58/87) had poor adherence to HAART treatment and 33.3% (29/87) had reported good adherence to HAART treatment. A total of 200 clinical isolates of Cryptococcus isolates were tested. No (0% (0/200) C. gattii was identified among the Cryptococcus isolates.In this study among patients living with HIV and a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in Uganda, we found no C. gattii infections."
https://openalex.org/W4285492890,"Unplanned hospital readmissions mean a significant burden for health systems. Accurately estimating the patient's readmission risk could help to optimise the discharge decision-making process by smartly ordering patients based on a severity score, thus helping to improve the usage of clinical resources. A great number of heterogeneous factors can influence the readmission risk, which makes it highly difficult to be estimated by a human agent. However, this score could be achieved with the help of AI models, acting as aiding tools for decision support systems. In this paper, we propose a machine learning classification and risk stratification approach to assess the readmission problem and provide a decision support system based on estimated patient risk scores."
https://openalex.org/W4285493623,"Hematological reference intervals (RIs) are affected by inherent variables like age, sex, genetic background, environment, diet and certain circumstances such as pregnancy signifying the need for population specific values. This study was designed to establish RIs for common hematological parameters of apparently healthy pregnant and non-pregnant women from Northeast Ethiopia.This community based cross-sectional study recruited 600 pregnant and non-pregnant women in South Wollo Zone, Northeast Ethiopia from June to August 2019. Complete blood count was performed for eligible participants using Mindary BC-3000 plus hematology analyzer. The mean, median, and 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reference limits with 90% CI were determined using SPSS version 23.The established selected 2.5th-97.5th percentiles RIs for pregnant women were: WBC: 4.0-13.2x109/L; RBC: 3.45-4.67x1012/L; Hgb: 10.1-13.7g/dL; HCT: 33.5-46.5%; MCV: 85-104fL; MCH: 27.5-33.0pg; MCHC: 30.3-33.7g/dL and Platelet count: 132-373x109/L. The respective values for non-pregnant women were 3.6-10.3; 4.44-5.01; 12.4-14.3; 38.4-50.1; 86-102; 27.1-32.4, 30.4-34.1, 173-456. A statistically significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant women was noted in all hematological parameters except MCHC. The mean and median value of WBC count, MCV, MPV and PDW increased, whereas mean values of HCT and Platelet count decreased as gestational period advances.The observed difference from other studies signify the necessity for using trimester specific RIs and separate RI for pregnant and non-pregnant women. Thus, we recommend the health facilities in the study area to utilize the currently established RIs for pregnant and non-pregnant women for better care."
https://openalex.org/W4285493645,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are public health problem across the globe, particularly in developing countries. Pakistan has the second highest prevalence of HCV infection worldwide. Limited data exist from Pakistan about persons who inject drugs (PWID) and are at significant risk of exposure to HCV infection and transmission. Serum specimens (n = 110) collected from PWID residing in four provinces were tested for molecular markers of HCV infection. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of the hypervariable region (HVR1) of HCV and Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology (GHOST) were used to determine HCV genotype, genetic heterogeneity, and construct transmission networks. Among tested specimens, 47.3% were found anti-HCV positive and 34.6% were HCV RNA-positive and belonged to four genotypes, with 3a most prevalent followed by 1a, 1b and 4a. Variants sampled from five cases formed phylogenetic cluster and a transmission network. One case harbored infection with two different genotypes. High prevalence of infections and presence of various genotypes indicate frequent introduction and transmission of HCV among PWID in Pakistan. Identification of a transmission cluster across three provinces, involving 20% of all cases, suggests the existence of a countrywide transmission network among PWIDs. Understanding the structure of this network should assist in devising effective public health strategies to eliminate HCV infection in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W4285493675,"A 2 × 2 factorial experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of maternal supplementation from day 83 of gestation and/or direct supplementation from weaning of a bovine casein hydrolysate plus a yeast β-glucan (CH-YBG) on pig performance and intestinal health on day ten post-weaning. Twenty cross bred gilts (Large White × Landrace) were randomly assigned to one of two dietary groups ( n = 10 gilts/group): basal diet (basal sows) and basal diet supplemented with CH-YBG (supplemented sows) from day 83 of gestation until weaning (2g/sow/day). At weaning, 120 pigs (6 pigs/sow) were selected. The two dam groups were further divided, resulting in four experimental groups (10 replicates/group; 3 pigs/pen) as follows: 1) BB (basal sows + basal pigs); 2) BS (basal sows + supplemented pigs); 3) SB (supplemented sows + basal pigs); 4) SS (supplemented sows + supplemented pigs). Supplemented pigs were offered 0.5g CH-YBG/kg of feed for 10 days post-weaning. On day 10 post-weaning, 1 pig/pen was humanely sacrificed and samples were taken from the gastrointestinal tract for analysis. Pigs weaned from supplemented sows (SS, SB) had reduced faecal scores and incidence of diarrhoea (P&lt;0.05) compared to pigs weaned from basal sows (BB, BS), with SS pigs not displaying the transient rise in faecal scores seen in the other three groups from day 3 to day 10 post-weaning (P&lt;0.05). Pigs weaned from supplemented sows had reduced feed intake (P&lt;0.05), improved feed efficiency (P&lt;0.05), increased butyrate concentrations (P&lt;0.05), increased abundance of Lactobacillus (P&lt;0.05) and decreased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Campylobacteraceae (P&lt;0.05) compared to pigs weaned from basal sows. In conclusion, maternal supplementation increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and decreased the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Campylobacteraceae while also increasing butyrate concentrations. The combination of maternal and direct supplementation led to pigs having the lowest faecal scores compared to all other groups."
