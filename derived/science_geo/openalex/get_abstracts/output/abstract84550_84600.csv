https://openalex.org/W2017659544,"The γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, which is composed of distinct proteins embedded in the neuronal plasma membrane, is important for several effects of benzodiazepines, including protection afforded against convulsions. During structural modification of ethyl β-carboline-3-carboxylate an agent was discovered which has high affinity for brain benzodiazepine receptors but which is a potent convulsant. Also in contrast to benzodiazepines, this type of benzodiazepine receptor ligand favors benzodiazepine receptors in the non-GABA-stimulated conformation, which may explain the convulsive properties."
https://openalex.org/W2017458967,"The photosynthesis of previtamin D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol in human skin was determined after exposure to narrow-band radiation or simulated solar radiation. The optimum wavelengths for the production of previtamin D3 were determined to be between 295 and 300 nanometers. When human skin was exposed to 295-nanometer radiation, up to 65 percent of the original 7-dehydrocholesterol content was converted to previtamin D3. In comparison, when adjacent skin was exposed to simulated solar radiation, the maximum formation of previtamin D3 was about 20 percent. Major differences in the formation of lumisterol3 and tachysterol3 from previtamin D3 were also observed. It is concluded that the spectral character of natural sunlight has a profound effect on the photochemistry of 7-dehydrocholesterol in human skin."
https://openalex.org/W2017560084,"From the complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of the avian sarcoma virus Y73, we have predicted amino acid sequence of p90 gag-yes, the product of the transforming gene. Contrary to previous evidence from molecular hybridization studies p90 gag-yes was found to have much homology with the transforming gene product p60 src of Rous sarcoma virus, suggesting that the cellular counterparts of the two (c-yes and c-src) originated from a common prototype sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1486896527,"Effects of maitotoxin, the most potent marine toxin, were studied using a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12h. A low concentration (10(-8) g/ml) of maitotoxin induced a profound increase in CA2+ influx into PC12h cells and the Ca2+-dependent release of [3H]norepinephrine from them. The effects of maitotoxin were not affected by treatment with tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M) and were observed even in the absence of external Na+. Furthermore, these effects were markedly inhibited or abolished by treatment with verapamil (30-300 microM), Mn2+ (5 mM), or tetracaine (1 mM). These results suggest that maitotoxin activates the voltage-dependent calcium channels of PC12h cells."

https://openalex.org/W2066748182,"The presence of synthetic ovine corticotropin-releasing factor leads to a rapid and marked stimulation of adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate accumulation in an enriched population of rat pituitary corticotrophs in primary culture. The increase, observed as early as 60 seconds after the addition of corticotropin-releasing factor, suggests that changes in the intracellular concentration of the cyclic nucleotide coincide with or precede the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone in response to corticotropin-releasing factor."
https://openalex.org/W191249933,"A chemical method of deglycosylation of human choriogonadotropin (hCG) was used to assess the role of carbohydrate moiety in the maintenance of quaternary structure and functional parameters such as receptor binding, immunological activity, and in vitro biological response. Treatment of purified hCG with anhydrous HF at 0 degrees C for 60 min was effective in removing more than 75% of the carbohydrate moiety. This extent of deglycosylation altered its chromatographic characteristics as revealed by retarded behavior on Sephadex G-100 and failure to be retained on concanavalin A-Sepharose. The electrophoretic heterogeneity present in native hCG was markedly reduced by deglycosylation. The deglycosylated hCG was stable in the lyophilized form and retained its quaternary structure as revealed by the fluorescence probe 8-anilino 1-naphthalene sulfonic acid, receptor binding, and immunological activities. Unlike receptor binding and immunological activities, which were fully retained, the ability of the hormone to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation in vitro in rat interstitial cells was completely abolished."
https://openalex.org/W1995486441,"Receptors that selectively bind micromolar concentrations of benzodiazepines are present in rat brain membrane. These micromolar receptors exhibit saturable, stereospecific binding, and the potency of benzodiazepine binding to these receptors is correlated with the ability of the benzodiazepines to inhibit maximum electric shock-induced convulsions. Benzodiazepine receptors with nanomolar affinity differ from the micromolar receptors in their binding, kinetic, and pharmacologic characteristics. The micromolar receptors also bind phenytoin, a non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant. These results provide evidence for a distinct class of clinically relevant benzodiazepine receptors that may regulate neuronal excitability and anticonvulsant activity."

The cerebrospinal fluid of 20 of the schizophrenic patients and 3 of the patients with bipolar disorders showed significant increases in immunoglobulin M antibody to cytomegalovirus; no difference was found in patients on or off psychotropic medications."
https://openalex.org/W1997385224,Mitogenic stimulation of mouse lymphocytes results in two sequential intracellular alkalinizations. The first shift of intracellular pH from 7.18 to 7.35 coincides with early biochemical events following mitogenic stimulation. The second alkalinization begins 12 hours after stimulation and rises in parallel with the rate of thymidine incorporation. The results suggest that intracellular alkalinization following stimulation may play a key role in the enhancement of cellular activation and mitogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1575266405,"The development of insulin responsiveness of the transport systems for glucose (2-deoxyglucose) and potassium (Rb+) was compared during in vitro adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Growing cells exhibited minimal increases in 2-deoxyglucose and Rb+ transport rates in response to insulin. Low levels of insulin stimulation of both transport processes became apparent when cultures attained confluence, and these levels were maintained in uninduced cells which retained their fibroblast-like morphology. Following a 48-h induction treatment with methylisobutylxanthine and dexamethasone, a dramatic and simultaneous increase in insulin sensitivity of both deoxyglucose and Rb+ uptake was observed. In fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin caused a 6-10-fold increase above the basal rate for deoxyglucose uptake and a 1.50-1.60-fold increase of Rb+ uptake. The insulin dose response relationships were identical for both deoxyglucose uptake and Rb+ uptake and half-maximal stimulation occurred at insulin concentrations of 2-3 nM in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, 550 pM in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and 100 pM in mature rat adipocytes. Basal rates of deoxyglucose and Rb+ uptakes were 2-9-fold higher in growing cells than in confluent cells, and fatty cells exhibited lower transport rates relative to nonfatty cells. The number of active Na+ pumps on the cell surface was determined by quantitation of the covalent phosphorylated intermediate of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase. Plasma membranes of growing cells contained a larger number of (Na+,K+)-ATPase specific phosphorylation sites and higher (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity than those of confluent cells. Although (Na+,K+)-ATPase and Rb+ transport activities were greater in uninduced cells than in induced cells, both cultures exhibited the same number of phosphorylation sites, implying that the Na+ pump in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was operating at a reduced efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1629600409,"We recently described a method for the purification of a protein kinase related to pp60src from Rous sarcoma virus-induced rat tumors (Blithe, D. L., Richert, N. D., and Pastan, I. H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7135-7142). In this report, we describe some of the properties of the 7200-fold purified enzyme. The purified kinase phosphorylates casein, vinculin, actin, and histone H2B, but not bovine serum albumin or ovalbumin. Protein substrates are phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine residues. Casein was used as a substrate for more detailed analysis. The phosphorylation reaction proceeds at a linear rate for at least 40 min at 22 degrees C. Maximum enzyme activity occurs at pH 6.5 to pH 6.8 and requires the presence of either Mg2+ (5 to 10 mM) or Mn2+ (1 to 5 mM). The Km for ATP is 30 microM and the Vmax 0.03 mumol/min/mg using 0.4 mg/ml of casein as a substrate. The enzyme utilizes ATP or dATP, but not GTP as a phosphate donor in the reaction. The enzyme is inhibited by adenosine and deoxyadenosine and by their corresponding mono- and diphosphates. No inhibition of enzyme activity is observed with adenine, GTP, UTP, TTP, or CTP. The enzyme is very sensitive to increased ionic strength. Addition of 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM KPO4, or 50 mM NaPO4 inhibited casein phosphorylation by 90 to 95%. Analysis of the products of the phosphorylation reaction by thin layer chromatography revealed that the src kinase phosphorylates glycerol in addition to casein or the enzyme itself."

https://openalex.org/W171692377,"We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the nonallelic adult goat I alpha- and II alpha-globin genes and, as is the case with the duplicated human alpha-to each other. Such high homology (99%) has most likely been preserved via a gene conversion mechanism. The conversion unit in goats is only about 9000 base pairs in length, and contained within this short region are all the known signals required for accurate and efficient transcription, with the CCAAT box adjacent to the 5'-boundary of the conversion unit and the poly(A) addition site adjacent to the 3' end. This conversion unit is also flanked by a 23-base-pair direct repeat boundary sequence, vestiges of which are also observable in the human and mouse alpha-globin genes and pseudogenes. These direct repeats imply that a transposition-like event may have been responsible for the insertion of an ancestral alpha-like sequence into a new chromosomal locus, and that this insertion event and subsequent gene duplication may have predated the mammalian radiation."

https://openalex.org/W2029173226,"The activity of nucleoside triphosphatase, an enzyme that regulates nuclear messenger RNA transport, was measured in highly purified nuclear envelopes isolated from rat liver. Addition of picomolar concentrations of insulin to freshly prepared nuclear envelopes directly increased the enzyme activity. The major effect of insulin on this enzyme was to increase the maximum velocity of its activity; no significant effects were seen on the affinity constant. These studies raise the possibility, therefore, that the nuclear envelope is a site where insulin regulates nuclear functions."
https://openalex.org/W1602921644,"In Escherichia coli, the physiological conditions governing the expression of an acid phosphatase with an optimum pH of 2.5 were determined. By contrast with most enzymes, the synthesis of this phosphatase was turned off in exponentially growing bacteria and started as soon as cultures entered the stationary phase. A starvation for inorganic phosphate resulted in a premature full induction, while carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur limitations were inefficient. In the presence of nonlimiting amounts of inorganic phosphate, however, the transfer of the culture to anaerobic conditions led to an immediate accumulation of the acid phosphatase. Cyclic AMP exerted a strong negative control on the biosynthesis and of this enzyme for which the integrity of both the cya and the crp gene functions was necessary. The acid phosphatase was purified to apparent homogeneity and behaved as a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of about 45,000. It had predominantly a phosphoanhydride phosphatase activity and preferentially hydrolyzed the gamma-phosphoryl residue of GTP (Km = 0.35 mM) and the 5'-beta-phosphoryl residue of ppGpp (Km = 1.8 mM). The corresponding beta-phosphoryl residue of GDP was little hydrolyzed, while CTP, ATP, and UTP were not. The enzyme did not split most phosphomonoesters with the exception of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Km = 2.7 mM), 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (Km = 5 mM), and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Km = 5 mM). It was competitively inhibited by tartaric acid and by sodium fluoride (Ki = 60 microM). In addition, it was sensitive to the inhibitor of the translation elongation factor EF-G fusidic acid, and was also strongly inhibited by the triazine dye Cibacron Blue F3GA (Ki = 0.3 microM), suggesting the existence of a site able to recognize nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1670508237,"A cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase has been purified from wheat germ extracts. The enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of casein and phosvitin but not protamine, histone, or bovine serum albumin. However, the best substrate for the kinase appears to be that of an endogenous wheat germ protein. The kinase can utilize both ATP and GTP as phosphoryl donors. A molecular weight of 36,000-38,000 had been estimated for the kinase by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by glycerol density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration in the presence of 0.5 M KCl. In the presence of low salt, however, the molecular weight of the kinase appears to double. In isoelectrofocusing, the kinase exhibits a pI of about 6.5.The activity of the kinase is strongly inhibited by spermine and heparin. Spermidine is slightly stimulatory at low concentrations but inhibitory at high concentrations. High concentrations of putrescine also inhibit the kinase activity, but not to the extent observed with the other polyamines. Both spermine and spermidine appear to enhance the kinase activity at low Mg2+ concentrations. The result suggests that these polyamines could partially replace Mg2+ for kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1588237320,"Escherichia coli NADPH-sulfite reductase can be dissociated into an oligomeric flavoprotein and a monomeric hemoprotein (HP) subunit in 4 M urea. HP catalyzes stoichiometric 6-electron reductions of SO32- (to S2-) and of NO2-, as well as 2-electron reduction of NH2OH, with reduced methyl viologen (MV+) as reductant. While Vmax values are highest with the nitrogenous substrates, Km for SO32- is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less than the Km for NO2- or NH2OH. EPR spectroscopic and chemical analyses show that HP contains one siroheme and one Fe4S4 center per polypeptide. The heme is in the high spin Fe3+ state in HP as isolated. Near-quantitative reduction of the Fe4S4 center to a state yielding a g = 1.94 type of EPR spectrum by S2O42- and/or MV+ could be achieved if HP was converted to either the CN- or CO complex or treated with 80% dimethyl sulfoxide. HP binds one SO32- or CN- per peptide. Binding of these ligands, as well as CO, appears to be mutually exclusive and to involve the heme. The heme Fe3+/Fe2+ potential is shifted from -340 mV in the free HP to -155 mV in the HP-CN- complex. The potential of the Fe4S4 center is approximately 70 mV more negative in the CN- as opposed to the CO-ligated HP (-420 mV), a result which indicates the presence of heme-Fe4S4-ligand interaction in the HP complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1510800235,"We have identified a tyrosine kinase activity present in tumors which were raised in rats by subcutaneous injection of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed rat cells (SR-NRK). This kinase phosphorylates tyrosine on the heavy chain of IgG from tumor-bearing rabbit (TBR) sera specific for the src gene product, pp60src. Using TBR-IgG phosphorylation as an assay, we have purified this kinase over 7200-fold. The purification procedure involves detergent extraction of tumors followed by sequential column chromatography on hydroxylapatite, DEAE-Sephacel, oligodeoxyadenosine-cellulose, an affinity column prepared from TBR-sera, and Sephacryl S-200. The IgG kinase activity behaves as a molecule of apparent Mr = 54,000 on Sephacryl S-200 molecular sieve chromatography. Analysis of the Sephacryl fractions by SDS-PAGE indicates that a major Coomassie blue-stained band with an apparent Mr = 54,000 (p54), co-elutes with the peak of kinase activity. From 600 g of tumors, approximately 200 micrograms of p54 are obtained. We have four types of evidence which show that p54 is related to pp60src. 1) Purified p54 is capable of undergoing endogenous phosphorylation in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP producing a 32P-labeled pp54 polypeptide which is specifically immunoprecipitated by TBR-sera and contains only phosphotyrosine. 2) Purified p54 competes with 32P-labeled pp60src for binding to TBR-IgG, indicating a degree of purification over starting material which agrees very well with the results obtained by the IgG kinase assay. 3) V8 protease digestion of pp60src and p54 suggests that they share a common 26,000 fragment. 4) Antibodies to partially purified p54 specifically precipitate pp60src from Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598759779,"The distribution of dolichol and/or dolichol esters in subcellular fractions prepared from a rat liver homogenate has been investigated. After saponification of the various fractions dolichol was isolated and quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography in three systems. The degree of purity of the subcellular preparations was examined by marker enzymes and by electron microscopy. Using differential centrifugation it was found that the level of dolichol was highest in the mitochondria-lysosome fraction. Upon further resolution of this fraction by sucrose density centrifugation it was found that the majority of the dolichol was associated with the lysosome-rich fraction. In contrast, the mitochondrial fraction had only a low level of dolichol. This novel observation was confirmed by the finding that dolichol was greatly enriched in a highly purified lysosome fraction preparations isolated by Metrizamide density centrifugation. The enrichment of dolichol in this purified preparation paralleled the observed enrichment of the lysosomal enzyme activity in this fraction. All of these data suggest that the majority of cellular dolichol and/or dolichol esters is localized in the lysosome fraction. The significance of this finding in relation to the metabolism of dolichol is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2075310196,"Calcium ions enter and accumulate during depolarization of some cells, activating a potassium current, IK(Ca), that depends on the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium ions, [Ca]i. However, elevation of [Ca]i can depress IK(Ca) elicited by a subsequent membrane depolarization. The depression of IK(Ca) is ascribed here to a [Ca]i-mediated inactivation of the voltage-gated calcium conductance, which causes a net reduction in calcium ions available for the activation of IK(Ca). This suggests that other processes dependent on gated calcium entry may also be depressed by small background elevations in cytosolic free calcium ions."
https://openalex.org/W1520391214,"The phosphorylation of a 55,000-dalton protein (Protein IIIb) present in mammalian brain was previously shown to be increased by depolarizing agents in the presence of calcium, by cyclic nucleotides, and by appropriate neurotransmitters. We now report that Protein IIIb has been purified 660-fold to near homogeneity and partially characterized. The hydrodynamic properties of the purified protein indicate that it exists as an elongated monomer. cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the incorporation of 0.82 mol of phosphate into serine/mol of protein. The protein is heterogeneous in isoelectric focusing, exhibiting multiple forms with isoelectric points ranging in pH from 6.6 to 7.3."
https://openalex.org/W125565797,"C6 glial tumor cells exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) possessed lowered cAMP content, reduced ability to accumulate cAMP in response to norepinephrine or cholera toxin, and a 3-fold increase in the concentration of norepinephrine producing 50% of the maximal rate of cAMP accumulation. Detectable effects on cAMP accumulation occurred within 10 min of exposure to PMA, and prominent effects by 2 h. PMA similarly affected cells pretreated with cycloheximide. In contrast, Ca2+-depleted preparations of control and PMA-treated cells accumulated cAMP identically in response to norepinephrine or cholera toxin. Ca2+ restoration, which increased the rate of cAMP accumulation in control cells severalfold, did not enhance cAMP accumulation in PMA-treated cells. Neither high catecholamine nor high extracellular Ca2+ concentrations reversed the suppression of cAMP accumulation by PMA. Trifluoperazine, which inhibited the Ca2+-dependent component of norepinephrine-stimulated cAMP accumulation in control cells, did not significantly reduce norepinephrine-stimulated cAMP accumulation in PMA-treated cells. Cell free preparations of control and PMA-treated cultures did not differ significantly in calmodulin content or in Ca2+-stimulated adenylate cyclase, Ca2+-dependent cAMP phosphodiesterase, and (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activities. The Ca2+ content, however, of intact cells decreased with time of PMA treatment. Within minutes after exposure to PMA, the ability of Ca2+-depleted cells to take up 45Ca was significantly reduced. Both 45Ca uptake and Ca2+-dependent cAMP accumulation were reduced over the same PMA concentration range."
https://openalex.org/W2148066749,"To define the human homolog (or homologs) of transforming sequences (v-fes gene) common to Gardner (GA) and Snyder Theilen (ST) isolates of feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), a representative library of human lung carcinoma DNA in a cosmid vector system was constructed. Three cosmid clones were isolated containing GA/ST FeSV v-fes homologous cellular sequences, within 32- to 42-kilobase cellular inserts representing 56 kilobases of contiguous human cellular DNA. Sequences both homologous to, and colinear with, GA or ST FeSV v-fes are distributed discontinuously over a region of up to 9.5 kilobases and contain a minimum of three regions of nonhomology representing probable introns. A thymidine kinase selection system was used to show that, upon transfection to RAT-2 cells, the human c-fes sequence lacked detectable transforming activity."
https://openalex.org/W1591210776,"We have studied the binding of liposomes containing dinitrophenylated lipid to rat basophil leukemia cells armed with monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl IgE. The liposomes were either fluid at 37 degrees C (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine or an equimolar binary mixture dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol) or solid (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, or dibehanoylphosphatidylcholine). We have also studied the immune mediated degranulation of these cells induced by the above lipid membrane targets. In some cases both studies were carried out with liposomes containing various surface densities of lipid haptens. From these studies we conclude that freely mobile nonaggregated lipid haptens in bilayer membrane targets can trigger efficient serotonin release from rat basophil leukemia cells in the presence of specific antihapten IgE. Solid target membranes are also effective as stimulators of serotonin release. The release of serotonin depends strongly on the surface density of lipid haptens over a narrow range of surface densities. These studies with lipid membrane targets having well defined physical properties indicate the need for generalized molecular models of receptor-mediated cell triggering."

https://openalex.org/W1504174509,"Abstract We have identified the nucleotide at which transcription initiates on the yeast mitochondrial small (14 S) rRNA gene by sequencing of RNA labeled at the 5' initiating triphosphate with vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase [alpha-32P]GTP (in vitro capping reaction). Initiation occurs within the stem of a 12-base palindromic repeat. The initiation sequence has homology with the large (21 S) ribosomal RNA initiation sequence that has been previously determined. We have also sequenced the 5' and 3' ends of the mature 14 S rRNA after labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase, respectively. These sequences demonstrate that about 80 nucleotides are cleaved from the 5' end of a precursor to produce the mature 14 S rRNA. This cleavage is imprecise in that the processing occurs at one of five adjacent nucleotides 77 to 81 nucleotides downstream from the 5' initiation site. The 3' ends of this precursor and the mature 14 S rRNA are unique and identical."

https://openalex.org/W1576786511,"RNA capping by partially purified HeLa cell GTP:RNA guanylyltransferase has been shown to occur in the following sequence of two partial reactions involving a covalent protein-guanylate intermediate: (i) E(P68) + GTP in equilibrium E(P68-GMP) + PPi (ii) E(P68-GMP) + ppRNA in equilibrium GpppRNA + E(P68) Initially, the enzyme reacts with GTP in the absence of an RNA cap acceptor to form a covalent protein-guanylate complex. This complex consists of a GMP residue linked via a phosphoamide bond to a Mr = 68,000 protein. The enzyme then transfers the guanylate residue from the Mr = 68,000 polypeptide to the 5' end of diphosphate-terminated poly(a) to yield the capped derivative GpppA(pA)n. Both partial reactions have been shown to be reversible. In the reverse of Reaction i, E(P68--GMP) reacts with PPi to regenerate GTP. In the reverse of Reaction ii, the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the 5'-GMP from capped RNA to the Mr = 68,000 protein to form protein-guanylate complex. A divalent cation is required for both partial reactions. The Mr = 68,000 protein is presumed to be a subunit of the HeLa guanylyltransferase. This interpretation is consistent with the sedimentation coefficient of 4.2 S of the native enzyme. Preliminary studies of RNA guanylyltransferase from mouse myeloma tumors suggest a similar mechanism of transguanylylation involving a Mr = 68,000 protein-guanylate complex. These data, in conjunction with previous studies of vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase (Shuman, S., and Hurwitz, J. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 187-191) suggests that covalent GMP-enzyme intermediates may be a general feature of the RNA capping reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1525304849,"Corneal endothelial cells in culture synthesize basement membrane collagen and secrete it into the medium. This collagen sediments faster than interstitial collagen by velocity sedimentation and is disulfide-bonded. After reduction, two biochemically distinct chains can be determined by cyanogen bromide peptide mapping. These chains migrate close to each other and immediately below beta 12(I) components on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Treatment with pepsin gives rise to a major band which still retains interchain disulfide bonds and which will not convert to components with the mobility of interstitial alpha chain by reduction. However, an alpha chain and three minor collagenase-sensitive and pepsin-resistant peptides are generated if the molecule is reduced and alkylated under nondenaturing conditions prior to pepsin treatment. When collagen which accumulates in the media over a long period of time is compared to the newly synthesized molecules, there is an apparent differential resistance to limited pepsin treatment. However, the products which are generated in both cases share electrophoretic identity."
https://openalex.org/W1553299351,"Rotational diffusion of cytochrome oxidase in the inner membrane of rat liver mitochondria was measured by detecting the decay of absorption anisotropy after photolysis of the heme a3.CO complex by a vertically polarized laser flash. As in previous experiments with beef heart mitochondria (Kawato, S., Sigel, E., Carafoli, E., and Cherry, R. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5508-5510), co-existence of rotating cytochrome oxidase (mean rotational relaxation time, phi, of 700 to 1400 microseconds) and immobilized cytochrome oxidase (phi greater than 20 ms) was observed in mitochondria and mitoplasts. The effect of lipid/protein ratio by weight (L/P) on the relative proportions of mobile and immobile cytochrome oxidase was investigated following the fusion of soybean phospholipid vesicles with mitoplasts. The fusion procedure yielded four separate fractions upon sucrose density gradient centrifugation with L/P as follows: 0.3 in Pellet, 0.7 in Band 3, 1.5 in Band 2, and 3.0 in Band 1. The percentage of rotationally mobile cytochrome oxidase (phi = 700 to 1000 microseconds) in each of the different bands was found to be 16% in Pellet, 25% in Band 3, 47% in Band 2, and 76% in Band 1 at 37 degrees C. The dependence of the amount of mobile cytochrome oxidase on L/P indicates that the fraction of aggregated protein progressively decreases with decreasing concentration of proteins in the membrane. Thus, the large immobile fraction of cytochrome oxidase in mitochondrial inner membranes can be explained by nonspecific protein aggregation which is a consequence of the low L/P. The decrease in the mobile fraction in Pellet compared with mitoplasts was shown to be due to the pH 6.5 incubation used for fusion."

https://openalex.org/W1517876062,"The molecular action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) is thought to involve its localization within the nucleus of target cells, a process mediated by intracellular receptors. This report probes both the association between chick intestinal 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors and purified homologous nuclei and the interaction between this receptor and nucleic acids. 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors bound to purified nuclei in a apparently saturable manner (Kd = 2.2-4.8 X 10(-10) M) under conditions of intermediate ionic strength and constant protein concentration. Nuclear binding was hormone-dependent; whereas receptor-hormone complex (Rs) binds to nuclei under the ionic conditions employed here (greater than 70%), hormone-free (R0) receptors do not bind (less than 10%). Binding was localized to the nuclear chromatin fraction and was extremely sensitive to KCl concentration both in the incubation medium and during postincubation treatment of nuclei. The interaction appeared to be temperature-independent, suggesting the lack of a classic activation event characteristic of most steroid receptors. Partial digestion of intestinal nuclei with DNase I eliminated subsequent receptor binding by greater than 95%, pointing to the involvement of DNA in the binding interaction. In turn, receptors were found to bind to both DNA and RNA, a characteristic independent of receptor aggregation, but sensitive to disruption with increasing ionic strength buffers. Elution of both Rs and R0 from DNA appeared identical (0.28 M KCl), whereas the strength of interaction with RNA was much less (0.12 M KCl). Thus, while there appeared to be a fundamental difference between R0 and Rs, such that only the binding of receptor-hormone complex to nuclei was allowed under the conditions employed here, this characteristic was not observed during DNA binding. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that the in vivo interaction between 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor and nuclei involves DNA and that this nuclear constituent may be the ultimate site of action of this unique sterol hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1568987190,"The kinetics of oxygen consumption and (Na+,K+)-ATPase-mediated K+ transport was examined by reintroducing K+ into a K+-depleted suspension of renal tubules. In the presence of the substrates glucose, lactate, and alanine, a K+/O2 ratio of 10.4 +/- 0.2 was obtained, and the apparent K1/2 for K+ transport with respect to external K+ concentration was 0.9 mM. Supplementation of the substrates with the short chain fatty acid, butyric, had a 3-fold effect on the kinetic parameters examined: 1) the quantity of (Na+,K+)-ATPase-mediated ion transport per oxygen consumed fell by 17 +/- 2%; 2) the maximum rate of K+ transport increased by nearly 50%; and 3) the apparent K1/2 for transport with respect to external K+ concentration rose to 1.5 mM. These results indicate that despite decreasing the quantity of ATP produced per oxygen consumed, short chain fatty acids are able to increase the overall production of ATP during periods of high metabolic demand. The coupling between the two major metabolic processes of the renal cell, (Na+,K+)-ATPase-mediated ion transport and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, is addressed in the context of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1518944769,"Glucose bisphosphate phosphatase has been partially purified from the cytosol of mouse brain. Enzyme activity required Mg2+ and a heat-stable cofactor. The activator was present in boiled extracts of mouse brain mitochondrial-nuclear fraction, of red blood cells, or of rabbit muscle. The chemical properties of the activator are consistent with its identification as inosine monophosphate (IMP), including its mobility in a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system capable of resolving all of the biologically important mononucleotides. A large number of other biologically important compounds were not effective, including AMP, cAMP, cGMP, and UMP, GMP, purified by HPLC, (50 or 74 microM), gave a rate about 35% of that obtained with IMP (5 microM). The enzyme was separated completely from phosphoglucomutase and significantly from glucose bisphosphate synthase. The products of the reaction are glucose-P and Pi. Fructose bisphosphate at 500 microM inhibited only 40% in the presence of 20 microM glucose bisphosphate. The activation by IMP follows hyperbolic kinetics with an apparent Ka of 5 microM in the presence of 12 microM glucose bisphosphate. The apparent Km of glucose bisphosphate was 10 microM in the presence of 50 microM IMP. There was no inhibition by 5 or 50 microM AMP or ADP. The possible regulatory importance of glucose bisphosphate in carbohydrate metabolism and the significance of the regulation of the phosphatase by the nucleotide are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1565003755,"We have used two methods to detect specific transcription of the chicken alpha 2 (type I) collagen gene in cell-free extracts derived from Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts. The first method is a modification of the S1 nuclease mapping procedure which utilizes a DNA probe labeled with 32P at the 5' end of the HindIII linker originally used to clone the collagen promoter region into PBR322. The probe distinguishes newly made, specific RNA from endogenous RNA and nonspecific transcripts. Using this procedure we have found that chicken whole cell extracts support accurate initiation of transcription of the chicken alpha 2 (type I) collagen DNA template. Addition of either creatine phosphate, GTP, or UTP to concentrations of approximately 3 to 5 mM was found to stimulate RNA polymerase II transcription by 5- to 10-fold. The second method employs an avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase-catalyzed primary extension procedure, rendered in vitro-specific by use of a pBR322 fragment as primer. These two techniques should be useful for analyzing specific transcription in other types of cell-free extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1481428268,"Polyoma empty capsids and DNA interact in a cell-free system to form a polyoma-like particle (PLP). The particle is stable in high concentrations of salt and contains a DNA fragment that is protected by the capsid from the action of DNase I. The DNA extracted from PLP is heterogeneous in size. It has a mean molecular weight of 1.2 x 10(6) with a standard deviation of +/- 0.5 x 10(6). Analysis of PLP DNA with restriction endonucleases and the Southern blot technique reveals that a specific primary sequence is not required for PLP formation. Either linear, circular, or supercoiled polyoma DNA, as well as single-stranded DNA, rRNA, and the synthetic homopolymers poly(dA) . poly(dT) and poly(dG) . poly(dC) can be used for PLP formation. It is concluded that polyoma empty capsids can be used to bind and encapsidate nucleic acids differing in their primary, secondary, and superhelical tertiary structure to form, in vitro, stable polyoma-like particles."
https://openalex.org/W1520583645,"We have identified transcripts with sequence homology to the var1 region on yeast mtDNA. In wild type, and in cytoplasmic petite strains retaining the var1 region, we detect four RNA species, 19 S, 16 S, 14 S, and 13 S, which hybridize to var1 DNA probes. The 16 S RNA is by far the most abundant of these RNAs in wild type cells. We also observe hybridization of the 15 S rRNA and a 10 S RNA species to var1 DNA probes. This hybridization is most likely due to the presence in these RNAs of a GC-rich cluster which has near perfect sequence homology to a GC-rich cluster in the var1 region. We find that the 16 S RNA, estimated to be 2000 to 2100 nucleotides long, varies in size in direct correspondence with the size of var1 polypeptide; it is about 100 nucleotides longer in strains with the var1 (44,000) allele than in strains with var1 (40,000). The amount of the 16 S RNA also varies in correspondence with the amount of var1 polypeptide made; it is increased in an oxi-3 mit- strain (CAD245) which makes about 10 times more var1 protein than wild type, and is barely detected in PZ200, a strain with very low levels of mitochondrial protein synthesis harboring two mutations within var1. We have purified the 16 S RNA following chromatography over oligo(dT) cellulose columns. When the RNA is end-labeled and hybridized to a HincII digest of wild type mtDNA, we observe hybridization only to the fragment containing the entire var1 region, HincII fragment 10."
https://openalex.org/W1554720878,"Gene activity in the development of phage SPO1 is transcriptionally regulated. Early viral genes are transcribed by the major vegetative cell RNA polymerase (E. sigma). Middle viral genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase core (E) bearing the SPO1 gene 28 protein (gp28) instead of sigma. This paper deals with the competitive interactions of sigma and gp28 with E which must, at least in part, be involved in the ability of viral middle gene expression to succeed early gene expression. An in vitro assay has been developed for determining the proportions of early (E. sigma) and SPO1 middle (E.gp28) Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase in mixtures. The assay, which is based on the transcription of two well studied SPO1 restriction fragments followed by gel electrophoresis and quantitation of the E. sigma and E.gp28 transcription products, has been used to study the interactions of sigma and gp28 with RNA polymerase core. These subunits are found to be capable of competitively excluding each other. The binding competition is sensitive to ionic strength, with sigma being more effective below 0.2 total ionic strength and gp28 being more effective at higher values. The outcome of competition is also dependent on the order of addition of subunits and the reconstitution kinetics have been studied. The subunit competition is rather insensitive, particularly at higher ionic strength, to temperature. Gp28 can convert E. sigma to E.gp28 but the reverse reaction occurs much less efficiently. The B. subtilis delta protein biases the sigma-gp28 competition in favor of the sigma subunit. the implications of these results for the physiological transition of transcriptional specificity during SPO1 development are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1486334076,"The cell-free translation of genome RNA from Rous sarcoma virus was examined following hybridization to selected fragments of viral DNA. Single-stranded fragments, generated by t-RNATrp primed transcription of 70 S RNA from the Schmidt-Ruppin D strain, were isolated and purified by electrophoresis. These included DNA complementary to the 5'-terminal 101 nucleotides (DNA100) of virion 38 S RNA and a collection of prematurely terminated transcripts which lack the complement to the extreme 5'-terminal 7-20 nucleotides (DNA less than 100). In addition, DNA encompassing the viral leader sequences was purified from a cloned copy of proviral DNA. Under hybrid-arrested translation conditions, the leader DNA as well as DNA100 inhibited translation of all protein products generated from the 70 S RNA, while hybridization to the shorter transcripts (DNA less than 100) did not affect in vitro protein synthesis. All single-stranded DNAs were shown to hybridize with equal efficiency to viral RNA under hybrid-arrested translation conditions and inhibition of protein synthesis by DNA100 was concentration-dependent. These results document the participation of noncoding leader RNA in Rous sarcoma virus protein synthesis and demonstrate that a free, single-stranded 5' terminus is necessary for cell free translation of 70 S RNA."
