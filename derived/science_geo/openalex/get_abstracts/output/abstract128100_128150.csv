https://openalex.org/W2134153749,"The 4,639,221–base pair sequence of Escherichia coli K-12 is presented. Of 4288 protein-coding genes annotated, 38 percent have no attributed function. Comparison with five other sequenced microbes reveals ubiquitous as well as narrowly distributed gene families; many families of similar genes within E. coli are also evident. The largest family of paralogous proteins contains 80 ABC transporters. The genome as a whole is strikingly organized with respect to the local direction of replication; guanines, oligonucleotides possibly related to replication and recombination, and most genes are so oriented. The genome also contains insertion sequence (IS) elements, phage remnants, and many other patches of unusual composition indicating genome plasticity through horizontal transfer."
https://openalex.org/W4212936275,"The transactivation properties of the two estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, were examined with different ligands in the context of an estrogen response element and an AP1 element. ERα and ERβ were shown to signal in opposite ways when complexed with the natural hormone estradiol from an AP1 site: with ERα, 17β-estradiol activated transcription, whereas with ERβ, 17β-estradiol inhibited transcription. Moreover, the antiestrogens tamoxifen, raloxifene, and Imperial Chemical Industries 164384 were potent transcriptional activators with ERβ at an AP1 site. Thus, the two ERs signal in different ways depending on ligand and response element. This suggests that ERα and ERβ may play different roles in gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2076314401,"Human Cdc25C is a dual-specificity protein phosphatase that controls entry into mitosis by dephosphorylating the protein kinase Cdc2. Throughout interphase, but not in mitosis, Cdc25C was phosphorylated on serine-216 and bound to members of the highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed family of 14-3-3 proteins. A mutation preventing phosphorylation of serine-216 abrogated 14-3-3 binding. Conditional overexpression of this mutant perturbed mitotic timing and allowed cells to escape the G2 checkpoint arrest induced by either unreplicated DNA or radiation-induced damage. Chk1, a fission yeast kinase involved in the DNA damage checkpoint response, phosphorylated Cdc25C in vitro on serine-216. These results indicate that serine-216 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding negatively regulate Cdc25C and identify Cdc25C as a potential target of checkpoint control in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2105592350,"In response to DNA damage, mammalian cells prevent cell cycle progression through the control of critical cell cycle regulators. A human gene was identified that encodes the protein Chk1, a homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Chk1 protein kinase, which is required for the DNA damage checkpoint. Human Chk1 protein was modified in response to DNA damage. In vitro Chk1 bound to and phosphorylated the dual-specificity protein phosphatases Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C, which control cell cycle transitions by dephosphorylating cyclin-dependent kinases. Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25C on serine-216. As shown in an accompanying paper by Peng et al. in this issue, serine-216 phosphorylation creates a binding site for 14-3-3 protein and inhibits function of the phosphatase. These results suggest a model whereby in response to DNA damage, Chk1 phosphorylates and inhibits Cdc25C, thus preventing activation of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex and mitotic entry."
https://openalex.org/W2015556634,"PSD-95 is a component of postsynaptic densities in central synapses. It contains three PDZ domains that localize N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor subunit 2 (NMDA2 receptor) and K + channels to synapses. In mouse forebrain, PSD-95 bound to the cytoplasmic COOH-termini of neuroligins, which are neuronal cell adhesion molecules that interact with β-neurexins and form intercellular junctions. Neuroligins bind to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95, whereas NMDA2 receptors and K + channels interact with the first and second PDZ domains. Thus different PDZ domains of PSD-95 are specialized for distinct functions. PSD-95 may recruit ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors to intercellular junctions formed between neurons by neuroligins and β-neurexins."
https://openalex.org/W2172164880,"DNA in amounts representative of hundreds of eukaryotic genomes was extended on silanized surfaces by dynamic molecular combing. The precise measurement of hybridized DNA probes was achieved directly without requiring normalization. This approach was validated with the high-resolution mapping of cosmid contigs on a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) within yeast genomic DNA. It was extended to human genomic DNA for precise measurements ranging from 7 to 150 kilobases, of gaps within a contig, and of microdeletions in the tuberous sclerosis 2 gene on patients' DNA. The simplicity, reproducibility, and precision of this approach makes it a powerful tool for a variety of genomic studies."
https://openalex.org/W1969308341,"Arrest of the cell cycle at the G 2 checkpoint, induced by DNA damage, requires inhibitory phosphorylation of the kinase Cdc2 in both fission yeast and human cells. The kinase Wee1 and the phosphatase Cdc25, which regulate Cdc2 phosphorylation, were evaluated as targets of Chk1, a kinase essential for the checkpoint. Fission yeast cdc2-3w Δcdc25 cells, which express activated Cdc2 and lack Cdc25, were responsive to Wee1 but insensitive to Chk1 and irradiation. Expression of large amounts of Chk1 produced the same phenotype as did loss of the cdc25 gene in cdc2-3w cells. Cdc25 associated with Chk1 in vivo and was phosphorylated when copurified in Chk1 complexes. These findings identify Cdc25, but not Wee1, as a target of the DNA damage checkpoint."

Biochemical analyses demonstrate that phytochrome is an ancient molecule that evolved from a more compact light sensor in cyanobacteria. The cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 is a light-regulated histidine kinase that mediates red, far-red reversible phosphorylation of a small response regulator, Rcp1 (response regulator for cyanobacterial phytochrome), encoded by the adjacent gene, thus implicating protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation in the initial step of light signal transduction by phytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W1988367469,"Angiostatin is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor which has been identified as an internal fragment of plasminogen that includes its first four kringle modules. We have recently demonstrated that the anti-endothelial cell proliferative activity of angiostatin is also displayed by the first three kringle structures of plasminogen and marginally so by kringle 4 (Cao, Y., Ji, R.-W., Davidson, D., Schaller, J., Marti, D., Sohndel, S., McCance, S. G., O'Reilly, M. S., Llinás, M., and Folkman, J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 29461–29467). We now report that the kringle 5 fragment of human plasminogen is a specific inhibitor for endothelial cell proliferation. Kringle 5 obtained as a proteolytic fragment of human plasminogen displays potent inhibitory effect on bovine capillary endothelial cells with a half-maximal concentration (ED50) of approximately 50 nm. Thus, kringle 5 would appear to be more potent than angiostatin on inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated capillary endothelial cell proliferation. Appropriately folded recombinant mouse kringle 5 protein, expressed inEscherichia coli, exhibits a comparable inhibitory effect as the proteolytic kringle 5 fragment. Thus, kringle 5 domain of human plasminogen is a novel endothelial inhibitor that is sufficiently potent to block the growth factor-stimulated endothelial cell growth.

Angiogenesis is the process of formation of capillaries that sprout from existing blood vessels (1Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Blood capillaries are primarily composed of endothelial cells, which are usually quiescent in the adult mammal under physiological conditions (2Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar). In response to appropriate stimuli, quiescent endothelial cells can degrade the surrounding basement membrane, change their morphology, proliferate, migrate, form new lumen, and sprout microtubes (3Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex process implies the presence of multiple controls, which can be turned on and off within a short period. Outgrowth of new blood vessels under pathological conditions can lead to development and progression of diseases such as tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, tissue and organ malformation, and cardiovascular disorders (4Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar). The switch of angiogenesis phenotype depends upon the net balance between angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors, i.e.up-regulation of angiogenic factors and down-regulation of angiogenic suppressors (4Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar, 5Cao Y. Chen C. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M. Folkman J. J. Exp.

For example, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; Pgn, plasminogen; K, kringle; AMCHA,trans-aminomethylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; bFGF, basic FGF; BCE cells, bovine capillary endothelial cells. and vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor are most commonly overexpressed angiogenic stimulators found in tumors (6Senger D.R.

Tumors may express one or more of these angiogenic peptides that can synergistically stimulate tumor angiogenesis and promote tumor growth (12Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, an angiogenesis inhibitor of thrombospondin-1 has been found to be down-regulated in many tumors with the mutated p53 tumor suppressor gene (13Dameron k.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Science. 1994; 265: 1582-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Within the family of angiogenesis inhibitors, angiostatin, an endothelial cell-specific inhibitor, has been demonstrated to be the most potent (14O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19467-29461Google Scholar). Angiostatin contains the first four triple disulfide-linked loops of plasminogen (Pgn) known as kringle domains. Angiostatin isolated from serum and urine of tumor-bearing mice, or the corresponding fragment of human Pgn compatible to murine angiostatin, impairs both primary and metastatic tumor growth without toxicity (14O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar,15O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Chen C. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). In vitro, it specifically inhibits endothelial cell growth, but not proliferation of other cell types, including tumor cells (14O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M.

O'Reilly M.S. Llinás M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19467-29461Google Scholar). In vivo, angiostatin suppresses neovascularization in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay and in the mouse corneal assay (14O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M.

Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Smaller fragments of angiostatin have been demonstrated to display differential effects on suppression of endothelial cell growth (16Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinás M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19467-29461Google Scholar). For example, the kringle 1 (K1) structure of angiostatin is a potent endothelial inhibitor, whereas kringle 4 (K4) exhibits markedly low inhibitory activity (16Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinás M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19467-29461Google Scholar). In this paper, we report on the anti-endothelial activity of kringle 5 (K5), which, while structurally related to the other four kringles in Pgn, is not present in angiostatin. Intact, NH2-terminal [Glu1]Pgn was purified from outdated and citrated human blood plasma (Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) by affinity chromatography on L-Lys-Sepharose (17Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar), and further purified into two isoforms by L-Lys-Sepharose affinity chromatography with a gradient of the ligand, 6-aminohexanoic acid (18Castellino F.J. Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Pgn was subjected to limited digestion with porcine pancreatic elastase (Nutritional Biochemical Corp.). Further chromatography through L-Lys-Sepharose permitted us to obtain miniPgn (K5+proteinase, Ser441–Asn791) as the flow-through fraction, resolved from the K1–K3 (Tyr80–Val338) and K4 (Val355–Ala440) fragments (19Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Prog. Chem. Fibrinolysis Thrombolysis. 1978; 3: 191-209Google Scholar). The flow-through fraction was lyophilized, dialyzed against doubly distilled water, and again lyophilized. MiniPgn was digested with porcine stomach mucous pepsin (Sigma) to obtain the K5 fragment (Val449(Pro452)–Phe547), as reported (20Thewes T. Ramesh V. Simplaceanu E.L. Llinás M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 254-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) except that the K5-specific ligandtrans-aminomethylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid (AMCHA; Sigma) was added to the incubation mixture in 5-fold excess. The reaction mixture was incubated for 75 min at 25 °C with shaking. After dissolving the K5 mixture in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, K5 was isolated by column chromatography on Sephadex G-75 SF. The intact K5 complexed with AMCHA composes the largest fraction. K5 was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and was desalted by gel filtration through a G-50 Sephadex column. To remove AMCHA, K5 was dialyzed against doubly distilled water, pH 3.0, for 48 h and lyophilized. The final K5 preparation was stored as a dry powder. Pepsin digestion in the presence of AMCHA raised the yield from 10% (20Thewes T. Ramesh V. Simplaceanu E.L. Llinás M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 254-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to greater than 50%. K5 was identified via1H NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz using a Bruker WM-500 instrument, as reported previously (20Thewes T. Ramesh V. Simplaceanu E.L. Llinás M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 254-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal sequence analyses indicated that the obtained K5 contains a 40:60% Asp/Asn heterogeneity at site 452 of the [Glu1]Pgn sequence. Alternatively, human K5 was prepared from the digestion of [Lys78]Pgn (Abbott Laboratories) with porcine elastase (Sigma). Briefly, 1.5 mg of elastase was incubated with 200 mg of [Lys78]Pgn in 5–50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated overnight at room temperature. The mixture was dialyzed for 6 h against 4 liters of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, followed by changing fresh buffer overnight and lyophilized. The cleaved Pgn was applied a 1.0 cm × 6.5-cm Bio-Rad Mono-S column equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0). The kringle portions, K4, K5, K1–K3, and K1–K4, were eluted at 1.0 ml/min with step gradients of 0–20%, 20–50%, 50–70%, and 70–100% of 20 mm NaOAc, 1 m KCl, pH 5.0, with 5 min of flow at constant concentration at the end of each step. K5 was eluted within 5 min when the following buffer had reached to 50%. The peak of K5 was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The purity of K5 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified K5 was confirmed by NH2-terminal sequencing. Human angiostatin was prepared by digestion of human Pgn with porcine elastase and purified by affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose 4B as described previously (16Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinás M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19467-29461Google Scholar). The cDNA coding for K5 of mouse Pgn was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the mouse plasminogen cDNA as a template and two oligonucleotide primers (5′-end primer of aagcggatccgagcgactctgagacag and 3′-end primer of aagcggatccttaaaaggatgatgctgctgatgca), corresponding to amino acid residues 476–481 and 558–563 of the mouse plasminogen, respectively. At the carboxyl terminus, the K5 cDNA coded a hexahistidine tag. A standard PCR protocol was used (21Cao Y. Technique. 1990; 2: 109-111Google Scholar), and the PCR-amplified cDNA fragment was cloned into the SalI site of an expression vector, PET-22b(+) under T7 promoter (Novagen). Recombinant K5 (rK5) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain Bl 21. rK5 was obtained as a soluble protein from the periplasmic space,i.e. oxidatively refolded. Purification was achieved by chromatography on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column by a standard protocol (Qiaexpress) recommended by the manufacture (Qiagen, Inc.). The purified K5 protein was dialyzed exhaustively with phosphate-buffered saline. Protein concentration was determined according to Hartree (22Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells were isolated as described previously (23Folkman J. Haudenschild C.C. Zetter B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5121-5217Crossref Scopus (617) Google Scholar). BCE cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, 3 ng/ml recombinant human bFGF (Scios Nova, Mountain View, CA). Cells growing in gelatin-coated six-well plates were dispersed in 0.05% trypsin solution and resuspended with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 12,500 cells in 0.5 ml were added to each well of gelatinized wells of 24-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of fresh DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, and samples of K5 in triplicate were added to each well. After 30 min of incubation, bFGF was added to a final concentration of 1 ng/ml. After 72 h of incubation, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in Hematall (Fisher Scientific Inc.) and counted with a Coulter counter. The K5 domain of human Pgn contains 80 amino acid residues. Primary structure alignment shows that K5 displays remarkable sequence identity with K1 (57.5%), K2 (46.25%), K3 (48.75%), and K4 (52.5%), respectively (Fig.1). Similar to K1, K2, and K4, K5 is a lysine-binding kringle of human Pgn. Elsewhere (16Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinás M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19467-29461Google Scholar) we have noticed that K4 contains two sets of positively charged lysine pairs (boxed in Fig. 1), each adjacent to Cys22 and Cys80, respectively. Three-dimensional structure analysis shows that, together with Lys57, these four lysines configure an exposed, cationic cluster in K4 (24Cox M. Schaller J. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Rickli E. Llinás M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Mulichak A.M. Tulinsky A. Ravichandran K.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10576-10588Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, one may speculate that this constellation of positively charged side chains may be responsible for the negligible activity of K4 vis àvis suppression of endothelial cell proliferation. Interestingly, unlike K4, these Lys residues are absent in the primary structure of K5. A K5-containing fragment was obtained via porcine pepsin digestion of human miniPgn, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.2 A). Alternatively, K5 was also generated by overdigestion of Pgn with elastase (Fig.2 A) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The proteolytic fragments containing K5 were purified by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-75 column, followed by ion-exchange chromatography (20Thewes T. Ramesh V. Simplaceanu E.L. Llinás M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 254-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the purified protein revealed two elastolytic cleavage sites at the NH2 terminus of K5. The first cleavage site was located to the position between Val448 and Val449 (Fig. 2 A) of [Glu1]Pgn. The second site was located three amino acids downstream of the first cleavage position, i.e. between Leu451 and Pro452 (Fig. 2 A). Carboxyl-terminal sequence analysis showed the elastase cleavage site (between Ala544 and Pro545) is located three amino acids upstream of the pepsin cleavage site (between Phe547 and Asp548). SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 A) verifies purity of the K5 fragment isolated via pepsin digestion of miniPgn. In agreement with amino acid sequencing data, two species of protein migrated with molecular masses of 14.9 and 15.7 kDa, representing [Pro452]- and [Val449]K5, respectively (Fig. 3, lane 1). Purity of the sample was verified by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, as published (20Thewes T. Ramesh V. Simplaceanu E.L. Llinás M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 254-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, K5 released by elastolytic cleavage of Pgn was also purified to homogeneity (data not shown).Figure 3SDS-PAGE analysis of K5 preparations. A, human miniPgn was digested with porcine stomach mucous pepsin and K5 was purified by column chromatography on Sephadex G-75 SF, followed by further purification by ion-exchange chromatography. Three micrograms of the purified material was analyzed on a 15% SDS gel under a reducing condition. K5 with molecular mass of 14.9 and 15.7 kDa, representing NH2 termini of Val449 and Pro452 respectively, was purified to homogeneity (lane 1). The molecular size markers are indicated inlane 2. B, the appropriately folded rmK5 protein with molecular mass of 13 kDa was purified to homogeneity as analyzed by a 15% SDS-PAGE under a reducing condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ala563 of mouse Pgn, was expressed in E. coli as a soluble periplasmic form (Fig.2 B) and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 3 B). Under reducing conditions, rmK5 migrated with the expected molecular mass of 13 kDa (Fig. 3 B). Apparently, the molecular weights of proteolytic human K5 (Fig. 3 A, 14.9 or 15.7 kDa) are higher than that of recombinant mouse plasminogen (Fig. 3 B) due to the presence of additional amino acid sequences in both NH2and COOH termini of human K5 (Fig. 2 A). K5 obtained from pepsin digestion of human miniPgn was assayed for its inhibitory activity on BCE cell proliferation stimulated by bFGF (1 ng/ml). The inhibitory effect was determined using ligand-free K5 as well as K5 complexed with AMCHA, a zwitterionic ligand analogue of lysine of comparatively high affinity for K5 (association constantK a ∼ 44 mm−1) (39Menhart N. McCance S.G. Sehl L.C. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8799-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both ligand-free and ligand-bound K5 inhibited BCE cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A), suggesting that the lysine-binding site of K5 is not involved in its inhibitory activity. Likewise, the proteolytic K5 obtained via elastase digestion of Pgn yielded a similar inhibitory effect (not shown). In the presence of K5, the morphology of BCE cells appeared similar to that of control cells. In addition, cell proliferation can be rescued with bFGF stimulation after removal of K5. These results indicate that K5 is not cytotoxic to capillary endothelial cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of K5 would appear to be specific for endothelial cells, as assays on other cell types, such as 3T3 fibroblasts, bovine smooth muscle cells, and murine T241 fibrosarcoma cells failed to show inhibition (data not shown). As is the case for proteolytic human K5, the inhibitory effect of rmK5 on BCE cells occurred in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.4 B). The inhibitory effect on BCE cells was reversible after removal of rmK5 from the culture medium. In addition, the morphological appearance of cells treated with rmK5 was indistinguishable from that of non-treated cells. To study whether the appropriate folding of rmK5 is required for the inhibitory activity, folded rmK5 was reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and assayed on BCE cells. The anti-endothelial proliferation activity was markedly abolished (greater than 80%) after reduction/alkylation (data not shown), suggesting that the formation of appropriate disulfide bridges in rmK5 is essential to maintain its anti-endothelial activity. To direct compare the inhibitory efficacy, human K5, rmK5, and human angiostatin (K1–K4) were assayed on suppression of bFGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation (Fig.5). The concentration of half-maximal inhibition (ED50) for human K5 is about 50 nm,i.e. lower than that for angiostatin (ED50 = 140 nm). The concentration of murine rK5 required to elicit 50% inhibition (ED50 < 20 nm) turned out to be comparable to that of proteolytic human Pgn K5 (Fig. 5). The inhibitory effects of human K5 and rmK5 are also more potent than those of human kringle 1, K2, K3, and K4 (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the Pgn K5 module is a specific inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation. K5 obtained as a proteolytic fragment of human Pgn suppresses the bFGF-stimulated endothelial cell growth with a half-maximal concentration between 50 and 60 nm, which is lower than that of proteolytic human angiostatin (about 140 nm). Similarly, recombinant mouse Pgn K5 elicits a potent inhibitory effect that is comparable to the human proteolytic fragment. Angiostatin contains the first four kringle structures of plasminogen (14O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar). K1 has been characterized as the most potent inhibitory segment of angiostatin on endothelial cell proliferation, whereas fragments containing K4 solely are comparatively inefficient in the suppression of endothelial cell growth (16Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinás M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19467-29461Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment of the kringle domains of human plasminogen reveals that K5 displays the highest sequence identity with K1 (57.5%). Thus, the similarity in the primary structure of K1 and K5 may relate to the potent inhibitory activity of these two kringles on endothelial cell growth. Although K5 also shares a high degree of sequence identity with K4 (52.5%), it lacks two sets of positively charged lysine pairs (adjacent to Cys22 and Cys80, respectively) in K4, which might be connected to the latter's low anti-endothelial cell activity (16Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinás M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19467-29461Google Scholar). As previously discussed (16Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinás M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19467-29461Google Scholar), the potency of angiostatin kringles to inhibit bFGF-stimulated endothelial cell growth does not correlate with their lysine binding affinities. In the case of K5, the growth inhibition experiments in the presence of the K5·AMCHA complex, where the ligand AMCHA is highly selective for the K5 lysine-binding site, yield essentially the same results as those in the presence of ligand-free K5 (Fig. 4 A). This further supports the hypothesis that the kringles' lysine-binding site is unlikely to be responsible for the observed inhibitory effects. Angiostatin was initially isolated from tumors of a murine Lewis lung carcinoma (14O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar). In addition, several different types of human tumors growing in mice have been found to produce angiogenesis inhibitors (26Chen C. Parangi S. Tolentino M. Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4230-4233PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these inhibitors are angiostatin or angiostatin-related molecules remains to be established. A recent study shows that tumors can produce an angiogenesis inhibitor different from angiostatin (27O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fuhai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4263) Google Scholar). Thus, tumors not only overexpress angiogenic factors, but also retain their abilities of production of angiogenesis inhibitors. It is not yet clear how expression of these angiogenesis inhibitors is regulated. It seems that tumor cells do not express angiostatin molecules per se. 2Y. Cao, unpublished data. However, they produce protease(s) that subsequently cleaves circulating Pgn to generate angiostatin (37Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Patrick M. Boggio L. Cundiff D.L. Schnaper H.W. Madison L. Volpert O. Bouck N. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Soff G.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4887-4890PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that protease(s) released by tumor cells is not the only source for generation of angiostatin. Metalloelastase produced by tumor-infiltrating macrophages has been found to be responsible for angiostatin production by a murine Lewis lung carcinoma (38Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, different types of tumors may use different strategies for generation of angiostatin. It appears that the generation of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitorsin vivo from large precursor proteins with distinct functions is a recurrent theme in the inhibition of angiogenesis. A number of angiogenesis inhibitors have been characterized as proteolytic fragments. In addition to angiostatin and K5, examples are endostatin, which is a carboxyl fragment of collagen XVIII, the 16-kDa NH2-terminal fragment of prolactin (28Clapp C. Martial J.A. Guzman R.C. Rentierdelrue F. Weiner R.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), an NH2-terminally truncated fragment of platelet factor 4 (29Gupta S.K. Hassel T.

Pathol. 1985; 120: 327-332PubMed Google Scholar). The parental large molecules, namely Pgn, collagen XVIII, and prolactin, which generate angiostatin, endostatin, and 16-kDa prolactin, respectively, do not suppress angiogenesis (14O'Reilly M.S.

Guzman R.C. Rentierdelrue F. Weiner R.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, proteolytic processing plays critical dual roles in the control of angiogenesis. When angiogenesis is initiated, proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane surrounding endothelial cells is a prerequisite for endothelial cell proliferation. Once new blood vessels have been formed, they may require angiogenic inhibitors, such as the proteolytic fragments mentioned above, to control the overgrowth of blood vessels. Further studies are required to elucidate the regulation of protease activity and the substrate specificity. The molecular mechanisms of how angiostatin and its related kringle fragments specifically suppress neovascularization remain uncharacterized. It may be speculated that angiostatin could interact with a specific receptor that is exclusively expressed in the proliferating endothelial cell compartment. However, the concentrations of angiostatin to reach effective suppression of endothelial cell proliferation seem too high to interact with cell surface sensitive receptors. The endothelial specific receptor may be a cell adhesion molecule such as αvβ3 and αvβ5 (35Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 36Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), thus blocking the integrin-mediated signals for endothelial cell proliferation. Alternatively, angiostatin may block the signal pathways stimulated by angiogenic factors of vascular endothelial growth factor and FGF. Whatever the underlying mechanism might be, angiostatin and its related fragments have been shown to be one of the most potent endogenous molecules for suppression of angiogenesis and tumor growth.

https://openalex.org/W1981079102,"The p53 tumor suppressor is found to be mutated and abundant in a wide variety of tumors. Within tumors showing rapid growth, the Type II isoform of hexokinase is also highly expressed to facilitate high rates of glucose catabolism, which in turn promote their rapid proliferation. We previously reported isolation of the proximal promoter of the Type II hexokinase gene from the highly glycolytic hepatoma AS-30D (Mathupala, S. P., Rempel, A., and Pedersen, P. L. (1995) J. Biol.

Co-expression studies showed that p53 overexpression significantly and reproducibly activated the Type II hexokinase promoter. Two functional p53 motifs were identified within this promoter by footprint and gel retardation analyses. Presence of functional p53 response elements on the Type II hexokinase promoter and the positive regulatory effect on the promoter by the mutant p53 indicates that in rapidly growing liver tumors, and perhaps in many other tumors as well, this highly abundant p53 protein plays a role in maintaining a high glycolytic rate. This is the first report of a possible link between loss of cell cycle control in rapidly growing cancer cells and their high glycolytic phenotype.

This is the first report of a possible link between loss of cell cycle control in rapidly growing cancer cells and their high glycolytic phenotype. Mutations within the p53 gene represent one of the most common genetic aberrations in tumorigenesis (1Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C.

Whereas the wild type p53 (wt p53) 1The abbreviations used are: wt, wild-type; mut, mutant; bp, base pair(s); Pu, purine; Py, pyrimidine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. negatively regulates cell growth and division, the mutant forms lack the ability to suppress or control cell cycle progression. It is now generally accepted that the tumor suppressor function of wt p53 is a result of its ability to act as a cell cycle checkpoint protein, thus halting the cell cycle in the G1 phase if and when DNA damage occurs to a normal cell. Considerable evidence has accumulated for regulation of transcription as one of the primary mechanisms of wt p53 action, where the p53 protein binds to a specific motif on gene promoters and thus transactivates the genes to bring about the suppression of cellular transformation (4Farmer G. Bargonetti J. Zhu H. Friedman P. Prywes R. Prives C. Nature. 1992; 358: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 5Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Two repeats of a 10-bp motif PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy have been described as the common DNA binding site of wt p53 (6El-Deiry W.S. Kinzler S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat.

An improved high affinity motif, PuGPuCATGPyCPy, where the G and A at positions 2 and 5, respectively, are critical determinants in p53-DNA binding has been reported also (7Funk W.D. Pak D.T.

Mutant p53 (mut p53) proteins are reported to show a dominant-negative effect by forming oligomeric complexes with the wt p53 prior to DNA binding, which brings about a change in conformation and subsequently a loss of affinity of wt p53 for DNA. However, recent reports (5Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 9Unger T. Nau M.M. Segal S. Minna J.D.

Miller C.W. Chen D.L. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1899-1906PubMed Google Scholar) also suggest that, in addition to this inactivating effect by mut p53, at least in some cases, the mutant forms can even promote the growth of the parental tumor cell and therefore exhibit an oncogenic gain-of-function of their own (15Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. Moore M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 16Hinds P. Finlay C. Levine A.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 739-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This endogenous dominant-oncogenic function is seen more clearly when mut p53 is transfected into p53-deficient cells (15Dittmer D. Pati S.

This contrasts with earlier studies which suggested that mut p53 is unable to bind DNA and transactivate gene transcription (4Farmer G. Bargonetti J. Zhu H. Friedman P. Prywes R. Prives C. Nature. 1992; 358: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 6El-Deiry W.S. Kinzler S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Analogous to the p53 protein, which plays a pivotal role in regulating cell cycle progression at the gene level, hexokinase plays a major role in metabolic regulation, notably in highly glycolytic tumor cells (19Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of hexokinase, in particular the Type II isoform, induces the capacity of tumor cells, at least in part, to catabolize glucose at high rates (20Bustamante E. Morris H.P. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8699-8704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Scott L.J. Pedersen P.L.

This enhanced metabolism not only increases the production of biosynthetic precursors essential for cell growth, but maintains a high rate of ATP production under low oxygen (hypoxic conditions). Therefore, it is interesting to inquire whether there is a relationship between loss of cell cycle control, increased abundance of mutated p53, and Type II hexokinase gene transcription. As described below, p53 motifs are located within the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter, and mutated p53 does interact with the promoter in cancer cells to activate transcription of this key metabolic enzyme. [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. The isolation, sequence, and structure of the Type II hexokinase gene promoter has been reported previously (22Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). pGL-2 vector series (pGL2-Basic, pGL2-Control) and pSV-β-galactosidase control vector were from Promega. Chemiluminescence measurements and mammalian cell transfections were carried out as described previously (22Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

Restriction enzymes, DNA-modifying enzymes, and tissue culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc., or from Sigma. AS-30D hepatoma cells, a model tumor cell line exhibiting a high glycolytic rate (23Weinstein I.B. Orenstein J.M. Gebert R. Kaighn M.E. Stadler U.C. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 253-263PubMed Google Scholar), were propagated in the peritoneal cavity of female Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) exactly as described previously (24Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5702-5706PubMed Google Scholar). For nuclear extract preparation, the cells were purified in RPMI 1640 media, followed by a phosphate-buffered saline wash. Total RNA was isolated from AS-30D hepatoma cells using RNAzol B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Hepatocytes were isolated from non-heparinized female Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) by the collagenase perfusion method (25Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, New York1987: 264-265Google Scholar) with minor modifications as follows. Post-perfusion, the hepatocytes were resuspended in an equal volume of Hepatocyte Wash Medium (4 °C) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Viable hepatocytes were separated by sedimentation and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline prior to the nuclear extract preparation. Nuclear extracts were prepared from hepatoma or hepatocyte nuclei according to the method of Dignam et al. (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C until use. The p53 coding region cDNA of AS-30D hepatoma cells was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR, using oligonucleotides complementary to a reported normal rat liver p53 cDNA sequence (27Hulla J.E. Schneider R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The forward and reverse oligonucleotides were GC GAATTC ATG GAG GAT TCA CAG TCG GAT and CC TCTAGA TCA GTC TGA GTC AGG CCC CAC, respectively. The primers contained an EcoRI site and an XbaI site for cloning purposes at their 5′ termini, respectively. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out using the Superscript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) for first strand cDNA synthesis. PCR amplification was performed in the presence of both Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and Pfu DNA polymerase (Taq Extender, Stratagene) to minimize reading errors. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI-XbaI site of the pUC18 plasmid vector. p53 cDNA was sequenced in both orientations by using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar). For co-transfection studies, the p53 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI-SalI sites of the pCI-Neo mammalian expression vector (Promega Biotech Inc., Madison, WI) using the EcoRI position on the original cloning primer andSalI position of the pUC18 (29Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) multiple cloning site. Orientation and sequence integrity were verified by DNA sequencing in both orientations. The Type II hexokinase promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, transfection conditions, and reporter gene assay method have been described previously (22Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For co-expression studies, 2.5 μg of the p53 expression plasmid was used with 5 μg of the Type II hexokinase promoter-luciferase gene construct, per 25 × 106 AS-30D hepatoma cells. For Western blotting, samples of nuclear extract from hepatocytes or hepatoma were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) membranes. The membranes were probed with an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody specific for the C-terminal region of human p53 (Catalog No. OP03, Oncogene Science) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL System, Amersham). Protein-DNA complexes were allowed to form in 4 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 12% (v/v) glycerol, 85 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 0.04 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. In a volume of 15 μl, the nuclear extract (8–12 μg of protein) was preincubated for 10 min with 0.85 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA at 25 °C. A 96-bp double-stranded probe of the promoter region corresponding to −4259 through −4173 (GCGGTACC … AGATCTGC), end-labeled via methods adapted from Kingston (30Kingston, R. E.

Incubation was continued for 30 min at 25 °C. Samples were then subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in a low ionic strength buffer (7 mm Tris-HCl, 3.5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9) at 12.5 V/cm for 3–4 h at 4 °C. For competition experiments, a competitor unlabeled double-stranded probe was incubated in the binding mixture before the labeled probe was added. DNase I footprint assays were adapted from methods by Kingston (30Kingston, R. E. (1994) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D.

DNA binding reactions were performed in a 35-μl volume of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl) with 2 ng (approximately 500,000 cpm) of DNA template end-labeled by Klenow fill-in reactions (30Kingston, R.

Reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice followed by a 60-s digestion at 25 °C with 0.3 to 5 μl of a freshly diluted DNase I solution (0.05 μg/μl). The digestion reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of stop buffer (1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA). The sample was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. The DNA pellets were dried and resuspended in sequence loading buffer (99% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol), incubated 5 min at 68 °C, and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8.3 murea sequencing gel. The gels were dried and autoradiographed for 1 to 6 h prior to film development. To identify novel cis elements within the Type II hexokinase promoter isolated from AS-30D hepatoma (22Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the 4.3-kilobase pair promoter sequence was analyzed against a transcription factor data base (32Prestridge D.S. CABIOS. 1991; 7: 203-206PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicated the presence of a pair of p53 response elements (Fig.1 A) at −4250 and −4195, in close proximity to a region presently identified as containing numerous other cis elements, including response elements for glucose and insulin (22Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Upon closer examination, it was found that each p53 element was located at the center of a perfect 54-bp direct repeat sequence (−4276 to −4223 and −4222 to −4169, TACCTATGG … TTTTAAAA) (Fig.1 B). The p53 consensus sites located within these repeats, AGGCATGTTC, were also closely similar to a reported high affinity p53 consensus motif (PuGPuCATGPyCPy) identified by combinatorial library screening (7Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2871-2966Crossref Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and by in vitro transcriptional assay (8Thukral S.K. Lu Y. Blain G.C. Harrey T.S. Jacobsen V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5196-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) methods, where the G at the second position and the A at the fifth position were reported to be critical for enhanced affinity toward the p53 oligomer. The Western analyses of the nuclear extracts from hepatocytes and AS-30D hepatoma cells (Fig. 1, C andD) clearly show that the p53 protein is highly abundant in the model hepatoma cell line. On a comparative basis, when similar amounts of total nuclear protein were assayed, a signal for p53 could not be detected for the hepatocyte extract. This result implicates possible mutations within the p53 protein of the hepatoma, as mutations often generate a protein with a longer half-life (33Mukhopadhyay T. Maxwell S.A. Roth J.A. p53 Suppressor Gene. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Crossref Google Scholar). The half-life of wt p53 is known to be between 6 and 20 min, whereas the most common p53 mutants maintain a half-life of 4–12 h (33Mukhopadhyay T. Maxwell S.A. Roth J.A. p53 Suppressor Gene. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Crossref Google Scholar). This results in accumulation of mutated p53 within tumor cells and is clearly detectable by immunochemical techniques. The p53 signal observed for the AS-30D hepatoma extract examined here indicates a similar accumulation of the protein within these cells, suggesting the presence of a mutant p53. To determine whether the p53 protein of AS-30D hepatoma cells exhibit one or more mutations, the transcribed p53 message was subjected to reverse transcriptase-PCR cloning. Analysis of the primary sequence of the cloned p53 from AS-30D hepatoma cells, when compared with the normal rat liver wt p53 sequence (27Hulla J.E. Schneider R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig.2), shows two point mutations, at position 103 (Gly to Ser), and 256 (Glu to Gly). The first mutation at position 103 is located in proximity to the second conserved region of p53, whereas the mutation at position 256 is located on the C-terminal end of the fourth conserved region. When the primary sequence is aligned with the human wt p53 (Fig. 2), the mutations observed for the AS-30D hepatoma are located at positions 105 (Gly) and 258 (Glu) of the human wt p53 sequence, at the periphery of the core DNA binding domain (amino acids 102 to 292) (33Mukhopadhyay T. Maxwell S.A. Roth J.A. p53 Suppressor Gene. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Crossref Google Scholar). However, both mutations, when compared with the most common human p53 point mutations identified so far, lie outside the positions where the mutations result in inactivation of DNA binding ability. Whether the two mutations observed impart a greater stability to p53 in hepatoma cells and whether the mutations confer stronger DNA binding ability remains to be elucidated. It should be noted that both mutations lie outside the transactivating domain of p53 (amino acids 20–42) and the oligomerization domain (amino acids 300–391). Furthermore, the nuclear localization signal motif (33Mukhopadhyay T. Maxwell S.A. Roth J.A. p53 Suppressor Gene. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Crossref Google Scholar) also remains unaffected. A gel mobility shift assay was performed using a double-stranded nucleotide fragment corresponding to the putative p53 response element region of the Type II hexokinase promoter. Two major protein-DNA complexes were formed between the p53 element-containing DNA probe and the AS-30D hepatoma nuclear extract. These complexes were competitively disrupted by addition of unlabeled p53 probe DNA, but were not disrupted by the addition of a nonspecific competitor DNA amplified from the same Type II hexokinase promoter (Fig.3). These results indicate that the p53 response element region used here is sufficient to specifically bind AS-30D hepatoma nuclear factors in vitro. A nuclear extract was prepared from AS-30D hepatoma cells as described under “Methods.” In the presence of this extract both p53 motifs identified on the hexokinase promoter are seen to be protected (Fig. 4), indicating that the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter engages in specific interactions with the mutated p53 nuclear protein. The footprint data provide us the first direct evidence that the p53 motifs are in fact functional within the promoter. In addition, the motif AGGCATGTTC not only retains a perfect consensus sequence for p53 binding (PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy), but also contains a Gly at position 2 and an Ala at position 5 which are reported to be critical for high affinity p53 binding activity and transactivation (7Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2871-2966Crossref Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 8Thukral S.K. Lu Y. Blain G.C. Harrey T.S. Jacobsen V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5196-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test for the effects of overexpressed mut p53 on Type II hexokinase gene transcription, the mut p53 cDNA isolated from the AS-30D hepatoma cells was placed under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven mammalian expression vector pCI-Neo (see “Methods”). The expression plasmid was co-transfected with the Type II hexokinase promoter-luciferase construct (22Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) into AS-30D hepatoma cells (Fig. 5 A). Control co-transfection experiments contained the pCI-Neo vector that lacked the Type II hexokinase cDNA insert. Eight independent experiments were performed to test for regulation of the tumor Type II hexokinase gene promoter by the overexpressed mutant p53. Fold activations as high as 1.91 (calculated over that observed for the pCI-Neo control and normalized against a β-galactosidase expression vector) were obtained. The average fold activation was 1.51 in the eight experiments with a S.D. of ±0.277 (Fig. 5 B). The results obtained clearly show the transactivating effect of the Type II hexokinase promoter by overexpressed mut p53. It should be noted that the above activation was observed over the basal mutant p53 levels already present in the AS-30D hepatoma cells. Therefore, it is quite likely that in the absence of the endogenous mutant p53, that a much higher fold activation would be obtained upon co-expression of the mutant p53. The above experiments clearly demonstrate for the first time the ability of a mutant p53 protein to transactivate a gene that is critical for maintaining the high glycolytic capacity, and therefore the survival, of a rapidly growing tumor. This novel finding is consistent with recent reports describing transactivating effects of mutant p53 on various genes (9Unger T. Nau M.M. Segal S. Minna J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10Chen J.Y. Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2159-2166PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chumakov A.M.

Miller C.W. Chen D.L. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1899-1906PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to previous reports that mutant p53 only functions in tumor cells to debilitate the ability of wt p53 to transactivate genes involved in cell cycle regulation (4Farmer G. Bargonetti J. Zhu H. Friedman P. Prywes R. Prives C. Nature. 1992; 358: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 5Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The findings that the mut p53, abundantly present in most tumor cells, can in fact function or induce a gain-of-function in activating certain genes is physiologically reasonable, as the mut p53 protein is present in quantities that are significantly higher than that necessary for its dominant-negative effect on wt p53. This is the first report of a possible link between loss of cell cycle control and one of the most common biochemical signatures of cancer cells, i.e. their propensity to catabolize glucose at high rates."
https://openalex.org/W2080073058,"Doxorubicin (Dox), a cardiotoxic antineoplastic drug, disrupts the cardiac-specific program of gene expression (Kurabayashi, M., Dutta, S., Jeyaseelan, R., and Kedes, L. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 6386–6397; Jeyaseelan, R., Poizat, C., Wu, H. Y., and Kedes, L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 5828–5832). To determine whether this drug might interfere with the function of cardiac-specific regulatory pathways, we used a differential display strategy to clone from neonatal rat cardiomyocyte candidate mRNAs that were rapidly sensitive to Dox. We report here the identification of a constitutively expressed, cardiac-restricted, nuclear protein whose mRNA level is exquisitely sensitive to Dox. Hence we have named this protein cardiacadriamycin-responsive protein (CARP). CARP mRNA is present at the earliest stages of cardiac morphogenesis. It was detected by in situ hybridization within the cardiogenic plate of 7.5-day post coitum (p.c.) embryos, and in 8.5-day p.c. embryos CARP transcripts are present in uniformly high levels in the myocardium. Throughout cardiac development, CARP expression is specific for the myocardium; endocardial cushions and valves exhibit only background levels of signal. Transcript levels persist but gradually decrease in neonatal, 2-week-old, and adult hearts. There were no stages when CARP mRNA could not be detected. The pattern and timing of CARP mRNA expression, including transient expression in the tongue at 14.5 days p.c., coincides with that of Nkx2.5/Csx (a putative homolog of tinman, theDrosophila melanogaster gene responsible for cardiac development). The cloned full-length 1749 nucleotide CARP cDNA encodes a 319-amino acid 40-kDa polypeptide containing five tandem ankyrin repeats. CARP appears to be the rat homolog of a previously reported human single-copy gene (C-193; Chu, W., Burns, D. K., Swerlick, R. A., and Presky, D. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 10236–10245), whose mRNA is inducible by cytokines only in human endothelial cells. CARP appears to function as a negative regulator of cardiac-specific gene expression. Overexpression of CARP in cardiomyocytes suppresses cardiac troponin C and atrial natriuretic factor transcription. Cotransfection experiments in HeLa cells indicate that CARP inhibits Nkx2.5 transactivation of atrial natriuretic factor promoter. When fused to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain, CARP has transcriptional inhibitory properties in noncardiac cells. CARP thus represents the first example of a cardiac-restricted transcriptional regulatory protein that is sensitive to Dox. Doxorubicin (Dox), a cardiotoxic antineoplastic drug, disrupts the cardiac-specific program of gene expression (Kurabayashi, M., Dutta, S., Jeyaseelan, R., and Kedes, L. (1995) Mol. Cell.

Initially we demonstrated that Dox selectively inhibits the accumulation of mRNA of heart-specific genes in cardiomyocytes (5Ito H. Miller S.C. Billingham M.E. Akimoto H. Torti S.V. Wade R. Gahlmann R. Lyons G. Kedes L. Torti F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Poizat C. Wu H.- Y. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5828-5832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Dox also inhibits the transcription of muscle-specific genes in skeletal muscle cells without affecting the transcription of housekeeping genes (2Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5524-5529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies (3Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Dox blocks such transcription at least in part due to the induction of a dominant negative regulator, Id (6Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar), and possibly also by inhibiting the DNA binding capacity of transcription factors active in cardiomyoctes such as MEF2. We have also demonstrated that the induction of the Id promoter by Dox is mediated through kinases distinct from protein kinase C and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) (4Kurabayashi M. Dutta S. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6386-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These observations led us to initiate a search for additional cardiac-specific molecules that might mediate the effects of Dox. We report here the identification of a cardiac-restricted nuclear protein that is constitutively expressed and whose mRNA level is exquisitely sensitive to Dox. Hence we have named this proteincardiac adriamycin-responsiveprotein (CARP). CARP mRNA is present at the earliest stages of cardiac morphogenesis, and its pattern and timing of expression coincides with that of the homeobox regulatory factor Nkx2.5/Csx (a putative homolog of tinman, theDrosophila melanogaster gene responsible for cardiac development (7Bodmer R. Development. 1993; 118: 719-729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Repression of factors such as the Nkx2.5/Csx (8Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1995; 270: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), significantly affect specific components of cardiac morphogenesis (12Lyons G.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the molecules involved in commitment and maintenance of the vertebrate cardiac phenotype remain unclear. Here, we provide evidence that CARP plays a negative role in cardiac-specific transcription and speculate that it may be important in the maintenance of the cardiac phenotype. Moreover, its rapid and sensitive elimination by adriamycin exposure may well contribute to the cardiac-specific toxicity of adriamycin and the development of cardiomyopathy. A cDNA of CARP fused with a FLAG peptide at its carboxyl terminus was synthesized by PCR. The sense primer with aBamHI site at its 5′ end was complimentary to the amino-terminal codons of CARP, starting from the ATG. The antisense primer spanned the carboxyl-terminal codons with the antisense FLAG amino acids and an XbaI site at the 5′ end. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned in the BamHI/XbaI sites of pAC-CMV (13Gomez-Foiz A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting construct is pACCMV-CARP-FL. The cardiac atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter construct, which contains the first 700 bp of the promoter, was generously provided by Dr Heikki Ruskoaho (University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland). β-Actin CAT has been previously described (14Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The cardiac troponin C (cTnC) construct that contains the full-length 4.5 kilobases of cTnC promoter sequences and the full-length cTnC first intron in the sense orientation has been described previously (15Christensen T.H. Prentice H. Gahlmann R. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6752-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To generate plasmid CMV-NKX2.5, plasmid cMlx1.2 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Harvey, Victoria, Australia) was digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease. The resulting fragment was ligated intoEcoRI site of the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The orientation of the plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate the GAL4 DNA-binding domain-CARP fusion construct, CARP cDNA was PCR-amplified using Pfu polymerase and subcloned into plasmid GAL0 (gift from G. F. Tomaselli), which contains four GAL4 DNA-binding sites. The resulting plasmid was named GAL-CARP, and to ascertain that the plasmid was in a correct reading frame, CARP was sequenced in both orientations. To create plasmid CMV-CARP, CARP cDNA was excised from the TA cloning vector by XbaI digestion and was then filled in with phage T4 DNA polymerase, followed by BamHI cleavage. CARP cDNA was ligated intoHindIII/blunt/BamHI-digested pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). UAS 4-tk luciferase was a gift from Dr. Ron Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes from 2–4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared using a previously described protocol (16Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% 5-bromodeoxyuridine. After the cells start beating 24 h post-culture, they were treated either with 1 μm Dox or 1 μm daunomycin (Dn) for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) from drug-treated and untreated cardiomyocytes. The concentrations of the RNA were measured by spectrophotometry. The integrity of the RNA was ensured by analysis in 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels. After electrophoresis RNA was transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.). The cDNA inserts excised from clones were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a random primer DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The membranes were prehybridized and hybridized as described earlier (2Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5524-5529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), washed in 1% SDS, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA three times at 55 °C for 15 min each, and exposed to Kodak XRX film at −80 °C. Differential display was carried out using the RNA map™ kit (GeneHunter Corporation) following the supplied protocol (14Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Briefly 200 ng of total RNA from neonatal rat cardiac myocytes was used for one reverse transcription reaction containing 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 2 μl each of four primers in one reaction (10 μm T12MA, T12MC, T12MG, or T12MT) in a 20-μl reaction volume in the presence of 20 μm dNTPs and the reverse transcription buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 37.6 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The reverse transcription reaction product (2 μl) was used for one PCR reaction in a volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of the same four primers, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 2 μm dNTP, 2 μl of 20 μmarbitrary primer, 1 μl of [α-35S]dATP (1200 Ci/mmol), and 0.2 μl of AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer). The PCR reactions were performed for 40 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 5 min at 72 °C for the elongation step. The PCR products were analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel. The differentially expressed bands were excised from the dried gel and eluted. The eluted DNAs were amplified using the same primers used for initial amplification using the same PCR conditions except that the dNTP concentration was increased (20 μm). The PCR products were cloned using the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and the inserts from the obtained colonies were used as probes in Northern blot analysis. Based on a 3′-UTR sequence, an antisense primer was synthesized. 5′ RACE was performed using poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from rat neonatal cardiomyocytes plus the antisense primer following the company protocol supplied with the Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (Clonetech Laboratories, Inc.). The RACE product was cloned in the TA vector (Invitrogen), and the entire cDNA was sequenced. Double stranded sequencing of the positive clones were carried out using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence searches were performed using BLAST by e-mail. Primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated as described previously were cultured on coverslips. 5 μg of pACCMV-CARP-FL was transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (17Graham F. van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). After 72 h the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Following exposure to 100 mmglycine PBS, pH 7.0, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature and blocked with PBS containing 10% horse serum. FLAG monoclonal antibody (Kodak) was used for primary antibody staining. Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody. The coverslips were mounted on a slide after six washes in PBS containing 10% horse serum using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Slides were examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The protocol that was used to fix and embed C57BL/6xDBA/2 embryos and post-natal tissues is described in detail in Lyons et al.

Briefly, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight, dehydrated, and infiltrated with paraffin. 5–7-μm serial sections were mounted on gelatinized slides. Two sections were mounted per slide, deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated, and post-fixed. The sections were digested with proteinase K, post-fixed, treated with triethanolamine/acetic anhydride, washed, and dehydrated. A 640-bp cDNA corresponding to the 3′-UTR of CARP was subcloned into PCRII (Invitrogen). This plasmid was linearized withXbaI and transcribed with SP6 polymerase to generate the antisense probe. This plasmid was linearized with BamHI and transcribed with T7 polymerase to generate the sense control probe. The cRNA transcripts were synthesized using a Maxiscript kit (Ambion) and labeled with 35S-UTP (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham). Sections were hybridized overnight at 52 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 0.3m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaPO4, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 50 mg/ml total yeast RNA, and 50,000 cpm/ml 35S-labeled cRNA probe. The tissue was subjected to stringent washing at 65 °C in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, 10 mm dithiothreitol and washed in PBS before treatment with 20 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Following washes in 2 × SSC and 0.1 × SSC for 10 min at 37 °C, the slides were dehydrated and dipped in Kodak NTB-2 nuclear track emulsion and exposed for 1 or 2 weeks in light-tight boxes with desiccant at 4 °C. Photographic development was carried out in Kodak D-19. Slides were counterstained lightly with toluidine blue and analyzed using both lightfield and darkfield optics of a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. The sense control cRNA probe (identical to the mRNAs) always gave background levels of hybridization signal (data not shown). Embryonic structures were identified with the help of the following atlases: Rugh (19Rugh R. The Mouse: Its Reproduction and Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990Google Scholar) and Kaufman (20Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press, New York1992Google Scholar). Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared as described previously (16Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% 5-bromodeoxyuridine. 24 h after plating, transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation. The cells were harvested 30 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was measured with an Monolight 2001™ luminometer. For CAT reporter constructs, the cardiomyocytes were harvested 48 h after transfection. CAT assays (21Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) were quantitated on an AMBIS Dual Radioanalytic Imaging System for the acetylated products. In all the experiments, protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The amount of reporter gene was kept constant at 2 μg/dish, and various concentrations of CMV-CARP or CMV backbone construct were cotransfected. Unless otherwise mentioned, the results were obtained from duplicate or triplicate transfections of at least two independent cardiocyte preparations, using at least two independent DNA plasmid preparations. 10T1/2 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. DNA transfection was performed as described previously by calcium phosphate precipitation. Each culture dish was incubated for 20 h with a calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate containing 2 μg of reporter plasmid and increasing concentrations of a GAL-CARP fusion construct. 3 μg of Nkx2.5 construct and 2 μg of CARP expression vector were cotransfected with 2 μg of ANF promoter. After removal of excess DNA, the cells were kept in fresh 10% calf serum. 24 h later, cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for reporter activity, which was normalized to the protein content. These transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated twice with two different preparations of each plasmid. To identify a cardiac-specific target of Dox, we analyzed the differential expression patterns of genes in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes by a differential display technique (23Liang P. Averboukh L. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6966-6968PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the effects of Dox with a Dox-derivative Dn to confirm the results. The differential display was carried out using total RNA extracted from treated and control cells of primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes by growing the cells in media containing 1 μm Dox or Dn for 24 h. To identify the most sensitive transcripts, the concentrations of Dox or Dn used were reduced to half that usually required for a complete cessation of tissue-specific gene expression in cardiomyocytes (2 μm). The reverse transcription was done using oligo(dT) primers followed by PCR with arbitrary oligos containing 10 nucleotides. Several different combinations of oligo(dT) and arbitrary primers were used to cover a larger number of messenger RNAs. We identified 20 differentially expressed bands, of which 8 bands were repressed in their expression during both Dox and Dn treatment. The cDNAs in the corresponding segments from control lanes were eluted, reamplified, subcloned, and subjected to Northern blotting. Out of eight clones, seven were positives only in Northern blots of RNA from the drug-treated cells. One among the seven clones, a 640-bp partial cDNA, had characteristics (described below) that made it the subject of intensified analysis. The differential display band from which it was cloned is shown in Fig.1 A, and the Northern blot against RNA from untreated and Dox- and Dn-treated cardiocytes is shown in Fig. 1 B. The mRNA band detected in untreated cardiomyocytes is drastically reduced in the presence of Dox or Dn in both the differential display pattern (Fig. 1 A) as well as in the Northern blot (Fig. 1 B). The size of the mRNA in Northern blot is estimated as 2.0 kilobases. We named the protein encoded by this clone as CARP for cardiacadriamycin-responsiveprotein. Because Dox affects the levels of mRNA for cardiac housekeeping genes, the rate at which tissue-specific mRNAs disappear following Dox exposure may be a reflection of turnover of those transcripts. The effects of Dox on the time for half-decay of mRNA for a number of sarcomeric protein is in the order of 12–20 h (2Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5524-5529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, CARP mRNA levels in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exposed to 1 μm Dox or Dn falls by half by 2 h and is almost undetectable by 12 h (Fig.2 A). The mRNA for a representative sarcomeric protein, cardiac troponin I, which falls steadily in response to Dox or Dn, has an apparentt½ of 16 h and is still detectable at 36 h. As expected, the expression of the housekeeping gene cyclophilin is minimally affected by the drugs. The relative levels of CARP and cardiac troponin I mRNAs following Dox exposure are compared in Fig. 2 B. These results suggest that in the presence of Dox, CARP mRNA levels are very labile. Radiolabeled CARP cDNA was used to probe Northern blots of rat RNA derived from various organs. CARP transcripts were easily detected in myocardium but not in RNA extracted from adult rat brain, kidney, testis, liver, or skeletal muscle (Fig.3 A). These results suggest that CARP mRNA is tissue-specific and is detectable only in heart. We also wanted to analyze whether the expression of CARP is restricted to cardiomyocytes or is expressed also in the plentiful fibroblastic noncardiomyocytes that populate myocardium including vascular endothelium. We cultured pure populations of such nonmyocytes and carried out Northern blots with these extracted RNAs and RNAs from nonmuscle cells (10T1/2 and HeLa). The results (Fig. 3 B) show that high level expression is detected in cardiac myocytes but not in cardiac fibroblasts or 10T1/2 or HeLa cells. We also examined RNA from both the myoblast and myotube stages of C2C12 cell differentiation and detected the presence of low levels of CARP transcripts (Fig.3 C) at both stages of differentiation but far below the levels found in heart. When normalized for differences in RNA transfer to the membrane, densitometry scans of the autoradiographs demonstrate a 10–12-fold increase of CARP mRNA levels from myoblasts to myotubes (not shown). Disappointingly, after a determination of the nucleotide sequence of the 640-bp cDNA obtained from differential display cloning, the sequence remained unidentified after internet searches using BLAST and TIGR for data base analysis. We then cloned 1.7 kilobases of the cDNA by 5′ RACE using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (see “Materials and Methods”), rat cardiomyocyte poly(A)+ mRNA, and the antisense primer of the 3′-UTR. The entire cDNA was sequenced (Fig.4 A), and the single open reading frame was analyzed. The 1749-bp cDNA encodes a protein of 319 aa starting with an ATG at nucleotide position 61 and ending with a TGA at nucleotide 1018. There is a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) starting at base 1731. The 3′-UTR contains a stretch of five mRNA destabilization signals in tandem and two other AU-rich regions.Figure 4A, sequence of CARP cDNA and the translated protein. The numbers at rightrepresent the nucleotide positions, and the numbers atleft represent the amino acid positions. The translation starts at nucleotide position 61 and ends at 1018.

One match was found for a human cDNA that has 64% DNA sequence identity and 91% amino acid identity. The encoded protein (C-193) (20Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press, New York1992Google Scholar) is inducible by cytokines in human endothelial cells and is most likely the human homolog of CARP. The 3′-UTR of C-193 is not similar to the 3′-UTR of rat CARP, although mRNA degradation signals are present in both the UTRs. However, the protein coding regions of C-193 and CARP share 85% DNA sequence homology. The alignment of the proteins is shown in the Fig.4 C. Both proteins have ankyrin-like repeats and nuclear localization signals. The open reading frame of the cDNA was transcribed in vitro using SP6, and the products of a reticulocyte lysate translation reaction were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). The synthesized polypeptide appears to be 40 kDa, as compared with the computer predicted molecular mass of 36.2 kDa (pI 8.8). Analysis of the CARP polypeptide revealed a number of putative protein motifs. There are five tandem 33-amino acid-long ankyrin-like repeats (Fig. 4, B and D); four of these had been identified at homologous locations in C-193, but what appears to be a fifth ankyrin repeat (Anky1) in CARP is also present in C-193. The CARP polypeptide sequence contains a number of other putative protein motifs (Fig. 4 D). There are three 4-residue potential nuclear localization signals: KKKK (at residue 70), KKRK (residue 93), and KRKK (residue 94); there is another potential nuclear localization signal, RKSEKVREAELKKKKLE, starting at residue 59. CARP has five putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at the following locations: TGK (11–13 aa), SEK (62–64 aa), SDK (141–143 aa), SAR (213–215 aa), and SLK (305–307 aa). There is one putative cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site, KKNS (13"
https://openalex.org/W1969393277,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-activated kinase (TAK1) is known for its involvement in TGF-β signaling and its ability to activate the p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This report shows that TAK1 is also a strong activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Both the wild-type and a constitutively active mutant of TAK1 stimulated JNK in transient transfection assays. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4)/stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (SEK1), a dual-specificity kinase that phosphorylates and activates JNK, synergized with TAK1 in activating JNK. Conversely, a dominant-negative (MKK4/SEK1 mutant inhibited TAK1-induced JNK activation. A kinasedefective mutant of TAK1 effectively suppressed hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1 (HPK1)-induced JNK activity but had little effect on germinal center kinase activation of JNK. There are two additional MAPK kinase kinases, MEKK1 and mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), that are also downstream of HPK1 and upstream of MKK4/SEK mutant. However, because the dominant-negative mutants of MEKK1 and MLK3 did not inhibit TAK1-induced JNK activity, we conclude that activation of JNK1 by TAK1 is independent of MEKK1 and MLK3. In addition to TAK1, TGF-β also stimulated JNK activity. Taken together, these results identify TAK1 as a regulator in the HPK1 → TAK1 → MKK4/SEK1 → JNK kinase cascade and indicate the involvement of JNK in the TGF-β signaling pathway. Our results also suggest the potential roles of TAK1 not only in the TGF-β pathway but also in the other HPK1/JNK1-mediated pathways."

Cx43 is phosphorylated on tyrosine by v-Src. The Src homology 3 (SH3) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of v-Src mediate interactions with substrate proteins. SH3 domains interact with proline-rich peptide motifs. SH2 domains associate with short amino acid sequences containing phosphotyrosine.

https://openalex.org/W2026271507,"The role of postsynaptic, neuronal glutamate transporters in terminating signals at central excitatory synapses is not known. Stimulation of a climbing fiber input to cerebellar Purkinje cells was shown to generate an anionic current mediated by glutamate transporters. The kinetics of transporter currents were resolved by pulses of glutamate to outside-out membrane patches from Purkinje cells. Comparison of synaptic transporter currents to transporter currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes suggests that postsynaptic uptake at the climbing fiber synapse removes at least 22 percent of released glutamate. These neuronal transporter currents arise from synchronous activation of transporters that greatly outnumber activated AMPA receptors."

This enzyme is encoded by a single gene, and adult mammalian muscles express a single splice variant, corresponding to the catalytic subunit of type T (AChET) (1Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D.

Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At the post-translational level, however, quaternary interactions introduce a considerable diversity of molecular forms that are characterized by distinct localizations in cellular structures. These molecules include amphiphilic monomers (G1a) and dimers (G2a), nonamphiphilic tetramers (G4na), as well as hetero-oligomeric structures in which tetramers of catalytic subunits are disulfide-linked with a hydrophobic “tail” (20 kDa) in the membrane-bound G4a forms (3Gennari K. Brunner J. Brodbeck U. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Inestrosa N.C. Roberts W.L. Marshall T.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4441-4444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with a collagenous “tail” in the collagen-tailed or asymmetric (A) forms. The latter molecules consist of one, two, or three tetramers (A4, A8, A12), which are disulfide-linked to the strands of the triple helical collagen tail (see Fig. 1 A). G1a and G2a forms appear to remain mostly intracellular and represent precursors of more complex molecules. The G4na form is secreted and hydrophobic-tailed tetramers (G4a) are attached to the plasma membrane. The collagen-tailed molecules are tethered in the basal lamina, and are largely responsible for the high concentration of AChE at the neuromuscular junction. To understand the biosynthesis of the various AChE forms and its regulation, it is necessary to analyze the association of AChET catalytic subunits with anchoring subunits, particularly the collagen subunits, which have been named Q, according to the nomenclature of AChE-associated proteins (5Massoulié J. Sussman J.L. Doctor B.P. Soreq H. Velan B. Cygler M. Rotundo R. Shafferman A. Silman I. Taylor P. Massoulié J. Bacou F. Barnard E. Chatonnet A. Doctor B.P. Quinn D.M. Cholinesterases. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1991: 285-288Google Scholar). Cloning and expression of the collagen tail subunit of the asymmetric AChE forms from Torpedo electric organ (tQ1) allowed us to show that the structural and catalytic subunits assemble into collagen-tailed molecules when coexpressed in COS cells (6Krejci E. Coussen F. Duval N. Chatel J.M. Legay C. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Cartaud J. Bon S. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of the Q subunit comprises an N-terminal region, QN, a collagen domain, and a C-terminal domain, QC. We showed that the QN domain is able to recruit monomers, producing a tailed tetramer (7Duval N. Krejci E. Grassi J. Coussen F. Massoulié J. Bon S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3255-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol.

Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present study, we cloned cDNAs encoding Q subunits from the rat, using cross-hybridization with Torpedo probes. We asked three major questions: Do several genes encode different Q subunits? Are collagenous and noncollagenous AChE-associated proteins, particularly the 20-kDa membrane anchor, generated by the same gene(s)? Is the expression of Q gene(s) exclusively restricted to cholinergic tissues? Unless otherwise indicated, reagents were purchased from Prolabo (Paris, France), Sigma, or Appligene (Illkirch, France), and enzymes from New England Biolabs (Ozyme, France). Ten male Wistar albino rats weighing 180–250 g at the time of surgery were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 5 mg/kg xylazine (Rompun, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany) and 90 mg/kg ketamine (Ketalar, Parke-Davis and Co., Berlin, Germany). The sciatic nerve on one side was exposed and crushed in the mid thigh region by a nonserrated hemostat for 30 s. The wound skin was closed, and the animals were left to recover for 21 days to allow for sciatic nerve regeneration and reinnervation of the soleus muscle. The animals were then sacrificed, and the reinnervating soleus muscle was rapidly isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from muscle (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar), and a cDNA library was constructed in pCDM8. Briefly, double-stranded cDNA was obtained (11Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar), using a cDNA synthesizing kit (Pharmacia). Then, BstXI adaptors were linked to the blunt-ended cDNA, after purification by Sephacryl 400 chromatography, and the cDNAs were ligated in pCDM8, which had previously been cleaved by BstXI. 1.5 × 106 independent transformed MC1061/P3 bacteria were distributed in pools of 10,000–12,000 clones and amplified. 60 pools were grown, and for each pool the DNA was extracted, digested by XhoI, run on agarose gels, and blotted to nylon membranes that were hybridized with probes derived from the Torpedo cDNA (nucleotides 1–213 and 916–1416) (6Krejci E. Coussen F. Duval N. Chatel J.M. Legay C. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Cartaud J. Bon S. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated in 7% SDS, 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA at 50 °C with the radiolabeled probes and washed in 1% SDS, 0.2m sodium phosphate, and 2 mm EDTA at 45 °C. One pool was positive with the two probes. Sequential dilutions were used to isolate a positive clone, rQ1. A second screening of this library with a probe derived from the rQ1 clone yielded five other clones with different structures, which will not be described in detail here. Sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide method with the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and analyzed by the Genework program (IntelliGenetics). Comparisons of protein and nucleic acid sequences with data banks were done with the FASTA and BLAST programs. We used the rat multiple tissue Northern blot from CLONTECH, prepared with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis. The N-terminal probe (nucleotides 5–412 of rQ1 cDNA) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides 5′-CCTTGCCCTCTGACTTGATA-3′ and 5′-GGGGGCATCAGTAGGCAGCA-3′, the C-terminal probe (nucleotides 892–1412) with oligonucleotides 5′-GAAAGAGGATTTCCAGGGCC-3′ and 5′-TATCGGCAGGGTGTGGAGTC-3′. Radiolabeled probes of high specific activity were generated by random priming with the Rediprime kit (Amersham Corp.). Hybridization was performed in 5 ml of rapid hybridization buffer (CLONTECH) for 2 h at 55 °C. Washings were done in 1 × SSC at 50 °C. The same membrane was first hybridized with a C-terminal probe and exposed, then boiled in 2 mm EDTA and exposed again to verify the completeness of dehybridization. It was finally hybridized with the N-terminal probe. Blots were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) after 48 h of exposure. Rat genomic DNA was extracted by the salting out method (12Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17845) Google Scholar). For Southern blotting, genomic DNA was digested by restriction enzyme, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized as described for screening of the cDNA library. The mouse 129 cosmid library (Stratagene) was screened with N-terminal (5–412) and C-terminal (892–1412) probes derived from the rQ1 cDNA. We isolated one clone that hybridized only with the N probe and contained part of the Q gene. All EcoRI fragments from this cosmid were subcloned and sequenced at their extremities. The fragments were assembled by sequencing throughEcoRI site, directly on the cosmid. Exons were localized by hybridization with cDNA probes of EcoRI fragment digested with restriction enzymes or deleted by exonuclease III (13Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Some junctions were confirmed by sequencing the cosmid with specific oligonucleotides. RNA probes were generated by Sp6 or T7 RNA polymerases with [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham). Q1 probe contains the sequence 145–412 of the rQ1 cDNA, QR probe 145–321. The probes were gel-purified and eluted in 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS at 37 °C. Hybridization of RNA with the radioactive probes, RNase digestion, and inactivation were performed with the HybspeedTM RNase protection assay kit (Ambion). The protected fragments were analyzed after electrophoresis in a Fuji image analyzer (BAS 1000). The content of A nucleotides was taken into account for calculation of the relative abundance of the fragments. A peptide corresponding to residues 35–51 of the rQ1 deduced primary sequence was synthesized by Joel Vandekerckhove, coupled to keyhole limpet hemagglutinin, and injected into hens (Biocytex, France). IgY antibodies were purified from egg yolks by Biocytex. Transfection of COS cells was performed by the DEAE-dextran method, as described previously (7Duval N. Krejci E. Grassi J. Coussen F. Massoulié J. Bon S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3255-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using 5 μg of DNA encoding the rat catalytic subunit AChET and 5 μg of DNA encoding rQ1 or rQR. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and analyzed 2–4 days after transfection (14Legay C. Bon S. Vernier P. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We constructed plasmids in which the AChET and rQ1 coding sequences were inserted between 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences ofXenopus globin, in the TST7 vector (15Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2331-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), so as to enhance stability and translation efficiency. Synthetic transcripts were prepared with the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINETM in vitro transcription kit. Samples of ∼50 nl (25 ng of AChET and 5 ng of Q mRNA) were injected with an air pressure injection system (Inject+matic, Geneva, Switzerland) into Xenopus oocytes (16Soreq H. Parvari R. Silman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Analysis of the molecular forms of AChE was performed 1–3 days after injection. AChE was extracted from transfected COS cells and Xenopus oocytes in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. In the case of rat heart, we performed sequential extraction by a low salt buffer without detergent, a low salt buffer in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and finally a high salt solution containing 1m NaCl, as described previously (17Bon S. Cartaud J. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). AChE purifications were performed from frozen bovine caudate nucleus andXenopus oocytes essentially as described previously (3Gennari K. Brunner J. Brodbeck U. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using an trimethylammonium m-phenylenediamine affinity column (18Brodbeck U. Gentinetta R. Ott P. Azzi A. Brodbeck U. Zahler P. Membrane Proteins: A Laboratory Manual. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1981: 85-96Crossref Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C in presence of 20 mm EDTA and 2 mm benzamidine hydrochloride as protease inhibitors. The activity was assayed by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (19Ellman G.L. Courtney D.K. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21370) Google Scholar). SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed essentially according to the method of Lämmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) using 5–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Protein bands were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The gels were calibrated with Bio-Rad SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis molecular mass standards: myosin (200 kDa),Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (116 kDa), rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), hen egg white ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and hen egg white lysozyme (14.4 kDa). After electrophoresis, proteins from acrylamide gels were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Westran, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) in a tank-blot system (XCell II, Novex, San Diego, CA). Blotting was performed overnight at 20 V in a borate buffer containing 50 mm sodium borate (pH 9.0) and 20% (v/v) methanol. After transfer, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were rinsed three times with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl. For blocking, a solution of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl (buffer A) and 3% bovine serum albumin was added to the blot, which was incubated for 4 h at room temperature. It was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1/200 diluted antiserum in buffer B (buffer A plus 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were rinsed four times with buffer B and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or anti-hen immunoglobulins diluted 1:1000 with buffer B. The strips were washed five times with buffer B and developed with a solution of 0.05% of diaminobenzidine in buffer A containing 1 μl/ml of 8.8 mH2O2. Sedimentation analysis of AChE forms in sucrose gradients was performed as described previously (7Duval N. Krejci E. Grassi J. Coussen F. Massoulié J. Bon S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3255-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); the 5–20% sucrose gradients contained 0.4m NaCl and 0.2% Brij-96; they were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm, at 7 °C for 16 h, in a SW41 Beckman rotor. AChE was assayed by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (19Ellman G.L. Courtney D.K. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21370) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficients were deduced by a linear relationship from the position of internal markers, alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S) and β-galactosidase (16 S) from E. coli. For assays of AChE and BChE, AChE activity was specifically inhibited with 10−6m BW284C51, and BChE activity was inhibited with 10−4m tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide (21Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). To increase the level of transcripts encoding the collagen tail, we used a rat soleus muscle which was in the process of reinnervation after a crush of the sciatic nerve; in this case, AChE collagen-tailed forms become highly expressed throughout the entire length of muscle fibers (22Crne-Finderle N. Toplisek J. Sketelj J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We constructed a cDNA library containing 1.5 × 106 independent clones from RNA isolated from the reinnervating soleus and screened it with probes corresponding to the QN and QC regions of theTorpedo tQ1 subunit. We thus obtained one cDNA clone, rQ1, which cross-hybridized at low stringency with the two probes. The length of rQ1 was 2,731 nucleotides. It contains 45 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region, and 1312 nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated region. The coding sequence (46–1419) is entirely homologous to that of Torpedo, tQ1 (6Krejci E. Coussen F. Duval N. Chatel J.M. Legay C. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Cartaud J. Bon S. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); rQ1 and tQ1 presented 60% identity at the nucleotide level and 52% identity at the amino acid level. An alignment of the deduced peptide sequences shows that nonconserved regions alternate with remarkably well conserved regions, which define potentially functional domains (Fig.1 B). The N-terminal part of the sequence corresponds to a secretion signal peptide, which is predicted to contain 22 residues in rQ1, and 42 residues in tQ1 (23von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The predicted cleavage sites are located at the same position in the aligned rQ1 and tQ1sequences, and this position was recently confirmed in the case of tQ1 (8Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extremity of the mature protein shows only 10 conserved residues out of 28, but it is followed by a very conserved PRAD, containing 15/17 identical residues. The PRAD sequence includes two adjacent cysteines that establish disulfide bonds with AChET subunits (24Lee S.L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12292-12301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stretches of five and three prolines. This peptidic domain is sufficient for binding an AChET tetramer (9Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is separated from the collagen domain by 30 residues, showing essentially no conservation between tQ1 and rQ1, except for the presence of a cysteine residue, which may participate in the stabilization of the triple helix through intersubunit disulfide bonds (tQ1contains two cysteines in this region, only one of which is conserved in rQ1). The collagen domain has approximately the same length in both sequences; it consists of 63 triplets of amino acids GXY in rat, compared with 60 in Torpedo, with an interruption of 10 residues in tQ1, 7 in rQ1, at the same position in both sequences. Two internal motifs, which have been proposed to represent binding sites for heparan sulfate proteoglycans in tQ1 (25Deprez P.N. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), are totally conserved, RKGR (128–131) and KRGK (234–237). The C-terminal noncollagenous domain contains three conserved regions of unequal length. The first conserved region consists of 14 residues, beginning immediately at the end of the collagen domain; it contains two conserved cysteines, separated by a single residue, that are probably involved in interchain bonds. The second conserved region contains 31 identical residues, and 9 conservative substitutions, out of 45 residues. It is highly hydrophilic, with a large proportion of negatively and positively charged residues, and shows no similarity with known proteins. Separated from this domain by a short linker, the third conserved region covers the C-terminal 81 residues of rQ1 (83 in tQ1). It contains 10 conserved cysteines, and presents an imperfect internal repeat, as previously noted in the case of tQ1 (6Krejci E. Coussen F. Duval N. Chatel J.M. Legay C. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Cartaud J. Bon S. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Another cDNA clone, rQR was isolated from the soleus muscle library and also obtained by a rapid amplification of cDNA ends 3′ procedure. In this transcript the PRAD-encoding sequence is followed by a short sequence (355 nucleotides) that is not included in rQ1 (see Fig. 3). As described in a subsequent section, analysis of the genomic sequence in the mouse showed that this unrelated sequence corresponds to the “readthrough” of the following intron. The rQR transcript was terminated by a poly(A) sequence, despite the absence of a canonical polyadenylation signal. The identity of rQ1 as the collagen tail of AChE asymmetric forms was confirmed in two ways. First, the coexpression of this molecule with rat AChET led to the production of asymmetric AChE molecules in COS cells (not shown) and in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2 A). Second, we developed chicken antibodies directed against peptide 35–51, which precedes the PRAD and shows no conservation with the Torpedosequence. In sucrose gradients, these antibodies shift the sedimentation of all A forms synthesized in oocytes (Fig.2 A) and all the A forms extracted from soleus muscle (Fig.2 B). The N-terminal peptide of rQ1 is therefore present and accessible in the collagen-tailed molecules. Rat genomic DNA, cleaved by restriction enzymes, was hybridized in Southern blots at low stringency with probes corresponding to the QC domain. We observed a single strong signal (not shown), suggesting the absence of closely related genes, since C-terminal sequences are generally well conserved among members of a collagen family (26van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). We also screened a human cosmid genomic library with two probes corresponding to the rat QC domain, at low stringency. We obtained five independent cosmids, all of which overlapped in the same genomic region. 2E. Krejci, unpublished results. In addition, we cloned a 35-kb cosmid containing part of the mouse Q gene, by hybridization with a probe covering rat QN domain. This cosmid covers less than a third of the coding sequence. Fig.3 shows the exon-intron boundaries of the exons encoding the PRAD and the collagen domain. A single exon of 131 base pairs (EPRAD) encodes the PRAD and flanking sequences, and the next 3′ exon (Ecoll 1, 96 nucleotides) extends into the beginning of the collagen domain. Exons encoding the N-terminal part of the collagen domain are small (27–72 nucleotides), and each one encodes a multiple of GXY triplets, starting with the first base of the glycine codon (GGN). The few coding differences between the rat and the mouse sequences are indicated on Fig. 3. Another way to investigate the possible diversity of cholinesterase-associated collagens is to examine whether BChE asymmetric forms cross-react with antibodies raised against the nonconserved peptide that precedes the PRAD, anti-rQN35–51. Because collagen-tailed forms of BChE are relatively abundant in Torpedo heart (27Toutant J.P. Massoulié J. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1988; 86: 225-265Crossref Google Scholar), and because rQ1 appears to be expressed at a high level in rat heart, we thought that it might be possible to characterize asymmetric BChE in this tissue. We performed sequential extractions of rat heart ventricle in low salt and in high salt concentrations, as described previously (17Bon S. Cartaud J. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), to obtain an extract enriched in A forms. This high salt extract was analyzed by sedimentation in sucrose gradients, followed by assays of AChE and BChE activities, performed in the presence of the specific inhibitors tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide and BW284C51, respectively (Fig. 4). The patterns obtained showed the presence of asymmetric forms of both AChE and BChE, with distinct sedimentation coefficients in the fractions of the same sucrose gradient, 16.5 S for AChE A12 and 18 S for BChE A12. This difference in sedimentation, in complete agreement with previous analyses in rat muscle (28Vigny M. Gisiger V. Massoulié J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2588-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), established that the AChE and BChE molecules were distinct and independent. The sedimentation coefficients of all asymmetric forms, BChE as well as AChE, were increased by about 2 S after incubation with the anti-rQN35–51 antibodies, while globular forms were not affected. Although the BChE A4 and A8 forms were not entirely resolved from the G4 peak, these molecules were also clearly shifted by the antibodies. The rQR cDNA clone corresponds to unspliced readthrough transcript, in which the PRAD exon is followed by the subsequent genomic sequence (Fig. 3), instead of the collagen exons. This transcript is polyadenylated and thus represents a mature mRNA, which encodes the PRAD without the collagen domain. By RNase protection assays with a probe covering EPRAD and the readthrough sequence rQR (QR probe), we showed that this mRNA represents about 5% of the transcripts in the soleus muscle and about 15% in the heart ventricle (Fig.5). We also performed RNase protection assays with a probe covering EPRAD and the three following exons, encoding the N-terminal part of the collagen domain (Q1 probe). As shown in Fig. 5, we observed a major protected fragment corresponding to the structure of Q1 in both tissues; the fragment corresponding to EPRADoriginating from rQR or other splicing events was nearly undetectable in this experiment but was visible in other experiments. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis we failed to detect any transcript in which the PRAD-containing exon would be associated with downstream sequences differing from rQ1or rQR. We obtained similar results with brain mRNA (not shown). Since the protein encoded by rQR contains the attachment domain without the collagen domain, it appeared possible that it might represent the hydrophobic subunit that anchors AChE tetramers (G4a) in cellular membranes. To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed rQR with AChET; this produced only nonamphiphilic G4namolecules, either in COS cells or in Xenopus oocytes (data not shown). In Western blots after nonreducing electrophoresis, we found that anti-rQN35–51 antibodies recognize the heavy dimer of G4na produced by coexpression of rQR and AChET in oocytes but not the dimers that constitute the G4a form extracted from bovine brain (Fig. 6). In addition to the labeling of the heavy dimer, which appears diffuse, we observed a labeled band corresponding to the association of a rQR with a single AChE subunit. In the brain extract, a labeled band of high molecular weight could correspond to the A form. As positive controls, we verified that the antibodies shifted the sedimentation of bovine A forms in sucrose gradient, demonstrating that they interact with the bovine QN sequence (not shown) and that the heavy dimer of purified brain G4na is recognized by an anti-anchor antibody (29Liao J. Norgaard-Pedersen B. Brodbeck U. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), producing a labeled band at the expected position in Western blot (not shown). We analyzed the tissue distribution of rQ transcripts by Northern blots, using an N-terminal probe extending into the beginning of the collagen domain (N-terminal probe), and a probe corresponding to the QCdomain (C-terminal probe). As shown in Fig.7, both N-terminal and C-terminal probes recognized a major transcript of about 2.7 kb, corresponding to t"

The present work describes the identification and characterization of a novel member of this family termed microsomal glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase III (microsomal GST-III). The open reading frame encodes a 16.5-kDa protein with a calculated pI of 10.2. Microsomal GST-III has 36, 27, 22, and 20% amino acid identity to microsomal GST-II, LTC<sub>4</sub> synthase, microsomal GST-I, and FLAP, respectively. Microsomal GST-III also has a similar hydrophobicity pattern to FLAP, LTC<sub>4</sub> synthase, and microsomal GST-I. Fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization mapped microsomal GST-III to chromosomal localization 1q23. Like microsomal GST-II, microsomal GST-III has a wide tissue distribution (at the mRNA level) and is predominantly expressed in human heart, skeletal muscle, and adrenal cortex, and it is also found in brain, placenta, liver, and kidney tissues. Expression of microsomal GST-III mRNA was also detected in several glandular tissues such as pancreas, thyroid, testis, and ovary. In contrast, microsomal GST-III mRNA expression was very low (if any) in lung, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Microsomal GST-III protein was expressed in a baculovirus insect cell system, and microsomes from Sf9 cells containing either microsomal GST-II or microsomal GST-III were both found to possess glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity as shown by their ability to reduce 5-HPETE to 5-HETE in the presence of reduced glutathione. The apparent <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> of 5-HPETE was determined to be approximately 7 μm for microsomal GST-II and 21 μm for microsomal GST-III. Microsomal GST-III was also found to catalyze the production of LTC<sub>4</sub> from LTA<sub>4</sub> and reduced glutathione. Based on these catalytic activities it is proposed that this novel membrane protein is a member of the microsomal glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase super family, which also includes microsomal GST-I, LTC<sub>4</sub> synthase, FLAP, and microsomal GST-II."
https://openalex.org/W2046821312,"Mesangial cell (MC) activation plays a pivotal role in the development of the end stage sclerotic lesion characteristic of most forms of chronic glomerular disease. We have previously demonstrated that MC activation is directly linked to high level expression of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) enzyme (Turck, J., Pollock, A. S., Lee, L., Marti, H.-P., and Lovett, D. H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 25, 15074–15083), the transcription of which is regulated in a tissue-specific fashion. Recent studies (Harendza, S., Pollock, A., Mertens, P. R., and Lovett, D. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 18786–18796) delineated a strong cis-acting enhancer element, designated MMP-2 RE1, within the 5′-flanking region of the rat MMP-2 gene. Gel shift, DNA footprint, and transcriptional analyses mapped the enhancer element to a unique 40-base pair (bp) sequence located at −1322 to −1282 bp relative to the translational start site. Bromodeoxyuridine-substituted UV cross-linking of the 40-bp enhancer element with MC nuclear extracts yielded a single protein of 52 kDa, while Southwestern blot analysis with MMP-2 RE1 demonstrated three hybridizing nuclear proteins of 52, 62, and 86 kDa size. Screening of a human MC cDNA expression library with MMP-2 RE1 exclusively yielded clones with the identical sequence of the transcription factor YB-1. Western blot and supershift gel analysis of MC nuclear extracts with an anti-YB-1 antibody confirmed the presence of YB-1 within the shifted complex. Examination of the MMP-2 RE1 sequence revealed an incomplete Y-box sequence (CTGCTGGGCAAG), which specifically interacted with recombinant YB-1 on DMS protection footprinting analysis. YB-1 protein preferentially bound the single-stranded components of the 40-bp MMP-2 RE1 and, with increasing concentrations, formed multimeric complexes. Co-transfection of YB-1 in MC increased the enhancer activity within the context of the native MMP-2 promoter, while transfection of non-MMP-2-synthesizing glomerular epithelial cells with YB-1 led to transcriptional suppression.

These enzymes are characterized by activity at neutral pH, secretion in latent, proenzyme forms, dependence upon zinc for catalytic activity, and inhibition by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1–3 (1Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). While MMP-2 and MMP-9 share similar substrate specificities, encompassing type IV and V collagen, fibronectin, and laminin (2Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L.

Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their patterns of expression are distinct. MMP-2 has been the focus of considerable interest, since high level expression of this enzyme in metastatic tumor cells correlates with overall metastatic potential (4Sreenath T. Matrisian L.M. Stetler-Stevenson W. Gattoni-Celli S. Pozzatti R.O. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4942-4947PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar), presumably due to enhanced degradation of the major basal membrane component, Type IV collagen.Furthermore, MMP-2 is of importance in inflammatory reactions found in numerous tissues, including the kidney. The development of the sclerotic lesion in chronic glomerulosclerosis is temporally correlated with high level expression of MMP-2 (6Carome M.A. Striker L.J. Peten E.P. Elliot S.J. Yang C.W. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Reponen P. Tryggvason K. Striker G.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 5 (1391): 1391PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, MMP-2 acts not only as a matrix-degrading enzyme but also directly stimulates growth by glomerular mesangial cells (MC) (7Turck J. Pollock A.S. Lee L.K. Marti H.-P. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15074-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with assumption of an inflammatory phenotype characterized by increased synthesis of prosclerotic interstitial collagens.Although in most cell culture systems MMP-2 expression is constitutive in nature, there are cells described with a differentially regulated expression of MMP-2 both in vivo and in vitro. For example, MMP-2 is highly expressed in a temporally limited pattern in the developing murine lung and kidney (8Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Huhtala P. Hurskainen T. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7856-7862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, MMP-2 expression by MCs can be stimulated with interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β (9Marti H.-P. Lee L. Kashgarian M. Lovett D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 82-94PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region up to −1686 bp relative to the translation start site of the rat MMP-2 gene was recently evaluated for the existence of MC-specific regulatory elements (10Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), with the resultant identification of an apparently unique, 40-bp cis-acting enhancer element located at −1282 to −1322 bp relative to the translation start site, designated MMP-2 RE1. The MMP-2 RE1 confers cell-specific transactivation of luciferase reporter constructs containing MMP-2 RE1 in conjunction with either the homologous MMP-2 or a heterologous SV40 promoter. Furthermore, specific DNA binding activity to this element was demonstrated in MC nuclear extracts (10Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although nuclear protein binding activity to this enhancer element was also detected in other cell types, positive transactivation in conjunction with the homologous MMP-2 promoter was confined to MCs.Given these findings, we set out to identify the MC nuclear protein binding activity that interacts with the MMP-2 RE1 by expression screening of a MC cDNA library. These studies have identified the transcription factor YB-1 as a component of the MMP-2 transactivating complex. YB-1 was found to preferentially bind both the sense and antisense single-stranded components of the MMP-2 RE1, as compared with double-stranded DNA. Co-transfection studies using a YB-1 expression vector and reporter constructs containing the MMP-2 RE1 confirmed the role of YB-1 as a regulator of MMP-2 transcription, with cell-specific transactivation or repression.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified the transcription factor, YB-1, as a major regulator of the cell-specific regulation of MMP-2 gene transcription. YB-1 was obtained by expression screening of a mesangial cell λgt11 cDNA library using the MMP-2 RE1 as a probe (10Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility of recombinant YB-1 closely matches that of the 52-kDa nuclear protein obtained with UV cross-linking of mesangial cell nuclear extracts with the MMP-2RE-1. A protein with a similar molecular mass of 52 kDa was also observed following Southwestern analysis of both mesangial and glomerular epithelial cell nuclear extracts. In addition, Western blots of nuclear extracts from both cell types probed with anti-YB-1 antibody also demonstrated proteins of 56–52 kDa. The specific interaction of YB-1 with the MMP-2 RE-1 was confirmed by gel shift analysis with recombinant YB-1 protein and by supershift analysis with specific antibody. We note that the sensitive Southwestern blot analysis of mesangial and glomerular epithelial cell nuclear extracts also detected proteins with molecular masses of 62 and 86 kDa, which were not recovered from our mesangial cell expression library. Future studies are planned using alternative screening strategies to identify these potentially significant MMP-2 RE-1 binding proteins.YB-1 belongs to a family of evolutionarily highly conserved transcription factors, the Y-box family (25Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 30Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Members of this family derived from bacteria and extending to mammals all include a homologous 80-amino acid DNA binding domain, termed the cold shock domain (31Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Rosenfeld P.T. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 48: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The DNA binding region of the YB-1 protein recognizes a relatively conserved element, the Y-box, which contains a core inverted CCAAT sequence. Upon reinspection of the MMP-2 RE1 sequence following the expression cloning of YB-1, a significant homology between a Y-box consensus sequence and the MMP-2 RE1 sequence was evident (Fig. 2).Functional characterization of a related member of the Y-box transcription factor family, FRGY, has revealed a domain at the C-terminal region of the protein that facilitates both homomultimerization and interaction with other transcription factors (32Kolluri R. Torrey T.A. Kinniburgh A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our results with recombinant YB-1 protein indicate that concentration-dependent multimerization does occur upon binding to the MMP-2 RE1 sequence, particularly within the single-stranded context. The propensity of YB-1 to multimerize on this element is the most probable explanation for the very extended DNA footprint observed in this study. The actual functional significance of YB-1 protein multimerization along a recognition element remains conjectural at this time, but it may facilitate interactions with other transactivating factors.YB-1 bound with a much higher affinity to the single-stranded components of the MMP-2 RE-1. In this regard, it is of interest that YB-1 may convert double-stranded DNA into single strands. MacDonaldet al. (29MacDonald G.H. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol.

A model has been proposed whereby the YB-1-mediated induction of single-stranded regions in critical regulatory regions may prevent the binding or activity of positive transactivating factors. This model has the drawback that positive transactivation mediated by YB-1, as shown in our present study with mesangial cells, cannot be explained.Interactions of YB-1 or related proteins with the regulatory regions of a rather diverse set of genes have been reported. These include the above mentioned class II MHC genes, the multidrug resistance 1 gene, the myosin light chain 2v gene, and the genes for the epidermal growth factor receptor and γ-globin, among others (23Didier D.K.

These studies have demonstrated that within the individual gene contexts, YB-1 can act either in a positive or repressive manner to mediate transcription. In our current analysis, we demonstrated the unexpected finding that YB-1 can act on a single gene, the MMP-2 gene, in a positive or negative manner that is dependent upon the cellular context.Given the fact that nuclear extracts from both mesangial cells (positive transactivation) and GECs (repression) contain the YB-1 protein, it is likely that its mechanism of action is dependent upon either cell-specific interactions with the intrinsic MMP-2 promoter or upon the interaction of YB-1 with distinct transcriptional partner proteins. YB-1 interaction with transcriptional regulators has been described in several systems. For example, Zou and Chien (15Zou Y. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated the cell-specific activation of the myosin light chain 2v gene by YB-1 and have documented through immunoprecipitation techniques the interaction of YB-1 with a 30-kDa protein in cardiac muscle cells. Chen and colleagues (37Chen N.N. Chang C.-F. Gallia G.L. Kerr D.A. Johnson E.M. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S. Frisque R. Bollag B. Khalili K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The decreased electrophorectic mobility of the MMP-2 RE1 oligonucleotide when incubated with mesangial cell nuclear extracts, as compared with either recombinant YB-1 protein or GEC extracts, strongly suggests the presence of an additional partner protein(s). While immune precipitation studies of radiolabeled nuclear extracts of mesangial cells using the anti-YB-1 antibody do not indicate the presence of preformed YB-1-partner protein complexes, we have recently recovered two nuclear proteins of 34 and 67 kDa size when the incubation includes the MMP-2 RE1 oligonucleotide. 2P. R. Mertens and D. H. Lovett, unpublished observation.In summary, the current study has documented the transcriptional regulation of yet another critical growth regulatory factor, MMP-2, by YB-1. Future studies aimed at the characterization of mesangial cell-specific YB-1 transcriptional partner proteins may be expected to provide additional insights into the regulation of MMP-2 transcription and may offer alternative strategies for the pharmacologic regulation of this growth and differentiation determinant. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MC, mesangial cell; GEC, glomerular epithelial cell; IRE, interferon response element; SV40, simian virus 40; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift; bp, base pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine.1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MC, mesangial cell; GEC, glomerular epithelial cell; IRE, interferon response element; SV40, simian virus 40; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift; bp, base pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. which include the interstitial collagenases, stromelysins 1–3, matrilysin, 92-kDa gelatinase B (MMP-9), and the 72-kDa gelatinase A (MMP-2), constitute a family of matrix-degrading enzymes with distinctive extracellular matrix substrate specificities. These enzymes are characterized by activity at neutral pH, secretion in latent, proenzyme forms, dependence upon zinc for catalytic activity, and inhibition by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1–3 (1Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). While MMP-2 and MMP-9 share similar substrate specificities, encompassing type IV and V collagen, fibronectin, and laminin (2Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L.

Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their patterns of expression are distinct. MMP-2 has been the focus of considerable interest, since high level expression of this enzyme in metastatic tumor cells correlates with overall metastatic potential (4Sreenath T. Matrisian L.M. Stetler-Stevenson W. Gattoni-Celli S. Pozzatti R.O. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4942-4947PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar), presumably due to enhanced degradation of the major basal membrane component, Type IV collagen. Furthermore, MMP-2 is of importance in inflammatory reactions found in numerous tissues, including the kidney. The development of the sclerotic lesion in chronic glomerulosclerosis is temporally correlated with high level expression of MMP-2 (6Carome M.A. Striker L.J. Peten E.P. Elliot S.J. Yang C.W. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Reponen P. Tryggvason K. Striker G.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 5 (1391): 1391PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, MMP-2 acts not only as a matrix-degrading enzyme but also directly stimulates growth by glomerular mesangial cells (MC) (7Turck J. Pollock A.S. Lee L.K. Marti H.-P. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15074-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with assumption of an inflammatory phenotype characterized by increased synthesis of prosclerotic interstitial collagens. Although in most cell culture systems MMP-2 expression is constitutive in nature, there are cells described with a differentially regulated expression of MMP-2 both in vivo and in vitro. For example, MMP-2 is highly expressed in a temporally limited pattern in the developing murine lung and kidney (8Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Huhtala P. Hurskainen T. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7856-7862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, MMP-2 expression by MCs can be stimulated with interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β (9Marti H.-P. Lee L. Kashgarian M. Lovett D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 82-94PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region up to −1686 bp relative to the translation start site of the rat MMP-2 gene was recently evaluated for the existence of MC-specific regulatory elements (10Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), with the resultant identification of an apparently unique, 40-bp cis-acting enhancer element located at −1282 to −1322 bp relative to the translation start site, designated MMP-2 RE1. The MMP-2 RE1 confers cell-specific transactivation of luciferase reporter constructs containing MMP-2 RE1 in conjunction with either the homologous MMP-2 or a heterologous SV40 promoter. Furthermore, specific DNA binding activity to this element was demonstrated in MC nuclear extracts (10Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although nuclear protein binding activity to this enhancer element was also detected in other cell types, positive transactivation in conjunction with the homologous MMP-2 promoter was confined to MCs. Given these findings, we set out to identify the MC nuclear protein binding activity that interacts with the MMP-2 RE1 by expression screening of a MC cDNA library. These studies have identified the transcription factor YB-1 as a component of the MMP-2 transactivating complex. YB-1 was found to preferentially bind both the sense and antisense single-stranded components of the MMP-2 RE1, as compared with double-stranded DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2021237189,"The mdm2 oncogene encodes a 90-kDa protein that can bind to the p53 tumor suppressor protein and negatively regulate its functions in transcription, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. The mdm2 gene is frequently amplified in human sarcomas, which may be responsible for the malignant transformations. We present evidence that the mdm2 oncoprotein is cleaved by an interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-like protease (caspase) during p53-mediated apoptosis. The protease that cleaves mdm2 has a specificity similar to that of CPP32 (caspase-3), and recombinant caspase-3 is able to cleave mdm2 in vitro. The protease cleavage site has been mapped to between residue 361 and 362 of human mdm2. The proteolytic cleavage removes the COOH-terminal RING finger domain of mdm2, resulting in the loss of RNA binding activity. The p53 binding and inhibition functions of mdm2 are not affected by the cleavage. The cleavage site sequence of mdm2 is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that regulation by caspase cleavage during apoptosis is an important feature of mdm2.

The cleavage site sequence of mdm2 is evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that regulation by caspase cleavage during apoptosis is an important feature of mdm2. The mdm2 oncogene was first cloned as an amplified gene on a murine double-minute chromosome in the 3T3DM cell line, a spontaneously transformed derivative of BALB/c 3T3 cells (1Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The gene encodes a 489-amino acid polypeptide that contains a p53 binding domain, an acidic region, and three putative zinc-binding motifs (one zinc finger and two RING fingers). It was shown that overexpression of the mdm2 gene in NIH 3T3 cells increased the tumorigenic potential of these cells, thus establishing mdm2 as an oncogene (1Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The mdm2 gene can immortalize rat embryo fibroblasts and cooperate with the activated ras oncogene to transform these cells (2Finlay C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The mdm2 gene is amplified or overexpressed in about 40–60% of human osteogenic sarcomas and about 30% of soft tissue sarcomas (3Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 794-799PubMed Google Scholar), implicating its role in the development of these malignancies. An important function of mdm2 is to bind to the p53 tumor suppressor protein, inhibiting its ability to act as a transcription factor (5Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). p53 plays an essential role in the prevention of tumor development in humans. More than 50% of all human cancers have mutations of the p53 gene (6Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7479) Google Scholar). Humans or mice carrying germline mutations of p53 are at high risk for the development of multiple forms of malignancies at young ages (7Malkin D. Li F.P. Strong L.C. Fraumeni J.F. Nelson C.E.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar,16Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), suggesting that mdm2 can function as a negative feedback regulator of p53. Mouse embryos with inactivated mdm2 alleles die shortly after implantation. However, mice carrying inactivatedmdm2 and p53 are viable (17Oca Luna R.M. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 18Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). This suggests that an important function of mdm2 is negative regulation of p53. In cell culture experiments, mdm2 overexpression abrogates the ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (19Chen C.Y. Oliner J.D. Zhan Q. Fornace Jr., A.J. Vogelstein B. Kastan M.B.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5048-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These activities may also be responsible for or contribute to the transforming properties of mdm2. An important event during apoptosis is the activation of proteases with homology to interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (ICE), 1The abbreviations used are: ICE, interleukin 1β-converting enzyme; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. which are now named caspases (26Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.L. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). Caspases are cysteine proteases with the unique property of cleaving Asp-Xaa bonds (where Xaa is a small hydrophobic residue) (27Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Thornberry N. Ding G.J.F. Limjuco G. Weidner J. Salley J.P. Hogquist K.A. Chaplin D.D. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2964-2969PubMed Google Scholar). The critical role of caspases in the control of programmed cell death was first revealed by genetic studies of lower organisms. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has an ICE homolog Ced3 that is necessary for the normal developmental cell death in this organism (28Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). More than 10 homologs of ICE have been isolated (26Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.L. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). Overexpression of caspases can induce apoptosis in mammalian cells (29Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J.

Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibitors of an ICE homolog CPP32 (caspase-3) efficiently inhibit the apoptosis of human cells, suggesting that the proteolytic cleavage of proteins by caspase-3 is important for the induction of apoptosis (32Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). To date, a small number of cellular proteins have been found to be substrates of caspases. Some of these substrates are poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (33Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G.

Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known how proteolytic cleavages of these proteins may result in or contribute to the apoptosis phenotype. Because some of these known substrates are involved in cellular repair, it has been suggested that destruction of proteins in nuclear homeostatic pathways may be an important mechanism of cell death induction (44Casciola-Rosen L.

In this report we show that during p53-mediated apoptosis, the mdm2 protein induced by p53 is cleaved by an apoptosis-specific protease. The cleavage inactivates the RNA binding function of mdm2 without affecting p53 binding. Cleavage by the apoptosis protease is an evolutionarily conserved feature of mdm2, and human, mouse, andXenopus mdm2 proteins can all serve as substrates for the mouse apoptosis protease. The cleavage site sequence is also present in the recently isolated mdm2 homolog mdmx. These results suggest that cleavage by the apoptosis protease is an important feature of mdm2 which may regulate or inactivate its functions during apoptosis. A partial cDNA clone of the human PARP protein was obtained by PCR amplification of a HeLa cDNA library using primers PARP-ATG (5′-CGGGATCCGAGGATGGCGGAGTCTTCGG-3′) and PARP-UAG (5′-CGGGATCCTAAGAGATTTCTCGGAATTC-3′). A 1.1-kilobase PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and inserted into the pBluescript vector (Promega). In vitro translation of the plasmid using the TNT-coupled in vitro transcription and translation system (Promega) generated a protein product of ∼38 kDa. This PARP fragment contains a cleavage site for CPP32 (caspase-3) between residues 216 and 217 (45Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). To obtain the mdm2 mutant representing the protease cleavage fragment (amino acids 1–361), plasmid pHDM1A containing a full-length human mdm2 cDNA (46Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) was amplified using a primer HDM361N (5′-CCGGATCCTCAATCAGGAACATCAAAG-3′) and a T7 promoter primer in a PCR with the Pfu DNA polymerase. The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and cloned into pBluescript. To obtain a clone encoding the COOH-terminal cleavage product (amino acid 362–491), pHDM100–491 (46Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) was amplified with primer HDM362N (5′-CCGGATCCACCATGTGTAAAAAAACTATGTGA-3′) and a T7 primer. The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and cloned into pBluescript. The clones were sequenced to confirm that there are no PCR-introduced mutations. To construct mammalian cell expression vectors (pCHDM1–361, pCHDM362–491), these two mutants were excised from the pBluescript vector and inserted into the BamHI site of the pCMV-neo-Bam vector (47Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Xenopus laevis mdm2 (xdm2) clone and sequence were derived from the work of V. Marechal et al. (48Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Taneyhill L. Piette J. Mechali M. Nicolas J.C. Levine A.J. Moareau J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a Chameleon double-stranded DNA mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. The primer HDM361A (5′-CTTTGATGTTCCTGCTTGTAAAAAAAC-3′) was used to change codon 361 of human mdm2 from aspartic acid to alanine. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The VM10 cells were maintained at 39 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 500 μg/ml G418, and 200 units/ml hygromycine. To obtain apoptotic cells, the cells grown to ∼70% confluence were shifted to a 32 °C incubator for 6 h. The plates were scraped, and both floating and attached cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Nonapoptotic cells were obtained by scraping plates kept at 39 °C to harvest both floating and attached cells. The cytosol was prepared using a procedure described by Nicholsonet al. (32Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was suspended in 3 volumes of cytosol buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mmEDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin A, 50 μm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The mixture was homogenized by 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was stored at −70 °C. To test for protease cleavage, PARP or mdm2 plasmids were translatedin vitro using the TNT system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. 2–5 μl of the translation product was mixed with 20 μl of the cytosol, incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and autoradiography. Tetrapeptide-aldehyde inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO were purchased from Bachem. They were dissolved in cytosol buffer and added to the apoptotic cytosol at indicated concentrations before the addition of substrates. Synthetic mdm2 and PARP cleavage site peptides were obtained from the Core Laboratories of LSU Medical Center. 5 mg of each peptide was dissolved in 0.25 ml of 50 mm PIPES-HCl (pH 7.4). 3 μl of 5 n NaOH was then added to obtain a final pH of ∼7.0. The peptides were used at 0.5 mmconcentration in the cytosol cleavage assay. VM10 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and 5 mg (∼1 ml) of total protein was immunoprecipitated using 200 μl of anti-mdm2 monoclonal antibody 2A10 hybridoma supernatant and 20 μl (packed volume) of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the immunoprecipitate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The fractionated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter using a semidry electroblotting apparatus for 1 h. The filter was blocked for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% non-fat dry milk and then incubated for 1 h with a 1/1,000 dilution of a rabbit anti-mdm2 serum in PBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk. The filter was then washed four times (5 min each) with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The bound primary antibody was detected by incubating for 1 h with protein A-peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) diluted in PBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk. The filter was washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then developed using the enhanced chemiluminescense method (ECL, Amersham). Both primary and secondary antibody incubations were carried out at room temperature. An immunoprecipitation was necessary because of the low abundance of mdm2. The short transfer and incubation times reduced the renaturation of Ig heavy chain and its binding by protein A-peroxidase. A cDNA clone of the human CPP32β protease was kindly provided by Dr. Emad S. Alnemri (30Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA was used as template for a PCR containing primers p17-ATG (5′-CGGGATCCATGTCTGGAATATCCCTGGAC-3′), CPP-UAA3 (5′-CGGGATCCGTGATAAAAATAGAGTTCTT-3′), and the Pfu DNA polymerase. The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of the pQE12 vector (Qiagen), resulting in the addition of 6 histidines to the COOH terminus of CPP32. Escherichia coli XL1 blue transformed by the recombinant plasmid was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h during logarithmic growth. The cells were lysed under nondenaturing conditions, the lysate was passed through a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) and the column was eluted with imidazole as recommended by the manufacturer. A mock purification was also performed using E. coli transformed with the pQE12 vector. SDS-PAGE and silver staining of the purified protease indicated that the recombinant protein was present as two bands of 17 and 12 kDa. A single contaminant band (∼50 kDa) with intensity similar to that of the 12-kDa subunit was also present in the purified enzyme preparation as well as the mock purification product. The two enzyme subunits and the 50-kDa band together were estimated to account for >90% of the protein in the preparation. Approximately 100 μg of enzyme was purified from 1 liter of bacteria culture. E. coli transformed with GST-p53 fusion protein expression plasmids (46Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) were grown to an optical density at 595 nm of 0.8, 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the cells were grown for 3 h. The cells from 250 ml of culture were then pelleted, resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, lysed by sonication, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) were washed with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.5% nonfat milk. Twenty μl (packed volume) of beads was incubated with 0.5 ml ofE. coli lysate for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with BII buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol). 10 μl of in vitro translation lysate containing35S-labeled mdm2 was mixed with an equal volume of cytosol buffer and incubated with 0.02 ng/μl recombinant CPP32 for 1 h at 37 °C. The cleaved mdm2 was then incubated with the loaded glutathione beads in 200 μl of BII buffer for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. The beads were washed with 0.5 × SNNTE (2.5% sucrose, 2.5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40), boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. U2-OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. In a transient transfection, 2 × 106 cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes for 24 h and transfected with 5 μg of pCOSX1-CAT (p53-responsive) or pTi-CAT (basal promoter only) (15Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar) and 10 μg of mdm2 plasmid (pCHDM1A for full-length mdm2 (49Chen J. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 142-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pCHDM1–361 and pCHDM362–491 described above) using the calcium phosphate precipitate protocol. The transfected cells were washed and refed 16 h after the addition of DNA and were harvested 48 h after addition of DNA. 100 μl of cytoplasmic extracts was prepared from each 10-cm plate. CAT assays were performed using 50 μl of extract adjusted to identical protein concentrations in a 150-μl reaction containing 0.8 mm acetyl-coenzyme A, 0.2 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol, and 0.25 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). Conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was detected by thin layer chromatography. Poly(A)-agarose, poly(G)-agarose, and poly(C)-agarose were obtained from Sigma. Poly(U)-agarose was obtained from Pharmacia. Human mdm2 was synthesized by in vitro translation of plasmid pHDM1A (46Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translation product was mixed with an equal volume of cytosol buffer and then incubated with purified recombinant CPP32 (0.02 μg/μl) for 1 h at 37 °C. RNA binding was carried out as described previously (24Elenbaas B. Matthias D. Roth J. Shenk T. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 439-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA-agarose beads were washed with RNA-binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μm ZnCl2, 2% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). 30 μl of the translation-cleavage product was incubated with about 20 μg of RNA in a total volume of 250 μl of RNA-binding buffer. The tubes were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The RNA-agarose beads were then washed three times with RNA-binding buffer. The beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the bound proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A murine cell line (VM10) that expresses a CMV promoter-driven mouse c-myc oncogene and a SV40 promoter-driven temperature-sensitive murine p53 mutant (Val135) was described previously (20Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The VM10 cells grow normally at 39 °C when the p53 protein is at a mutant conformation. When the cells are incubated at 32 °C, the p53 protein switches to the wild type conformation, and the cells die by apoptosis. To obtain apoptotic cells, VM10 cells that were maintained at 39 °C were transferred to an 32 °C incubator for 6 h. This treatment causes 30–40% of the cells to fragment their DNA and detach from the plate (20Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Cytosol was prepared from these apoptotic cells as well as the nonapoptotic VM10 cells cultured at 39 °C and incubated with a radiolabeled PARP fragment (amino acids 1–343) synthesized by in vitro translation. We found that the PARP fragment was cleaved into a 26-kDa product when incubated with the cytosol prepared from apoptotic VM10 cells but not from the nonapoptotic VM10 cells (data not shown). Therefore, the PARP-cleaving protease, probably CPP32 (caspase-3), is activated during p53-mediated apoptosis in the VM10 cells. To determine whether the mdm2 oncoprotein is a substrate of apoptotic proteases, in vitro translated human mdm2 protein was incubated with the VM10 apoptotic and nonapoptotic cytosol. This treatment resulted in the cleavage of human mdm2 into two fragments of 60 and 32 kDa by the apoptotic cytosol (Fig.1). In the same experiment, mouse andXenopus mdm2 were also cleaved by the apoptotic VM10 cytosol. This mdm2 cleavage activity is absent in the nonapoptotic cytosol. Other in vitro translated proteins, including p53, TATA-binding protein, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p57, p21, and p16, were not cleaved in this assay (data not shown), suggesting that the apoptotic protease that cleaves mdm2 is highly specific. To determine whether the endogenous mdm2 in the VM10 cells is also cleaved during apoptosis, lysates were prepared from the VM10 cells cultured at 39 °C or 32 °C and analyzed by Western blot using anti-mdm2 serum. This experiment showed that the endogenous murine mdm2 is cleaved into a ∼55-kDa fragment in cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 2). A lower molecular mass mdm2 protein, which is believed to result from the use of an alternative translation start codon at residue 50 (50Olson D.C. Marechal V. Momand J. Chen J. Romocki C. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2353-2360PubMed Google Scholar), is also cleaved, resulting in the appearance of a double band. No cleavage of mdm2 was observed in the parental cell line Val5 (expresses temperature-sensitive p53 but does not overexpress c-myc) which only undergoes growth arrest after p53 activation. Using a monoclonal antibody 4B11 that reacts with the COOH terminus of mdm2 (46Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), we were not able to detect the presence of the COOH-terminal fragment in the apoptotic VM10 cells. When the human U2-OS osteosarcoma cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the COOH-terminal fragment (pCHDM362–491), its expression in these nonapoptotic cells can be detected readily by 4B11 (data not shown), indicating that the absence of detectable COOH-terminal fragment in apoptotic VM10 cells is not the result of technical problems. It is likely that the COOH-terminal fragment is degraded rapidly once generated in the apoptotic cells. Activation of the mdm2-cleaving protease is not unique to p53-mediated apoptosis. The human leukemia cell line HL60, which is devoid of endogenous p53, also activates the mdm2-cleaving protease when induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with the DNA-damaging drug etoposide (data not shown). Using a series of in vitro translated mdm2 deletion mutants constructed previously (46Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), the apoptotic cleavage site on mdm2 was mapped to a region between residues 350 and 397 of mdm2 (Fig.3, A and B). Within this region of mdm2, there is a stretch of amino acids with the sequence 355-EGFDVPDCKK-364 which resembles the known cleavage sites of the cysteine protease CPP32 (RKGDEVD/GVD of PARP, “/” represents the cleavage site) (45Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). This sequence is highly conserved among human, mouse, and Xenopus mdm2 (Fig.3 C). The DVPD se"

Using human placental AP (PLAP) as a paradigm, we have investigated whether the monomers in a given PLAP dimer are subject to cooperativity during catalysis following an allosteric model or act via a half-of-sites model, in which at any time only one single monomer is operative.

Upon full metalation with Zn2+, however, the negative cooperativity disappeared. To distinguish between an allosteric and a half-of-sites model, a [Gly429]PLAP-[Ser84]PLAP heterodimer was produced by combining monomers displaying high and low sensitivity to the uncompetitive inhibitor l-Leu as well as a [Gly429]PLAP-[Ala92]PLAP heterodimer combining a catalytically active and inactive monomer, respectively. The l-Leu inhibition profile of the [Gly429]PLAP-[Ser84]PLAP heterodimer was intermediate to that for each homodimer as predicted by the allosteric model. Likewise, the [Gly429]PLAP-[Ala92]PLAP heterodimer was catalytically active, confirming that AP monomers act independently of each other. Although heterodimers are structurally asymmetrical, they migrate in starch gels with a smaller than expected weighted electrophoretic mobility, are more stable to heat denaturation than expected, and are more sensitive to l-Leu inhibition than predicted by a strict noncooperative model. We conclude that fully metalated mammalian APs are noncooperative allosteric enzymes but that the stability and catalytic properties of each monomer are controlled by the conformation of the second AP subunit.

Alkaline phosphatases (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, alkaline phosphatase; PLAP, placental AP; GCAP, germ cell AP; pNPP,p-nitrophenylphosphate; DEA, diethanolamine; wt, wild type. are ubiquitous enzymes found in most species from bacteria to man (1McComb R.B. Bowers G.N. Posen S. Alkaline Phosphatases. Plenum Press, New York1979Crossref Google Scholar). Human APs are encoded by four genes (reviewed in Refs. 2Millán J.L. Anticancer Res. 1988; 8: 995-1004PubMed Google Scholar and 3Harris H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 186: 133-150Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar), i.e. the placental (PLAP), germ cell (GCAP), intestinal, and tissue-nonspecific AP isozyme, respectively. APs are dimeric metalloenzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic transfer of phosphate to water or its transphosphorylation to amino alcohols (4Coleman J.E. Gettins P. Spiro T.G. Metal Ions in Biology. 5. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1983: 153-217Google Scholar), but when separated the monomeric subunits fail to display enzyme activity. Three metal ions (two Zn2+ an one Mg2+) in the active site (5Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) are essential for enzymatic activity. However, these metal ions also contribute substantially to the conformation of the AP monomer and indirectly regulate subunit-subunit interactions (6Cioni P. Piras L. Strambini G.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fully metalated Escherichia coli AP dimers are symmetrical, both by crystallographic measurements and spectroscopic methods (7Coleman J.E. Gettins P. Gray H. Bertini J. Progress in Inorganic Biochemistry and Biophysics: Zn Enzymes. 1. Birkhauser, Boston1986: 77-99Google Scholar), but partially metalated dimers manifest structural asymmetry. As a result of such molecular asymmetry, APs have been claimed to be capable of accepting only one single-substrate molecule in a half-of-sites reactivity mechanism and to display negative cooperativity (8Harris M.I. Coleman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5063-5073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chlebowski J.F. Armitage I.M. Tusa P.P. Coleman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1207-1216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of cooperativity for the interaction between AP subunits has been investigated intensively in the E. coli enzyme, and evidence for both the existence of positive and negative cooperativity has been presented (10Simpson R.T. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Gettins P. Coleman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4991-4997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During early studies, hybrid E. coli AP dimers were formed using mixtures of native and partially modified enzyme forms during a random reconstitution step following denaturation of the dimers with chaotropic agents (12Bloch W. Schlesinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1760-1768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Meighen E. Yue R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 412: 262-272Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). More recently, heterodimers were generated upon controlled proteolysis ofE. coli AP, not necessitating any AP denaturation (14Olafsdottir S. Chlebowski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4529-4535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter study of the resulting hybrid APs clearly indicated asymmetry in these hybrids both in terms of structure and function, pointing to catalytically relevant subunit communication in the AP enzyme. Mammalian APs have a unique surface loop not present in the E. coli enzyme that extends from amino acids 400–430 (15Tsonis A. Argraves W.S. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 623-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This loop has been shown to play an important role in defining the conformation and stability of the AP molecule (16Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The loop is also partially responsible for the interaction of APs with extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen (17Bossi M. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that this loop is responsible for the unique property of mammalian APs of being uncompetitively inhibited by a number of amino acids and small peptides (17Bossi M. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We and others have found that a single amino acid substitution, E429G, was primarily responsible for the differential inhibition of PLAP and GCAP by l-Leu (19Hummer C. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Watanabe T. Wada N. Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21174-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of inhibition was further modulated by a second substitution, N84S, in GCAP, causing a conformational change in the molecule accompanied by a 50% drop in the degree of inhibition by l-Leu (16Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because the [Gly429]PLAP 2The mutants are named as follows: [Gly429]PLAP, [G]PLAP, PLAP mutant containing an E429G substitution; [Ser84]PLAP, [S]PLAP, PLAP mutant containing an N84S substitution; [Ala92]PLAP, [A]PLAP, PLAP mutant containing an S92A substitution; [RGR]PLAP, PLAP mutant containing P209R, E429G, and P479R substitutions; [S]PLAP-t, PLAP mutant containing a 410TESESGSPE418 to a SMDVYAHNN substitution.and the [Ser84]PLAP mutants display a 100-fold difference in K i for l-Leu, heterodimers of these mutants provided an optimal test system to study AP subunit interactions and negative cooperativity for mammalian APs. In this paper we report that AP dimers display negative cooperativity when the AP monomers are partially demetalated, but both AP monomers function essentially independently when both subunits are properly metalated. This behavior of mammalian APs fits the definition of an allosteric enzyme. The PLAP mutants [Ser84]PLAP ([S]PLAP) and [Gly429]PLAP ([G]PLAP) have been described elsewhere (19Hummer C. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two charged substitutions, P209R and P479R, were introduced into the [G]PLAP cDNA to generate the [RGR]PLAP mutant. In addition, an S92A mutation was superimposed onto [RGR]PLAP to replace the active site S92 thus producing an inactive AP molecule ([ARGR]PLAP). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described (21Tomic M. Sunjevaric I. Savtchenko E.S. Blumenberg M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The sequence of the mutagenesis primer pairs were as follows (underlined bases indicate changes): S92A, 5′-CTCTTCCGCTGGAGCCACAGCCACGGC-3′ and 5′-CTCTTCCAGCGTCTGGCACATGTTTGTC-3′; P209R, 5′-CTCTTCATGTTTCGCATGGGGACCC-3′ and 5′-CTCTTCAACATGTACTTTCGGCCTCC-3′; P479R, 5′-CTCTTCTGGCGCCCGCCGCCGGCACC-3′ and 5′-CTCTTCCGCCAGGTCGCAGGCGGTGTAG-3′. Finally, the sequence TESESGSPE at positions 410–418 in [S]PLAP was replaced by SMDVYAHNN to produce the heat-labile mutant [S]PLAP-t (17Bossi M. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mutant PLAP cDNAs were subcloned into the pSVT7 vector (22Bird P. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. J. Cell. Biol. 1987; 105: 2905-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells (23Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar), and transfected cells were selected (19Hummer C. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At confluency, the double transfectants were washed with 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 140 mm NaCl. Cultured cells were extracted with a 1:1 mixture of butanol and 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% merthiolate. The pH in these extracts was then titrated to 7.5 with 1.0 m Tris, and butanol was removed by evaporation. JEG3-choriocarcinoma cells were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations (0–4 mm) of sodium butyrate to progressively induce GCAP (24Ito F. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2526-2530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following overnight dialysis and neuraminidase treatment (1 unit/ml), [S]PLAP-[RGR]PLAP heterodimers were separated from their respective parent homodimers by cation-exchange chromatography on Mono-S Sepharose in 20 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.8, and elution with a linear NaCl gradient (0–250 μm). AP kinetic determinations were performed as described previously (18Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) as substrate in 1.0 m diethanolamine (DEA) buffer, pH 9.8, containing 20 μm ZnCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2. Experiments in the absence of transphosphorylation acceptors were performed in 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 μmZnCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2. To investigate the role of metal ions on the existence of enzyme cooperativity, [G]PLAP was treated with Chelex for 24 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mmNaCl, after which Michaelis-Menten kinetics were studied for various degrees of metalation using buffered substrate treated with Chelex. Isolated homo- and heterodimeric APs were tested for their time-dependent inactivation at 56 °C as described (25Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and enzyme catalysis by the dimers in the presence of 0–1.0m guanidinium chloride was tested in 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20 μmZnCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2. Double reciprocal plots were constructed via linear regression analysis by correlating initial rates of pNPP conversion with substrate concentration, using the GRAFIT version 3.0 Erithacus software. For experiments performed in the presence of EDTA, inhibition constants (K i) were derived from the experimental inhibitor concentrations and the calculated slopes of the fitted regression lines by introducing both parameters in the proper expression for the initial rate. TheK i values were then calculated for several concentrations of inhibitor as the means ± S.D. To confirm the validity of residual enzyme level predictions during AP inhibition byl-Leu, the experimental and the predicted residual AP activities of [S]PLAP and [G]PLAP homodimers were correlated via regression analysis, for inhibitions at equal concentrations ofl-Leu. To statistically identify the kinetic model dictating AP enzyme catalysis (see below), residual experimental AP levels for [S]PLAP-[G]PLAP heterodimers were also correlated via linear regression analysis with residual enzyme levels at equal concentrations of l-Leu, as predicted by each separate kinetic model. Statistically weighted numerical values forK m were calculated as described by Wilkinson, including determination of standard errors of the mean (26Wilkinson G.N. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2724) Google Scholar). The general scheme for the AP-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphate substrates can be summarized as shown in Scheme FSI (4Coleman J.E. Gettins P. Spiro T.G. Metal Ions in Biology. 5. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1983: 153-217Google Scholar). Whereas at low pH E-P accumulates, at alkaline pH the dissociation of E·P is rate-limiting. However, in the presence of a transphosphorylating amino alcohol (R2OH), the enzyme is readily regenerated. Certain amino acids inhibit AP by blocking both hydrolysis and transphosphorylation of the E-P complex, thus explaining why this inhibition is uncompetitive (18Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,27Byers D.A. Fernley H.N. Walker P.G Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 29: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The AP catalysis can be described by simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, although both K m and k cat are complex functions of the rate constants, as depicted in Scheme FSI. However, to study subunit interactions and cooperativity and to comply with the dimeric nature of the AP enzyme, AP catalysis can better be represented by the generalized model applicable for allosteric enzymes (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. J. Wiley and Sons, New York1975Google Scholar) (Scheme FSII). In this model,K 1 and K 2 represent the Michaelis constants for both subunits respectively, whereask 1 and k 2 stand for the catalytic rate constants for each monomer. For a classical noncooperative allosteric dimeric enzyme, K 1= K 2 and k 1 =k 2, the kinetic analysis of these enzymes being described accurately by linear Lineweaver-Burk plots, withk cat = 2k 1 andK m = K 1 (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. J. Wiley and Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). However, because PLAP, respectively [S]PLAP, and GCAP, respectively [RGR]PLAP, have slightly different kinetic constants, in the case of [S]PLAP-[RGR]PLAP heterodimers Scheme FSII would be more accurately described by the following rate equation, at least for enzyme heterodimers in which both monomers act independently:v=*E1E2*ok11+K1*S*o+k21+K2*S*oEquation 1 with [E 1 E 2]obeing the total AP concentration and k 1,K 1 respectively k 2,K 2 being the rate constants and Michaelis constants for the individual AP subunits. Linear Lineweaver-Burk kinetics can be anticipated from Equation 1, based on previously determined kinetic constants for [S]PLAP and [RGR]PLAP, respectively, with k cat =k 1 + k 2. TheK m corresponds to the positive solution of the following second order function:(k1+k2)Km2+(k1−k2)(K2−K1)Km−(k1+k2)K1K2=0Equation 2 This analysis assumes that in the heterodimers each monomer will catalyze phosphate substrates with similar catalytic efficiencies as in the parent homodimers. Whereas no linear kinetics can arise when the SE 1 E 2S intermediate would be the only active enzyme-substrate complex metabolized (i.e. SE 1 E 2and E 1 E 2S are inactive), linear kinetics are also predicted when only one of both subunits (i.e. only SE 1 E 2 and notE 1 E 2S) participates in the catalysis (i.e. k 2 = 0), because then Equation 1 reduces to a simple Michaelis-Menten form andk cat = k 1 andK m = K 1. Such a situation would arise if as a result of structural cross-talk between both AP monomers; the second AP monomer is shut off for substrate positioning as a consequence of substrate binding to the first subunit, in agreement with a half-of-sites model. The reaction rate would then reduce to:V=*k2/K2+k1/K1**E1E2*o*1/K2+1/K1*+1/*S*oEquation 3 withkcat=(k2/K2+k1/K1)(1/K1+1/K2)*and*Km=K1K2K1+K2Equation 4 and describe a mechanism that results in linear double reciprocal plots of enzyme activity versus substrate over a wide range of substrate concentrations. Formally, under those conditions, enzyme kinetics for AP heterodimers match those for equal mixtures of both homodimers, with comparable degrees of saturation. In this model homodimeric APs are described kinetically byk cat = k 1 andK m = K 1/2. Formally this model also describes the kinetics of a heterodimer composed of one active and one inactive monomer, both in an allosteric and in a half-of-sites model. When SE 1 E 2S is only formed at much higher substrate concentrations than required to form either SE 1 E 2 orE 1 E 2S, nonlinear double reciprocal plots of enzyme activity versus substrate concentration will be found even for homodimers, typical of negative cooperativity, as can be substantiated from Equation 1, because both AP monomers would be nonequivalent. It is clear that the above equations do not enable an easy distinction between the allosteric and the half-of-sites model. The uncompetitive amino acid inhibitor l-Leu on the contrary enabled us to further distinguish between Equations 1 and 3. Uncompetitive inhibition of AP homo- and heterodimers was carried out at saturating concentrations of pNPP (10 mm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of l-Leu (0–50 mm), and the residual AP activity was measured. Because at high [pNPP] in the allosteric model (Equation 1) only the substrate intermediate SE 1 E 2S is metabolized, schematically the inhibition of AP heterodimers can be represented as in Scheme FSIII and be described by the following rate equation:V=*E1E2*ok11+*I*o/Ki1+k21+*I*o/Ki2Equation 5 On the contrary, according to the half-site model at saturating [pNPP], the inhibition is represented as in SchemeFSIV with the following rate equation:V=*E1E2*o*k1/K1+k2/K2*1/K1*1+*I*o/Ki1*+1/K2*1+*I*o/Ki2*Equation 6 Based on the known values of k 1,k 2, K 1,K 2, K i 1, andK i 2 (18Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and assuming no asymmetry-dependent cross-talk between both monomers in a nonsymmetrical heterodimer, it is possible to predict residual AP activities in the presence of l-Leu, according to both models (Equation 5, respectively 4) and to compare these predicted enzyme levels with actual data collected for heterodimers between [S]PLAP and [G]PLAP forms. Double reciprocal plots of enzyme activity versus the concentration of pNPP were linear for various EDTA concentrations tested (rranging from 0.988 to 0.999) and intersected on the y axis (mean ± S.D. of the intersection equalledA 405 nm−1 = 1.63 ± 0.26), compatible with competitive inhibition (Fig.1 A). Thus [S]PLAP activity was inhibited by EDTA with a K i equal to 0.51 ± 0.06 mm, indicative of the high stability of active site bound Zn2+ ions; wt PLAP was likewise inhibited with aK i equal to 0.87 ± 0.3 mm. In agreement with these data, [S]PLAP could not be demetalated by Chelex, not even after prolonged incubations (not shown). On the contrary, [G]PLAP was also inhibited competitively by EDTA (Fig.1 B; r of the regression lines ranging from 0.994 to 0.998; intersection atA 405 nm−1 = 3.3 ± 0.1), but with a K i equal to 19 ± 1.4 μm. GCAP was inhibited to the same degree as [G]PLAP, with an inhibition constant equal to K i = 26 ± 6 μm. These data indicate that EDTA has a 30–40-fold higher affinity for Zn2+ metal ions located in the GCAP (and [G]PLAP) active site than for those in the PLAP active site. In agreement with the different accessibility of l-Leu in the PLAP and [G]PLAP active sites, these large differences in the affinity of Zn2+ can be ascribed to the substitution of one single amino acid (E429G) in PLAP. When [G]PLAP, fully loaded with Zn2+, is diluted in Chelex-treated buffered substrate solutions, a progressive loss of the AP activity is observed over time, independently of the substrate concentration, as shown by the decreasing slope of AP activity plotsversus time (Fig.2 A). This behavior is in agreement with the rapid loss of [G]PLAP activity in the presence of EDTA and is indicative of the spontaneous dissociation of Zn2+ from the active site. Replots of the slopes of these curves versus time were linear (Fig. 2 B,r = −0.986 for the upper line and −0.945 for the lower line), i.e. compatible with a monophasic disappearance of enzyme activity with a half-life for the Zn2+ dissociation in 1 m DEA buffer, pH 9.8, estimated to be around 90 min. In agreement with the loosely bound Zn2+ ions, the overnight treatment with Chelex inactivated [G]PLAP completely. Fully metalated [G]PLAP incubated with increasing substrate concentrations up to 100 mm (1000-fold above the K m) in 1 m DEA buffer, pH 9.8, shows no evidence of negative cooperativity. On the contrary, a mild inhibition is observed at substrate concentrations exceeding 10 mm (not shown). Similarly, measurements at pH 7.5, in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 20 μm ZnCl2 and 0.5 mmof MgCl2 but no transphosphorylating alcohol still shows no evidence of negative cooperativity for pNPP up to 100 mm, at which concentration a clear-cut substrate inhibition of about 50% is observed (Fig. 3 A). Experiments in the presence of 0.5 m guanidinium chloride, claimed to enhance AP activity (29Rao N.M. Nagaraj R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5018-5024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), do not raise the AP activity measured at high pNPP concentrations, whereas in the presence of 1.0m guanidinium chloride, a clear-cut drop in enzyme activity is observed (Fig. 3 A). These experiments indicate that fully metalated APs do not display negative cooperativity. Whereas Chelex-treated [G]PLAP displays negligible enzyme activity, Zn2+ can restore the activity in a dose-dependent manner. Little or no activity is regained in the presence of 0.5 μm of ZnCl2, partial reconstitution is observed with 2.5 μm ZnCl2, and full reconstitution can be achieved in the presence of 20 μm ZnCl2 (Fig. 3 B), whereas the subsequent addition of MgCl2 does not further increase the enzyme activity (r = 0.996 for the 1/v versus 1/[S] plot of the reconstituted enzyme with an interceptA 405 nm−1 = 1.14 ± 0.04). Double reciprocal plots (Fig. 3 B) of AP activityversus [pNPP] for the enzyme reconstituted with 2.5 μm ZnCl2 are, however, linear only at low substrate concentrations (r = 0.999 for the linear part of the 1/v versus 1/[S] plot with a lowerV max as indicated by the higher intercept ofA 405 nm−1 = 3.16 ± 0.44) and display negative cooperativity. Because extrapolatedV max values are identical for the partially reconstituted and fully reconstituted enzyme, this implies that on substrate saturation both of the enzyme's sites are occupied and that they function with identical catalytic rates, i.e. even though partial metalation increases k 1, it does not affect the rate of phosphorylation k 2 and dephosphorylation k 3 (Scheme FSI). Together with the above findings, it follows that when fully metalated, AP dimers function noncooperatively. To further study whether AP monomers acted independently, we made use of the differentiall-Leu inhibition properties of PLAP and GCAP. Although the inhibition of wt GCAP (K i = 0.54 ± 0.01 mm) and wt PLAP (K i = 9.2 ± 1.2 mm) by l-Leu differ 17-fold, the inhibition of [S]PLAP (K i = 19 ± 1.5 mm) and [G]PLAP (K i = 0.2 ± 0.01 mm) differ 100-fold (18Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and these mutants were therefore chosen for our experiments. To optimize the chromatographic separation of the AP heterodimers we also engineered two charge replacements, P209R and P479R in [G]PLAP ([RGR]PLAP). These substitutions were chosen, because they represent known allelic mutations in PLAP and GCAP and neither of them affect the catalytic properties of the enzyme (18Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 illustrates the predicted inhibition curves of heterodimers constructed between PLAP and GCAP (Fig. 4 A) and between [S]PLAP and [G]PLAP (Fig.4 B) according to both test models. Whereas in the allosteric model an inhibition profile is expected to be intermediate between that of the AP homodimers, the half-of-sites model predicts an inhibition curve almost coinciding with that of the [G]PLAP mutant. A kinetic analysis of chromatographically purified homodimers revealed linear Lineweaver-Burk plots with K m values ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 mm for [S]PLAP and [S]PLAP-t (comparable with the known K m of wt PLAP) to 0.1–0.2 mm for the [RGR]PLAP mutants, comparable with those reported for [G]PLAP and wt GCAP (18Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and confirming that homo- and heterodimers could adequately be separated via ion-exchange chromatography. The value K m = 0.54 ± 0.13 mm determined for the [S]PLAP-t-[RGR]PLAP heterodimer was, however, higher than the expected K m values predicted by the models described by Equations 1 (expectedK m = 0.2 mm) and 3 (expectedK m = 0.14 mm), i.e. is higher than the weighted average of the parent molecules regardless of the model chosen. These data suggested structural asymmetry to influence AP subunit communication but made evident that a simple Michaelis-Menten analysis did not suffice to distinguish between models 1 and 2. According to Equations 5 and 6, the uncompetitive inhibition byl-Leu of a heterodimeric AP molecule is fundamentally different for an allosteric enzyme or a half-of-sites enzyme. Fig.5 A shows the l-Leu inhibition profiles for [S]PLAP-t-[RGR]PLAP heterodimers, in comparison with the inhibition curves obtained for the corresponding chromatographically isolated [S]PLAP-t and [RGR]PLAP homodimers. Both homodimers respond to l-Leu according to inhibition curves in good agreement with those predicted by Fig. 4 B and known to describe the inhibition by l-Leu of [S]PLAP and [G]PLAP, respectively. Experimentally measured [S]PLAP-t enzyme levels in the presence of l-Leu correlated well with predicted residual enzyme levels (Fig.6 A; r = 0.974, slope of the regression line equals 1.06 ± 0.08). Likewise, a good correlation existed between experimentally measured [RGR]PLAP enzyme levels in the presence of l-Leu and the predicted residual enzyme levels (Fig. 6 A; r = 0.98, slope of the regression line equals 0.93 ± 0.07). Correlating via linear regression analysis the biphasic intermediate inhibition curve derived for the isolated [S]PLAP-t-[RGR]PLAP heterodimers with residual AP enzyme levels as predicted by the allosteric model (Fig.6 B; r = 0.997 and slope = 1.02) and by the half-of-sites model (Fig. 6 B; r = 0.86 and slope = 0.75) revealed that this inhibition curve only matches the inhibition profile predicted by the allosteric model. Thus this analysis confirms that APs are allosteric enzymes and implies that covalently immobilizing a phosphate group by l-Leu in one active site (E-P intermediate) has no direct consequences for the catalytic efficiency of the adjacent subunit.Figure 6Correlation between experimental and predicted AP activity.

By mutagenizing the active site Ser92 (S92A) in the [RGR]PLAP mutant cDNA and co-transfecting [S]PLAP and this [ARGR]PLAP mutant, inactive [ARGR]PLAP homodimers were expected as well as half-active [S]PLAP-[ARGR]PLAP heterodimers and fully active [S]PLAP. Two active AP peaks were eluted from the ion-exchange column with the enzyme eluting at the heterodimer position yielding linear kinetics and confirming that within the context of a dimeric AP structure the active monomer can function independently of the inactive one. Whereas the [S]PLAP homodimer fraction was inhibited by l-Leu as expected (Fig. 5 B), the [S]PLAP-[ARGR]PLAP heterodimers were inhibited with a slightly higher efficacy with an apparent IC50 around 3 mm. These findings substantiate that the structural asymmetry in the heterodimers affects the three-dimensional configuration of the active site of the [S]PLAP monomer that results in an enhanced accessibility forl-Leu. The K m value (0.27 ± 0.03 mm) for pNPP was, however, within the range expected for a [S]PLAP-[ARGR]PLAP heterodimer in which only the [S]PLAP monomer is active. Fig.7 shows the well characterized electrophoretic migration on starch gel electrophoresis of the common F and S homodimeric allozymes of PLAP as well as the pattern for the heterozygous FS variant. The FS pattern displays a third band of activity corresponding to the heterodimeric F/S molecules, equidistant to the migration of the F and S homodimeric components. Resting JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells express relatively low levels of a PLAP, but when cultured in the presence of butyrate, these cells express GCAP (30Watanabe S. Watanabe T. Li W.B. Soong B.-W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31Hendrix P.G. Hoylaerts M.F. Nouwen E.J. De Broe M.E. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1793-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Starch gel electrophoresis of the desialylated AP extracted from JEG3 cells grown in the presence of increasing butyrate concentrations (Fig. 7) indicated that the lower migrating GCAP isozyme progressively increased in intensity with increasing butyrate concentration, whereas the upper PLAP isozyme band gradually diminished to disappear entirely at 2.0 mm sodium butyrate. In addition, the intermediate PLAP-GCAP heterodimeric band is induced maximally at 0.5 mmsodium butyrate. We have shown previously that PLAP and GCAP differ conformationally mainly as a result of the E429G substitution, which also causes the retardation of GCAP in starch gel compared with the migration of PLAP (25Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The fact that heterodimers migrate at a position that is not the exact intermediate between that of the PLAP and GCAP dimers indicates that the overall conformation of the PLAP-GCAP heterodimer resembles more closely that of GCAP than that of PLAP and provides further evidence for the existence of structural cross-talk between the asymmetrical monomers in the PLAP-[G]PLAP heterodimers. We have previously shown that the E429G substitution affected the resistance of the resulting mutants toward inactivation by heat (25Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast to PLAP and [S]PLAP, which are extremely stable even at pH 9.8, [G]PLAP activity disappears at 56 °C with a half-life of approximately 25 min (Fig. 8; Ref. 25Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Even though the inactive [ARGR]PLAP subunit cannot contribute to the measured activity remaining after time-dependent heat inactivation of the [S]PLAP-[ARGR]PLAP heterodimer, it is clear that the heat stability of the [S]PLAP-[ARGR]PLAP heterodimer resembles much more that of [G]PLAP than that of [S]PLAP, further confirming that PLAP-[G]PLAP types of heterodimer structurally compare better with [G]PLAP than with the weighted PLAP-[G]PLAP average (Fig. 8). We reported that a surface loop, made up of amino acids 400–430 substantially contributed to the heat-stability of PLAP (17Bossi M. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because modifications in this loop dramatically reduced the resistance of the resulting PLAP mutant (PLAP-t) to denaturation by heat (PLAP-t homodimers were inactivated by 90% after 20 min at 56 °C; 17) without affecting the kinetic parameters of the PLAP-t mutant. To investigate in more detail whether this loop participates in the structural cross-talk between both AP subunits, we have also analyzed the heat stability of the [S]PLAP-t-[RGR]PLAP heterodimers. It is evident that the heat inactivation pattern for the [S]PLAP-t-[RGR]PLAP heterodimers resembles that of [G]PLAP (Fig.8), confirming that these heterodimers behave more as [G]PLAP, irrespective of the presence of the t-loop substitution in the [S]PLAP subunit. Thus, the amino acids 400–430 loop controls the active site stability in PLAP but is not involved in any stabilizing cross-talk between AP subunits, corroborating our findings that the E429G substitution in PLAP is associated with structural changes in this loop, facilitating the access for l-Leu (25Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and EDTA. Mammalian APs are allosteric enzymes in which both monomers act independently, at least when both AP subunits are completely metalated. It is, however, clear that for different AP isozymes, subtle amino acid substitutions in positions close to the active site may dramatically affect the affinity for Zn2+binding in the active site pocket. Therefore, in different tissues the mechanism of the actual AP catalysis will be determined by the local concentrations of available isozyme and zinc ions. It is also evident that heterodimers can form between structurally related mammalian APs. These heterodimers are not the weighted average of the parent homodimers; as a consequence of subunit interactions, AP enzymes are formed that are structurally less asymmetrical than expected and that have catalytic properties divergent from those of the parent homodimers. Hence, mammalian APs are noncooperative allosteric enzymes, but the stability and catalytic properties of each monomer are controlled by the conformation of the second AP subunit."

Neon was found to be depleted in the cometary ice by more than a factor of 25 relative to solar abundance, which suggests that ices in Hale-Bopp formed at (or later experienced) temperatures higher than 25 kelvin. A helium line emission at a wavelength of 584 angstroms was detected and may be attributable to charge transfer of solar wind α particles in the cometary coma. Ionized oxygen and another helium line contribute to an emission observed at 538 angstroms."
https://openalex.org/W1996020433,"The interactions of type VI collagen have been investigated, using solid phase binding assays, with two components of the fibrillin-containing microfibrils, the elastin-binding protein, MAGP-1 and its structural relative MAGP-2. Both native and pepsin-treated forms of type VI collagen specifically bound to MAGP-1 but not to MAGP-2. Pepsin type VI collagen was shown to block the binding of MAGP-1 to native type VI collagen indicating that the major MAGP-1-binding site was in the triple-helical region of the molecule. MAGP-1 was found not to bind to collagens I, III, and V. Affinity blotting of pepsin-treated type VI collagen showed that MAGP-1 binding was specific for the collagenous domain of the α3(VI) chain. Decorin and biglycan were found not to inhibit the interaction of pepsin-treated type VI collagen with MAGP-1, indicating that its binding site on the collagen is not close to that for the proteoglycans. Reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds in MAGP-1 did not destroy its type VI collagen-binding properties, indicating that the binding site was likely to be in the cysteine-free, N-terminal domain of MAGP-1. Interestingly, the interaction of MAGP-1 with type VI collagen was inhibited by tropoelastin, suggesting that the binding sites for tropoelastin and type VI collagen may be in the same domain of MAGP-1. A peptide, corresponding to amino acids 29–38 of MAGP-1, was found to inhibit the interactions of MAGP-1 with type VI collagen and tropoelastin. The results suggest that the peptide may contain the binding sequences for both type VI collagen and tropoelastin, and thus that these two proteins may share the same binding site on MAGP-1. The interactions of MAGP-1 with type VI collagen and tropoelastin were both determined to be of moderately high affinity, withK d values of 5.6 × 10−7m and 2.6 × 10−7m, respectively. The findings indicate that MAGP-1 may mediate a molecular interaction between type VI collagen microfibrils and fibrillin-containing microfibrils, structures which are often found in close proximity to each other in a wide range of extracellular matrices.

Two structurally distinct microfibrillar elements, type VI collagen microfibrils and fibrillin-containing microfibrils, are abundant constituents of the extracellular matrix in a wide range of tissues. Type VI collagen microfibrils (3–5 nm in diameter) are present as an extensive network in virtually all soft connective tissues, where they are found in loose association with collagen fibers and basement membranes, and near the surface of cells (1Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G.

Their major structural components are considered to be the fibrillins, which are a two-member family of large (350 kDa), rodlike, cysteine-rich glycoproteins, named fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 (17Sakai L.Y.

Parallel arrays of 6–8 fibrillin molecules appear to aggregate, end to end, to form the microfibrils (25Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14763-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bachinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol.

It is uncertain whether the two forms of fibrillin form distinct microfibrils or if they can co-exist within the same microfibril. The fibrillin-containing microfibrils have a characteristic beaded-filament structure, with a 50-nm periodicity, when viewed by the rotary shadowing technique (14Henderson M. Polewski R. Fanning J.C.

Current evidence suggests that the bundles of fibrillin molecules form the interbead regions, whereas the beads correspond to regions of head to tail interaction between adjacent bundles (25Sakai L.Y.

Evidence suggests that the beads may contain other components including the small structurally related glycoproteins, MAGP-1 1The abbreviations used are: MAGP, microfibril-associated glycoprotein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin.1The abbreviations used are: MAGP, microfibril-associated glycoprotein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin. (31 kDa) and MAGP-2 (25 kDa) (14Henderson M. Polewski R. Fanning J.C. Gibson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

MAGP-1 specifically co-distributes with fibrillin-1 in tissues and has been shown to be localized periodically, at 50-nm intervals, to the beads of the microfibrils (14Henderson M. Polewski R. Fanning J.C. Gibson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAGP-1 is covalently associated with the microfibrils by disulfide bonding, and it may play a role in the stabilization of the head to tail interaction between fibrillin molecules (14Henderson M. Polewski R. Fanning J.C. Gibson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gibson M.A. Hughes J.L. Fanning J.C. Cleary E.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7596-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining experiments indicate that the MAGP-1 molecule is accessible on the surface of the microfibril (13Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and in vitro binding assays have shown that MAGP-1 will bind to the elastin precursor, tropoelastin (34Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R. Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that MAGP-1 may participate in the binding and alignment of tropoelastin onto the surface of the microfibrils during elastinogenesis. However, MAGP-1 is also present in microfibrils that do not develop into elastic fibers (16Kumaratilake J.S. Gibson M.A. Fanning J.C. Cleary E.G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 117-127PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein may also be involved in the interaction of the microfibrils with other structural elements of the extracellular matrix. MAGP-2 is also specifically disulfide-bonded to fibrillin-associated microfibrils but has a much more restricted tissue distribution than MAGP-1 (21Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4590-4598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Kumaratilake J.S. Sandberg L.B. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). MAGP-2 is associated with microfibrils in tissues, such as nuchal ligament, muscle, spleen, kidney mesangium, and the adventitia of arteries, but is essentially absent from tissues, such as ocular zonule, media of arteries, and the peritubular matrix of kidney. 2M. A. Gibson, J. S. Kumaratilake, and E. G. Cleary, manuscript in preparation.2M. A. Gibson, J. S. Kumaratilake, and E. G. Cleary, manuscript in preparation. It is possible that MAGP-2 is specifically associated with microfibrils containing only fibrillin-2. The close similarity between MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 is confined to a central region of 60 amino acids where there is precise alignment of 7 cysteine residues. The two glycoproteins are very diverse in the remainder of their structures, suggesting that they may have very distinct functions in microfibril biology (24Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

Ultrastructurally, fine microfibrils of type VI collagen are often found in close proximity to the thicker fibrillin-containing microfibrils in a wide range of tissues (2Keene D.R. Engvall E.

Glanville R.W. Kuo H.J. Uson R.R. Rand J.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 283-291PubMed Google Scholar), suggestive of molecular interactions between the two structures. In the present study we have investigated the binding, in vitro, of the microfibrillar proteins MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 with native type VI collagen and the pepsin-resistant fragment of the collagen (pepsin type VI collagen), which corresponds mainly to the triple-helical region. The results indicate that MAGP-1, but not MAGP-2, specifically interacts with type VI collagen. The binding appears to be via a region close to the N terminus of MAGP-1 with a site in or close to the helical region of the α3(VI) chain. The finding provides biochemical evidence that fibrillin-containing microfibrils may indirectly link elastic fibers to collagen fibers via the interaction of MAGP-1 with type VI collagen microfibrils. MAGP-1, MAGP-2, and MP78/70 (βig-h3) were extracted from fetal nuchal ligaments using reductive saline treatment and purified by DEAE-cellulose and gel permeation chromatography as described previously (21Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4590-4598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except the proteins were not alkylated and buffers contained 25 mm dithiothreitol. Disulfide bonds were reformed by dialysis into 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 m guanidinium chloride, 4 mmcysteine, and 2 mm cystine. Collagen types I, III, V, and VI (native and pepsin-treated), were prepared from fetal calf skin or nuchal ligaments as described previously (37Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11149-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tropoelastin was purified using the method of Brown et al. (38Brown P.L. Mecham L. Tisdal C. Mecham R.P Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and decorin and biglycan were prepared from the fetal calf by the method of Choiet al. (39Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 have been described previously (14Henderson M.

For some experiments MAGP-1 was radiolabeled with Na125I (Amersham, Sydney, Australia) using IODO-BEADs (Pierce). Briefly MAGP-1 (95 μg) was dialyzed into 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 6 murea and reacted with a washed IODO-BEAD and 1 mCi of 125I for 15 min at room temperature. The radiolabeled protein was then dialyzed into 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.3m guanidinium chloride and stored at −20 °C. For some experiments MAGP-1 was equilibrated in Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 4 m guanidinium chloride and 25 mmdithiothreitol. A portion was then alkylated with 55 mmiodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark. Alkylated and nonalkylated aliquots of MAGP-1 were then either directly diluted or dialyzed into 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 mguanidinium chloride, 4 mm cysteine, and 2 mmcystine. The samples were then diluted further into PBS/milk for the solid phase binding assays (see below). Synthetic MAGP-1 peptides YPDHVQYTHY (peptide 29–38), VIPAPTLEPGTVET (peptide 74–87), and QSVAAACARSCGGC (peptide 170–183), corresponding to amino acids 29–38, 74–87, and 170–183, respectively, of the 183-amino acid sequence of bovine MAGP-1 (22Gibson M.A. Sandberg L.B.

Each peptide was dissolved at a concentration of 20 mg/ml in dimethyl formamide and stored at −70 °C under nitrogen. Plastic flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno Maxisorb modules) were coated with different collagen types (usually 1 μg in 200 μl of PBS) at 4 °C for 18 h. Control wells were coated with BSA. The wells were then rinsed with PBS, blocked for 30 min with 3% low-fat dried milk in PBS, and washed three times with PBS. MAGP-1 or MAGP-2, either125I-labeled or unlabeled (0–1 μg in 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% milk), was then added to wells in quadruplicate, and incubation was continued for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Binding of125I-labeled protein to each well was measured directly by scintillation counting. Dissociation constants for interactions were determined using the method of Bidanset et al. (40Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of unlabeled protein was measured using antibody detection with anti-MAGP-1 or anti-MAGP-2 antibodies (diluted 1:500 in PBS/Tween) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (1:8000 in PBS/Tween). o-Phenylenediamine was used for color development, which was stopped after 30 min by addition of 0.25 volume of 8 m H2SO4. Color was measured at 490 nm. Controls included omission of protein (MAGP-1 or MAGP-2) from the mobile phase (antibody-only controls). Blocking experiments were also conducted as described in the appropriate figure legends. These included (a) preincubation of MAGP-1 in the liquid phase with pepsin type VI collagen or tropoelastin (3 μg/μg of MAGP-1) for 2 h at 37 °C; (b) incubation of pepsin type VI collagen or BSA-coated wells with decorin, biglycan, MP78/70 or ovalbumin (1 μg/well) for 1 h at 37 °C, prior to the addition of 125I-labeled MAGP-1 in the liquid phase; and (c) addition of synthetic MAGP-1 peptides (25 μg/μg of MAGP-1) to 125I-labeled MAGP-1 in the liquid phase. Duplicate samples (1 μg) of pepsin type VI collagen and MAGP-1 were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 10% gels and transferred to nylon membranes using previously described methods (21Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4590-4598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11149-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with PBS containing 3% milk for 30 min. One membrane was incubated with MAGP-1 (8 μg/ml) in PBS, 0.05% milk for 18 h, the other was incubated without MAGP-1 as a control. The membranes were rinsed three times with PBS/Tween and incubated with anti-MAGP-1 monoclonal antibody 11B (as ascites diluted 1:500 in PBS/Tween containing 3% milk) for 18 h at 4 °C. After rinsing, the membranes were treated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:5000 in PBS, Tween, 3% milk. The membranes were rinsed again, and binding was detected using nitro blue tetrazolium and bromo-chloro-indolylphosphate substrates as described previously (22Gibson M.A. Sandberg L.B. Grosso L.E. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7596-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After photography, the membranes were counterstained for type VI collagen using polyclonal rabbit anti-(pepsin type VI collagen) antiserum, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Color was developed using 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing imidazole (10 mm), hydrogen peroxide (0.01%), and diaminobenzidine (600 μg/ml). MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 were tested for binding to native type VI collagen using a modified ELISA system (Fig. 1). MAGP-1 showed strong binding that directly correlated with the amount of type VI collagen coated to each well of the microtiter plate. In contrast, MAGP-2 showed no specific interaction with the collagen. To determine if the binding site(s) for MAGP-1 were present in the triple-helical and/or globular domains of type VI collagen, the assay was repeated using pepsin type VI collagen that corresponds to the triple-helical region of the molecule (Fig. 2). Strong binding of MAGP-1 was again observed, indicating that the pepsin-resistant region contained a major binding site. Preincubation of the MAGP-1 with pepsin type VI collagen in the mobile phase greatly reduced the binding to wells coated with pepsin type VI collagen, confirming that the molecular interaction was specific. Interestingly preincubation with pepsin type VI collagen also greatly reduced the binding of MAGP-1 to native type VI collagen. This confirmed that the major MAGP-1-binding site(s) on type VI collagen was in the pepsin-resistant domain.Figure 2MAGP-1 specifically binds to the pepsin-resistant domain of type VI collagen. Native type VI collagen (2 μg/well) and pepsin type VI collagen (0.5 μg/well) were coated onto microtiter plates. The wells were then incubated with MAGP-1 (0.6 μg/well) or with MAGP-1, which had been preabsorbed with pepsin type VI collagen (3 μg/μg of MAGP-1). Binding was measured using the peroxidase ELISA technique and color development at 490 nm. The binding of preabsorbed MAGP-1 is expressed as a percentage of the binding of untreated MAGP-1, measured by absorbance at 490 nm. Mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate determinations is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Other collagen types were also tested to determine if the binding of MAGP-1 was specific for type VI collagen rather than for collagens in general (Fig. 3). Radiolabeled MAGP-1 was used in these experiments to avoid variations in the nonspecific binding of the anti-MAGP-1 antibodies to wells coated with different collagens. MAGP-1 binding to wells coated with collagen types I, III, or V was very low and was comparable to the levels found in control wells coated with BSA. The binding to type VI collagen was at least 2.5-fold higher than to the other collagen types, indicating that it was specific for this microfibrillar collagen. Separation of the three α chains of pepsin type VI collagen by reduction and alkylation under denaturing conditions did not eliminate the binding of MAGP-1 to the collagen, provided that the collagen was renatured by dialysis before coating onto the microtiter wells (not shown). This finding suggested that the MAGP-1-binding site(s) was not dependent on the presence of the triple-helical conformation and thus that it was likely to be present on one of the three distinct α chains of the collagen. To identify which chain was involved, the three α chains of pepsin type VI collagen were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and affinity-blotted with MAGP-1 (Fig. 4). MAGP-1 was found to bind to one band of the pepsin type VI collagen (Fig. 4 A), which was not present in the duplicate blot incubated without MAGP-1 but with anti-MAGP-1 antibodies (Fig. 4 C). This result indicated that the band was identified by MAGP-1 and not directly by the antibody, thus confirming that the binding was specific. Counterstaining with anti-type VI collagen antibodies (Fig.4 B) showed that the band corresponded to the α3 chain of pepsin type VI collagen, indicating that the MAGP-1-binding site was present on this chain. To determine if the MAGP-1-binding site on type VI collagen could be blocked by decorin or biglycan, the MAGP-1-binding assay was repeated with type VI collagen-coated wells that had been preincubated with each of the above proteoglycans (Fig.5). Neither macromolecule was found to reduce the binding of MAGP-1 to type VI collagen, suggesting that the proteoglycans bind to a different region of the collagen. MP78/70 was also tested as a potential inhibitor, without effect. To determine if intact disul"

However, mutations accumulate at a high rate in these cells when they are maintained at high density. Thus the mutator phenotype of some mismatch repair-deficient cell lines is conditional and strongly depends on growth conditions. These observations have implications for tumor development because they suggest that mutations may accumulate in tumor cells when growth is limited."

The results obtained clearly indicate that the conversion of C2GnT into a trans-Golgi enzyme resulted in a substantial decrease of core 2 branched oligosaccharides.These results, taken together, strongly suggest that the predominance of core 2 branched oligosaccharides in those cells expressing C2GnT is due to the fact that C2GnT is located earlier in the Golgi than α-2,3-sialyltransferase that competes with C2GnT for the common substrate.

While resting human T lymphocytes express tetrasaccharides, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→3(NeuNAcα2→6)GalNAc, activated T lymphocytes almost exclusively express branched hexasaccharides, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→3(NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc β1→6) GalNAc (8Piller F. Piller V. Fox R.I. Fukuda M. J Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15146-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, such change is associated with T cell development in thymus; while immature thymocytes in cortical thymus express the hexasaccharides, relatively mature medullary thymocytes express the tetrasaccharides (9Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C.H. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The conversion of O-glycan biosynthesis is due to the turning on or off of core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT). 1The abbreviations used are: C2GnT, core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GalT, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase; ST6Gal I, Galβ1→ 4GlcNAc α-2,6-sialyltransferase; α-ManII, α-mannosidase II.1The abbreviations used are: C2GnT, core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GalT, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase; ST6Gal I, Galβ1→ 4GlcNAc α-2,6-sialyltransferase; α-ManII, α-mannosidase II. It has been demonstrated that activated T lymphocytes express a substantial amount of C2GnT activity, while resting T lymphocytes express negligible C2GnT activity (8Piller F. Piller V. Fox R.I. Fukuda M. J Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15146-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By in situ hybridization of the transcript, it has been shown that immature cortical thymocytes express a substantial amount of C2GnT mRNA, while it was not detected in medullary thymocytes (9Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C.H. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The conversion of O-glycan structures during thymocyte development may be critical for the apoptotic process in thymus, since such a process is modulated by the presence ofO-glycans on thymocytes (10Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Expression of the branched hexasaccharide in peripheral blood T lymphocytes has been also observed in patients with immunodeficient syndromes such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (11Piller F. Le Deist F. Weinberg K. Parkman R. Fukuda M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Higgins E.A. Siminovitch K.A. Zhuang D. Brockhausen I. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6280-6290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that AIDS patients express substantially increased amounts of the hexasaccharide or its monosialylated forms (13Saitoh O. Piller F. Fox R.I. Fukuda M. Blood. 1991; 77: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lefebvre J.-C. Giordanengo V. Limouse M. Doglio A. Cucchiarini M. Monpoux F. Mariani R. Peyron J.-F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). AIDS patients produce antibodies against leukosialin expressing those oligosaccharides, and such antibodies are implicated in causing T lymphocyte depletion, which may be a cause of pathological conditions in these diseases (15Ardman B. Sikorski M.A. Settles M. Staunton D.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These combined results indicate that it is critical to understand how core 2 branchings are synthesized. The biosynthesis of oligosaccharides is also controlled by specific localization of glycosyltransferases that add a specific monosaccharide in each reaction (16Sadler J.E. Ginsburg V. Robbins P.W. Biology of Carbohydrates. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 199-228Google Scholar). If a glycosyltransferase is misplaced, sequential reactions would not take place, since a given glycosyltransferase adds a monosaccharide to a particular acceptor that was formed by another glycosyltransferase that resides in an earlier compartment(s). Although subcellular localization of glycosyltransferases that form N-glycans is relatively well studied (17Roth J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 405-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), very little is known about subcellular distribution of glycosyltransferases that form O-glycans (see Ref.18Roth J. Wang Y. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8935-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have first determined that C2GnT is localized in cis to medial-Golgi using antibodies specific for C2GnT. We then converted C2GnT into a trans-Golgi enzyme by replacing its domain responsible for Golgi retention with that of Galβ1→4GlcNAc α-2,6-sialyltransferase, ST6Gal I (19Weinstein J. Lee E.U. McEntee K. Lai P.-H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such altered localization of C2GnT was found to result in altered synthesis of oligosaccharides, demonstrating the importance of the orderly presence of glycosyltransferases. To prepare antibodies specific to C2GnT, a cDNA encoding the catalytic domain of C2GnT was amplified by PCR using C2GnT cDNA (20Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) as a template and fused with GST protein. The 5′-primer for PCR is 5′-aaacgtggatccCATCATCATCATCATCAT ccc ggg TCTTCTTTCATC, (BamHI site and 6-His linker are singly and doubly underlined, respectively, while the italic type corresponds to residues 101–104 of C2GnT). The 3′-primer is 5′-aaaacggaattccccgggTCAGTGTTTTAATGT-3′ (the last 15 nucleotides correspond to residue 425 to the stop codon). PCR was carried out as described (21Ogata S. Fukuda M. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the amplified DNA was digested withBamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of pGEX-KG expression vector (Pharmacia). The resultant cDNA encodes a fusion protein composed of GST and a thrombin cleavage site, six histidines, and the catalytic domain (residues 101–428) of C2GnT.Escherichia coli HB101 was transformed with this plasmid vector, and a GST fusion protein was produced after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. HB101 cells were recovered by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C. After thawing on ice, the pellet was digested with 5 mg/ml lysozyme in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm EDTA and 1% Triton X-100 (buffer A). After the addition of DNase I (Amersham Corp.), the sample was then sonicated and centrifuged. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm EDTA and 1.5% N-lauroylsarcosine (Sigma) (buffer B). The suspended residue was then centrifuged, and the sarcosyl extract was obtained as described (22Frankel S. Sohn R. Leinwand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1192-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose beads were equilibrated with buffer B and added to the sarcosyl extract. The suspension was mixed gently at 4 °C for 90 min using a rotary mixer and then briefly centrifuged to recover the beads. After washing the beads with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 2.5 mmCaCl2), the beads were suspended in 2 ml of buffer C containing 20 units of thrombin and mixed overnight at room temperature. Thrombin-released material was recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation of the above mixture. The proteins that remained on beads were then released by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, which contained no reducing reagent, and the C2GnT protein fragment was recovered in this extraction and separated from other contaminating proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified protein sample, extracted from polyacrylamide gels by electroelution, was immunized in rabbits. The antiserum was applied to a protein A-Sepharose column, bound antibodies were eluted with glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, and the eluent was immediately neutralized by the addition of 1.0 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The partially purified antibodies were further applied to a column of Sepharose 4B conjugated to E. coli proteins, and the unbound fraction was used as a purified antibody sample. A cDNA encoding ST6Gal I was cloned by PCR using a human HL-60 cDNA library (20Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) as the template. The 5′-primer for this PCR corresponds to nucleotides −15 to 15 with respect to the translation initiation site (23Wang X. Vertino A. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Jani-Sait S.N. Shows T.B. Lau J.T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4355-4361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) plus SmaI site. The 3′-primer is 5′-aaacccggctcgag TGCTTAGCAGTGAATGGTCC-3′. TheXhoI site is underlined, while the italic type corresponds to nucleotides 1201–1221 (nucleotides 1216–1218 encode the stop codon). The PCR product was digested with SmaI andXhoI and cloned into the same sites in the pMSG vector (Pharmacia). A cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stem regions of ST6Gal I was amplified by PCR using the above plasmid vector as a template. The 5′-primer, DS23, corresponds to nucleotides −9 to 11 in relation to the translation initiation site of ST6Gal I, with the BamHI site at the 5′-end. The 3′-primer sequence was 5′-ATCACTACTAGGGTCCTGGGTGCTGCTT-3′. The first 12 nucleotides of this primer (shown by italics) correspond in antisense to residues 53–56 of C2GnT, and the last 16 nucleotides correspond in antisense to nucleotides 195–210 of ST6Gal I (nucleotides 196–210 encode codons 66–70). This PCR product encodes the first 70 amino acid residues of ST6Gal I plus 4 amino acids in the stem region of C2GnT. A cDNA encoding the catalytic domain of C2GnT was amplified by PCR. The 5′-primer sequence was 5′-AGCACCCAGGACCCTAGTAGTGATATTAATTG-3′. In this sequence, the first 12 nucleotides encode residues 67–70 of ST6Gal I, and the following 20 nucleotides encode residues 53–58 plus the portion of residue 59 of C2GnT. The 3′-primer, DS26, encodes the stop codon plus the following fifteen 3′-untranslated nucleotides of C2GnT sequence with the addition of the XhoI site. The PCR products of the C2GnT catalytic domain and ST6Gal I sequence overlap at sequences corresponding toSer-Thr-Gln-Asp-Pro-Ser-Ser-Asp, in whichSer-Thr-Gln-Asp comes from ST6Gal I andPro-Ser-Ser-Asp comes from C2GnT. To make a chimera of the NH2-terminal region of ST6Gal I and the catalytic domain of C2GnT, PCR was carried out using DS23 and DS26 (shown above) as primers and a mixture of the above two PCR products as templates (21Ogata S. Fukuda M. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After amplification under the same conditions as described, the PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and then ligated into the same sites of pcDNAI, yielding pcDNAI-ST6Gal I/C2GnT. CHO DG44 cells were transfected with pZIPNEO-leu alone, with pZIPNEO-leu and pcDNAI-C2GnT, or with pZIPNEO-leu and pcDNAI-ST6Gal I/C2GnT using LipofectAMINE and were subsequently selected for G418 resistance. Clonal cell lines expressing a substantial amount of either leukosialin (CHO-leu) or both leukosialin and core 2 branched oligosaccharides (CHO-leu·C2GnT, CHO-leu·ST6Gal I/C2GnT) were selected as described (24Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-leu·C2GnT and CHO-leu·ST6Gal I/C2GnT cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and immersed in 0.05% saponin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin solution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. They were then incubated with rabbit anti-C2GnT antibodies followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as described previously (25Williams M.A. Fukuda M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). After washing with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, they were sequentially washed with PBS containing 1% normal goat serum, 10 μg/ml unconjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG), and then 100 μg of unconjugated protein A/ml of PBS for 10 min each. The cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-α-mannosidase II antibodies (26Moremen K.W. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 fragment of IgG that is specific to the Fc portion of rabbit IgG (Axell). After washing with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin followed by PBS, the samples were visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (25Williams M.A. Fukuda M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or Zeiss CSM410 confocal laser scanning microscope (27Fukuda M.N. Sato T. Nakayama J. Klier G. Mikami M. Aoki D. Nozawa S. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as described. To detect C2GnT and β-1,4-galactosyltransferase in the same sample, pcDNAI-GalT (28Aoki D. Lee N. Yamaguchi N. Dubois C. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4319-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was transiently transfected in the above CHO cells. Simple double immunofluorescent staining was then carried out as described (25Williams M.A. Fukuda M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), since a mouse monoclonal antibody specific to human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (29Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar) was available. Controls were performed by omitting the primary antibodies. Rabbit antibodies specific to mouse (and hamster) α-mannosidase II (26Moremen K.W. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Kelley Moremen (University of Georgia). Mouse monoclonal antibody specific to human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (29Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Hisashi Narimatsu (Soka University). Staining of specimens was performed as described previously (30Kerjaschki D.

Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen sections of human kidney specimens, CHO-leu·C2GnT and CHO-leu·ST6GalI/C2GnT cells, were fixed with paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate, and incubation with primary antibody (rabbit anti-human C2GnT IgG, absorbed againstE. coli proteins) was performed overnight at 4 °C, followed by three washes in PBS containing 1% egg albumin and 0.075% saponin and incubation with secondary antibodies (goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, bound antibodies were visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and 3% H2O2 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and embedding in epon, ultra thin sections were cut and examined in a Jeol 1200 microscope. Controls were performed by either omitting the primary antibody or by replacing it with rabbit preimmune serum. C2GnT was assayed by using the acceptor Galβ-1→3GalNAc-α-p-nitrophenol (Toronto Chemicals) as described (20Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The CHO cells (∼1 × 107 cells) were metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine (10 μCi/ml), and the cell residues were subjected to Pronase digestion as described (24Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glycopeptides obtained were applied to a Sephadex G-50 (superfine) column (1.0 × 110 cm) equilibrated with 0.1 mNH4HCO3. Higher molecular weight glycopeptides were subjected to β-elimination as described (24Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and releasedO-glycans were separated from remaining glycopeptides using the same Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. The obtainedO-glycans were analyzed by Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration using the same conditions as described (24Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide peaks were desialyzed by clostridial neuraminidase, and the digest was again analyzed by Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration. The standard oligosaccharides used were obtained as described previously (24Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the ratio of the oligosaccharides synthesized, the amount of the radioactivity was determined after converting all of these oligosaccharides to Galβ1→3GalNAcOH by various exoglycosidase treatments as described (24Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After correcting the yield during chromatography, the relative amount of each oligosaccharide could be calculated (32Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9264-9271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of the specific radioactivity of GlcNAc and GalNAcOH was found to be 1:0.7, as seen before (32Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9264-9271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were extracted in 200 mmNa2CO3, pH 10.5, and Triton X-114 phase partition as described previously (31Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of the membrane proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-C2GnT antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) was used as a secondary antibody and detected by nitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate chromogenic substrate (Kierkergard and Perry, Gaithersberg, MD). As a control, the duplicate blot was probed with IgG purified from rabbit preimmune sera. Cells were metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label and immunoprecipitated as described (21Ogata S. Fukuda M. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular distribution of C2GnT, it was essential to produce antibodies specific to C2GnT. First, the catalytic domain of C2GnT was fused with GST protein and expressed in E. coli. The produced protein was then immunized in rabbits. After two additional boost immunizations, the titer of the antibodies was increased enough to detect C2GnT in CHO cells expressing C2GnT (Fig.1 A). The same antibodies also reacted with COS-1 cells, which transfected with C2GnT cDNA (Fig.2 B) but not with untransfected COS-1 cells (data not shown). Moreover, the antibodies did not react with CHO cells expressing I-branching β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, which shares homology with C2GnT (33Bierhuizen M.F. Mattei M.G. Fukuda M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). To confirm that the antibodies reacted with C2GnT, Western blot analysis was performed on the protein products used for immunization. Fig. 2 A shows that the antibodies reacted with a fusion protein of ∼68 kDa before thrombin digestion (lanes 1 and 2) and reacted with ∼36-kDa protein after the digestion (lanes 3 and4). The results are consistent with the calculated molecular mass for the GST-C2GnT fusion protein (∼68 kDa) and C2GnT catalytic domain (36 kDa).Figure 2Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation of C2GnT. A, GST-C2GnT fusion protein (lanes 1and 2) and its proteolytic digest (lanes 3 and4) were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-C2GnT antibodies. Lanes 1 and 3 contained 10 times more sample than lanes 2 and 4. The bands migrating at ∼75 kDa are most likely the dimers. B, Western blot analysis of human kidney membrane proteins (20 μg) using anti-C2GnT antibodies. Lane 5 is a control experiment omitting the primary antibody. C, immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled CHO cells stably expressing C2GnT (lane 7) and wild-type CHO cells (lane 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our preliminary studies on rat tissues showed that kidney had the highest activity of C2GnT. Western blot analysis of human kidney membrane proteins demonstrated that a ∼57-kDa protein strongly reacted with the antibodies, while the control experiment gave negative results (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). Finally, immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled CHO cells stably expressing C2GnT produced a specific band at ∼60 kDa, which was absent in wild type CHO cells (Fig. 2 C,lanes 7 and 8). These results combined clearly indicate that the antibodies generated are specific to C2GnT. To determine the subcellular distribution of C2GnT, CHO cells were transfected with pcDNAI-C2GnT and pZipNeo-leu, and those cells stably expressing C2GnT and leukosialin (CHO-leu·C2GnT) were established (24Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously, C2GnT is absent in CHO cells (24Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sasaki H. Bothner B. Dell A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12059-12076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, only introduced C2GnT can be detected in CHO cells. When C2GnT is localized differently by the replacement of the Golgi retention signal, such change should be clearly detected. Leukosialin was co-transfected, since those cells expressing core 2 oligosaccharides on leukosialin can be detected by T305 antibody (24Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-leu·C2GnT cells (clone 1) were stained by rabbit antibodies specific to C2GnT followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. After chasing the remaining antibodies by protein A, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” the same specimens were incubated with rabbit antibodies specific to α-ManII, a glycosidase normally found in cis to medial-Golgi (26Moremen K.W. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Preliminary experiments showed that the antibodies raised against mouse α-ManII cross-reacted with CHO α-ManII. As shown in Fig.3 (top left), the majority of C2GnT and α-ManII are overlapping in their distributions, showing strong yellow staining. In the second set of experiments, pcDNAI-human GalT cDNA (28Aoki D. Lee N. Yamaguchi N. Dubois C. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4319-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was transiently introduced into CHO-leu·C2GnT cells, and the expressed GalT, trans-Golgi enzyme, was similarly visualized by immunofluorescent staining. Since a mouse monoclonal antibody specific to human β-galactosyltransferase was available (29Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar), the transfected cells were stained with rabbit anti-C2GnT antibodies and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, followed by mouse monoclonal anti-GalT antibodies and goat FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The results, as shown in Fig. 3 (bottom left) demonstrated that there was almost no overlap in the distribution of C2GnT and GalT. These results, combined, established that C2GnT is present in thecis to medial-Golgi. The results also demonstrated that two-step immunostaining was specific, since staining for only C2GnT or α-ManII can be seen in certain cells (Fig. 3). These results were confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy using specimens of human kidney and stably transfected CHO cells (data not shown). The next question we asked was whether or not we could shift the Golgi localization of C2GnT by replacing the Golgi retention signal in C2GnT with that of a glycosyltransferase present in"
https://openalex.org/W2049290247,"Osteocalcin, the most abundant noncollagenous protein of bone matrix, has been demonstrated to inhibit bone growth by gene knockout experiments (Ducy, P., Desbois, C., Boyce, B., Pinero, G., Story, B., Dunstan, C., Smith, E., Bonadio, J., Goldstein, S., Gundberg, C., Bradley, A., and Karsenty, G. (1996)Nature 382, 448–452). Its specific functional mechanism in bone metabolism is, however, largely unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that osteocalcin has an inhibitory effect on tissue transglutaminase activity, as measured by cross-linking of osteopontin, another bone matrix protein. Using a set of synthetic peptides, we found that the inhibitory activity resided within the first 13 N-terminal amino acid residues of osteocalcin. An N-terminal peptide also inhibited cross-linking of another tissue transglutaminase substrate, β-casein. The inhibitory peptide was shown to have affinity for the substrates of transglutaminase rather than for the enzyme. Since the N terminus of osteocalcin exhibits homology to the substrate recognition site sequences of two transglutaminases, we conclude that the inhibitory effect is most likely due to competition with the enzyme for the transglutaminase-binding region of the substrates, osteopontin and β-casein, which prevents access of the enzyme to them to perform its function. The interference of osteocalcin with osteopontin cross-linking gives osteocalcin a new potential function as the first protein inhibitor of tissue transglutaminase. This suggests a specific role and a plausible mechanism for it as a modulator of maturation, stabilization, and calcification of bone matrix. Osteocalcin, the most abundant noncollagenous protein of bone matrix, has been demonstrated to inhibit bone growth by gene knockout experiments (Ducy, P., Desbois, C., Boyce, B., Pinero, G., Story, B., Dunstan, C., Smith, E., Bonadio, J., Goldstein, S., Gundberg, C., Bradley, A., and Karsenty, G. (1996)Nature 382, 448–452). Its specific functional mechanism in bone metabolism is, however, largely unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that osteocalcin has an inhibitory effect on tissue transglutaminase activity, as measured by cross-linking of osteopontin, another bone matrix protein. Using a set of synthetic peptides, we found that the inhibitory activity resided within the first 13 N-terminal amino acid residues of osteocalcin. An N-terminal peptide also inhibited cross-linking of another tissue transglutaminase substrate, β-casein. The inhibitory peptide was shown to have affinity for the substrates of transglutaminase rather than for the enzyme. Since the N terminus of osteocalcin exhibits homology to the substrate recognition site sequences of two transglutaminases, we conclude that the inhibitory effect is most likely due to competition with the enzyme for the transglutaminase-binding region of the substrates, osteopontin and β-casein, which prevents access of the enzyme to them to perform its function.

The organic matrix of mineralized tissues is composed of several noncollagenous proteins, whose functions in bone, dentine, and cartilage development and remodeling are not presently fully understood. In addition to their possible contribution to the structural integrity of hard tissues, the biochemical and medical evidence suggests their involvement in the regulation of bone turnover.

This implies the importance of OCN in promoting bone resorption and inhibiting mineralization.OCN is known to interact with osteopontin (OPN) in vitro(7Ritter N.M. Farach-Carson M.C. Butler W.T. J.

Since OPN is present in most normal tissues undergoing mineralization and is also known to accumulate at the site of healing calcified tissue interfaces (16McKee M.D. Nanci A. Anat. Rec. 1996; 245: 394-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it may be involved in the regulation of bone mineralization. OPN is a substrate of tissue transglutaminase (TG) (17Prince C.W.

( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Tissue transglutaminase (EC 2.3.2.13) belongs to a family of widely distributed calcium-dependent enzymes, which catalyze the formation of γ-glutamyl-ε-lysyl cross-links, inducing the formation of high molecular mass complexes of proteins (20Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The covalent bonds formed are stable and resistant to proteolysis, and where present, they increase the durability and integrity of the tissue (21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). TG is produced in mineralizing cartilage and bone (22Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and it is thought to participate in matrix cross-linking before the tissue undergoes calcification (21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Therefore, it might be involved in the initiation and regulation of the mineralization processes (22Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).In view of the observation that OCN is known to interact with OPN, we investigated whether OCN has an effect on TG-catalyzed cross-linking of OPN. In this paper, we provide evidence that OCN reduces the formation of TG-catalyzed high molecular mass complexes of OPN most likely by competing with the enzyme for the binding site of the protein substrate by a sequence homologous to tissue transglutaminase.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have indicated that OPN may participate in the assembly of bone matrix as a substrate for tissue TG (18S⊘rensen E.S. Rasmussen L.K. M⊘ller L. Jensen P.H. H⊘rup P. Petersen T.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). As OCN has been identified as a negative regulator of bone mineralization (6Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) and is capable of in vitro interaction with OPN (7Ritter N.M. Farach-Carson M.C. Butler W.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we studied whether OCN had an effect on TG activity with OPN as a substrate. Our results demonstrate that OCN is capable of inhibiting TG-mediated cross-linking of OPN. Experiments with a set of human OCN-derived synthetic peptides revealed that the first 13 N-terminal amino acid residues include the elements required for this inhibitory effect. The cross-linking of a non-bone TG substrate, β-casein, was inhibited by an N-terminal OCN peptide as well. The binding assay further demonstrated an interaction of the biotinylated inhibitory peptide with OPN and β-casein, showing only minor interaction with TG. This indicates that OCN interferes with TG activity by interacting with its substrates.The inhibitory N-terminal region of OCN possesses elements homologous to transglutaminase regions, reported to be involved in the substrate recognition of tissue TG and factor XIIIa by Achyuthan et al. (29Achyuthan K.E. Slaughter T.F. Santiago M.A. Enghild J.J. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21284-21292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor XIIIa is a transglutaminase of the blood coagulation cascade (21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The substrate recognition sites were localized by Achyuthan et al. by testing the effects of peptides derived from factor XIIIa on factor XIIIa and tissue TG activities. Two peptides outside the active-site pocket were capable of inhibiting the cross-linking of three different substrates of the enzymes, suggesting that these regions are involved in the substrate recognition. These factor XIIIa peptides, Asn72–Asp97 and Asp190–Phe230, exhibit 70 and 61% homology, respectively, to similar regions of liver tissue TG (30Ikura K. Nasu T. Yokota H. Tsuchiya T. Sasaki R. Chiba H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison (Table III) indicated that OCN has elements similar and homologous to both factor XIIIa peptides and that the homologous OCN residues are well conserved. OCN is also homologous to the region around the active-site cysteine of TG and factor XIIIa. The similarity of the N terminus of OCN to the three TG regions may imply that OCN binds to multiple sites in the protein substrates. The 1:20 substrate/inhibitor ratio required to produce a 50% decrease in the cross-linking of both OPN and β-casein also lends support to this idea. In light of these observations, we suggest that the inhibitory effect of OCN results from its mimicking the TG sequences that contribute to its substrate binding activity and therefore also to its enzymatic activity. This could result in a reversible binding of OCN to as yet unknown enzyme contact sites of OPN and β-casein, therefore preventing the access of the enzyme to its substrates.Table IIIAmino acid sequence comparison of the human and bovine inhibitory osteocalcin peptides with tissue transglutaminase and factor XIII substrate recognition and active sitesPeptideSequenceHuman OCN Tyr1–Val10YLYQWLGAPVGuinea pig liver TG Tyr273–Ala283YGQCWVFAAVA3-aSequence is 100% homologous to that of factor XIIIa.*** ***********Human OCN Tyr1–X 25YLYQWLGAPVPYPDPLXPRRXVMXL3-bX, γ-carboxyglutamic acid.Factor XIII A-chain Asn72–Asp97NKLIVRRGQSFYV-QIDFSR-PY----DPRRD***Bovine OCN Tyr1–Pro13YLDHWLGAPVPYPFactor XIII A-chain Asp190–Asn207DDAVYLDNEKEREEYVLNThe amino acid sequences of human OCN are as reported by Hauschka (1Hauschka P.V.

Open table in a new tab TG is expressed in mineralizing cartilage and bone and is active in tissues undergoing calcification (22Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J.

Aeschlimann et al. (23Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) demonstrated this by staining developing long bones and maturing tracheal cartilage with an isopeptide-specific antibody, which revealed the existence of TG-catalyzed cross-links in the mineralization front. Only osteopontin and osteonectin (31Hohenadl C. Mann K. Mayer U. Timpl R. Paulsson M. Aeschlimann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23415-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) from bone phosphoproteins have been identified as its in vitrosubstrates. They are both ultrastructurally localized in areas undergoing calcification (23Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 33Hultenby K. Reinholt F.P. Oldberg Å. Heinegård D. Matrix. 1991; 11: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Large OPN and osteonectin complexes have also been shown to exist in bone in vivo (18S⊘rensen E.S. Rasmussen L.K. M⊘ller L. Jensen P.H. H⊘rup P. Petersen T.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The role of these complexes is not clear, but as it is thought that the initiation of hydroxyapatite crystallization requires protein aggregates rather than single molecular monomers (32Glimcher M.J. Anat. Rec. 1989; 224: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), it is possible that the TG activity in the mineralization front could provide such protein clusters for hydroxyapatite nucleation seeds and a cross-linked protein scaffold for matrix assembly (21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 34Boskey A.L. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1992; 281: 244-274PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, the cross-linking products of TG, such as the OPN complexes, could be involved in the initiation of calcification and contribute to the stability and strength of the organic matrix of bone. Our observation that an established inhibitor of mineralization, OCN, inhibits TG-mediated cross-linking may imply per se that TG activity is directed to enhance calcification.Studies demonstrating that low levels or the total absence of OCN in bone causes extensive calcification and bone overgrowth indicate that OCN acts as a negative regulator of bone turnover (5Price P.A. Williamson M.K. Haba T. Dell R.B. Jee W.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7734-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 6Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments point to a dual role for OCN since it is thought to directly participate in the inhibition of calcification (3Romberg R.W. Werness P.G. Riggs B.L. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and in the promotion of bone resorption (4Lian J.B. Tassinari M. Glowacki J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1223-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In light of the present findings, we propose that one of the roles of OCN could be in the interference with TG activity. Based on previously published data, this kind of inhibitory effect could not only restrict the superfluous strengthening of the organic matrix of bone, but could simultaneously result in suppression of mineralization and excessive calcification by interfering with the formation of protein aggregates, which possibly act as initiators of calcification. The suppressive action directed toward TG activity could therefore have in vivo importance for the maintenance of flexibility of hard tissue.To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports on protein inhibitors of tissue TG activity. This paper therefore describes the first protein regulator of tissue TG activity, suggesting a novel potential function for OCN in this process. The fact that OCN is expressed only in calcifying tissues, but that both OPN and TG are present in, for example, atherosclerotic plaques (35Giachelli C.M. Bae H. Almeida M. Denhardt D.T. Alpers C.E. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1686-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 36Wiebe R.I. Tarr A.H. Bowness J.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 69: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), elicits an intriguing possibility that there could be OCN-like control proteins in other tissues for the extracellular regulation of TG activity and possibly for prevention of pathological calcification. This view is supported by the recent finding that mice lacking OCN-related matrix Gla protein show extensive calcification of arteries (37Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 38Ichinose A. McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W.

Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 33: 141-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Since OPN is present in most normal tissues undergoing mineralization and is also known to accumulate at the site of healing calcified tissue interfaces (16McKee M.D. Nanci A. Anat. Rec. 1996; 245: 394-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it may be involved in the regulation of bone mineralization. OPN is a substrate of tissue transglutaminase (TG) (17Prince C.W.

( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Tissue transglutaminase (EC 2.3.2.13) belongs to a family of widely distributed calcium-dependent enzymes, which catalyze the formation of γ-glutamyl-ε-lysyl cross-links, inducing the formation of high molecular mass complexes of proteins (20Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The covalent bonds formed are stable and resistant to proteolysis, and where present, they increase the durability and integrity of the tissue (21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). TG is produced in mineralizing cartilage and bone (22Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and it is thought to participate in matrix cross-linking before the tissue undergoes calcification (21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Therefore, it might be involved in the initiation and regulation of the mineralization processes (22Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In view of the observation that OCN is known to interact with OPN, we investigated whether OCN has an effect on TG-catalyzed cross-linking of OPN. In this paper, we provide evidence that OCN reduces the formation of TG-catalyzed high molecular mass complexes of OPN most likely by competing with the enzyme for the binding site of the protein substrate by a sequence homologous to tissue transglutaminase. DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have indicated that OPN may participate in the assembly of bone matrix as a substrate for tissue TG (18S⊘rensen E.S. Rasmussen L.K. M⊘ller L. Jensen P.H. H⊘rup P. Petersen T.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). As OCN has been identified as a negative regulator of bone mineralization (6Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) and is capable of in vitro interaction with OPN (7Ritter N.M. Farach-Carson M.C. Butler W.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we studied whether OCN had an effect on TG activity with OPN as a substrate. Our results demonstrate that OCN is capable of inhibiting TG-mediated cross-linking of OPN. Experiments with a set of human OCN-derived synthetic peptides revealed that the first 13 N-terminal amino acid residues include the elements required for this inhibitory effect. The cross-linking of a non-bone TG substrate, β-casein, was inhibited by an N-terminal OCN peptide as well. The binding assay further demonstrated an interaction of the biotinylated inhibitory peptide with OPN and β-casein, showing only minor interaction with TG. This indicates that OCN interferes with TG activity by interacting with its substrates.The inhibitory N-terminal region of OCN possesses elements homologous to transglutaminase regions, reported to be involved in the substrate recognition of tissue TG and factor XIIIa by Achyuthan et al. (29Achyuthan K.E. Slaughter T.F. Santiago M.A. Enghild J.J. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21284-21292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor XIIIa is a transglutaminase of the blood coagulation cascade (21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The substrate recognition sites were localized by Achyuthan et al. by testing the effects of peptides derived from factor XIIIa on factor XIIIa and tissue TG activities. Two peptides outside the active-site pocket were capable of inhibiting the cross-linking of three different substrates of the enzymes, suggesting that these regions are involved in the substrate recognition. These factor XIIIa peptides, Asn72–Asp97 and Asp190–Phe230, exhibit 70 and 61% homology, respectively, to similar regions of liver tissue TG (30Ikura K. Nasu T. Yokota H. Tsuchiya T. Sasaki R. Chiba H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison (Table III) indicated that OCN has elements similar and homologous to both factor XIIIa peptides and that the homologous OCN residues are well conserved. OCN is also homologous to the region around the active-site cysteine of TG and factor XIIIa. The similarity of the N terminus of OCN to the three TG regions may imply that OCN binds to multiple sites in the protein substrates. The 1:20 substrate/inhibitor ratio required to produce a 50% decrease in the cross-linking of both OPN and β-casein also lends support to this idea. In light of these observations, we suggest that the inhibitory effect of OCN results from its mimicking the TG sequences that contribute to its substrate binding activity and therefore also to its enzymatic activity. This could result in a reversible binding of OCN to as yet unknown enzyme contact sites of OPN and β-casein, therefore preventing the access of the enzyme to its substrates.Table IIIAmino acid sequence comparison of the human and bovine inhibitory osteocalcin peptides with tissue transglutaminase and factor XIII substrate recognition and active sitesPeptideSequenceHuman OCN Tyr1–Val10YLYQWLGAPVGuinea pig liver TG Tyr273–Ala283YGQCWVFAAVA3-aSequence is 100% homologous to that of factor XIIIa.*** ***********Human OCN Tyr1–X 25YLYQWLGAPVPYPDPLXPRRXVMXL3-bX, γ-carboxyglutamic acid.Factor XIII A-chain Asn72–Asp97NKLIVRRGQSFYV-QIDFSR-PY----DPRRD***Bovine OCN Tyr1–Pro13YLDHWLGAPVPYPFactor XIII A-chain Asp190–Asn207DDAVYLDNEKEREEYVLNThe amino acid sequences of human OCN are as reported by Hauschka (1Hauschka P.V.

Aeschlimann et al. (23Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) demonstrated this by staining developing long bones and maturing tracheal cartilage with an isopeptide-specific antibody, which revealed the existence of TG-catalyzed cross-links in the mineralization front. Only osteopontin and osteonectin (31Hohenadl C. Mann K. Mayer U. Timpl R. Paulsson M. Aeschlimann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23415-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) from bone phosphoproteins have been identified as its in vitrosubstrates. They are both ultrastructurally localized in areas undergoing calcification (23Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 33Hultenby K. Reinholt F.P. Oldberg Å. Heinegård D. Matrix. 1991; 11: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Large OPN and osteonectin complexes have also been shown to exist in bone in vivo (18S⊘rensen E.S. Rasmussen L.K. M⊘ller L. Jensen P.H. H⊘rup P. Petersen T.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Aeschlimann D. Kaupp O. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The role of these complexes is not clear, but as it is thought that the initiation of hydroxyapatite crystallization requires protein aggregates rather than single molecular monomers (32Glimcher M.J. Anat. Rec. 1989; 224: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), it is possible that the TG activity in the mineralization front could provide such protein clusters for hydroxyapatite nucleation seeds and a cross-linked protein scaffold for matrix assembly (21Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 34Boskey A.L. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1992; 281: 244-274PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, the cross-linking products of TG, such as the OPN complexes, could be involved in the initiation of calcification and contribute to the stability and strength of the organic matrix of bone. Our observation that an established inhibitor of mineralization, OCN, inhibits TG-mediated cross-linking may imply per se that TG activity is directed to enhance calcification.Studies demonstrating that low levels or the total absence of OCN in bone causes extensive calcification and bone overgrowth indicate that OCN acts as a negative regulator of bone turnover (5Price P.A. Williamson M.K. Haba T. Dell R.B. Jee W.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7734-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 6Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments point to a dual role for OCN since it is thought to directly participate in the inhibition of calcification (3Romberg R.W. Werness P.G. Riggs B.L. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and in the promotion of bone resorption (4Lian J.B. Tassinari M. Glowacki J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1223-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In light of the present findings, we propose that one of the roles of OCN could be in the interference with TG activity. Based on previously published data, this kind of inhibitory effect could not only restrict the superfluous strengthening of the organic matrix of bone, but could simultaneously result in suppression of mineralization and excessive calcification by interfering with the formation of protein aggregates, which possibly act as initiators of calcification. The suppressive action directed toward TG activity could therefore have in vivo importance for the maintenance of flexibility of hard tissue.To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports on protein inhibitors of tissue TG activity. This paper therefore describes the first protein regulator of tissue TG activity, suggesting a novel potential function for OCN in this process. The fact that OCN is expressed only in calcifying tissues, but that both OPN and TG are present in, for example, atherosclerotic plaques (35Giachelli C.M. Bae H. Almeida M. Denhardt D.T. Alpers C.E. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1686-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 36Wiebe R.I. Tarr A.H. Bowness J.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 69: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), elicits an intriguing possibility that there could be OCN-like control proteins in other tissues for the extracellular regulation of TG activity and possibly for prevention of pathological calcification. This view is supported by the recent finding that mice lacking OCN-related matrix Gla protein show extensive calcification of arteries (37Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R.

Recent studies have revealed that pre-B/pre-T cell receptors expressed on lymphocyte precursors also transduce signals for the regulation of their proliferation and differentiation as well as the rearrangement of genes coding for antigen receptors (3Karasuyama H. Rolink A. Melchers F. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 63: 1-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Borst J. Jacobs H. Brouns G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Ample evidence suggests that an array of protein kinases, both tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases, are involved in the signal transduction for the differentiation of lymphocyte precursors as well as the activation of mature lymphocytes (5Owen M.J. Venkitaraman A.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have studied what kinds of protein kinases were expressed and functioned in early lymphocyte precursor cells. In this process we identified and isolated a novel protein kinase gene, lok, which is the focus of this report. lok was found to encode a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the STE20 family (6Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). STE20 is well characterized as a component of the MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPKK, MAP kinase kinase; MAPKKK, MAP kinase kinase kinase; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; SH, Src homology; MBP, myelin basic protein; PAK, p21-activated kinase. kinase cascade for the signal transduction via the G-protein-linked pheromone receptor in yeast (7Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Genetic epistasis placed STE20 at the head of the cascade of kinases. STE20 phosphorylates STE11, which acts as a MAPKKK for STE7. STE7 in turn acts as a MAPKK for FUS3 and KSS1 MAP kinases (8Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Recently, several mammalian homologues of STE20 have been identified and shown to be involved in MAP kinase cascades activated by extracellular stimuli such as cytokines, mitogens and cellular stresses (6Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 9Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The present study shows that LOK is a unique member of the STE20 family in terms of its expression pattern among tissues and the distinctive structure of its non-catalytic domain. A pair of degenerate oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR was synthesized which corresponded to the two conserved amino acid sequences in the catalytic domains of various protein kinases, IHRDL and DVWSFG: 5′-CGGATCCAC(A/C)GNG A(C/T)(C/T)T-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCA(A/T)AGGACCA(C/G)AC(A/G)TC-3′, having anBamHI and EcoRI site at the 5′ end (underlined), respectively, as described by Wilks (10Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from NFS5.3 pre-B cells, and subjected to RT-PCR with the primers. The RT-PCR products of the expected size (about 210 base pairs) were cloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript and then sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA inserts from 21 randomly chosen clones resulted in the identification of 6 repetitive clones containing a cDNA for a novel kinase, which we designated LOK. To obtain a full-length cDNA, a cDNA library was prepared from mouse thymus by using λgt22 (Stratagene) and screened by the cDNA fragment. A full-length lok cDNA was inserted into an eukaryotic expression vector pME18S (pME-LOK), and pME-FLAG (a version of pME18S modified to encode the FLAG epitope at its N terminus) (11Ishida T.K.

The kinase-dead mutant of LOK, FLAG-LOK(KR), in which Lys-65 is replaced by Arg, was constructed from FLAG-LOK by the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The construction of pSRα-HA-MAPK, pSRα-HA-SAPK, pSRα-HA-p38, pSRα-MAPKK, pSRα-SEK1, and pSRα-MKK6 has been described previously (19Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T.

The GST-LOK plasmid was constructed by inserting the fragment of the lokcDNA encoding a sequence from Leu-357 to Lys-778 into the pGEX4T-3 expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The GST-fusion proteins was expressed in Escherichia coli XL1-blue in the presence of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, purified and used to immunize rabbits. Polyclonal antibody against LOK was affinity-purified using the GST and GST-LOK proteins bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The antibody was used to detect LOK by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. NFS5.3 (pre-B cell line) (12Hardy R.R. Dangl J.L. Hayakawa K. Jager G. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl.

Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For the kinase assay of LOK (Fig. 5), each plasmid DNA was transfected into COS7 cells by the calcium phosphate method. The cells were lysed after 48 h of transfection in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmEDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 50 units/ml aprotinin. For the co-transfection experiment (Fig. 6), COS7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) and, after 24 h of transfection, cells were lysed as described previously (19Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Cell lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) for 30 min and incubated with anti-FLAG (M2, Eastman Kodak Co.), anti-LOK antibody, or anti-HA (12CA5) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose, washed with lysis buffer, and then washed with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 3 mmMnCl2). To assay the kinase activity of LOK, the immunoprecipitates were incubated with 20 μm cold ATP and [γ-32P]ATP with/without substrates for 20 min at 30 °C. The substrates include casein, histone IIA, and myelin basic protein (MBP). To assay the activity of MAPK, JNK/SAKP, or p38, samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 3 μg of MBP, c-Jun, or ATF2 as described previously (20Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K.

The reaction products were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were fixed, dried, and autoradiographed.Figure 6LOK activates none of ERK2, JNK/SAPK, and p38 in COS7 cells. COS7 cells (2 × 105 cells) were transiently transfected with pSRα-HA-MAPK (A), pSRα-HA-SAPK (B), or pSRα-HA-p38 (C) in the presence of the empty expression vector (negative control, lane 1) or the expression plasmid encoding LOK, wt LOK (lanes 2 and 3) or kinase inactive mutant of LOK, mutKR LOK (lanes 4 and 5). The amounts of transfected wild type or mutant LOK plasmids in lanes 3 and 5 were 10 times that in lanes 2 and 4. As a positive control, pSRα-MAPKK (A), pSRα-SEK1 (B), or pSRα-MKK6 (C) were co-transfected in place of the LOK plasmids (lane 6). HA-MAPK, HA-SAPK, or HA-p38 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of the COS7 transfectants by anti-HA antibody. Their kinase activity was measured by the in vitrokinase assay using MBP, c-Jun, and ATF-2 as a substrate, respectively. Phosphorylation of each substrate was quantified by Fuji BAS 2000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Radioactive bands excited from dried gels were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The supernatant was lyophilized and dissolved in pH 1.9 buffer containing cold phosphoamino acids as markers. The phosphoamino acids were resolved electrophoretically in two dimensions using a thin layer cellulose (TLC) plate with two pH systems (pH 1.9 and 3.5). The markers were visualized by staining with ninhydrin (21Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). To identify protein kinases expressed in lymphocyte precursor cells, degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to conserved regions of subdomains VI and IX in the catalytic domain of protein kinases were used to amplify cDNA from a mouse precursor B lymphocyte line NFS5.3. The sequence determination of randomly chosen 21 clones of the amplified products revealed that 6 of them had an identical sequence that could encode a novel kinase, most likely a serine/threonine kinase. We named this molecule lymphocyte-oriented kinase (LOK) according to its expression pattern in tissues as shown below. Since Northern blot analysis using the lok cDNA fragment as a probe detected the expression of ∼5 kilobases of mRNA in NFS5.3 cell line as well as in thymus and spleen (data not shown), a cDNA library was prepared from mouse thymus and screened with the cDNA fragment to isolate full-length lok cDNAs. The nucleotide sequence of the obtained full-length cDNA (5033 base pairs) showed an open reading frame of 966 amino acids with the Kozak consensus (22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) at the initiation codon (Fig.1). The 3′-untranslated region contains 20 repeats of dinucleotide CA, representing a microsatellite sequence (Fig. 1. thin underlined). The kinase domain is located at the N terminus of the protein and contains all 11 subdomains of serine/threonine kinases (Fig. 1,boxed, and Fig. 3B) (23Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). Within the kinase domain, LOK displays the highest homology to members of the STE20 family such as PAK and GCK with 38–46% identity (Fig.2). Moreover, the subdomain VIII of LOK contains the sequence GTPY/FWMAPEV characteristic for the STE20 family, indicating that LOK is a new member of the family. However, the C-terminal non-catalytic domain of LOK does not show any homology to known members of the family. Homology search of the non-catalytic domain of LOK failed to find any homologous proteins except rat AT1–46 carrying no kinase domain (see “Discussion”). The C-terminal region of LOK is predominately α-helical and supposed to form a coiled-coil structure (Fig. 1, shaded, and Fig.3 B), as predicted by the Pepcoil algorithm (Fig. 3 A). Between the catalytic domain and the coiled-coil region, there is a proline-rich region containing putative SH3-binding motifs, PXXP (Fig. 1, thickly underlined, and Fig. 3 B).Figure 2Alignment of the catalytic domain of LOK with that of other STE20 family members. The predicted amino acid sequence of the kinase domain of LOK was aligned with the corresponding domains of hGCK, hKHS, hHPK1, hMST1, mNIK, hSOK-1, rPAK1, STE20, and Sps1. The 11 subdomains conserved in protein kinases are indicated inRoman numbers above the sequences. The numbers at the right indicate the amino acid positions.

The polyclonal antibody generated against LOK-GST fusion proteins could detect the same protein in lok cDNA-transfected COS7 cells (Fig.4 C). The expression of LOK in various mouse tissues was then examined by Western blotting with this antibody. Surprisingly, LOK expression was found not ubiquitous and rather restricted to lymphoid organs such as spleen, thymus and bone marrow (Fig. 4, A and B). Both T and B lymphocytes in spleen expressed LOK (Fig. 4 B). Analysis of LOK in a panel of in vitro cell lines confirmed the predominant expression of the kinase in lymphocytes (Fig.4 C, not all data shown). Eventually this pattern of expression led us to designate this kinase lymphocyte-oriented kinase, LOK. Since the nucleotide sequence predicted LOK as a novel serine/threonine kinase, we next analyzed whether the LOK protein was enzymatically active (Fig. 5). FLAG epitope-tagged LOK immunoprecipitated from COS7 transfectants autophosphorylated itself and phosphorylated substrates such as myelin basic protein and histone IIA when analyzed by the in vitro kinase assay. Furthermore, native LOK immunoprecipitated from the B cell line WEHI 231 also showed the kinase activity (Fig. 5 A, lane 10). The phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that serine and threonine residues but not tyrosine residues were phosphorylated in LOK and histone IIA (Fig. 5 B). The substitution of lysine at position 65 in the ATP-binding site of the catalytic domain with arginine (KR mutant) abolished the kinase activity of LOK (Fig.5 A, lane 9), indicating that the observed kinase activity was directly from LOK and not from other molecules associated with LOK. Thus, LOK indeed functions as a serine/threonine kinase. Many of the STE20 family members have been shown to activate the JNK/SAPK MAP kinase cascade and/or the p38 MAP kinase cascade (24Pombo C.M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked a question which cascade of the known MAP kinases (ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38) could be activated by LOK. The lokcDNA tagged with FLAG was transfected to COS7 cells together with HA epitope-tagged cDNAs encoding either ERK, JNK/SAPK, or p38. The activation of each MAP kinase was analyzed by the immune complex kinase assay using c-Jun, ATF-2, and myelin basic protein as substrates, respectively (Fig. 6). Even though slight elevation (1.2∼1.9-fold increase) of the activity was observed in all three MAP kinases coexpressed with wild-type LOK as compared with controls coexpressed with empty vectors, the coexpression of the kinase-dead KR mutant of LOK gave comparable increase of the MAP kinase activity. In contrast, the coexpression of MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK, SEK1/MKK4, and MKK6) greatly enhanced the activity of the corresponding MAP kinases. Therefore, we concluded that LOK activated none of the known MAP kinase cascades at least in COS7 cells. The present study has revealed that LOK is a new member of the STE20 family and has unique features among the family. First of all, LOK was found to be expressed predominantly in lymphocytes. GCK (germinal center kinase) is expressed ubiquitously, despite its original naming, like many of other family members (31Katz P. Whalen G. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16802-16809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A few members show the expression pattern relatively restricted to a certain tissue: PAK3/PAKβ in brain (32Manser E. Chong C. Zhao Z.-S. Leung T. Michael G. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25070-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and HPK1 in hematopoietic cells (25Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 26Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Those tissue-specific kinases including LOK may play important roles in response to a certain external stimulus in a tissue-specific manner. LOK is expressed in both B and T lymphocytes throughout their life, from early stage of their development in bone marrow and thymus till the differentiated effector phase in the periphery. Since recent studies have clarified that precursor cells of both B and T lymphocytes use the same or very similar mechanisms to regulate their differentiation (3Karasuyama H. Rolink A. Melchers F. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 63: 1-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Borst J. Jacobs H. Brouns G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), LOK may be involved in such regulations. Second, LOK has a unique non-catalytic domain, which does not have any similarity to that of other members of the STE20 family. The family can be divided into three subfamilies based on the overall structure (6Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar): (a) the archetypal PAK subfamily, containing an N-terminal p21-binding domain and a C-terminal kinase domain; (b) the pleckstrin homology-PAK subfamily, having a structure similar to the archetypal PAK subfamily, except they contain a pleckstrin homology domain N-terminal to the p21-binding domain (this subfamily has been found so far only in yeast but not in higher eukaryotes); (c) the GCK subfamily, having a kinase domain at the N terminus and lacking a recognizable p21-binding domain. Among this subfamily GCK (31Katz P. Whalen G. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16802-16809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), KHS (27Tung R.M. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), HPK1 (25Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 26Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and NIK (28Su Y. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) have extensive homology with each other in their non-catalytic domain to make one subgroup, whereas Mst1 (33Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and Mst2 (34Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 167: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) makes another subgroup. Although the overall structure of LOK indicates that LOK belongs to the GCK subfamily, the C-terminal non-catalytic domain displayed no resemblance to that of other members of the GCK subfamily including SOK1 (35Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and Sps1 (36Friesen H. Lunz R. Doyle S. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2162-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, LOK appears to be a distinct member of the subfamily. Homology search of the nucleotide sequence of LOK non-catalytic domain identified rat AT1–46 cDNA with 85% identity, and the C-terminal half of LOK shows 96% amino acid identity to AT1–46 protein (37Schaar D.G. Varia M.R. Elkabes S. Ramakrishnan L. Dreyfus C.F. Black I.B. Brain Res. 1996; 721: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This gene was originally cloned from rat brain and predicted to encode a 472-amino acid protein with no kinase domain, which corresponds to the coiled-coil region of LOK. Even though the authors claimed to have obtained a full-length AT1–46 cDNA of 4320 base pairs, their Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a single band of 5.2-kilobase transcripts hybridized with the cDNA. Moreover, the expression of the transcripts was highest in thymus and spleen and lowest in brain. Therefore, AT1–46 appears to be a part of the cDNA encoding rat homologue of mouse LOK. Outside of the kinase domain, LOK possesses two intriguing regions that have potential to interact with other molecules. The proline-rich region with PXXP motifs found near the middle of the protein is a good candidate for the binding site of SH3-carrying molecules (38Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar,39Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). PAK and NIK among the STE20 family members have been shown to associate through their proline-rich motifs with the adaptor protein Nck, which is composed of three SH3 domains and one SH2 domain and a common target for a variety of growth factor receptors (28Su Y. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 40Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 41Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A. Knaus U.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20997-21000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined what kind of a SH3-carrying molecule(s) is bound to the proline-rich region of LOK. The C-terminal half of LOK is predicted to form a ∼400-amino acid coiled-coil structure. This region exhibits a 24% amino acid sequence identity with the intermediate filament-associated protein, trichohyalin, which associates with keratin intermediate filaments (43Lee S.C. Kim I.G. Marekov L.N. O'Keefe E.J. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12164-12176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the coiled-coil structure of LOK is indicative of its interaction with itself (homodimerization) or with other coiled-coil proteins (heterodimerization). LOK activated none of the known MAP kinase cascades, ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38 (44Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), when expressed in COS7 cells together with the MAP kinases. In contrast, the archetypal PAK subfamily members and many of GCK subfamily members have been shown to activate the JNK/SAPK MAP kinase cascade, most likely via MEKK1 (or MLK3) and MKK4/SEK (24Pombo C.M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). At least two possibilities can be considered to explain why LOK failed to activate the known MAP kinase cascades. Ample of evidence indicates that the STE20 family resides near the top of the MAP kinase cascades and functions as a MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase (6Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Since the expression of LOK is mostly restricted to lymphocytes, it may not be surprising that a putative MAPKKK and/or MAPKK downstream of LOK is also expressed predominantly in lymphocytes. If this is the case, LOK could not activate the MAP kinases in the ectopic system with COS7 cells in the absence of these MAPKKK and MAPKK. Alternatively, LOK may be involved in an as yet unidentified MAP kinase cascade(s) working in lymphocytes. In this sense it is interesting to note that several “orphan” MAP kinase cascade modules such as ERK5 and its activator MEK5 have been described, in which upstream activators and downstream targets remain to be determined (45Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Since at least five MAP kinase cascades have been identified in yeast (46Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), it would be reasonable to speculate the existence of more distinct MAP kinase cascades in mammals in addition to the known ones. Some members of the STE20 family have been shown to become activated by stress such as inflammatory cytokines and H2O2(9Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 35Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether such stress can activate LOK in lymphocytes. The stimulation of lymphocytes with tumor necrosis factor α, H2O2, and mitogens such as lipopolysaccharide and anti-CD3 antibody failed to increase LOK kinase activity significantly, as determined by the immune complex kinase assay (unpublished observation). The problem in this in vitro kinase assay was that the basal activity of LOK isolated from unstimulated lymphocytes was already considerably high and might have obscured the activation of LOK. This high basal activity seems a common feature of the GCK subfamily in this assay (25Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is not clear yet that this high basal activity is due to autophosphorylation and autoactivation of LOK in the presence of ATPin vitro or indeed reflects the constitutive activation of LOK in vivo. Since NIK (NFκB-inducing kinase), a newly identified MAPKKK, has been shown to be involved in activation of NFκB (47Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility of involvement of LOK in this activation. However, LOK did not activate NFκB, and the KR mutant of LOK did not interfere the activation of NFκB by tumor necrosis factor α, at least when analyzed in L929 fibroblast. 2S. Kuramochi and H. Karasuyama, unpublished observation. Thus, possible elements upstream and downstream of LOK remain to be identified. Nevertheless, the predominant expression of LOK in lymphocytes and its distinctive non-catalytic domain make LOK very attractive among the STE20 family members. The expression of LOK not only in mature lymphocytes but also in their precursors in bone marrow and thymus may suggest an intriguing potential involvement in regulation of differentiation, proliferation, and activation of lymphocytes. To explore this possibility, we are in the process of establishing mice deficient for LOK. Furthermore, identification of molecules bound to the proline-rich motif and the coiled-coil structure of LOK should help us to understand the pathway of signal transduction through LOK.

https://openalex.org/W1991697282,"The nucleotide 73 (N73) “discriminator” base in the acceptor stem is a key element for efficient and specific aminoacylation of tRNAs and of microhelix substrates derived from tRNA acceptor stems. This nucleotide was possibly one of the first to be used for differentiating among groups of early RNA substrates by tRNA synthetases. In contrast to many other synthetases, we report here that the class II human lysyl-tRNA synthetase is relatively insensitive to the nature of N73. We cloned, sequenced, and expressed the enzyme, which is a close homologue of the class II yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetase whose co-crystal structure (with tRNAAsp) is known. The latter enzyme has a strong requirement for G73, which interacts with 4 of the 14 residues within the “motif 2” loop of the enzyme. Even though eukaryotic lysine tRNAs also encode G73, the motif 2 loop sequence of lysyl-tRNA synthetase differs at multiple positions from that of the aspartate enzyme. Indeed, the recombinant human lysine enzyme shows little preference for G, and even charges human tRNA transcripts encoding the A73 found in E. coli lysine tRNAs. Moreover, while the lysine enzyme is the only one in E. coli to be encoded by two separate genes, a double mutant that disables both genes is complemented by a cDNA expressing the human protein. Thus, the sequence of the loop of motif 2 of human lysyl-tRNA synthetase specifies a structural variation that accommodates nucleotide degeneracy at position 73. This sequence might be used as a starting point for obtaining highly specific interactions with any given N73 by simple amino acid replacements.

This sequence might be used as a starting point for obtaining highly specific interactions with any given N73 by simple amino acid replacements. The canonical tRNA structure contains 76 nucleotides in a cloverleaf secondary structure that terminates at the 3′-end in the N73CCA76OH single-stranded tetranucleotide acceptor stem (where N indicates any nucleotide), and also contains the TψC, dihydrouridine, and anticodon stem-loop domains. In three dimensions, the four helical stems of the cloverleaf are organized into a two-domain L-shaped structure that places the anticodon and amino acid attachment site in separate domains where they are about 76 Å apart (1Kim S.H. Suddath F.L. Quigley G.J. McPherson A. Sussman J.L. Wang A.H. Seeman N.C. Rich A. Adv. Enzymol. 1974; 185: 435-440Google Scholar). The N73CCA76OH tetranucleotide is at the 3′-end of the 12-base pair minihelix domain, which is formed by coaxial stacking of the acceptor stem with the TψC stem-loop (2Francklyn C. Schimmel P. Nature. 1989; 337: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For at least half of the tRNA synthetases, the minihelix, and a 7-base pair microhelix comprising the acceptor stem alone, are substrates for specific aminoacylation (3Martinis S.A. Schimmel P. Söll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 349-370Google Scholar). Nucleotides required for aminoacylation of these substrates generally include N73 and two or three base pairs in the helix. The constellation of acceptor helix atoms needed for aminoacylation of RNA oligonucleotide substrates constitutes an operational RNA code for amino acids that may have been part of the earliest aminoacylation systems (4Schimmel P. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Schimmel P. Ribas de Pouplana L. Cell. 1995; 81: 983-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The strong dependence of aminoacylation on the nature of N73 has also been seen with the full tRNAs. The N73 “discriminator” nucleotide was recognized early as a possible site for synthetases to discriminate between groups of tRNAs, according to their amino acid specificities (6Crothers D.M. Seno T. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3063-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). N73-dependent aminoacylation is found for synthetases that do and do not make contact with the anticodon trinucleotide in the second domain of the tRNA structure. This dependence can be so strong that, even for synthetases for which interactions with the anticodon trinucleotide contribute significantly to aminoacylation efficiency, an incorrect N73 nucleotide can obscure positive interactions with the anticodon (7Lee C.P. Mandal N. Dyson M.R. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7149-7152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for recognition of the discriminator base, an especially useful paradigm is provided by the crystal structure of yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetase complexed with tRNAAsp (8Cavarelli J. Rees B. Ruff M. Thierry J.-C. Moras D. Nature. 1993; 362: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 9Ruff M. Krishnaswamy S. Boeglin M. Poterszman A. Mitschler A. Podjarny A. Rees B. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Science. 1991; 252: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). This protein is one of ten class II tRNA synthetases that are characterized by three highly degenerate sequence motifs in the class-defining active site domain (10Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Motifs 1, 2, and 3 make up a helix-loop-strand, strand-loop-strand, and strand-helix, respectively. In the co-crystal, four residues (Glu, Asn, Ser, and Thr) in the 14-amino acid loop of motif 2 provide interactions with G73 of tRNAAsp. These include a backbone contact by Asn and a hydrogen bond between the carboxyl of Glu to the exocyclic N-2 of G, and between the OH groups of Ser and Thr with N-1 and O-6 of the base. These interactions are consistent with the high sensitivity of aminoacylation of minihelices or of tRNAAsp transcripts to the nature of N73 (11Frugier M. Florentz C. Giegé R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2218-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). High sensitivity of aminoacylation to the nature of N73 is also seen with other class II enzymes (12Shi J.-P. Francklyn C. Hill K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13McClain W.H. Foss K. Jenkins R.A. Schneider J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The crystal structure of the class II Escherichia colilysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) 1The abbreviations used are: LysRS, lysyl-tRNA synthetase; hLysRS, human lysyl-tRNA synthetase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; LB, Luria-Bertani; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; kbp, kilobase pair(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. has also been solved to 2.8-Å resolution (22Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). While within class II much diversity in structure and sequence is seen, the structure of the lysine enzyme is a close homologue to that of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, thus establishing that the two enzymes are more related to each other than to most other class II enzymes. While a co-crystal with tRNALys in the region of the acceptor stem has not been solved, the close similarity of the lysine enzyme to aspartyl-tRNA synthetase suggests that tRNA interactions are likely to be similar. In particular, while the sizes and sequences of the loop of motif 2 are highly variable among class II synthetases, aspartyl and lysyl-tRNA synthetases align well throughout this region. The importance of A73 in the E. coli lysine system was suggested from in vitro (23Tamura K. Himeno H. Asahara H. Hasegawa T. Shimizu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2335-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and in vivo (24McClain W.H. Foss K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) studies. While G73 is conserved among prokaryotic and eukaryotic aspartate tRNAs, the conserved A73 of prokaryotic lysine tRNAs is replaced by a G that is conserved among cytoplasmic eukaryotic lysine tRNAs (25Steinberg S. Misch A. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3011-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, despite the close similarity of the aspartyl- and lysyl-tRNA synthetase structure, the sequence of the loop of motif 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lysyl-tRNA synthetase differs at eight positions from that of the aspartate enzyme, including three of the four positions that contact G73 of tRNAAsp (8Cavarelli J. Rees B. Ruff M. Thierry J.-C. Moras D. Nature. 1993; 362: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 26Mirande M. Waller J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18443-18451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests that a significantly different motif 2 sequence in eukaryotic lysyl-tRNA synthetases could recognize G73or, alternatively, that the eukaryotic lysine enzyme, unlike others, does not have a high specificity for the discriminator base. Because of our interest in the development of aminoacylation systems throughout evolution, and in gaining an understanding of species barriers to aminoacylation, we focused on human LysRS as an example from the highest eukaryotes. The sequence of the loop of motif 2 of the human enzyme provided another opportunity for assessment of the relationship (if any) between the sequence of that loop and the nucleotide specificity at position 73. In addition, we wanted to determine whether the A73 of the prokaryotic lysine tRNAs would block aminoacylation of E. coli tRNALys by the human protein. A discriminator-basedependent species barrier to aminoacylation had been seen earlier with the human andE. coli glycyl-tRNA synthetases (15Hipps D. Shiba K. Henderson B. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5550-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Shiba K. Schimmel P. Motegi H. Noda T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10340-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two conserved regions in LysRS (indicated in Fig. 1) were selected from four sequences that were available, and three degenerate primers were synthesized for these regions. Using cDNA synthesized from the mRNA of a human fetal fibroblast cell line as a template, cross-species PCRs were performed for 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C. A 0.25-kbp DNA fragment that was amplified was then cloned and used as a probe for screening of a cDNA λDR2 phage library constructed from human fetal brain (5′-Stretch cDNA library,CLONTECH). Ten positive clones were obtained from about 2 × 106 plaques.Figure 1Alignment of 21 LysRSs.

The longest insert to be observed from some of the clones was 1.4 kbp. The insert was digested with BamHI and XbaI and was subcloned into the BamHI-XbaI sites of pBluescript KS(+) to construct plasmid pM102. Several subclones were constructed from pM102 using standard methods, and their sequences were determined. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with those of LysRSs from other organisms showed sequences coding for the human lysine enzyme. However, the 1.4-kbp insert lacked 5′-coding and 3′-noncoding regions of the human coding sequence. Therefore, both ends of the cDNA were extended by the modified PCR method (30Dumas J.B. Edwards M. Delort J. Mallet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5227-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Fragments of 0.5 and 0.16 kbp, respectively, were obtained from the 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR amplification (CLONTECH), resulting in a total length of the combined sequences of 1997 nucleotides. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the PILEUP program (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) that makes alignments based on the method of Needleman and Wunsch (31Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7861) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert of pM102 and the 0.5-kbp fragment of the 5′-RACE PCR product were assembled to construct plasmid pM109 that contains a full open reading frame of LysRS. The gene fragment that encodes codons 1–597 or 66–597 was cloned behind the T7 promoter of plasmid vector pET-3a (32Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pM116 and pM131, respectively. Plasmid pM116 produces full-length human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (hLysRS), and plasmid pM131 expresses a protein that is missing 65 residues at the N terminus (hLysRS-ΔN65). Codons 66–597 of hLysRS were also cloned under thelac promoter of plasmid pTZ19R (which in addition harbors the gene for ampicillin resistance) (33Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) to construct plasmid pM130. To construct oligohistidine-tagged hLysRS, a 1.8-kbp fragment from pM116 was cloned into pKS583, 2K. Shiba, unpublished result. which is a derivative of pET19b (32Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid pM368 produces a fusion protein and containing N-terminal MRGSHHHHHHSSGWVD sequence appended to full-length hLysRS. To test cross-species complementation, a lysS and lysU double-defective strain, PALΔSΔUTR/pMAK705 lysU + (constructed by Chen et al.; Ref. 34Chen J.S. Brevet A. Lapadattapolsky M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2699-2705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used. The growth of this strain is maintained by a wild type copy of lysU on a temperature-sensitive plasmid pMAK705 (Cmr) (34Chen J.S. Brevet A. Lapadattapolsky M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2699-2705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so that the strain can grow only at the lower temperature (30 °C). Strain PALΔSΔUTR/pMAK705 lysU + was transformed to ampicillin resistance at 30 °C with pM130 (which produces the 66–597 fragment of hLysRS; see above) or with pTZ19R (33Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) (as a control) and then scored for colony formation at 42 °C on LB plates containing ampicillin. A similar set of experiments was carried out with an E. coli strain, pM131/PALΔSΔUTR (DE3), which was constructed by lysogenization with phage DE3 that produces T7 RNA polymerase (32Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Plasmid pM131 (see above) was used for the DE3-lysogenized tester strain. Plasmid pKS506, which contains E. coli lysU under a tetracycline promoter in pBR322 (35Bolivar F. Rodriguez R.L. Greene P.J. Betlach M.C. Heyneker H.L. Boyer H.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1977; 2: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar),2 and pBR322 were used as controls. Crude E. coli extracts were prepared as described (27Shiba K. Schimmel P. Motegi H. Noda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30049-30055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare hLysRS-ΔN65, we used the “humanized” E. coli strain, pM131/PALΔSΔUTR(DE3), which is devoid of E. coli LysRS activity and produces the hLysRS-ΔN65 enzyme. The strain was grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB medium containing ampicillin. When the OD660 reached approximately 0.12, cells were transferred to 20 °C, induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.1 mm, and incubated for 21 h. The cell pellet was resuspended (10 ml/g of wet cells) in resuspension buffer (50 mm K2HPO4 (pH 7.5), 4 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 1 mm benzamidine, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1% volume of a saturated 2-isopropanol solution of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were treated with lysozyme at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml for 30 min with stirring. Following lysozyme treatment, cells were sonicated gently and spun at 14,000 × g for 30 min to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was partially purified by a 30–60% ammonium sulfate cut and dialyzed overnight against buffer A (50 mmK2HPO4 (pH 7.5), 2 mm β-ME). The sample was further purified on a HiLoad (26/10) Q-Sepharose Fast Flow FPLC anion exchange chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The bound protein was eluted by application of a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 300 mm (in buffer A). Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated using Centricon 30 (Amicon) concentrators. The sample was then injected onto a HiLoad (16/60) Superdex 200 prep grade sizing column (Pharmacia) preequilibrated in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-ME. The sample was eluted with 120 ml of the same buffer. The protein was exchanged into 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 6 mm dithiothreitol, and glycerol was added to 50% concentration by volume. Samples were stored at −80 °C. The above purification yielded approximately 3 mg of hLysRS-ΔN65 that was judged to be >95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (Purified hLysRS-ΔN65 migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 61 kDa.) The histidine-tagged full-length hLysRS was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enzyme concentrations were estimated by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as the standard (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). To prepare unmodified human tRNALys,3, a DNA insert containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and the gene encoding the tRNA was made by ligating six chemically synthesized oligodeoxynucleotides together as described previously (37Sampson, J. R., and Uhlenbeck, O. C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. , 85.Google Scholar). The insert was ligated intoEcoRI/BamHI-digested plasmid pVAL119 (38Liu M. Horowitz J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 264-266PubMed Google Scholar), which was a gift of Dr. Jack Horowitz (Iowa State University, Ames, IA) to generate plasmid pLYSF119. FokI-digested pLYSF119 was used to prepare tRNALys,3 by in vitro transcription according to established procedures (12Shi J.-P. Francklyn C. Hill K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase was purified according to Grodberg and Dunn (39Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) from E. colistrain BL21/pAR 1219, a gift of F. William Studier (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). RNA transcripts were purified on 16% polyacrylamide gels and stored in 10 mm Tris-HCl/1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) at −20 °C. Prior to aminoacylation assays, tRNAs were renatured in the presence of MgCl2 as described previously (40Liu H.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12708-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). N73 variants of tRNALys,3 were made by overlap extension PCR mutagenesis and were verified by sequencing. A plasmid containing the gene encodingE. coli tRNALys in front of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter was obtained as a gift from Dr. Margaret Saks (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). Digestion with BstNI allowed preparation of the unmodified transcript as described above. Fully modified E. coli tRNALys was purchased from Sigma. To determine tRNA concentrations, an ε260 of 60.4 × 104m−1 was used. Aminoacylation assays with purified enzymes were conducted at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-ME, 4 mm ATP, 20 μmlysine, 0.3 μCi/μl [3H]lysine (Amersham Corp.), 12.5 nm hLysRS-ΔN65, and 0.25–4 μm tRNA. At 20-s time intervals, 15-μl reaction aliquots were spotted onto trichloroacetic acid-soaked Whatman 3MM filter pads and washed. Kinetic parameters (k cat/K m) for aminoacylation of tRNALys,3 transcripts were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Aminoacylation activities of crude cell extracts were assayed as described previously (41Shiba K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22703-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 11.5 μg of crude extracts (determined by the Protein Assay Kit, Bio-Rad), 12 μCi of [4,5-3H]lysine (110 Ci/mmol, DuPont), 20 μmlysine, and 0.8 mg/ml E. coli MRE 600 tRNA or 0.4 mg/ml calf liver tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim) in a total reaction mixture of 100 μl. The cDNA for hLysRS was isolated by an alignment-guided cross-species PCR approach (27Shiba K. Schimmel P. Motegi H. Noda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30049-30055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Shiba K. Suzuki N. Shigesada K. Namba Y. Schimmel P. Noda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10340-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We first designed cross-species PCR primers for LysRS from an alignment of four sequences from Campylobacter jejuni (42Chan V.L. Bingham H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 695-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae (26Mirande M. Waller J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18443-18451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and two isozymes fromE. coli (43Lévêque F. Plateau P. Dessen P. Blanquet S.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3237-3243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that were available when we started the experiment. We chose two conserved regions that overlap with the class-defining motif 1 and motif 2 (10Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar) and synthesized degenerate primers KY-138, -139, and -140. PCR amplifications with KY-138/139 and KY-139/140 on a human cDNA gave 240-base pair DNA fragments whose sequences were identical and showed enough similarity to those of LysRSs from other organisms to conclude that they were derived from the human enzyme. The full-length cDNA was subsequently isolated from a human fetal brain poly(A)+ cDNA library, and 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR was performed. The resultant sequence has 1997 nucleotides in total without the poly(dA) track. This length was in agreement with the apparent size of the transcript (2.1 kbp) based on Northern blot experiments (data not shown). The DNA sequence obtained contains one long open reading frame with 597 codons that starts at nucleotide 15 and extends to nucleotide 1808. The first ATG codon and the flanking sequences (AagATGG) are consistent with the Kozak's optimal translation initiation sequence (ACCATGG) (46Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). The predicted translation product shows high sequence similarity to all of the reported LysRSs. Fig. 1 shows a multiple sequence alignment of 21 LysRSs from human, Cricetulus longicaudatus (Chinese hamster), Caenorhabditis elegans, S. cerevisiae, Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), Thermus thermophilus,Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae,Mycoplasma fermentans, Mycoplasma hominis,Mycobacterium leprae, E. coli (two isozymes, LysS and LysU), Hemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Synechocystis sp., C. jejuni,Sulfolobus solfataricus (Archaea), and S. cerevisiae(mitochondria). Also given are structural elements that are based on the crystal structure of the E. coli LysRS (LysU) (22Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Of the 597 amino acids in the human LysRS, 58 amino acids (10%) are strictly conserved across the 21 sequences. These conserved residues are shown by black boxes in Fig. 1. There is no large insert in the alignment. However, there is an N-terminal extension of approximately 60 amino acids in the five eukaryotic enzymes. This N-terminal extension of human LysRS is dispensable for aminoacylation activity (see below). The x-ray crystal analysis (22Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) showed that the E. coliLysRS comprises two main domains: an N-terminal anticodon recognition domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain forms a β-barrel structure with five β-strands that are surrounded by four α-helices (H1–H4). The C-terminal catalytic domain forms an eight-stranded β-sheet (βB1–βB8) flanked by four helices: H7, -8, -9, and H16. The class defining motifs 1, 2, and 3 are all located within this core structure. Between helix H9 and β-strand βB5, a long polypeptide is inserted into the structure. A similar insertion is also observed in yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (9Ruff M. Krishnaswamy S. Boeglin M. Poterszman A. Mitschler A. Podjarny A. Rees B. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Science. 1991; 252: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). One of the β-strands of this insertion (βB4) forms the core of the β-sheet in the catalytic domain (22Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, the primary structure of E. coli LysRS (LysU) is divided into four sub-regions based on its tertiary structure. These are the N-terminal anticodon bin"
https://openalex.org/W2090473009,"A new β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT) which involves in branch formation of Asn-linked complex-type sugar chains has been purified 224,000-fold from bovine small intestine. This enzyme requires divalent cations, such as Mn2+, and catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to biantennary oligosaccharide and produces triantennary oligosaccharide with the β1–4-linked GlcNAc residue on the Manα1–3 arm. The purified enzyme shows a single band ofM r 58,000 and behaves as a monomer. The substrate specificity demonstrated that the β1–2-linked GlcNAc residue on the Manα1–3 arm (GnT-I product) is essential for the enzyme activity. β1–4-Galactosylaion to this essential β1–2-linked GlcNAc residue or N-acetylglucosaminylation to the β-linked Man residue (bisecting GlcNAc, GnT-III product) blocks the enzyme action, while β1–6-N-acetylglucosaminylation to the Manα1–6 arm (GnT-V product) increases the transfer. Based on these findings, we conclude that the purified enzyme is UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:α-3-d-mannoside β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV (GnT-IV), that has been a missing link on biosynthesis of complex-type sugar chains.

The complex-type of oligosaccharides are synthesized through elongation by glycosyltransferases after trimming of the precursor oligosaccharides transferred to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases (GnTs) 1The abbreviations used are: GnT,N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases; PA, 2-aminopyridine; NeuAc, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Man and M,d-mannose; Gn, N-acetylglucosamine; Gal and G, d-galactose; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; the structures of sugar chains and their abbreviations used in this study are shown in Fig. 1.1The abbreviations used are: GnT,N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases; PA, 2-aminopyridine; NeuAc, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Man and M,d-mannose; Gn, N-acetylglucosamine; Gal and G, d-galactose; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; the structures of sugar chains and their abbreviations used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. take part in the formation of branches in the biosynthesis of complex-type sugar chains. In vertebrates, six GnTs, designated as GnT-I to -VI, which catalyze the transfer of GlcNAc to the core mannose residues of Asn-linked sugar chains, have been identified (1Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Hull E. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 351-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), GnT-V — GlcNAc β1 GnT-VI — GlcNAc β1 GnT-II — GlcNAc β1 GnT-IV — GlcNAc β1 GnT-I — GlcNAc β1 ↘ → ↗ → ↗ 6 4 2 4 2 GlcNAcβ1—GnT-III Man α1↘ ↓ 6 4 3 Manα1↗ Manβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc-Asn INTERACTION IThe complex-type sugar chains play important roles in many biological phenomena, such as control of glycoprotein hormone activity and cell-cell interactions. Some of the functions of sugar chains are closely related to their branching structure. For example, highly branched complex-type sugar chains are essential for the effective expression of in vivo biological activity of human erythropoietin since the activity correlates to the ratio of tetra-antennary to biantennary oligosaccharides (2Takeuchi M. Inoue N. Strickland T.W. Kubota M. Wada M. Shimizu R. Hoshi S. Kozutsumi H. Takasaki S. Kobata A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7819-7822Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the branching of sugar chains increases with the malignancy of tumor cells (3Yamashita K. Tachibana Y. Ohkura T. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pierce M. Arango J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10772-10777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Yoshimura et al. (5Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the sugar chains produced by the action of GnT-V are involved in invasion and cell attachment in the extravation stage of lung metastasis (5Yoshimura M.

Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Among known mammalian GnTs, only GnT-IV has not been purified, and its gene structure remains unknown. GnT-IV (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:α1,3-d-mannoside β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.145) catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to the GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3 arm of core oligosaccharide [Gn2(2′2)core oligosaccharide] and forms GlcNAcβ1–4(GlcNAcβ1–2)Manα1–3 structure on the core oligosaccharide (Gn3(2′,4,2)core oligosaccharide). The activity of GnT-IV was first identified in the hen oviduct by Gleeson and Schachter (18Gleeson P.A. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6162-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the rat, most tissues express GnT-IV activity, which is relatively high in the spleen and small intestine (19Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The products of GnT-IV (tri- and tetra-antennary sugar chains) are normally found in many glycoproteins, such as fetuin (20Nilsson B. Nordén N.E. Svensson S. J. Biol.

Although these phenomena were reported, the mechanism of the regulation of GnT-IV activity is unknown. We report here isolation and characterization of GnT-IV from the bovine small intestine. Uridine, UMP, UDP, UTP, TDP, CDP, UDP-hexanolamine agarose, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, 2′-deoxy-UDP, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine were obtained from Sigma. Q-Sepharose FF, chelating-Sepharose FF, and Superdex 200 were products of Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens was purchased from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan). β-Galactosidase from Aspergillus sp. was purchased from Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan). β-N-Acetylhexosaminidase from jack bean was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). RecombinantN-glycosidase F was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). GnT-IV activity was assayed using fluorescence-labeled substrate according to the method of Nishikawa et al. (19Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with some modifications (26Tokugawa K. Oguri S. Takeuchi M. Glycocojugate J. 1995; 13: 53-56Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Preparation of the substrate Gn2(2′,2)core-PA (Fig.1) was done as reported (26Tokugawa K. Oguri S. Takeuchi M. Glycocojugate J. 1995; 13: 53-56Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Enzyme solution (15 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h with 125 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.8 mmsubstrate, 20 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 7.5 mmMnCl2, 200 mm GlcNAc, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 50 μl. After the incubation, 50 μl of water was added and the enzyme reaction was stopped by boiling for 2 min. After filtration, 5 μl of the reaction mixture was applied to a TSK ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 150 mm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Reverse phase chromatography was performed at 50 °C with a 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.15% 1-butanol at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Fluorescence was monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. The specific activity of the enzyme was expressed as moles of products per hour of incubation per mg of protein. The Gn3(2′,4,2)core-PA (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) was used as the standard. Activities of GnT-III and -V were measured according to the method of Nishikawa et al. (19Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The activities of GnT-I and GnT-II were measured by the method of Schachter et al. (1Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Hull E.

Structures of all oligosaccarides used in the assay are shown in Fig. 1. (GGn)2(2′,2)core-PA and Gn2(2′,2)core-PA was prepared from pyridylaminated biantennary sugar chains isolated from human apo-transferrin by glycosidase digestion (26Tokugawa K. Oguri S. Takeuchi M.

Core-PA was prepared from Gn2(2′,2)core-PA by digestion with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase in 150 mm sodium citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, at 37 °C for 20 h. GGn(2′),Gn(2)core-PA was prepared from (NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6)(Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA (Takara) and Gn(2′), GGn(2)core-PA was prepared from (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6)(NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA (Takara) by sequential digestion with sialidase after β-galactosidase treatment. Gn(2′)core-PA was prepared from GGn(2′), Gn(2)core-PA, and Gn(2)core-PA was prepared from Gn(2′),GGn(2)core-PA by sequential digestion with β-galactosidase after β-N-acetylhexosaminidase treatment. Exoglycosidase digests were purified on a TSK ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 150 mm, Tosoh). Gn3(6′,2′,2)core-PA was prepared from Gn2(2′,2)core-PA by the reaction of GnT-V using CHO-K1 cell extracts as a crude GnT-V preparation. Harvested CHO-K1 cells were sonicated in 2 volumes of 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 900 ×g for 10 min, the supernatant was used as the crude GnT-V preparation. Sixty microliters of the crude GnT-V preparation, 40 μl of 1.6 mm Gn2(2′,2)core-PA, and 100 μl of the reaction buffer (250 mm MES, pH 6.25, 80 mmUDP-GlcNAc, 20 mm EDTA to reduce other GnTs activity, 400 mm N-GlcNAc, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100) were combined and incubated at 37 °C. After 4 h, an additional 60 μl of the crude GnT-V preparation was added and further incubated for 20 h. After boiling and filtration, the reaction mixture was applied to a reverse phase column (Vydac 218TP152010, 10 × 250 mm, Hesperia, CA). Gn3(6′,2′,2)core-PA was eluted at 50 °C with 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.15% 1-butanol at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Gn3(2′,2,bis)core-PA was prepared from the reaction mixture after measurement of GnT-IV activity in the bovine small intestine homogenate. 500 MHz 1H NMR measurement of the enzymatic product was performed with a JEOL JMG-GSX500 at 30 and 60 °C using acetone as an internal standard at δ 2.225 ppm. Smith's degradation was carried out according to the method described by Kobata and Takasaki (27Kobata A. Takasaki S. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approch. IRL Press, Oxford, England1993: 165-185Google Scholar). Molecular mass of pyridylaminated sugar chains was determined with MALDI-TOF-MS (LASER MAT 2000, Finnigan MAT, Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was done by the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 12% gel. The molecular weight marker kit (Bio-Rad) was used for size standards. Native PAGE was carried out at pH 8.8 on a 7.5% gel containing 0.1% Triton X-100 by the method of Davis (29Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1960; 121: 404-425Crossref Scopus (15912) Google Scholar). Proteins in the gels were stained with silver (Silver Stain Plus, Bio-Rad). Buffers used in this purification were as follows: Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain); Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol); Buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol); Buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m KCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol); Buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol); Buffer F (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1m KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol); Buffer G (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol); Buffer H (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol); Buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen bovine small intestine (2 kg) was minced and homogenized in 4 volumes of Buffer A with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica AG, Luzern, Switzerland) for 30 s four times at 1-min intervals. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged further at 105,000 ×g for 60 min and the microsome fraction was obtained as a precipitate. The microsome fraction was suspended with 3 volumes of Buffer A containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The suspension was gently stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fraction was collected and the residual pellet was suspended again in 1.5 volumes of the same buffer above. The first and second Triton extracts were combined (9 liters). The combined Triton X-100 extracts were applied to the Q-Sepharose FF column (5 × 30 cm) equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with 3 liters of Buffer B until the protein concentration in the eluate was reduced to below 0.1 mg/ml. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient established between 2.5 liters of Buffer B and 2.5 liters of the same buffer containing 0.5 m KCl at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The fractions containing GnT-IV activity (1 liter) were pooled. The pooled fraction from Q-Sepharose FF column chromatography was applied to the Cu2+-chelating Sepharose FF column (5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with Buffer C. The GnT-IV activity was bound completely to the column. After washing with 5 bed volumes of Buffer C, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient established between 1 liter of Buffer C and 1 liter of the same buffer containing 0.1 m glycine at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing GnT-IV activity (540 ml) were pooled and concentrated to 100 ml on a YM 30 membrane with a Diaflow Ultrafiltrater (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrate was dialyzed extensively against Buffer D. Half of the dialyzed sample (50 ml) was applied to a UDP-hexanolamine-agarose column (1.2 × 4.5 cm) equilibrated with Buffer D. The column was washed successively with 30 ml of Buffer D and 30 ml of Buffer E. GnT-IV was eluted with Buffer F. The fractions containing GnT-IV activity (4.5 ml) were pooled. The remaining dialyzed sample was fractionated using the identical column, and the fractions containing GnT-IV activity were combined. After dialysis against Buffer G, the active fractions (10 ml) were applied to a UDP-hexanolamine-agarose column (1.0 × 6.5 cm) equilibrated with Buffer G. After washing the column with 20 ml of the same buffer, GnT-IV was eluted with 20 ml of Buffer H at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The fractions containing GnT-IV activity (6 ml) were pooled. The pooled fractions were concentrated to 0.5 ml with a small column of Q-Sepharose FF. The concentrate was applied to a column of Superdex 200 HR10/30 (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated with Buffer I. GnT-IV was eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. After measurement of the protein concentration of the fractions, MnCl2 was added to give a final concentration of 10 mm. An low molecular weight kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for molecular weight calibration. The protein in the eluate of Q-Sepharose, Cu2+-chelating Sepharose, and UDP-hexanolamine column chromatographies were monitored by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The protein assays shown in Table I and the protein of the eluate of Superdex 200 column chromatography were measured by the more sensitive BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Table IPurification of GnT-IV from bovine small intestineStepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgnmol/hnmol/h/mg%-foldHomogenate112,90049,5000.441001Triton extract24,10014,5000.60291.4Q-Sepharose4,0007,2001.80144.1Cu-chelate Sepharose4503,6708.107.418.4First UDP-hexanolamine0.591,9503,3103.97,510Second UDP-hexanolamine0.0351,42040,6002.992,200Superdex 2000.00879098,8001.6224,000 Open table in a new tab Activity of GnT-IV was assayed using the fluorescence-labeled biantennary sugar chain, Gn2(2′,2)core-PA, as an acceptor substrate (19Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The assay method was originally developed to measure GnT-III, -IV, and -V activity at one time, which enabled the purification of GnT-III and -V (12Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kanagawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the sensitivity of this method for GnT-IV activity did not appear sufficient for purification. The substrate concentration used in the previous assay protocol (0.08 mm, Ref. 19Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was not high enough to detect GnT-IV activity; moreover, GnT-III and -V, which co-existed in the crude enzyme preparation, competed with GnT-IV against the same substrate. To compensate for these problems, the substrate concentration was raised to 0.8 mm. The addition of 10% glycerol and 1% bovine serum albumin in the assay solution were also effective to stabilize GnT-IV activity. As a result of these improvements, the sensitivity for detection of GnT-IV activity in the crude enzyme preparation was eight times higher than that under the previous assay condition. Using the method to survey the distribution of GnT-IV activity in rat tissues (19Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we surveyed GnT-IV activity in commercially available bovine tissues and cultured cells. Since the relative activity of GnT-IV against that of GnT-III and -V in the bovine small intestine was the highest among samples examined, we chose bovine small intestine as an enzyme source. Like other GnTs, GnT-IV was enriched in microsomes. However, about 20% of the GnT-IV activity in the homogenate was found in the cytosol fraction, suggesting that limited hydrolysis might occur. GnT-IV activity was successfully solubilized from the microsome fraction by Triton X-100 extraction. CHAPS andn-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside were less effective than Triton X-100 (data not shown). The addition of benzamidine hydrochloride, a trypsin inhibitor, was effective for maintenance of GnT-IV activity during the whole procedure. The majority of proteins in the Triton extract were removed from the GnT-IV activity by the Q-Sepharose FF column (Fig.2 A) and Cu2+-chelating Sepharose FF column chromatography (Fig.2 B) steps. After the two chromatographies, the GnT-IV active fractions still contained GnT-III and -V activities as well (data not shown). Separation of GnT-IV activity from other GnTs was carried out by affinity column chromatography (Fig. 2 C), using an analogue of the common donor substrate for GnTs (UDP-hexanolamine) as ligands. Activities of GnT-III and -V passed through the column under the chromatographic conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GnT-IV activity was bound completely to the column and eluted with 1 m KCl at pH 8.0. Since the eluted fractions still contained several proteins of various molecular weights (Fig.3, lane 4), another chromatography was performed. The GnT-IV activity was retarded on an affinity column (12Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kanagawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to which Gn2(2′,2)core-Asn was covalently bound, however, the GnT-IV activity could not be isolated from other proteins (data not shown). Neither blue, red, Q-, nor Cu2+-chelating Sepharose columns were effective for purification in this step. The separation of GnT-IV from other proteins was accomplished by the second UDP-hexanolamine column chromatography with modified elution conditions. The bound GnT-IV was eluted immediately from the column by the buffer lacking MnCl2(Fig. 2 D). The fraction containing GnT-IV was further purified by gel filtration (Fig. 2 E). The purified GnT-IV showed a single band with a molecular weight of 58,000 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, lane 6). It also showed a single band on native PAGE (Fig. 4 A), and GnT-IV activity was accompanied by a protein band (Fig. 4 B). No activity of GnT-I, -II, -III, or -V was detected in the purified GnT-IV preparation (data not shown). Table Isummarizes the purification of GnT-IV. GnT-IV was purified to homogeneity and over 224,000-fold by these procedures. A protein with a molecular weight of 45,000 in lane 4 (Fig. 3) was identified as bovine α1,3-galactosyltransferase (30Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Tunen A.J. Shaper N.L. J.

Each piece was used for enzymatic assays (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SDS-PAGE analysis of purified GnT-IV before (lane 1) and after (lane 2) digestion with peptide N-glycosidase F is shown in Fig.5. Apparent molecular weight was reduced by 3,000 as a result of glycosidase treatment indicating that GnT-IV is a glycoprotein with Asn-linked sugar chains. As shown Fig.2 E, the apparent molecular weight of GnT-IV was estimated to be 73,000 by gel filtration in the presence of Triton X-100. This estimated molecular weight may be larger than the actual size, since membrane proteins migrate as protein-detergent complexes on gel filtration columns. These observations together suggest that GnT-IV is a monomer with a molecular weight of 58,000. GnT-IV was the most active between pH 7.0 and 8.0 with an optimum of pH 7.3 (Fig. 6). GnT-IV activity depends on MnCl2concentration, and the optimum concentration of MnCl2 was 10 mm. When MnCl2 concentration was increased, the activity gradually decreased and was suppressed by 50% at 60 mm (data not shown). The effects of other divalent cations at 10 mm concentration were examined (TableII). Each divalent cation was added to the GnT-IV preparation which had been treated with 1 mmEDTA followed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol and 0.05% Triton X-100. GnT-IV maintained slight activity without the addition of any metal but lost activity completely by the addition of EDTA and CuCl2. The activity was maximal with MnCl2, while CoCl2and MgCl2 were less effective. CaCl2 and FeCl2 had no effect. The addition of 2-mercaptoethanol (10 mm) to the enzyme had no effect on the enzyme activity (data not shown).Table IIEffect of divalent cations on GnT-IV activityAdditionActivity%No5.6EDTA0MnCl2100CoCl274.8MgCl272.5CaCl27.2FeCl29.8CuCl20GnT-IV inactivated by the addition of 1 mm EDTA was used after dialysis against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol.

Activity is expressed as percent of β1,4-GlcNAc transfer observed in the presence of MnCl2. To identify the sugar chain structure produced by the enzyme, the product of GnT-IV using Gn2(2′,2)core-PA as a substrate was subjected to Smith's degradation. The molecular weight of the degradation fragments were monitored with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (data not shown). Before Smith's degradation, the molecular weight of the enzymatic products was 1598.2. After the first and second cycle of Smith's degradation, the molecular weights of the fragments were 795.3 and 634.7, respectively. This degradation pattern was consistent with that of the GnT-IV product shown in Fig. 7.1H NMR analysis of the enzymatic product showed peaks of chemical shifts at 4.53, 4.54, and 4.55 ppm, which correspond to those of anomeric protons of GlcNAc 7, GlcNAc 5, and GlcNAc 5′ (31Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-374Crossref Scopus (792) Google Scholar) in Fig.7, respectively. GlcNAc 7 should link to mannose 4 through β-linkage, because its spin coupling constant (J 1,2) is 7.9 Hz. These data indicate that the enzymatic product has the structure of Gn3(2′,4,2)core-PA (Fig. 1). To understand the relative effects of nucleotides and sugar nucleotides against UDP-GlcNAc, the activities of GnT-IV were measured in the presence of 2 mm UDP-GlcNAc analogues (TableIII). UDP was the most potent inhibitor. The uracil moiety appeared to be essential for the inhibition of nucleotides, since TDP and CDP did not inhibit enzyme activity. A comparison of uridine, UMP, UDP, and UTP suggested that the number of phosphoesters should be important for inhibition. The sugar nucleotides having the UDP moiety also inhibited enzyme activity, including UDP-hexanolamine which was used as an affinity ligand for enzyme purification.Table IIIEffects of nucleotides on GnT-IV activityAdditionActivity%None100Uridine115UMP97.3UDP27.3UTP88.2TDP110CDP1122′-Deoxy-UDP67.4UDP-hexanolamine73.6UDP-glucose56.6UDP-galactose87.3UDP-glucuronic acid92.3UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine59.7As described under “Experimental Procedures,” purified enzyme (3 μg/ml) was incubated in the reaction mixture with 0.5 mmUDP-GlcNAc and 2 mm inhibitors.

Activity is expressed as percent of β1,4-GlcNAc transfer observed in the absence of inhibitor. Acceptor substrate specificity of GnT-IV was examined with a set of complex-type sugar chains as listed in Fig. 1. Purified GnT-IV appeared to select its substrate clearly (Table IV). It transferred GlcNAc to Gn(2)core-PA (GnT-I and α-mannosidase II product) and Gn2(2′,2)core-PA (GnT-II product) structures. The addition of a GlcNAcβ1–6 at Manα1–6 residue of the core-PA structure (i.e. GnT-V product) increased the transfer rate about 150% (Gn3(6′,2′,2)core-PA against Gn2(2′,2)core-PA), while the addition of a GlcNAcβ1–4 at the Manβ1–4 residue of the core-PA structure (Gn3(2′,2,bis)core-PA, GnT-III products) prevented the transfer. The addition of fucose at the chitobiose portion through α1–6 linkage reduced the transfer rate about 50% (Gn2(2′,2)coreF-PA against Gn2(2′,2)core-PA). The addition of galactose to GlcNAc(2′) of the Gn2(2′,2)core-PA (GGn(2′),Gn(2)core-PA) reduced the transfer rate significantly, and the addition of a galactose to GlcNAc(2) of the Gn2(2′,2)core-PA (Gn(2′),GGn(2)core-PA) prevented the transfer. GnT-IV did not react with either of the sugar chains without GnT-I product, a GlcNAcβ1–2 at Manα1–3 residue of the core structure (Core-PA and Gn(2′)core-PA).Table IVSubstrate specificity of GnT-IVAcceptorsRelative activity%Core-PA0Gn(2)core-PA54Gn(2′)core-PA0Gn2(2′,2)core-PA100Gn2(2′,2)coreF-PA46Gn(2′),GGn(2)core-PA0GGn(2′),Gn(2)core-PA16(GGn)2(2′,2)core-PA0Gn3(2′,2,bis)core-PA0Gn3(6′,2′,2)core-PA164Purified GnT-IV (4 μg/ml) was assayed in the standard mixture described under “Experimental Procedures” except that the concentration of acceptors was 0.15 mm.

Open table in a new tab Purified GnT-IV (4 μg/ml) was assayed in the standard mixture described under “Experimental Procedures” except that the concentration of acceptors was 0.15 mm. Relative activity is expressed as percent of β1,4-GlcNAc transfer observed in the presence of Gn2(2′,2)core-PA as an acceptor. The structures of acceptor sugar chains are shown in Fig. 1. Lineweaver-Burk plots of kinetic data obtained with the purified GnT-IV preparation at a 40 mmUDP-GlcNAc concentration were linear, and gave the following kinetic constants: K m values for Gn2(2′,2)core-PA and Gn3(6′,2′,2)core-PA were 0.73 and 0.13 mm, respectively, andV max values for the same substrates were 3.23 and 1.75 μm/min, respectively. The K m value for UDP-GlcNAc was 0.22 mm in 0.8 mmGn2(2′,2)core-PA as an acceptor. A new β1,4-GlcNAc transferase was purified from the membrane fraction of bovine intestine. The enzyme transfers GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to Gn2(2′,2)core-PA and produces Gn3(2′,4,2)core-PA. This enzyme also acts on Gn2(2′,2)core oligosaccharides attached to glycoproteins (data not shown), suggesting that the enzyme belongs to the branch-forming GlcNAc transferases for Asn-linked sugar chains. Schachter et al. (18Gleeson P.A. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6162-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) classified such GlcNAc transferases from GnT-I to GnT-VI (1Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Hull E. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 351-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Among them, GnT-III, -IV, and -VI are β1,4-GlcNAc transferases which produce β1–4GlcNAc branches on the β-linked Man residue, the Manα1–3 residue, and the Manα1–6 residue of the core oligosaccharides, respectively (1Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Hull E. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 351-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Brockhausen I. Hull E. Hindsgaul O. Schachter H. Shah R.N. Michnick S.W. Carver J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11211-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β1,4-GlcNAc transferase newly purified in this paper was identified as GnT-IV, because the1H NMR of the product oligosaccharide clearly indicated that the enzyme produced Gn3(2′,4,2)core-PA exclusively. The substrate specificity of purified GnT-IV matched almost perfectly to that studied by Gleeson and Schachter (18Gleeson P.A. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6162-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the hen oviduct microsome fraction as an enzyme source: as shown in Table IV, (i) GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3 residue was absolutely required, (ii) galactosylation (GGn(2′),Gn(2)core-PA or Gn(2′),GGn(2)core-PA) reduced or even prevented the transfer, (iii) bisecting GlcNAc (Gn3(2′,2,bis)core-PA) prevented the transfer. The only disagreement (to Ref. 18Gleeson P.A. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6162-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the fact that the activity of purified GnT-IV was inhibited up to 50% by fucose residue linked α1–6 to non-reducing GlcNAc (Gn2(2′,2)coreF-PAversus Gn2(2′,2)core-PA, Table IV) while the crude enzyme was not. This may due to the structural difference at the reducing termini of the substrate from PA-derivatives to sugar peptides. According to the K m values, GnT-IV prefers Gn3(6′,2′,2)core-PA (0.13 mm) rather than Gn2(2′,2)core-PA (0.73 mm). On the other hand, GnT-V prefers Gn3(2′,4,2)core-PA as was reported by Nishikawa et al. (12Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kanagawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These substrate specificities of GnT-IV and -V suggest that triantennary sugar chains are always promoted to tetra-antennary ones. However, glycoproteins with tetra-antennary sugar chains are relatively rare. There must be either an imbalance of those enzymes or some factors in glycoproteins which prevent or promote the access of those enzymes (33Takeuchi M. Kobata A.

It should be quite interesting to investigate the relationship between branch structure of complex-type sugar chains and activity valance among GnT-III, -IV, -V, and β1,4-GalT. Our result clearly showed that purified GnT-IV could act on the mono-antennary Gn(2)core-PA (product of GnT-I and α-mannosidase II) and produced the Gn2(4,2)core sugar chain known as an abnormal biantennary type. Such an abnormal sugar chain appears on hCG from choriocarcinoma (24Mizuochi T. Nishimura R. Derappe C. Taniguchi T. Hamamoto T. Mochizuki M. Kobata A. J. Biol.

It would be quite interesting to examine if GnT-IV activity correlates with the advances of malignancy on those cancer cells. GnT-IV potentially contributes to the production of glycoprotein hormones sharing highly branched sugar chains. The specific activity of GnT-IV in CHO cells used widely for protein production is relatively low (20 pmol/h/mg), which is about 5% of GnT-V specific activity. It is expected that CHO cells with elevated GnT-IV activity by incorporation of the GnT-IV gene will increase the production of tetra-antennae. Cloning of the GnT-IV gene is now in progress in our laboratory.

https://openalex.org/W1987148054,"We have investigated the expression and extracellular release of active, recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2), an enzyme that is a potentially important determinant of M. tuberculosisinfection and whose extracellular release is correlated with pathogenicity. The M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase gene encodes a polypeptide of 478 amino acids; 12 such subunits comprise the active enzyme. Northern blot, nuclease S1, and primer extension analyses revealed glutamine synthetase specific transcripts of ∼1,550 and 1,650 nucleotides produced under low and high nitrogen conditions, respectively. Expression of recombinant M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase in Escherichia coliYMC21E, a glutamine synthetase deletion mutant, led to transcomplementation of the mutant but not to release of active enzyme. Expression in Mycobacterium smegmatis 1-2c, from the gene's own promoter, resulted in the release of >95% of all recombinant enzyme. No hybrid molecules containing M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis glutamine synthetase subunits were detected. Native and recombinant exported and intracellular glutamine synthetase molecules were indistinguishable from one another by mass, N-terminal amino acid sequence, antibody reactivity, and enzymatic activity. Since M. tuberculosisglutamine synthetase is similar to other, strictly intracellular, bacterial glutamine synthetases and the DNA sequence upstream of the structural gene does not encode a leader peptide, the information to target the protein for export must be contained in its amino acid sequence and/or conformation.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a facultative intracellular parasite, is one of the world's most important pathogens, with new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and deaths numbering many million annually (1Kochi A. Tubercle. 1991; 72: 1-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The rising worldwide incidence of tuberculosis and the emergence of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains underscore the need for a better understanding of the biology of the organism and the development of new approaches to combat tuberculosis (2Centers for Disease Control MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 1991; 40: 585-591PubMed Google Scholar). We recently identified glutamine synthetase (l-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming); EC 6.3.1.2) as one of several potentially important determinants of M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. Glutamine synthetase may influence the ammonia level within the phagosome containing the pathogen in host cells, profoundly altering physiological conditions in the phagosome, and the enzyme may be directly involved in the synthesis of poly-l-glutamic acid/glutamine found in abundance in the cell wall of pathogenic but not nonpathogenic mycobacteria (3Harth G. Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9342-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A remarkable finding in our previous study was that M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase is abundantly secreted by pathogenic mycobacteria but not by nonpathogenic mycobacteria or nonmycobacterial organisms and that it is released into its phagosome in infected human macrophages. To learn more about this vital enzyme and to develop its potential as a target for novel antimycobacterial drugs, we undertook a detailed molecular analysis of the M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase gene. The genetic analyses presented here provide evidence that (i) the glutamine synthetase gene is a single copy gene located upstream of the glnE-like gene, which encodes an adenylyl transferase in Escherichia coli, and the GSII gene 1The abbreviations used are: GSII gene, glutamine synthetase-like gene; bp, base pair(s); GSI gene, glutamine synthetase gene.1The abbreviations used are: GSII gene, glutamine synthetase-like gene; bp, base pair(s); GSI gene, glutamine synthetase gene. encoding a glutamine synthetase-like protein and (ii) transcription of the glutamine synthetase gene is initiated at two different sites depending on the nitrogen concentration of the culture medium. Our expression studies demonstrate that M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase (i) can transcomplement an E. coli glutamine synthetase deletion mutant; (ii) can be expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis, resulting in extracellularly released enzyme identical in mass, N-terminal amino acid sequence, antibody reactivity, and activity pattern to the native enzyme; and (iii) is exported very efficiently from M. smegmatis while this host's endogenous glutamine synthetase remains intracellular. Our study therefore indicates that the information for secretion of M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase, which lacks a leader peptide, is contained in the amino acid sequence of the protein. M. tuberculosis Erdman (ATCC 35801) and M. smegmatis 1-2c (4Garbe T.R. Barathi J. Barnini S. Zhang Y. Abou-Zeid C. Tang D. Mukherjee R. Young D.B. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were grown in 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with 2% glucose (3Harth G. Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9342-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). E. coli strains DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) and YMC21E (kindly provided by B. Magasanik, MIT) were maintained as described (5Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8170) Google Scholar, 6Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides (BioSynthesis), corresponding to theM. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase amino acid residues 11–17 (KLAKDEK; sense, 5′ → 3′: AAGCTGGCCAAGGACGAGAAG) (primer 1, Fig. 1) and to E. coli glutamine synthetase residues 317–329 (NSYKRLVPGYEAP; antisense, 5′ → 3′: CGGSGCCTCGTAGCCSGGSACSAGSCGCTTGTASGAGTT) (primer 2), were designed based on our N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of native glutamine synthetase and published DNA sequences of several bacterial glutamine synthetases (7Nakano Y. Tanaka E. Kato C. Kimura K. Horikoshi K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 57: 81-86Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction amplification product was obtained after 40 cycles at 94 to 37 to 72 °C using these primers and M. tuberculosis Erdman genomic DNA as a template, cloned into pCR™II (Invitrogen), verified by DNA sequencing across the vector/insert junctions with M13 and SP6 primers (pCR™II kit, Invitrogen), and used as a probe for a Southern blot of M. tuberculosis DNA restricted withPstI. The DNA molecules around the hybridizing band were excised from the agarose gel and cloned into pUC19 (Life Technologies).M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase-specific clones were verified by colony hybridizations, polymerase chain reaction analysis using the aforementioned primers, and plasmid restriction mapping. The insert of one clone was completely sequenced by the chain termination method (8Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar); the DNA sequence analysis showed that the insert carried the entire glutamine synthetase gene of 1,434 bp and included ∼1,300 bp of 5′-flanking region and ∼700 bp of 3′-flanking region. Total RNA was isolated fromM. tuberculosis Erdman cultures grown in 7H9 medium (with 3.8, 7.6, or 38 mm(NH4)2SO4 ± 2.5% glucose) or Sauton's medium (with 0.2, 0.5, or 2 g/liter l-asparagine or l-glutamine ± 2.5% glucose) (3Harth G. Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9342-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) by hot phenol extraction. The RNA preparations did not contain any genomic DNA and showed two sharp rRNA bands at ∼1,500 and ∼3,100 bases. For Northern blots, 25 μg of RNA was electrophoresed on 2.2 mformaldehyde gels, transferred in 10 × SSC (1 × SSC: 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate) to nitrocellulose membranes, probed at 60 °C with an anti-mRNA sense oligonucleotide (antisense, 5′ → 3′: CGAAGCCGGAATCGTGAAGTGCTGCATGAT; located at positions +120 to +91 with regard to the first nucleotide, guanosine, of the structural gene) (primer 3), washed at high stringency, and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji RX) for 1–2 days at −70 °C. Ribosomal RNA bands were probed with the following oligonucleotides: 16 S rRNA, sense, 5′ → 3′, TTTGTTTGGAGAGTTTGATCCTGGC (corresponding to the first 25 nucleotides of the 16 S rRNA gene coding sequence); and 23 S rRNA, sense, 5′ → 3′, TTGTAAGTGTCTAAGGGCGCATGGT (corresponding to the first 25 nucleotides of the 23 S rRNA gene coding sequence (9Kempsell K.E. Ji Y.-E. Estrada-G I.C.E. Colston M.J. Cox R.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). Nuclease S1 (Boehringer Mannheim) mapping of glutamine synthetase specific mRNA was performed as described (10Berk A.J. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1977; 12: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). DNA fragments that hybridized at 65 °C to the glutamine synthetase-specific mRNA molecules were analyzed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and probed with an oligonucleotide located at positions +196 to +219 with regard to the initiator guanosine nucleotide of the structural gene (sense, 5′ → 3′: GAATCCGACATGTTGCTTCTTCCC (primer 4)). Primer extension analyses were performed by annealing the aforementioned anti-mRNA sense oligonucleotide to total RNA isolated from the various M. tuberculosis cultures, extending this primer by reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 50 °C for 15 min, and analyzing the extension products along with the sequencing products obtained with the same primer on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. Two primers were annealed to the above mentioned glutamine synthetase clone to yield an amplification product suitable for ligation into the NcoI and HindIII restriction sites of pKK233–2 (kindly provided by A. Campbell, Brown University (11Amann E. Brosius J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). The 5′ primer carried four arbitrary nucleotides at the 5′ end followed by a NcoI restriction site and the first 31 nucleotides of the structural glutamine synthetase gene; the last nucleotide of the NcoI site, guanosine, overlaps the first nucleotide of the gene (sense, 5′ → 3′: CTAGCCATGGTGACGGAAAAGACGCCCGACGACGTCTTCA (primer 5)). The 3′ primer also carries four arbitrary nucleotides at the 5′ end followed by a HindIII restriction site, 24 nucleotides from the 3′-flanking region of the structural glutamine synthetase gene, the gene's stop codon, and the last 3 nucleotides of the gene's coding region (antisense, 5′ → 3′: TACGAAGCTTCTACACCCGGACTGCGAAGAGTCCTTAAAC (primer 6)). The recombinant pKK233–2 construct was transformed into YMC21E, and transformants were selected on M9 medium containing no glutamine. E. coli YMC21E mutants that were stably complemented in trans by M. tuberculosisglutamine synthetase were grown in broth culture, and recombinant pKK233–2 plasmids were isolated and sequenced across the vector/insert junctions with glutamine synthetase gene-specific primers. The primer for the 5′ junction was the same primer (anti-mRNA sense primer) as used for the Northern blot analyses (primer 3), and the 3′ primer (sense, 5′ → 3′: GGAAGAGGCCGCGAGTATCCCGCA (primer 7)) started 205 nucleotides upstream of the gene's stop codon. Culture supernatants and cell extracts were assessed for glutamine synthetase activity (3Harth G. Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9342-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), proteins were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-glutamine synthetase specific antibodies (3Harth G. Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9342-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce). An amplification product was obtained using the above mentioned glutamine synthetase clone as a template and cloned into theBamHI and HindIII restriction sites of theE. coli/mycobacteria shuttle vector pSMT3 (12Herrmann J.L. O'Gaora P. Gallagher A. Thole J.E.R. Young D.B. EMBO J. 1991; 15: 3547-3554Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The 5′ primer contained four arbitrary nucleotides at the 5′ end followed by aBamHI restriction site and 26 nucleotides derived from the glutamine synthetase gene located 320 nucleotides upstream of the GTG start codon (sense, 5′ → 3′: CTAGGGATCCGCGATCAGCCAGTCGATCAGCAGAGC (primer 8)). The 3′ primer was the same primer used for the construction of the pKK233-2 expression plasmid (primer 6). The recombinant construct was electroporated into M. smegmatis1-2c, and recombinant clones were selected by growth in 7H9 containing hygromycin as described (12Herrmann J.L. O'Gaora P. Gallagher A. Thole J.E.R. Young D.B. EMBO J. 1991; 15: 3547-3554Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated from stable transformants, reintroduced into E. coli DH5α, and sequenced across the vector/insert junctions. The 5′ orBamHI junction was determined with a pSMT3-specific primer (sense, 5′ → 3′: GGTTTCATCCCCGATCCGGAGGAA) located in the promoter region of heat shock protein 60, 34 nucleotides upstream of the plasmid-encoded ATG codon (13Thole J.E.R. Keulen W.J. De Bruyn J. Kolk A.H.J. Groothuis D.G. Berwald L.G. Thiesjema R.H. van Embden J.D.A. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1466-1475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′ or HindIII junction was determined with the same primer (primer 6) described for the 3′ junction in the recombinant pKK233–2 construct. Proteins in the culture medium and cell extract were analyzed as described above. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the recombinant M. tuberculosis and endogenous M. smegmatis glutamine synthetases on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were determined at the UCLA protein microsequencing facility using a Porton 2090 E amino acid sequencer. Recombinant glutamine synthetase was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on Affi-Gel Blue 100–200 mesh (Bio-Rad) and size fractionation on Superdex 75 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Active fractions were dialyzed against 15 mm Imidazole, 2.2 mmMnCl2, pH7, stored at 4 °C, and assessed for glutamine synthetase activity andl-methionine-S-sulfoximine inhibition as described (3Harth G. Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9342-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Weisbrod R.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3997-4002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise and were of the highest grade available. The DNA sequence analysis of the glutamine synthetase gene showed that its length is 1,434 bp, encoding a protein with a molecular mass of 53.6 kDa (Fig.1). A GTG codon marks the start of the structural gene, which has a G + C content of ∼65%. The ocher codon TAA forms the stop codon, which is followed by another in-frame stop codon, TAG, as is the case for both the E. coli andSalmonella typhimurium glnA gene, where a second in-frame stop codon occurs 3 and 17 codons, respectively, downstream of the first stop codon (15Colombo G. Villafranca J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10587-10591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hanau R. Koduri R.K. Ho N. Brenchley J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 82-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid residue 406, a tyrosine, is present in the context of the motif “DKDLYELPPEE” as in other bacterial glutamine synthetases (7Nakano Y. Tanaka E. Kato C. Kimura K. Horikoshi K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 57: 81-86Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This tyrosine in glutamine synthetase undergoes modification by the addition or removal of an AMP residue. Several other motifs common to glutamine synthetases, including an oxidation-sensitive histidine residue at position 276 (GMHCHQ), are also present in the M. tuberculosis enzyme. The start of the structural gene is preceded by a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence, AAAGGAG, located at positions −13 to −7 with regard to the structural gene's first guanosine nucleotide. Analysis of the coding capacity of the 5′-flanking region revealed only one potential open reading frame, extending from ∼800 to ∼320 bp upstream of the glutamine synthetase gene and potentially encoding an unknown polypeptide. The region immediately upstream of the structural gene should therefore contain all regulatory elements needed for transcription of the glutamine synthetase gene. However, no sequence elements similar to those upstream of the glnA gene ofE. coli could be identified. Tentatively assigned promoter elements will be described below along with the transcriptional analyses of the glutamine synthetase gene. Homology studies of the 3′-flanking region resulted in the identification of a glnE-like gene, encoding an adenylyl transferase, and a second gene immediately adjacent to glnE(a spacer region of only 48 bp separates these two genes), whose DNA sequence is very similar to glutamine synthetase, and hence tentatively designated glutamine synthetase II. Both genes are oriented in opposite direction compared with the glutamine synthetase gene (Fig. 1). Southern hybridizations and DNA sequence analyses indicate that there is only one copy of the M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase gene per genome. The gene maps to cosmids MTCY190 and 427 according to the M. tuberculosis genome project (17Philipp W.J. Poulet S. Eiglmeier K. Pascopella L. Balasubramanian V. Heym B. Bergh S. Bloom B.R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Cole S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3132-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that, among other factors, the ammonia concentration in the culture medium profoundly influences the detectable glutamine synthetase activity: a 10-fold increase in the concentration of ammonium sulfate, from 3.8 to 38 mm, results in an almost 10-fold decrease in detectable glutamine synthetase activity. This prompted us to investigate the influence of ammonia concentration on transcription of the glutamine synthetase gene at the molecular level. We focused specifically on this gene because (i) the flanking regions exclude the possibility of adjacent, co-transcribed genes and indicate that the glutamine synthetase gene very likely represents a single transcription unit and (ii) the two related genes, tentatively assigned adenylyl transferase and glutamine synthetase II, downstream of the glutamine synthetase gene are arranged in the opposite direction. Transcription of the M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase gene was first investigated by Northern blot analysis using total RNA isolated from cultures grown at various nitrogen and carbon concentrations. The results reflect our earlier findings on the regulation of glutamine synthetase activity, suggesting that expression of the gene is regulated at the transcriptional level. The results can be summarized as follows (Fig.2 A). (i) Under standard growth conditions (7H9 medium containing 3.8 mm ammonium sulfate), a strong, single band of ∼1,500–1,600 nucleotides is observed. (ii) Increasing the ammonium sulfate concentration in 7H9 medium to 7.6 mm results in the appearance of a second band at ∼1,600–1,700 nucleotides with a concomitant decrease in the intensity of the smaller mRNA band. (iii) At high ammonium sulfate concentrations, 38 mm in 7H9 medium or 2 g/literl-glutamine or l-asparagine in standard Sauton's medium, the longer transcript is the only mRNA species detectable. Measured densitometrically, the intensity of the larger species at high ammonium sulfate concentrations is 15 to110 that of the smaller mRNA species at the low (3.8 mm) ammonium sulfate concentration. (iv) The addition of glucose exerts only a modest effect on the transcription rate of the gene; when added at high ammonium sulfate concentrations, it causes a slight reduction (∼½) in the level of the longer transcript. The data obtained in nuclease S1 protection assays corroborated these findings. RNase A treatment of the RNA preparation abolished all hybridization signals, but DNase I (Pharmacia) treatment did not. Chance hybridization to 16 S rRNA was ruled out by the consistent band pattern observed with a rRNA-specific oligonucleotide probe, a band of ∼1,500 nucleotides migrating slightly faster than the smaller of the two glutamine synthetase-specific mRNA molecules. These results confirmed that the glutamine synthetase gene represents a single gene transcription unit and that expression of this gene is regulated at the transcriptional level, akin to the E. coli glutamine synthetase gene (6Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The detailed mapping of the transcriptional start sites of the glutamine synthetase mRNA was done by primer extension analyses using an anti-mRNA sense oligonucleotide whose 3′ end annealed to nucleotide +91, counted from the first nucleotide, guanosine, of the structural gene. Again, the nitrogen concentrations in the growth medium affected the glutamine synthetase gene transcripts both qualitatively and quantitatively (Fig.2 B). (i) At low ammonium sulfate concentration, a strong band was observed representing a mRNA molecule with a 45-nucleotide-long untranslated leader. (ii) At high ammonium sulfate or l-glutamine/l-asparagine concentrations, a band of lesser intensity (∼10% of the “low nitrogen concentration band”) was observed, indicating a mRNA species with a 115-nucleotide-long untranslated leader. The first nucleotide of the “low nitrogen concentration transcript” is most likely adenosine in the sequence 5′-CAATATCGG-3′ (Fig. 2 B). This promoter region does not contain any recognizable −10 and −35 RNA polymerase contact sites; rather, the 31 nucleotides directly upstream of the mRNA initiator adenosine are similar to ς60 type promoters activated by enteric organisms during nitrogen-limited growth (18Ausubel F.M. Cell. 1984; 37: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The first nucleotide of the “high nitrogen concentration transcript” is most likely adenosine in the sequence 5′-GGGGAGACC-3′. A potential −10 RNA polymerase recognition site is located 9 nucleotides upstream of the initiator adenosine: 5′-CACAATA-3′. Two regions, ending at positions −35 and −26, respectively, with regard to the initiator adenosine could potentially represent the −35 RNA polymerase contact site: 5′-TTACGA-3′ and 5′-TTGCCG-3′ (Fig. 2 B). However, these sequence comparisons and promoter element assignments are tentative at best, since no promoter consensus elements have been described for M. tuberculosis. This is also true for transcription termination signals; however, a stretch of 5 thymidines, 62 nucleotides downstream of the gene's stop codon, marks a region that can form a stem-loop structure, characterized by 18 hydrogen bonds in the stem and 6 nucleotides in the loop. This region is followed by the aforementioned 5 T nucleotides, consistent with an E. coli transcription termination signal (Fig. 2 B). It is not known how the tentatively assigned glnE and glutamine synthetase type II genes are transcribed. Furthermore, it remains unknown if the glutamine synthetase type II gene encodes a functional glutamine synthetase protein. The E. coli strain YMC21E (6Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) carries a chromosomal deletion that encompasses the entireglnALG operon and is thus strictly dependent on the presence of glutamine in the culture medium for growth. In addition, the adenylyl transferase gene, glnE, is inactivated by the insertion of Tn5, which abolishes the cell's ability to lower the activity of glutamine synthetase by the addition of one AMP residue per enzyme subunit. Using a plasmid construct that utilizes a hybridtrp-lac promoter and that allows the expression of a fusion protein by providing the initiator methionine codon ATG for genes cloned directly downstream, we succeeded in transcomplementing the glutamine synthetase-deficient mutant YMC21E with the correspondingM. tuberculosis protein. Several transcomplemented YMC21E mutants were analyzed in detail (Fig.3). (i) The ratio of transcomplementing YMC21E cells from glutamine auxotrophs to glutamine prototrophs was ∼5,000–10,000:1, as determined by growing an aliquot of the transformation mix on agar with and without l-glutamine. The growth rate of transcomplemented mutants was ∼½ of that observed for YMC21E cells grown in the presence of glutamine. YMC21E cells did not grow in medium lacking glutamine. (ii) The transcomplemented colonies stably maintained the glutamine synthetase expression plasmid over many generations and subcultures. (iii) Glutamine synthetase-proficient E. coli contained a maximum of about 2 milliunits of detectable glutamine synthetase per 1 × 108 cells during late logarithmic growth, virtually all of which was present intracellularly (3Harth G. Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9342-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). YMC21E cells did not contain any glutamine synthetase protein or activity. Fractionation of broth cultures of YMC21E cells in their midlogarithmic growth phase, transcomplemented with M. tuberculosisglutamine synthetase, into culture supernatants (Fig. 3, CF) and cell extracts (Fig. 3, CP) revealed that only cell extracts contained glutamine synthetase activity (0.35–0.75 milliunits/1 × 108 cells). No glutamine synthetase activity was detected in the culture supernatant. The glutamine synthetase activity was neither inducible nor repressible by a change in the growth medium's nitrogen concentration, presumably because regulatory regions upstream of the structural gene are missing in this construct and the promoter driving the expression of glutamine synthetase is a mixed trp-lac promoter. The amount of glutamine synthetase protein in cell extracts varied from 10 to 20 ng/1 × 108 cells. Subunits of the recombinant glutamine synthetase migrated as entities with a molecular mass of ∼56,000–58,000 Da in denaturing polyacrylamide gels and reacted strongly and specifically with anti-M. tuberculosisglutamine synthetase antibodies (3Harth G. Clemens D.L. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9342-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), as with the native M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase. (iv) In M. tuberculosis, the initiator methionine codon of the glutamine synthetase is specified by GTG. However, in E. coli, this codon typically specifies valine. In the recombinant construct, E. coli utilized the vector encoded ATG as the initiator methionine and translated the GTG codon following it as a valine, thereby extending the N terminus of the recombinant enzyme by one amino acid. Hence, upon removal of the initiator methionine, valine was the N-terminal amino acid rather than the following amino acid, threonine, which is the N-terminal amino acid of the native enzyme. Other constructs, in which the vector encoded ATG was replaced with the glutamine synthetase gene's GTG codon or the sequence ATG ATG ACG, specifying methionine, methionine, and threonine, did not yield any viable colonies upon transformation into YMC21E. To express the M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase in M. smegmatis, we used a polymerase chain reaction product very similar to the one used to transcomplementE. coli YMC21E. The only significant difference was the inclusion of ∼300 bp flanking the glutamine synthetase gene at the 5′ end to allow transcription and translation to proceed from the gene's own regulatory region (Fig. 4). M. smegmatis strain 1-2c, the host strain for this set of expression studies, carries a functional glutamine synthetase gene; hence, recombinant clones were identified by growth in hygromycin. Following electroporation, we selected several hygromycin-resistant colonies, cultured them in broth, and assessed their glutamine synthetase expression and activity patterns (Fig. 4), as follows. (i) The transformation frequency of M. smegmatis 1-2c to hygromycin resistance was ∼1:1,00"

In some cells, protein kinase C-induced activation of the retinoblastoma protein results in G1arrest. However, inducible overexpression and activation of the protein kinase Cα isozyme or the addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in the prostate epithelial cell line, LNCaP, resulted in apoptosis preceded by induction of p21 and dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Consistent with a role for the retinoblastoma growth suppressor protein in protein kinase C-induced apoptosis, DU145 cells, which do not express functional retinoblastoma protein or LNCaP cells, which have been transfected with the retinoblastoma inhibitor, E1a, were resistant to apoptosis. LNCaP apoptosis was initiated by a unique conflict between the growth-suppressive activity of the retinoblastoma protein and growth-promoting mitogenic signals. Thus, when this conflict was prevented by serum depletion, apoptosis was suppressed. The caspase family of cysteine proteases is believed to encompass the execution machinery of mammalian apoptosis, and addition of the cell-permeable caspase inhibitor, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, afforded nearly total protection from protein kinase C-signaled apoptosis. This protection correlated with the total loss of caspase activity as measured by the proteolytic cleavage of nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. On the basis of these results, we propose that protein kinase C regulates a novel cell death pathway that is initiated by a cellular conflict between retinoblastoma growth-suppressive signals and serum mitogenic signals in proliferating prostate epithelial cells and that is executed by the caspase family of cysteine proteases.

Cell death is influenced by diverse environmental signals that include cytokines and steroids or the depletion of peptide growth factors and sex hormones in cells of the immune system, nervous system, and the epithelial component of various tissues (1White E.

Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). Mutational events that occur in the genesis of prostate cancer involve alterations in apoptotic pathways present in normal androgen-dependent epithelium. Two such alterations of the genetic machinery in prostate carcinogenesis include mutation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 (5Gao X. Chen Y.Q. Wu N. Grignon D.F. Sakr W. Porter A.T. Honn K.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1395-1398PubMed Google Scholar), and allelic loss at the retinoblastoma locus (6Ittmann M.M. Wieczorek R. Hum.

Rb encodes a 110-kDa phosphoprotein that regulates the transition between G1 and S phases in the cell cycle and also functions in transducing growth-inhibitory signals that regulate differentiation and growth (9Sherr C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 15-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Functional regulation of Rb is cell cycle dependent, being strictly controlled by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) during G1. Rb is functionally active in an underphosphorylated conformation and is inactivated during late G1 by cyclin D/cdk4/6- and cyclin E/cdk2-dependent phosphorylation, allowing the cell to proceed from G1 to S (4Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). Additionally, cdk activity and Rb function are regulated by a family of inhibitors that block the catalytic activity of the cdk/cyclin complex. The cdk inhibitors p21 (SDI, WAF1, CIP1) and p27 (KIP1) are universal in their specificity and inhibit the activity of a number of different cdks. p16 (MTS1, INK4A), on the other hand, selectively blocks the activity of cdk4 and cdk6. Regardless of specificity, overexpression of either p21 or p16 have been shown to activate Rb, resulting in G1 arrest of cells (10Blagosklonny M.V. Prabhu N.S. El-deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 320-325PubMed Google Scholar, 11Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).We have previously reported that apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells is regulated by activators and inhibitors of the protein kinase C (PKC) family (12Day M.L. Zhao X. Wu S. Swanson P. Humphrey P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar, 13Powell C.T. Brittis N.J. Stec D. Hug H. Heston W.D.W. Fair W.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar). PKC is a synonym for a multimember family of serine/threonine kinases that has traditionally been associated with signal transduction regulating cell growth and differentiation (14Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar) but has recently been associated with the regulation of cell death as well (12Day M.L. Zhao X. Wu S. Swanson P. Humphrey P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar, 13Powell C.T. Brittis N.J. Stec D. Hug H. Heston W.D.W. Fair W.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar). Most PKC isozymes require the physiological activator diacylglycerol, which is derived from membrane phospholipids; for full activity, however, the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or the macrocyclic lactone, bryostatin 1, will also activate PKC. Additionally, PKC activity also requires association with cellular membranes and/or cytoskeletal components to execute many of its physiological functions (15Kiley S.C. Jaken S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Gregorio C.C. Repasky E.A. Fowler V.M. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PKC modulates signal transduction pathways that have been linked to both positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle and the initiation of apoptosis; however, the specialized roles of the individual isozymes and their physiological targets that modulate these events are not known. The response of a particular type of cell to PKC activators appears to depend not only on specific PKC isozyme expression but also on the status of the functional targets of PKC. Thus, growth regulation by PKC is likely mediated by the cell cycle machinery, but the regulation of cell death may require other, undefined components of the PKC signaling pathway.By using an inducible overexpression system of PKCα in the present study, we examined the role of Rb in PKC-regulated apoptosis of LNCaP cells. Results from this study are the first to demonstrate that PKC-induced apoptosis was preceded by the rapid induction of p21 and Rb dephosphorylation and required Rb activity for cell death. Moreover, Rb could only induce apoptosis in opposition to serum mitogenic signals in proliferating LNCaP cells and that the execution of apoptosis was dependent on the activation of the caspase family of cysteine proteases. Taken together, the experimental evidence indicates that PKC and Rb are linked in a novel signal transduction pathway which in the presence of mitogenic signals culminates in caspase-regulated apoptosis.DISCUSSIONWe and others have previously demonstrated that castration-induced apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells coincides with the loss of G1 cdk activity and increased synthesis of Rb mRNA and protein (3Day M.L. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Zhao X. Humphrey P. Swanson P. Postigo A.A. Zhang S.H. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8125-8128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Day M.L. Wu S. Basler J.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5597-5599PubMed Google Scholar, 25English H.F. Santen R.J. Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 1987; 11: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Rb that had accumulated in the glandular epithelium following castration was in the hypophosphorylated (active) form.3 Similar to this observation was our current findings in LNCaP cells, where TPA treatment or overexpression and activation of PKCα led to the loss of G1 cdk activity, resulting in the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb. The resulting growth signal conflict initiated by Rb growth-suppressive activity in this system did not lead to growth arrest, but in opposition to mitogenic signals in proliferating cells, resulted in apoptosis. This conflict-mediated apoptosis did not occur in Rb−/−prostate epithelial cells and was prevented by functional inhibition of Rb or removal of mitogenic signals. From our use of caspase inhibitors and examination of their activity, it is apparent that execution of this apoptotic pathway is mediated through this proteolytic pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that PKC signals a unique apoptotic pathway that is initiated by an Rb-dependent growth signal conflict in proliferating LNCaP cells and executed by the caspase proteases.Programmed cell death is regulated by diverse cellular factors, some of which possess differential functions that may include the maintenance of cell growth and survival. Two such regulatory molecules, PKC and Rb, which traditionally are implicated in the transduction and execution of growth-regulatory and differentiation signals (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar, 27Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem.

Burgess R. Staudinger J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 699-705PubMed Google Scholar), have been linked to the regulation of apoptosis as well (3Day M.L. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Zhao X. Humphrey P.

Although much of the molecular function of PKC and Rb are known, specific PKC isozymes and the mechanism of Rb-mediated apoptosis that it signals are completely unknown. The current study was initiated based on the observation that the Rb+/+ LNCaP cells undergo TPA-induced apoptosis associated with p21 induction and Rb activation and that DU145 cells, which exhibit p21 induction but lack functional Rb, do not. Therefore, it appears that the signal to decrease cdk activity through p21 is sent in TPA-treated Rb−/− DU145 cells, but they do not undergo apoptosis, perhaps because they lack Rb. In total, these results suggested that Rb activity is required for TPA-induced apoptosis. To investigate this further, we focused on this pathway in the Rb+/+ LNCaP line. TPA-treated LNCaP cells did not exhibit loss of cyclin D1 or cyclin E expression; however, there was a dramatic increase in the level of p21. In contrast to p21 induction, there was little change in the level of the related inhibitor p27 or the cdk4/6 inhibitor p16. Therefore, it appeared that a PKC-mediated increase in p21 expression leads to a reduction in G1 cdk activity, resulting in Rb hypophosphorylation and cell death.The response of a particular type of cell to PKC activators appears to depend not only on the combination of PKC isozymes expressed in the cell but also on the expression and status of the functional targets of PKC. As an “early ” functional target of PKC, Raf-1 becomes phosphorylated (activated) by TPA in a variety of cell types, which exhibit various responses, such as proliferation, transformation, growth arrest, and differentiation. However, in LNCaP cells overexpressing activated PKCα, Raf-1 is phosphorylated very early in a pathway that terminates in cell death. This finding suggests that Raf-1 phosphorylation by PKCα represents a putative signaling cascade leading to Rb hypophosphorylation and apoptosis. The association between PKC signal transduction and activation of Rb was further established by staurosporine-mediated inhibition of p21 induction and Rb activation. Coupled to the observation that this pathway was inhibited by the depletion of PKC, suggested a signal-transducing role for PKC in G1 regulation that in LNCaP cells results in apoptosis.Because these studies provided correlative evidence but not definitive proof of PKC function in this pathway, we next examined this mechanism in inducible PKCα-overexpressing lines. The p21/Rb pathway was indeed activated following PKCα induction in the presence of the PKC activator, bryostatin 1, implicating this isoform in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The effects of inducible overexpression of PKCα have not been examined previously, and our results contrast with those of Ways et al., who, employing constitutive overexpression of PKCα in MCF-7 cells, showed that TPA and bryostatin 1-induced cell death was associated with G2-M accumulation, minimal p21 induction, and lack of Rb activation (30de Vente J.E. Kukoly C.A. Bryant W.O. Posekany K.J. Chen J. Fletcher D.J. Parker P.J. Pettit G.J. Lozano G. Cook P.P. Ways D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1874-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additionally, parental MCF-7 cells treated with TPA demonstrated G1arrest associated with p21 induction and Rb activation and were mostly unaffected by bryostatin 1. The results in MCF-7 cells were complicated by the finding that constitutive overexpression of PKCα, in the absence of PKC activators, resulted in increased expression of PKCβ and decreased expression of PKCη and p53 (31Ways D.K. Kukoly C.A. de Vente J.E. Hooker J.L. Bryant W.O. Posekany K.J. Fletcher D.J. Cook P.P. Parker P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1906-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). None of these changes were observed in LNCaP cells following inducible overexpression of PKCα. Interestingly, Livneh et al. reported that ectopic expression of the epithelial-specific PKCη isoform regulated a similar program in NIH 3T3 cells, resulting in p21 induction and Rb dephosphorylation (32Livneh E. Shimon T. Bechor E. Doki Y. Schieren I. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1545-1555PubMed Google Scholar). However, these PKCη-expressing fibroblasts did not undergo apoptosis as do inducible PKCα-expressing LNCaP epithelial cells but remain G1 arrested.Our observations along with those of other laboratories suggest that accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb is a general response of PKC activity leading to G1 arrest in a variety of cell types (33Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A. Evans S.S. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9424-9435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated in fibroblasts that disruption of integrin-mediated contact results in the induction of p21 and G1 cyclin inactivation leading to dephosphorylation of Rb and growth arrest (34Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 35Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As in fibroblasts, however, we have found that the same integrin-regulated pathway induced in several different epithelial cell lines, including prostate, resulted in p21 induction and Rb activation, but in contrast to growth arrest of fibroblasts, the epithelial cells underwent apoptosis (3Day M.L. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Zhao X. Humphrey P. Swanson P. Postigo A.A. Zhang S.H. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8125-8128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The present results using ectopic expression of PKCα demonstrate that PKC activation, like β1 integrin, initiates a signaling pathway that results in Rb hypophosphorylation and apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells. The evidence that Rb is central to this PKC-induced apoptotic pathway was confirmed by the finding that LNCaP clones, stably expressing the adenovirus E1a protein, prevented TPA-induced apoptosis. It therefore appears that activation of Rb, which leads to growth suppression in some cell types, uniquely regulates an apoptotic pathway in prostate epithelial cells and possibly other epithelial cells (3Day M.L. Foster R.G. Day K.C. Zhao X. Humphrey P. Swanson P. Postigo A.A. Zhang S.H. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8125-8128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Because LNCaP cells respond to Rb activation by undergoing apoptosis, Rb itself must encompass some aspect of the cell death signal; however, the nature of such a signal is unknown. Apoptosis is thought to be a default pathway in cells receiving opposing cell proliferation signals. Evan et al. have published extensively on growth signal conflict-induced apoptosis using c-myc overexpression in fibroblasts deprived of serum growth factors (23Evan G.I. Brown L. Whyte M. Harrington E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 7: 825-834Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although our findings demonstrate that conflicting growth signals induce apoptosis, it is due to the opposite scenario, where negative Rb growth-inhibitory signals precipitate an apoptotic conflict with positive mitogenic signals in proliferating prostate epithelial cells. To confirm this possibility, we found that if such a conflict was prevented in LNCaP cells, by removing the mitogenic signal (serum depletion) or eliminating the growth-inhibitory signal (Rb deletion in the DU145 cells or Rb inactivation by E1a transfection in LNCaP cells), then apoptosis does not occur.We next set out to determine the mechanism through which apoptosis is executed by this Rb-mediated conflict. We began by investigating the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-related proteases, which have been implicated in apoptosis of many diverse systems. When we used the cell-permeable caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-fmk, we observed total protection from apoptosis in the bryostatin 1-treated PKCα-expressing line, LNα17. When we examined cleavage of the caspase substrate, PARP, we found it unaltered by 12 h of PKCα activation, which is the time when Rb is becoming activated, but that complete cleavage had occurred by 24 h, at which time Rb is fully activated, suggesting that Rb activation preceded activation of the caspases. In determining the order of events in this apoptotic pathway, we observed that inhibition of PKC by staurosporine (initiation phase) not only inhibits Rb activation but also inhibits apoptosis and the associated cleavage of PARP. Coupled to the findings that ZVAD-fmk inhibited both apoptosis and PARP cleavage (execution phase) in LNCaP cells but did not inhibit Rb hypophosphorylation places Rb downstream of PKC yet upstream of caspase activation. Therefore, we postulate that the cellular conflict signal provided by Rb in proliferating cells is initiated by PKC and terminates in the recruitment of caspases to execute apoptosis.Tumor suppression is manifest not only by cell cycle arrest but also through the initiation of cell death programs as well. The role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product in apoptosis has been extensively documented in cells that are responding to DNA-damaging agents or chemotherapeutic agents or in cells that have a deregulated cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 1White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Although Rb has been shown to inhibit multiple p53-dependent apoptotic pathways (1White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 23Evan G.I. Brown L. Whyte M. Harrington E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 7: 825-834Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar), accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb leading to G1 arrest and apoptosis occurs in multiple p53-independent pathways as well (36Wang H.

A. 1995; 92: 9019-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), both of which result in the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb, G1 arrest, and apoptosis. Apoptosis also occurs normally in the androgen-dependent prostate epithelium of p53−/− mice following castration (41Berges R.R. Furuya Y. Remington L. English H.F. Jacks T. Isaacs J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8910-8914Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), indicating that this is a p53-independent process. p53 transcriptionally activates a number of different genes including p21 in response to DNA damage; however, p21 expression can occur independently of p53 function (42Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3391-3395PubMed Google Scholar).PKC and Rb modulate a variety of physiologic responses in cells ranging from the regulation of cell growth and differentiation to cell death. Therefore, it is likely that cell survival is dictated by a complex intracellular environment through which PKC signaling pathways are responding to common extracellular cues. Some of these PKC-regulated pathways terminate in the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb; however, depending on the type of cell and its environment, PKC and Rb activities may encompass differential roles, directing the cell toward quiescence, differentiation, or apoptosis. We maintain that the primary role of Rb in regulating cell cycle is to signal growth arrest; however, we suggest that it is the extracellular and intracellular mitogenic influences that dictates whether the cell will survive or die in response to that signal. Cell death is influenced by diverse environmental signals that include cytokines and steroids or the depletion of peptide growth factors and sex hormones in cells of the immune system, nervous system, and the epithelial component of various tissues (1White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 2Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C.

Although the UL8 gene product is essential for HSV-1 DNA replication in vivo, a subassembly consisting of only the 99-kDa UL5 and 114-kDaUL52 gene products was found to be indistinguishable in its DNA-dependent ATPase, DNA helicase, and DNA primase activities from the heterotrimeric enzyme (13Calder J.M.

It was subsequently observed that the 80-kDa UL8 protein, which lacks enzymatic and DNA binding activities, can stimulate primer synthesis (15607–612Parry, M. E., Stow, N. D., and Marsden, H. S.

It can also enhance the utilization of primers synthesized by the UL5/52 heterodimer (17Sherman G. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 74: 4884-4892Crossref Google Scholar). More recently, it was found that the UL8 protein can stimulate the DNA-dependent ATPase, helicase, and primase activities of the UL5/52 heterodimer in the presence of the HSV-1-encoded single strand DNA-binding protein, ICP8 (18Le Gac N.T. Villani G. Hoffmann J.-S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study we have found that with duplex DNA substrates >30 nucleotides in length containing a single-stranded loading site fully coated with ICP8, helicase activity shows an almost complete dependence on the UL8 subunit. However, at a narrow range of subsaturating levels of ICP8, unwinding of the helicase substrate can be promoted by the UL5/52 subassembly alone. The helicase activity of the HSV-1-encoded primosome therefore appears to be modulated by ICP8. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9 and Sf21) cells were grown at 27 °C in Sf-900 11 SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) on a gyratory shaker rotating at 150 rpm. Stocks of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus recombinant for the UL8, UL5, UL52, and UL29 genes were prepared by infecting 500 ml of SF9 cells grown to 1 × 106 cells/ml at 0.1 plaque-forming unit/cell. The medium was supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) just before infection. After incubation for 3 days, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1500 × g, 10 min) at room temperature, and the virus in the supernatant fluid was either used directly or frozen at −80 °C. The final titers were approximately 107–108 plaque forming units/ml. Five hundred milliliters of Sf21 cells were grown to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. The cells were infected with 5–10 plaque forming units/cell recombinant baculovirus, grown for 48 h, and pelleted by centrifugation (1500 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. After washing with 500 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.), the cells were collected by centrifugation (1500 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. The pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C. To lyse the cells, the frozen cell pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium bisulfite (pH 7.8), 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonic acid, 1.0 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0). The resuspended cells were incubated for 20 min on ice, transferred to a Dounce homogenizer, and disrupted using 15 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle. For the UL5/52 and UL5/52/8 proteins, nuclei were removed from the extract by centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. The cytosolic fraction was used directly or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. In the case of ICP8, NaCl was added to the suspension of nuclei to a final concentration of 1.2 m, and the mixture was rotated for 45 min at 4 °C. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm for 60 min using a Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor. The UL5/52/8 and UL5/52 proteins were purified as described previously (19Dodson M.S. Crute J.J. Bruckner R.C. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20835-20838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Heparin-agarose was replaced with a prepacked 10-ml heparin Hi-trap column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the Superose 12 column was replaced with a prepacked Sephadex 200 (16/60) column (Pharmacia). The yields of UL5/52/8 heterotrimer and UL5/52 heterodimer were approximately 5 mg each. The purity of both complexes estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomasie Blue staining was at least 95%. The UL8 protein was purified as described previously (14Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1105-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Two prepacked 5-ml heparin Hi-trap columns coupled in series were used in place of the heparin-agarose column, and Superose 12 was replaced by a Sephadex 200 (16/60) column. The yield of UL8 protein was approximately 6 mg. It was at least 95% pure. ICP8 was purified as described previously (20Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Escherichia coliSSB was obtained from Amersham Life Sciences, Inc. A 60-base oligonucleotide (5′-ACATGATAAGATACATGGATGAGTTTGGACAAACCACAACGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCC-3′) was labeled with 32P at its 5′ terminus with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Stratagene) and annealed to M13 mp18 single-stranded DNA (Biolab) to generate a 20-bp double-stranded region with a 40-nucleotide 5′ tail. To extend the duplex, it was incubated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates and Mg2+ (21Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4725-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA product was subsequently cleaved with the PstI orEcoRI restriction enzymes to yield a double-stranded region 33- or 74-bp in length, respectively. The DNAs were purified by gel filtration through a 1-ml Bio-Gel A-5 m column (Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 15 fmol of DNA substrate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 mmMgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 mm NaCl, and the indicated amounts of ICP8 and the UL5/52/8 or UL5/52 proteins. Incubation was at 32 °C for the times indicated and stopped by the addition of 2 μl of stop solution (90 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol, 0.25% xylene cyanol). The products were separated by electrophoresis through an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried onto DE81 (Whatman), and autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. An extra step was added in the experiments involving E. coli SSB. 10 μl of 400 μg/ml proteinase K and 2% SDS were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at 32 °C before 4 μl of stop solution was added. Measurements of the interaction of the UL8 protein, the UL5/52 subassembly, and the UL5/52/8 heterotrimer with ICP8 were performed using the BIAcore Biosensor (Biacore AB Pharmacia). ICP8 was immobilized on a CM5 research grade sensor chip at 140 μg/ml in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0) with the use of an amine coupling kit (Biacore AB) (22Lofas S. Johnsson B. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; 21: 1526-1528Crossref Google Scholar, 23Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). A blank surface was prepared by injecting 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0) onto a CM5 research grade sensor chip. Measurements were performed at room temperature in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 4.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium chloride, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.005% surfactant P-20 with a flow rate of 15 μl/min. All surfaces were washed with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 4.5 mmMgCl2, 1 m sodium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.005% surfactant P-20 to remove noncovalently bound proteins. A32P-labeled 60-base oligonucleotide was annealed to the complementary region of M13 mp18 single-stranded DNA to form a helicase substrate with a 20-bp double-stranded region and a 40-nucleotide-long 5′ single-stranded tail (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, A andB, the helicase activity of the UL5/52 subassembly with this substrate was almost indistinguishable from that of the heterotrimeric enzyme. This result is in agreement with earlier reports (14Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1105-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15607–612Parry, M. E., Stow, N. D., and Marsden, H. S. (1993)J. Gen. Vir., 607–612.Google Scholar). The effect of ICP8 on the helicase action of the UL5/52/8 and UL5/52 proteins could not be tested because of the helix-destabilizing activity of ICP8 on short duplexes under these conditions (24Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 711-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2The helicase activity of the UL5/52 subassembly is indistinguishable from that of the UL5/52/8 heterotrimer on short duplex DNA substrates in the absence of ICP8. Reaction mixtures were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” except that the volume was 70 μl. The substrate (105 fmol) contained a 20-bp double-stranded region and a 40-nucleotide 5′ tail. The UL5/52 subassembly (525 fmol) and the UL5/52/8 heterotrimer (525 fmol) were added. Samples (10 μl) were removed at the times indicated, and 2 μl of stop solution was added.

We therefore increased the length of the double-stranded region by DNA polymerase action followed by cleavage with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The substrates produced in this way contained duplex stretches of 33- and 74-bp in addition to the 40-bp single strand loading site (Fig. 1). With the 74-bp duplex substrate, essentially no unwinding by the UL5/52 heterodimer could be detected either in the presence or absence of the UL8 protein (<1%). However, when ICP8 was added, there was a significant difference in the response of the UL5/52 and UL5/52/8 proteins. In the absence of the UL8 subunit, ICP8 had only a very small stimulatory effect; in its presence, substantial unwinding was observed (Fig. 3, A and B). Essentially the same result was obtained with the substrate containing a 34-bp duplex region (data not shown). We therefore conclude that ICP8 has a strong stimulatory effect on the helicase activity of the HSV-1 helicase-primase and that this stimulation is dependent upon the UL8 protein. To determine the amount of UL8 protein required for optimal helicase activity, increasing amounts in the UL8 protein were added to the UL5/52 subassembly, and helicase activity was determined with the substrate containing a 74-bp DNA duplex and a 40-nucleotide single strand loading site coated with ICP8. As shown in Fig. 4, helicase activity reached a plateau when the UL8 protein was present at a ratio of about 1:1 with the UL5/UL52 subassembly. This finding is consistent with the 1:1:1 stochiometry that is found in the helicase-primase isolated from HSV-1-infected cells (10Crute J.J. Tsurumi T. Zhu L.A. Weller S.K. Olivo P.D.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4484-4488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether stimulation of the helicase activity of the UL5/52/8 heterotrimer by ICP8 is specific, the heterologous E. coliSSB was substituted for ICP8. As shown in Fig.5, there was no stimulation of helicase activity by the E. coli SSB under conditions where ICP8 produced a strong stimulation. The T4 phage SSB, gene 32 protein, was similarly ineffective (data not shown). The specific stimulation of helicase activity by ICP8 suggested that there is physical interaction between ICP8 and the helicase-primase. However, attempts to detect such an interaction by specific retention of either the UL8 protein or the UL5/52/8 heterotrimer on an ICP8-agarose column or by co-immunoprecipitation with antibody directed against ICP8 were unsuccessful. 2M. Falkenberg, P. Elias, and I. R. Lehman, unpublished data. Surface plasmon resonance detects the change in refractive index near a surface bearing one adsorbed protein as a result of the interaction with a second protein. The change in refractive index, in resonance units, recorded as a function of time after the addition of the second protein or following removal of this protein can be used to determine the rates of association and dissociation respectively. These rates are related through simple exponentials to the fundamental rate constantk a and k d for the binding reaction,A+B*→ka*ABEquation 1 *⟶kdwith k a /k d =K A, the equilibrium association constant (25Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In these experiments, ICP8 was immobilized to the dextran surface of a BIAcore sensor chip, and its interaction with the UL5/52/8 holoenzyme, UL5/52 subassembly, and the UL8 protein was measured. As shown in Fig.6, the UL5/52 subassembly and the UL8 protein failed to interact with the ICP8 surface. In contrast, the UL5/52/8 holoenzyme did interact significantly. The apparent association rate constant (k a) was 2.8 × 105 s−1m−1 (S.D., 8.5 × 104; n = 4). The apparent dissociation rate constant (k d) was 2.5 × 10−3 s−1 (S.D., 9.8 × 10−4; n = 4). We assume that a 1:1 complex is formed between ICP8 and the UL5/UL52/UL8 heterotrimer. A plot of ln(R 0/R) versus time after the start of dissociation, where R 0 is the response at the start of dissociation and R is the response at time t after dissociation is linear, indicating that dissociation is first order (data not shown). The experiments described this far were all performed at excess ICP8 to ensure that free ICP8 would be available to bind the single-stranded DNA generated during the helicase-promoted unwinding of the substrate (26Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the UL5/52 heterodimer was inactive. There was, however, a narrow range of subsaturating ICP8 concentrations at which unwinding of the substrate could be observed in the absence of the UL8 protein (Fig.7, A and C). As the level of ICP8 was increased, the stimulatory effect was suppressed. In contrast, increasing amounts of ICP8, in the presence of the UL8 protein, produced no such inhibition (Fig. 7, B andC). In a control experiment using E. coli SSB, no stimulation of helicase activity was observed at any of the concentrations tested. It therefore appears that low concentrations of ICP8 can have a specific stimulatory effect on the helicase activity of the helicase-primase even in the absence of the UL8 protein. The primosome encoded by HSV-1 is a heterotrimer consisting of the products of the UL5, UL8, and UL52genes (9Crute J.J. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6585-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Crute J.J. Tsurumi T. Zhu L.A. Weller S.K. Olivo P.D. Challberg M.D. Mocarski E.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Helicase activity is associated with the UL5 subunit (17Sherman G. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 74: 4884-4892Crossref Google Scholar, 28Zhu L. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 469-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and primase activity is associated with the UL52 subunit (29Klinedinst D.K. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specific function of the UL8 subunit has remained obscure. In the studies reported here, we have found that the UL8 subunit is not needed for helicase action on short, 20-nucleotide duplex DNA substrates in the absence of ICP8 but is required for longer, 30–74-bp duplex DNA substrates with a single-stranded loading site fully coated with the HSV-1 single strand DNA binding protein, ICP8. A plausible inference from these findings is that the UL8 subunit of the primosome interacts with ICP8-coated single-stranded DNA to facilitate binding of the UL5/52 heterodimer. The reaction is specific for ICP8, and a heterologous single strand DNA-binding protein (E. coli SSB) was ineffective, suggesting a physical interaction of the primosome with ICP8. By using surface plasmon resonance we did, in fact, observe that the UL5/8/52 holoenzyme, but neither the UL5/52 subassembly nor the UL8 subunit alone, was able to bind to ICP8. The estimatedk d of 2.5 × 10−3 s−1confirmed that the interaction is specific and occurs with a relatively high affinity. Attempts to measure the interaction of the UL5/52/8 holoenzyme, the UL5/52 subassembly, or the UL8 protein with ICP8 bound to single-stranded DNA were complicated by the rapid association and dissociation of ICP8 with and from the single-stranded DNA. 3D. Bushnell, M. Falkenberg, P. Elias, and I. R. Lehman, unpublished data. What is the mechanism by which the UL8 protein promotes the binding of the helicase-primase to an ICP8-coated substrate? One possibility is that it permits the displacement of ICP8 from DNA, perhaps by stabilizing a conformation of ICP8 that prevents it from binding to single-stranded DNA. Alternatively, ICP8-coated single-stranded DNA itself may serve as the loading site for the helicase-primase. Since the UL8 protein alone does not bind ICP8, interaction of the UL8 protein with the UL5/52 subassembly either enhances its binding to ICP8, or alternatively, facilitates interaction of the UL5/52 subassembly with ICP8. The effects of ICP8 on the HSV-1 primosome are reminiscent of the effects of the T4 bacteriophage single strand DNA-binding protein, the gene 32 protein, on the T4 primosome, the product of T4 genes 41 and 61. The gene 32 protein stimulates the helicase activity of the primosome but confines the synthesis of RNA primers to those sites that are used to initiate synthesis of an Okazaki fragment (30Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1791-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An additional T4encoded protein, the product of gene 59, is required to assemble the gene 41 protein (the helicase) onto gene 32-coated single-stranded DNA. This reaction is mediated by a specific interaction between the gene 59 and gene 32 proteins (30Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1791-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the HSV-1-encoded UL8 protein may be the functional analogue of the T4 gene 59 protein. A surprising finding was that over a narrow range of subsaturating ICP8 concentrations, the UL5/52 subassembly can unwind long DNA duplexes even in the absence of the UL8 subunit. Possibly the UL5/52 heterodimer can bind to a single-stranded DNA loading site free of ICP8 and promote helicase activity. The appropriate concentration of ICP8 would then be needed to bind the single strands produced by helicase action, preventing them from reannealing. At levels of ICP8 sufficient to fully coat the single-stranded DNA, the UL5/52 subassembly is unable to bind the ICP8-coated single strands, and helicase activity is inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W2008604254,"Our previous immunoelectron microscopy studies of chicken gizzard smooth muscle cells showed that in certain areas the distribution of anti-calponin exhibits a high degree of overlap with β-actin, filamin, and in particular, desmin, suggesting that in situ a fraction of calponin may be associated with intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton. In this work we further explore this idea by studying the interaction between calponin and desmin. We found that at physiological salt concentrations, calponin bound only weakly to synthetic desmin intermediate filaments. On the other hand, calponin bound strongly to nonfilamentous desmin tetramers and was incorporated into intermediate filaments when the two proteins were mixed in a buffer containing 6 m urea and dialyzed into a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl. Anti-calponin was found to label a portion of intermediate filaments and dense bodies isolated from gizzard tissues. Our findings suggest that in chicken gizzard smooth muscle cells, calponin may be an integral component of desmin intermediate filaments in the vicinity of dense bodies. Since calponin is also known to bind actin, we hypothesize that one of the functions of calponin might be to bridge intermediate filaments with actin in dense bodies.

The properties of CP have been reviewed by Gimona and Small (1Gimona M. Small J.V. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 91-103Crossref Google Scholar) and Winder and Walsh (2Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Soon after its discovery, several striking biochemical properties of CP were rapidly established. (a) It is an actin-binding protein (3Takahashi K. Hiwada K. Kokubo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 4Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10148-10155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (b) It is capable of inhibiting actomyosin ATPase activity (4Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10148-10155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Abe M. Takahashi K. Hiwada K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). (c) It can bind calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ with low affinity, and the complex does not bind to F-actin nor inhibit the ATPase activity (3Takahashi K. Hiwada K. Kokubo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 6Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Vasulka C. Johnson J.D.

(d) It can be phosphorylated (4Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10148-10155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Naka M. Kureishi Y. Muroga Y. Takahashi K. Ito M. Tanaka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylated protein is no longer capable of binding actin nor of inhibiting actomyosin ATPase activity (4Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10148-10155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is based on these in vitro findings that CP is widely regarded as a thin filament-based regulator of actin-myosin interaction. However, its true physiological role remains unknown. Aside from regions that contain myosin and contractile actin, SMCs have an extensive cytoskeletal network made of desmin and/or vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs), β-actin filaments, α-actinin, and filamin (reviewed by Small (9Small J.V. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), Small et al. (10Small J.V. Fürst D.O. Thornell L.-E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and Bagby (11Bagby R.M. Ultrastructure of Smooth Muscle. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, Massachusetts1990: 23-61Crossref Google Scholar)). They also have dense bodies, often thought to be equivalent to the Z-disks of skeletal muscle, but unlike Z-disks, dense bodies contain noncontractile β-actin (12North A.J. Gimona M. Cross R.A. Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 445-455PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that in gizzard SMC, the desmin IFs connect the dense bodies, but the molecular mechanism of how they are connected is not known (9Small J.V. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As is well known, IFs are polymerized at ∼0.15 m NaCl from desmin tetramers, which are stable at low ionic strengths and in urea up to ∼5 m (13Kaufmann E. Weber K. Geisler N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Studies by Lehman showing that the majority of CP did not coimmunoprecipitate with anti-CaD (14Lehman W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) but did with anti-filamin (15Lehman W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1991; 12: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggested a cytoskeletal association for CP. More recently, Northet al. (16North A.J. Gimona M. Cross R.A. Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 437-444PubMed Google Scholar) reported immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) results showing that CP is localized in both the cytoskeletal and the contractile regions of chicken gizzard SMCs. Using a novel fixation method that clearly distinguished cytoskeletal regions from myosin-containing contractile regions, we found that the density of CP in regions rich in myosin filaments is much lower than that in and around the cytoskeleton (17Mabuchi K. Li Y. Tao T. Wang A.L.-C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This indicates that it is not likely for CP to directly regulate actin-myosin interaction in these cells. The distribution of CP is such that in certain regions of the cell it overlapped precisely with the cytoskeletal proteins β-actin, filamin, and in particular, desmin. This suggests that a fraction of CP may be associated with desmin IFs in situ and may function to link IFs with various elements of the cytoskeleton. In this work we seek further evidence for the association of CP with IFs and investigate the nature of this association. Our results indicate that CP can be incorporated into synthetic IFs as a co-polymer with desmin in vitro and that some CP remains associated with native IFs and dense bodies even after extraction with solutions containing 0.4 m NaCl. Common reagents were from Sigma, urea was from U. S. Biochemical Corp., materials for gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad, and materials for recombinant DNA procedures were from Difco. Mouse desmin cDNA previously characterized by Li et al. (18Li H. Choudhary S.K. Milner D.J. Munir M.I. Kuisk I.R. Capetanaki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 827-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was inserted into the protein expression vector pET11d (Novagen, Madison, WI) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21/DE3. Bacteria from a 2-liter culture were pelleted and kept at −20 °C until use. The pellets were suspended in 150 ml of wash solution containing 0.1 mNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The suspension was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 25 min, and the resulting residue was homogenized in 100 ml of extraction buffer containing 6 m urea, 1 mm DTT, 2 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After removal of the insoluble materials by centrifugation, the extracts were applied onto a DE52 (Whatman) fast flow column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with the extraction buffer that contained 50 mm NaCl but without the trypsin inhibitor. The bound proteins were then eluted with a 50–200 mm NaCl gradient. A desmin peak at ∼110 mm NaCl was pooled and dialyzed against a solution containing 0.15 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to polymerize the desmin. Desmin filaments were collected by centrifugation (30 min at 70,000 ×g), dissolved with 6 m urea in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, and stored at −20 °C. We obtained about 100 mg of desmin from a 2-liter culture. Desmin concentration was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). We use the convention of indicating desmin concentration as that of the monomeric single-peptide chain throughout. Expression and purification of recombinant chicken gizzard αCP were described earlier (19Gong B.J. Mabuchi K. Takahashi K. Nadal-Ginard B. Tao T. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 446-453Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purified CP was kept as freeze-dried powder at −20 °C. When needed, it was dissolved in a solution containing 6m urea and 10 mm DTT then dialyzed against the appropriate buffer. Since some fraction of CP is always aggregated upon storage, we routinely centrifuge CP solution at 220,000 ×g for 20 min before each application. The method of Tsukita et al. (20Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Ishikawa H. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 229: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was modified as follows. Chicken gizzard homogenates were first thoroughly washed as described for the preparation of washed myofibrils (21Sobieszek A. Bremel R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We extracted actomyosin with 3 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (ATP/EGTA solution). Actomyosin was removed by three cycles of homogenizations of the myofibrils (or residues) in the ATP/EGTA/MgCl2 solution and centrifugations at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The residue after the third extraction, termed the dense body/IF-enriched fraction, was further suspended in the ATP/EGTA solution containing 0.15–0.4 m NaCl and then centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 10 min to compare the extractability of CP with that of CaD or Tm. Desmin (4 μm) and CP (0, 2, and 4 μm) were dissolved in a solution containing 6 m urea, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, and the urea was replaced with IF buffer consisting of 0.15 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, by successive dialyses versus solutions of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 4, 2, and 0 m urea and finallyversus the IF buffer. After each dialysis, small amounts of solutions were put aside for electron microscope examination. For co-sedimentation experiments, 4 μm CP with or without 8 μm desmin IFs in 100 μl of solution containing 0.1m NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5 (0.1 m NaCl buffer) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min using the Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge and a TLA 100.2 rotor. For co-polymerization experiments, 5 μm each of proteins were mixed in 6m urea, the urea was replaced with the IF buffer as described above, and 200 μl was used for analysis. After centrifugation, 40 μl each of the supernatants and all the resolubilized pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE. For rotary shadowing, proteins were adsorbed onto mica by placing a sheet of freshly cleaved mica on a drop of protein solution prepared as follows: 1 μg/ml desmin in 30% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, with or without 4m urea, or 200-fold diluted dialysates (see “Formation of Intermediate Filaments” below). The mica was then transferred to the above solution containing neither urea nor protein to remove unadsorbed protein and urea. Adsorbed protein was then stabilized by treatment with uranyl acetate. After rinsing away the uranyl acetate, the mica was processed for rotary shadowing as described earlier (22Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 103: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For imaging, the antibody-labeled CP-desmin complex, a monoclonal anti-CP (ascites, Sigma) was purified on a CP affinity column as described in Stafford et al. (24Stafford W.F. Mabuchi K. Takahashi K. Tao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10576-10579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CP and anti-CP were then mixed at equimolar ratio (3.3 μm) in 0.1 mammonium acetate, 30% glycerol, pH 7.2, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was then diluted 200-fold into the desmin (1 μg/ml) solution containing no salt but 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and adsorbed onto mica after incubation for 1 h at room temperature. For negative staining, proteins (2–4 μm) were adsorbed onto carbon films on copper grids (400 mesh), washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.35% glutaraldehyde and then treated with aqueous 1% uranyl acetate. All the specimens were observed at 60 kV using a Philips 300 electron microscope. For IEM imaging of desmin-CP co-polymers, the filaments were sedimented at ∼20,000 × g for 10 min to remove free CP, and the pellets were resuspended in the IF buffer. Desmin-CP IFs or dense body fractions were reacted with the monoclonal anti-CP (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The following day, 10-nm gold-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (BioCell, Cardiff, UK) was added to the mixture at 5-fold dilution and further incubated overnight at 4 °C. Desmin (∼15 mg) was dissolved in 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and dialyzed versus 4 m urea, 100 mmsodium potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. About 0.5 g of CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) was quickly washed with the same buffer and mixed with the desmin solution. The mixture was left at 4 °C over a weekend with gentle constant agitation and then packed into a 1 × 2-cm column. After repeated washes with 0.1 m acetic acid and 0.1 m Tris solutions, the column was equilibrated with a solution containing 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. 0.5 ml of a 0.8 mg/ml CP solution in 75 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was applied onto the desmin column containing ∼2 ml of desmin-conjugated resin. The column was washed with ∼10 ml of the buffer above then eluted with a 0.075–1m NaCl gradient. Gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) was carried out using SE 250 vertical slab units (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco) according to manufacturer protocols. Images of gel slabs were captured by Data Transfer Frame Grabber (Marlboro, MA) using a model CCD-72 (Dage-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN) camera equipped with a Sony TV zoom lens. Amounts of proteins associated with gel bands were estimated from the digitized images using the program NIH Image 1.54. To assess whether CP binds directly to IFs, CP (4 μm) and preformed desmin IFs (8 μm) were mixed in a solution containing 0.1m NaCl and subjected to centrifugation. SDS-PAGE of the supernatant and pellet fractions (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4, respectively) show that whereas all the IFs were sedimented, only a small amount of CP sedimented with the IFs. Densitometric protein quantitation showed that 19% CP was found in the pellet fraction. Since ∼10% CP sedimented by itself under the same conditions (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and2), the fraction of sedimented CP attributable to binding to the synthetic IFs is no more than 9%. We conclude that the interaction between CP and preformed synthetic IFs is weak at best. To examine whether CP can form a co-polymer with desmin, CP (5 μm) was mixed with desmin (5 μm of monomer) in 6 m urea as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resultant filaments were centrifuged, and the supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1,lanes 5 and 6). It can be seen that a considerable amount of CP (52%) sedimented along with desmin. When CP without desmin was dialyzed versus the no-salt buffer, almost all the CP appeared to have stuck to dialysis membranes, and further dialysis versus the IF buffer solubilized only one-half of the CP. In contrast, with desmin, ∼44% of the original 5 μm was recovered in the dialysis bag, whereas very little desmin was lost. Using this final CP concentration of ∼2.2 μm rather than the initial 5 μm and assuming that ∼10% of the 2.2 μm was self-sedimented, 42% of the CP co-polymerized with desmin IFs, clearly larger than the 9% in the co-sedimentation experiment (see above). To ascertain whether the sedimented CP is indeed associated with the filaments, the sediments from an initial mixture of 2 μmCP and 4 μm desmin were resuspended in the IF buffer and examined by gold IEM using the monoclonal anti-CP. It can be seen that the gold particles overlap well with the filaments (Fig.2 C). In control experiments using filaments formed with desmin alone, almost all the particles were found in the background (data not shown). It appears that the overall shape of the filaments is dependent on the relative content of CP; whereas filaments formed from an initial mixture of 2 μmCP and 4 μm desmin (Fig. 2 B) were similar in shape compared with desmin IFs (Fig. 2 A), those formed from 4 μm each of protein were wider, less dense, and had a flared appearance (Fig. 2 D). These observations indicate that CP and desmin can form a co-polymer and imply that CP may interact with tetrameric desmin. It has been reported that tetrameric desmin is stable at 4 m urea (13Kaufmann E. Weber K. Geisler N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We found that the rotary-shadowed images of desmin in 4 murea (Fig. 3 A) is indeed similar to those in the absence of salt (Fig. 3 B). We further found that in the presence of 4 m urea, desmin does not polymerize in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 8.5 (data not shown), a property that we exploited to construct a desmin affinity column (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.4 shows the elution profile of CP from the desmin column (panel A) and the corresponding SDS-gel electrophoretogram of selected fractions (panel B). No CP was found in the flow-through, indicating that all the CP was bound. Upon elution with a 0.075–1 m NaCl gradient, CP was eluted at ∼0.3 m NaCl (fractions 22–26). In another experiment, the bound CP was eluted with stepwise increases in the concentration of NaCl; the majority of the CP also eluted at 0.3 m NaCl. This result shows that CP interacts with the unpolymerized form of desmin and that this interaction is likely to be quite strong since 0.3m NaCl is required to dissociate CP from the desmin column.Figure 4Affinity chromatography of CP on a column of tetrameric desmin.

The bound CP was visualized using anti-CP and quantitated by densitometric imaging. The results (not shown) show that at 0.2 m NaCl, CP binds to desmin tetramers in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, further indicating that this interaction can occur. We attempted to image the complex between CP and tetrameric desmin by mixing CP and desmin in the presence of 6 m urea followed by dialysis into salt-free buffer. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of this preparation revealed large globular structures with many projections. Since it is well known that under this condition desmin is in the tetrameric form (see also Fig. 3 B) whereas CP forms aggregates, we surmised that the projections are desmin tetramers, and the globules are CP aggregates. Such structures can form if CP binds to or near the ends of the desmin tetramers. We obtained clearer pictures from a preparation obtained by mixing 1 μg/ml desmin with 0.5 μg/ml CP in the presence of ∼1 mm salt, conditions in which desmin molecules stay as tetramers and most of the CP molecules stay monomeric because of the very low protein concentration. We observed images of triangularly shaped anti-CP IgG molecules (26Heuser J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 155-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) localized primarily at the very ends of individual or aggregated desmin tetramers (Fig. 3 D, marked by arrowheads) and, much less frequently, at about one-third from the ends (marked by arrows). SDS-gel electrophoretograms of the residue left after extensive ATP/EGTA extraction (the dense body/IF-enriched fraction; see “Experimental Procedures” for details) showed that it contained primarily α-actinin, desmin, actin, and CP together with small amounts of filamin, myosin, CaD, and Tm (Fig. 5, lane 3). Further extraction of the dense body/IF-enriched fraction with the ATP/EGTA solution containing higher concentrations of NaCl removed CaD at 0.15m and Tm almost completely at 0.3 m (lane 9). In contrast, a significant amount of CP remained with desmin even after extraction with 0.4 m NaCl (lane 11). We found that anti-β-actin (Sigma) reacted much stronger to actin in the residue after 0.4 m NaCl extraction than to actin in total gizzard homogenates (data not shown), indicating that β-actin is also enriched. It should be noted that several unidentified proteins were also present in the 0.4 m NaCl-washed fraction. These results show that desmin and CP are co-purified, but whether they associated with each other is not determined yet. Electron microscopic examination of the dense body/IF-enriched fraction showed the presence of dense body-like dark objects, some of them connected by IFs (Fig. 6 A). Upon reaction with anti-CP and gold-conjugated anti-IgG, many gold particles were seen to be associated with the dense body-like objects (Fig. 6 B). However, details were difficult to discern, probably because filaments bearing CP became aggregated by the IgG molecules. When IEM examination was carried out on the residue after the 0.3 m-NaCl extraction, association of gold particles with IFs near or at a dense body was clearly observed (Fig.6 C). The impetus of this work was to seek independent evidence that might substantiate our earlier IEM findings that CP appears to be associated with IF (desmin) in certain areas of the chicken gizzard SMC (17Mabuchi K. Li Y. Tao T. Wang A.L.-C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We found that at physiological ionic strengths, CP interacts with synthetic desmin IFs only weakly, so that it is not likely that CP is associated with IFs via direct binding. We noted that this is in agreement with Wang and Gusev (27Wang P. Gusev N.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), who reported that CP binds to IFs only at low ionic strengths. Instead, we found that CP binds strongly to tetrameric desmin and that the primary binding site is likely to be at one end of the IF polymerization subunit. This raises the possibility that CP is capable of being involved in IF assembly. To examine this possibility, we mixed CP and desmin in 6 murea followed by stepwise dialysis into a buffer known to promote IF polymerization. By this procedure, we produced a co-polymer of CP and desmin as judged by co-sedimentation and IEM examination. Thesein vitro studies clearly show that although it does not associate with IFs directly, CP is capable of forming a co-polymer with desmin in IFs. We noted that these findings are consistent with those of Wang and Gusev (27Wang P. Gusev N.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), who reported that CP binds to IFs only at low ionic strengths and that CP inhibits the rate of desmin polymerization in a solution of 50 mm NaCl and 5 mmMgCl2 at pH 8.3. Further, we examined the association of CP with various purification fractions starting with homogenates of chicken gizzards. As is well known, thorough washing followed by extraction with a solution containing ATP, EGTA, and MgCl2 removes most of the soluble proteins, leaving a residue that is primarily composed of dense body-like structures linked by the IF net work. We found that some CP is associated with this dense body/IF-enriched fraction as judged by SDS-PAGE and IEM. This fraction was further extracted with the ATP/EGTA solution containing 0.15–0.4 m NaCl to compare the salt extractability of CaD and Tm with that of CP. We found that whereas Tm and CaD were nearly completely removed at 0.15 and 0.3 mNaCl, respectively, CP remained with the dense body/IF fraction even after the 0.4 m NaCl wash. IEM examination of the fraction after the 0.3 m NaCl wash shows the presence of some CP on a portion of IFs and the association of CP with the dense bodies. We can conclude from the above that a fraction of CP is tightly associated with IFs that are in the vicinity of dense bodies. From ourin vitro studies, it is likely that this salt-resistant association is via co-polymerization of CP and desmin. Our results here are therefore in strong support of our earlier IEM observations showing that CP is associated with some desmin filaments in situ. The question that arises is what functional roles this CP might playin vivo. In a recent review, Small (9Small J.V. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) discussed a model for the cytoskeleton of SMC in which the dense bodies in the β-actin-containing cytoskeletal channels are connected by the IF network, but the molecular basis for this connection is not known. Since it is well established that CP binds to actin, it is tempting to propose that CP functions as the link between dense bodies and IFs by cross-linking IFs with β-actin in the vicinity of the dense bodies. Our IEM image shown in Fig. 6 C does reveal some anti-CP labeling of IFs that seems to be at the boundary of dense bodies. However we do find labeled IFs that are not attached to dense bodies and some IFs that are not labeled at all. This may be due to disruption of the original contact between IFs and dense bodies by the high salt that was used for the extraction. Since the dense body contains many other proteins, it is also possible that other cytoskeletal proteins might be involved in the connection between IFs and dense bodies. It should be stressed that the proposed involvement of CP in cross-linking IFs to dense bodies appears to be only one of the in vivofunctions of CP. This is because a high proportion of CP is extractable together with actin filaments with low salt ATP/EGTA/MgCl2solution. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether or not CP is associated with IFs in areas other than the vicinity of dense bodies because only the dense body-IF complexes remain intact after the extensive extraction of actin and myosin filaments, which most likely cause the loss of structural integrity of the cytoskeletal channels. It is clear that much more work is still needed before the function of CP can be understood at the molecular level. We thank Drs. J. V. Small and A. C.-L. Wang for their valuable discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2092998689,"Neutrophils contain various antibacterial polypeptides and proteins in the granules that contribute to the killing of microorganisms. Recently, we have purified a cationic antibacterial polypeptide of 11 kDa (CAP11) from guinea pig neutrophil granules. CAP11 is a homodimer of G1LRKKFRKTRKRIQKLGRKIGKTGRKVWKAWREYGQIPYPCRI43joined with one disulfide bond. In this study, to understand the regulation of CAP11 expression, we isolated and analyzed cDNA encoding CAP11. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of CAP11 mRNA during neutrophil maturation and localization of CAP11 among neutrophil granule subsets. Sequence analysis of CAP11 cDNA isolated from guinea pig bone marrow cells using rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique indicated that CAP11 is synthesized as a precursor comprising 178 amino acid residues, which is composed of a signal peptide (N-terminal 29 residues), a propeptide (106 residues), and a C-terminal mature peptide (43 residues). Interestingly, the predicted CAP11 precursor displayed the characteristic features of cathelicidins, a novel protein family of antibacterial polypeptides with a conserved cathelin-like pro-region and a variable C-terminal antibacterial domain. Northern blot and Western blot analyses using neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, mononuclear cells, and bone marrow cells revealed that only neutrophils and bone marrow cells expressed CAP11 mRNA and contained CAP11, suggesting that expression of CAP11 is neutrophil lineage-specific. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis using bone marrow cells separated according to their maturation stages showed that CAP11 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the cells at later stages of neutrophil maturation. Consistent with this, in situ hybridization using CAP11-specific cRNA probe demonstrated that CAP11 mRNA was primarily expressed at metamyelocyte stage. In addition, extracellular release assay revealed that CAP11 was readily released from neutrophils accompanied with gelatinase by low concentrations ofN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe without release of specific and azurophil granule components, and CAP11 was found to be exclusively present in the fraction containing gelatinase granules, prepared by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Together these observations indicate that CAP11 is a member of cathelicidin family and its mRNA is preferentially expressed at the later stage of neutrophil maturation (i.e. metamyelocyte stage). Furthermore, CAP11 may be stored in the granule subset, possibly the gelatinase granule.

Furthermore, CAP11 may be stored in the granule subset, possibly the gelatinase granule. Neutrophils have been recognized as a key element in host defense against microbial infections (1Lehrer R.I.

Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 859-874Google Scholar). One of the main functions of neutrophils is the ingestion and subsequent intracellular killing of microorganisms. Intracellular killing is mediated by oxidative and/or nonoxidative mechanisms (3Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 541-588Google Scholar, 4Elsbach P. Weiss J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 603-636Google Scholar). The former depends on oxidants (H2O2, hypochlorite, chloramines, and hydroxyl radicals) whose production follows the activation and assembly of NADPH oxidase on the plasma membrane. The nonoxidative mechanism reflects the actions of potent antibacterial polypeptides residing within the cytoplasmic granules. A number of antibacterial polypeptides, such as defensin, azurocidin, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, lysozyme, lactoferrin, cationic antibacterial proteins of 18 kDa (CAP18) 1The abbreviations used are: CAP18, cationic antibacterial proteins of 18 kDa; CAP11, cationic antibacterial polypeptide of 11 kDa; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcription; nt, nucleotide(s); kb, kilobase(s); DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; fMLP,N-formyl Met-Leu-Phe; PMAP, porcine myeloid antibacterial peptide; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid., indolicidin, bactenecins, and protegrins, have been isolated from neutrophils of human and animal species (4Elsbach P.

In general, they are highly cationic and act by perturbing the membranes of target microorganisms. Neutrophils contain three subsets of granules, primary (azurophil) granules, secondary (specific) granules, and tertiary (gelatinase) granules (11Borregaard N. Lollike K. Kjeldsen L. Sengel⊘v H. Bastholm L. Nielsen M.H. Bainton D.F. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 12Borregaard N. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1996; 3: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Among antibacterial polypeptides, defensin, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, and azurocidin are known to be present in azurophil granules, whereas lactoferrin and CAP18 are found in specific granules, and lysozyme is present in both azurophil and specific granules (11Borregaard N.

Using makers for azurophil granules (myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase, and defensin), specific granules (lactoferrin) and gelatinase granules (gelatinase), mRNA expression, and protein synthesis were examined during maturation of neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow. In this context, in situ hybridization studies revealed that mRNA transcripts for myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase, and defensin were expressed at the promyelocyte and myelocyte stages, whereas mRNA for lactoferrin was expressed at the myelocyte and metamyelocyte stages (13Fouret P. duBois R.M. Bernaudin J.-F. Takahashi H. Ferrans V.J. Crystal R.G. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Nagaoka I. Yomogida S. Nakamura S. Someya A. Iwabuchi K. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, biosynthesis studies using bone marrow cells sorted according to their stages of maturity showed that myeloperoxidase was mainly synthesized in the fraction containing myeloblasts and promyelocytes; lactoferrin was primarily synthesized in the fraction containing myelocytes and metamyelocytes; and gelatinase was synthesized in the fraction containing myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and band cells (15Borregaard N. Sehested M. Nielsen B.S. Sengel⊘v H. Kjeldsen L. Blood. 1995; 85: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mRNA expression and synthesis of proteins, which are characteristic of the different granule subsets, are tightly controlled at different maturation stages of neutrophil precursors. Recently, we have purified a cationic antibacterial polypeptide of 11 kDa (CAP11) from guinea pig neutrophil granules (16Yomogida S. Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CAP11 is a homodimer of G1LRKKFRKTRKRIQKLGRKIGKTGRKVWKAWREYGQIPYPCRI43joined with a disulfide bond and possesses the antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative and positive bacteria. Amino acid sequence of CAP11 shows partial homology (19–30%) to the putative active peptides of rabbit and human CAP18 (17Tossi A. Scocchi M. Skerlavaj B. Gennaro R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Agerberth B. Gunne H. Odeberg J. Kogner P. Boman H.G. Gudmundsson G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immun. 1995; 63: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting CAP11 might be a homologue of CAP18, the members of cathelin-related antibacterial proteins (cathelicidins) (20Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Cathelicidin is a novel protein family with a conserved pro-region and a variable C-terminal antibacterial domain, and the pro-sequence is highly identical to the sequence of cathelin (21Ritonja A. Kopitar M. Jerala R. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), a protein identified in porcine neutrophils. However, the amino acid sequence of CAP11 precursor has not been identified, and it is not known whether CAP11 is a member of cathelicidin family. Furthermore, expression of CAP11 during neutrophil maturation has not been examined, and the localization of CAP11 among granule subsets is not clear. In this study, therefore, to deduce the amino acid sequence of CAP11 precursor, we isolated cDNA encoding CAP11 from bone marrow cells using RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) technique. In addition, we evaluated the expression of CAP11 mRNA during neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow by Northern blot and in situ hybridization. We also examined the localization of CAP11 among granule subsets by extracellular release assay and subcellular fractionation experiment using Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Hartley male guinea pigs weighing approximately 350 g were used as the source of cells. Blood neutrophils and mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized blood by Ficoll-Conray centrifugation (22Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 79B: 147-151Google Scholar). Macrophages were prepared from the peritoneal cavity 4 days after the intraperitoneal injection of glycogen (22Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 79B: 147-151Google Scholar). Eosinophils were isolated from eosinophil-rich peritoneal exudates by Ficoll-Conray centrifugation (22Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 79B: 147-151Google Scholar). In some experiments, alveolar macrophages (14Nagaoka I. Yomogida S. Nakamura S. Someya A. Iwabuchi K. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), lymphocytes, and monocytes purified from blood mononuclear cells (22Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 79B: 147-151Google Scholar) were also used. Isolated cells were stained with May/Grünwald/Giemsa, and the purity was >95%. Bone marrow cells were obtained from femoral bones. Cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4). Total cellular RNA was isolated from bone marrow cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified through oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (Collaborative Biomedical Products), and the first strand cDNA was synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using oligo(dT)18 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) as a primer. To obtain the CAP11 cDNA fragment, 5′- and 3′-primers corresponding to Gly1–Lys8, and Trp28–Tyr34 of the published amino acid sequence of CAP11 (16Yomogida S. Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), respectively, were used (Fig. 1): 5′-primer, 5′-gcgaattc-GGCCTGCGGAAGAAGTTCCGGAA-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-gcgaattcGTACTCCCGCCAGGCC-TTCCA-3′, where the lowercase letters represent EcoRI recognition sequence included to facilitate the subcloning of PCR products. Amplification was performed with 50 pmol of each primer in a final reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) using the following thermal cycling parameters: 94 °C for 2 min; then 30 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s; 55 °C for 15 s; 72 °C for 30 s; followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified cDNA fragment (approximately 120 base pairs was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene). DNA sequencing (see below) revealed that the cDNA fragment encoded the Gly1–Tyr34 sequence of CAP11. Based on the nucleotide sequence, 5RT (reverse transcription)-primer, and 5′- and 3′-amplification (amp) primers were synthesized and used for the RACE protocol (Fig. 1 A) (24Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). To amplify the 3′ end (RACE3′), poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT)18-adapter primer containing SalI, BamHI, and HindIII recognition sites in the adapter sequence. After purification with a spin column (Quick Spin™ Column G-50, Boehringer Mannheim), the first strand cDNA was amplified by PCR using the upstream 3′-amplification primer 5′-gcgaattcACAGGAAAAGGATCCAG-3′ (corresponding to nt 441–458 shown in Fig. 1 B with EcoRI recognition sequence at 5′ end) and the downstream adapter primer. To amplify the 5′ end (RACE5′), poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed with 5RT-primer 5′-AGACTTTCCGGCCAGTTTTC-3′ (complementary to nt 479–498), and the single-stranded cDNA was tailed with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TOYOBO) using dATP. Then tailed cDNA was amplified with an upstream oligo(dT)18-adapter primer and a downstream 5′-amplification primer 5′-gcgaattcCAGTTTTCCCGATTTTCCG-3′ (complementary to nt 468–486 with EcoRI recognition sequence at 5′ end) located 12 nucleotides upstream of RT-primer. To assemble the full-length cDNA, the first strand cDNA synthesized with oligo(dT)18 primer was amplified using the 5′ end primer 5′-gcgaattcGAGTGAGGACCATGGGCA-3′ (corresponding to nt 1–18 with EcoRI recognition sequence at 5′ end) and the 3′ end primer 5′-gcgtcgacCAAGAACACACTAGGTAGTC-3′ (corresponding to nt 651–670 with SalI recognition sequence at 5′ end). The amplified cDNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and SalI and subcloned into pBluescript SK(−). The sequences of cDNAs subcloned into pBluescript SK(−) were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using the ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Core Kit (with AmpliTaq® DNA Polymerase, FS) and the model 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Both strands were sequenced using T3, T7 primers (Promega), and synthetic oligonucleotide primers, which were deduced from the cDNA sequence. Analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were performed with the GeneWorks and PC/GENE software (IntelliGenetics), and homology search was carried out on the SWISS-PROT data base. Total RNA (5 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred by capillary blotting onto nylon membranes (Biodyne® A Membrane; Pall) (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was cross-linked with Funa®-UV-Linker (Funakoshi Co. Ltd.), and the blots were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with Multiprime DNA labeling systems (Amersham Corp.) using [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals Inc.) (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes used for Northern blot analysis were the 0.67-kb CAP11 cDNA (encompassing nt 1–670; Fig. 1 B), the 2.3-kb γ-actin cDNA (pHFγA-1; graciously provided by P. Gunning and L. Kedes, Stanford University) (25Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell.

Iwabuchi K. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the 0.59-kb lactoferrin cDNA (encompassing nt 472–1060 of lactoferrin cDNA) (28Johnston J.J. Rintels P. Chung J. Sather J. Benz Jr., E.J. Berliner N. Blood. 1992; 79: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) obtained by the PCR amplification of HL60 cell cDNA, and the 0.46-kb gelatinase cDNA (encompassing nt 1567–2024 of gelatinase cDNA) (29Wilhelm S.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) obtained by the PCR amplification of cDNA from phorbol myristate acetate-treated U937 cells. The cells were treated with 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and disrupted in ice by sonication (Tomy Ultrasonic Disruptor UD-201, Tominaga Works Ltd.). The sonicates were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to sediment nuclei, and the supernatants (106 cell equivalents) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 7.5–22% linear gradient of polyacrylamide (14Nagaoka I. Yomogida S. Nakamura S. Someya A. Iwabuchi K. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The resolved polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked in 3% normal goat serum/PBS and probed with affinity purified rabbit anti-CAP11 antibody (100 ng/ml; see below). The membrane was further probed with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Organon Teknika Corp.), and CAP11 was finally detected with ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Corp.). Anti-CAP11 serum was raised in rabbits using the synthetic peptide (corresponding to L2RKKFRKTRKR12 of CAP11) (16Yomogida S. Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and anti-CAP11 antibody was purified by affinity chromatography using the synthetic peptide-conjugated epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Bone marrow cells were mixed with 1% dextran T-500 (Pharmacia), and erythrocytes were sedimented. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 200 ×g for 10 min, and the pelleted cells were suspended in PBS at 107 cells/ml. The cells (15 ml) were applied on top of a 50-ml centrifuge tube containing 9 ml of Percoll (Pharmacia), density 1.080 g/ml, layered below 9 ml of Percoll, density 1.065 g/ml (15Borregaard N. Sehested M. Nielsen B.S. Sengel⊘v H. Kjeldsen L. Blood. 1995; 85: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The desired densities of Percoll were obtained by mixing 10 × PBS with precalculated amounts of Percoll and distilled H2O, as described by the manufacturer. The gradient was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. This resulted in the fractionation of bone marrow cells into three groups: band 1, a well defined band on top of the gradient; band 2, all the cells between band 1 and a cell pellet at the bottom, band 3. Band 3 was contaminated with erythrocytes and therefore subjected to a hypotonic lysis. Cytocentrifuge preparations were made using Cytospin 2 (105cells/slide, 340 rpm, 10 min; Shandon Instruments) and stained with May/Grünwald/ Giemsa. Differential counting of stained myeloid cell preparations revealed that band 1 contained 18 ± 6% myeloblasts, 56 ± 4% promyelocytes, 16 ± 4% myelocytes, and 10 ± 4% metamyelocytes; band 2 contained 5 ± 3% promyelocytes, 36 ± 7% myelocytes, 44 ± 8% metamyelocytes, 10 ± 5% band cells, and 5 ± 3% segmented cells; band 3 contained 4 ± 3% myelocytes, 12 ± 4% metamyelocytes, 49 ± 5% band cells, and 35 ± 7% segmented cells (mean ± S.D., n = 3), as previously reported (15Borregaard N. Sehested M. Nielsen B.S. Sengel⊘v H. Kjeldsen L. Blood. 1995; 85: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from the three groups of cells and subjected to Northern blot analysis (described above). To measure the relative amounts of mRNA, the detected bands were quantified using MasterScan™ System (Scanalytics). In situ hybridization was performed essentially based on the methods previously described (14Nagaoka I. Yomogida S. Nakamura S. Someya A. Iwabuchi K. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,30Ohwada A. Takahashi H. Nagaoka I. Kira S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells were cytocentrifuged (see above) onto siliconized RNase-free glass slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and treated with 0.25% acetic anhydride, 0.1 mtriethanolamine buffer, pH 8.0. The cytocentrifuge preparations were hybridized at 45 °C for 14–16 h with 35S-labeled antisense or sense cRNA probe (107 cpm/ml) and then treated with RNase. For autoradiography, the slides were coated with Konica NR-M2 emulsion (Konica Corp.) diluted 1:1 with 0.3 mammonium acetate at 42 °C, air-dried, and stored in the dark at 4 °C. After 3–10 days of exposure, the slides were developed in Konicador Super developer, fixed in Fujifix (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.), and stained with May/Grünwald/Giemsa. Silver grain counts above individual cells or in their close vicinity were microscopically evaluated, and bone marrow cells hybridized with antisense cRNA probes were considered as positive if they contained more than four grains per cell; this was based on the results that the cells hybridized with all five sense probes (see below) contained less than four grains per cell. A minimum of 500 cells was evaluated in each preparation using the morphologic criteria described before (13Fouret P. duBois R.M. Bernaudin J.-F. Takahashi H. Ferrans V.J. Crystal R.G. J. Exp.

To generate 35S-labeled cRNA probes, the CAP11, myeloperoxidase, defensin, lactoferrin, and gelatinase cDNAs (described above) were subcloned into the transcription vector pBluescript SK (−), and after appropriate linearization, labeled antisense and sense cRNA probes were synthesized by transcription of cDNAs with T3 (Stratagene) or T7 (TOYOBO) RNA polymerase using35S-UTP (1000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals Inc.). Cytocentrifuge preparations (see above) were immunostained as described previously (14Nagaoka I. Yomogida S. Nakamura S. Someya A. Iwabuchi K. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To inactivate the endogenous peroxidase activity, the slides were treated with 0.1 m periodic acid and 0.02% sodium borohydride. The slides were incubated with 100 ng/ml rabbit anti-CAP11 antibody or rabbit control IgG (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) containing 1% gelatin and 0.05% Tween 20, and after washing, further incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The slides were finally developed in 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, 0.01% H202 and counterstained with May/Grünwald/Giemsa. Neutrophils (5 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with or without various concentrations of N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP; Sigma) in a total volume of 1 ml of PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2. After incubation, each tube was placed in ice and centrifuged at 1850 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were mixed with 5 mm DFP and used for the assay of CAP11, lactoferrin, gelatinase, β-glucuronidase, and lactate dehydrogenase. To measure the total contents, neutrophils sonicates containing 5 mm DFP were used. Extracellular release was calculated as the content in the supernatant in terms of percentage of the total content. CAP11 and lactoferrin were detected by Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-CAP11 antibody and rabbit anti-lactoferrin serum (1:1000 dilution; Organon Teknika), respectively, as primary antibodies, as described above. Gelatinase was analyzed by zymography with SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide containing 1 mg/ml gelatin under nonreducing conditions (32Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Umenishi F. Koshikawa N. Umeda M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1992; 111: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To measure the relative amounts, CAP11 (11 kDa) and lactoferrin (80 kDa) bands detected by Western blotting and gelatinase bands (92, 135, and 220 kDa) (33Hibbs M.S. Hasty K.A. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H.

The densities of CAP11, lactoferrin, and defensin (see below) bands and the areas of clear zones in gelatin zymograms were quantitated in the ranges where they were proportional to the amounts of samples used as follows: CAP11, 105 to 106 cell equivalents; lactoferrin and defensin, 104 to 105 cell equivalents; gelatinase, 103 to 104cell equivalents. β-Glucuronidase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were measured as described previously (35Nagaoka I.

Recombinant human α-l-iduronidase, isolated from secretions of an overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cell line, is potentially useful for replacement therapy of these disorders. Because of the importance of carbohydrate residues for endocytosis and lysosomal targeting, we examined the oligosaccharides of recombinant α-l-iduronidase at each of its sixN-glycosylation sites. Biosynthetic radiolabeling showed that three or four of the six oligosaccharides of the secreted enzyme were cleaved by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, with phosphate present on the sensitive oligosaccharides andl-fucose on the resistant ones. For structural analysis, tryptic and chymotryptic glycopeptides were isolated by lectin binding and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography; their molecular mass was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry before and after treatment with endo- or exoglycosidases or with alkaline phosphatase. Identification of the peptides was assisted by amino- or carboxyl-terminal sequence analysis. The major oligosaccharide structures found at each site were as follows: Asn-110, complex; Asn-190, complex; Asn-336, bisphosphorylated (P2Man7GlcNAc2); Asn-372, high mannose (mainly Man9GlcNAc2, some of which was monoglucosylated); Asn-415, mixed high mannose and complex; Asn-451, bisphosphorylated (P2Man7GlcNAc2). The Asn-451 glycopeptide was unexpectedly resistant to digestion byN-glycanase unless first dephosphorylated, but it was sensitive to endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and to glycopeptidase A. The heterogeneity of carbohydrate structures must represent the accessibility of the glycosylation sites as well as the processing capability of the overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. α-l-Iduronidase is a lysosomal hydrolase that is deficient in Hurler syndrome and clinically milder variants.

The heterogeneity of carbohydrate structures must represent the accessibility of the glycosylation sites as well as the processing capability of the overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. α-l-Iduronidase (EC 3.2.1.76), a lysosomal enzyme that participates in the degradation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, is deficient in the Hurler, Hurler/Scheie, and Scheie syndromes, collectively known as mucopolysaccharidosis I (1Neufeld E.F. Muenzer J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2465-2494Google Scholar). In the absence of α-l-iduronidase, lysosomal accumulation of partially degraded glycosaminoglycans causes characteristic clinical manifestations that include corneal clouding, skeletal abnormalities, cardiovascular disease, limited joint mobility, and organomegaly. Mental retardation and death in childhood characterize the Hurler syndrome, while intelligence is normal and life span nearly so in the Scheie syndrome. There exist canine and feline forms of α-l-iduronidase deficiency, and a murine form has recently been generated by homologous recombination (2Clarke L.A. Russell C. Warrington C. Pownall S. Borowski A. Jirik E.R. Toone J. Dimmick J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: A196Google Scholar). The disorders have been extensively reviewed, as have recent studies of their molecular basis (1Neufeld E.F. Muenzer J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Early work in cell culture had suggested that mucopolysaccharidosis I might be amenable to enzyme replacement therapy, since exogenous enzyme could be taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis and delivered to lysosomes (1Neufeld E.F. Muenzer J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2465-2494Google Scholar). To provide sufficient enzyme, we isolated a stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ConA, concanavalin A; dMM, deoxymannojirimycin; endo-H, endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight; PNGase-F, peptideN-glycosidase F (N-glycanase); TPCK,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; TLCK,N-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. cell line that synthesized and secreted large amounts of recombinant human α-l-iduronidase (4Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The secreted enzyme had properties desirable for replacement purposes, including efficient endocytosis by cultured fibroblasts through a mannose 6-phosphate-dependent system and a 5-day half-life within the cells. When used in replacement trials for the canine model of α-l-iduronidase deficiency, the recombinant human enzyme was taken up to the largest extent by liver, in lesser amounts by lung, kidney, and spleen, and little if at all by brain, cartilage, myocardium, and cornea (5Shull R.M. Kakkis E.D. McEntee M.F. Kania S.A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12937-12941Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6Kakkis E.D. McEntee M.F. Schmidtchen A.

Similar results were found in replacement trials for the feline model of the disease (7Haskins M.E. Kakkis E.D. Wan O. Weil M.A. Aguirre G.D. Schuchman E.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: A39Google Scholar). It is not known whether this distribution is the result of accessibility of the circulating enzyme to tissues, of uptake of the enzyme by specific receptor systems, or of some combination of these factors. Overexpressing CHO cell lines have been engineered for production of a number of other soluble lysosomal enzymes (8Ioannou Y.A. Bishop D.F. Desnick R.J. J.

In contrast to normal cultured cells, which secrete very little lysosomal enzyme except in the presence of NH3 or lysosomotropic amines, engineered CHO lines secrete a substantial fraction of the newly synthesized recombinant enzymes even in the absence of these weak bases (4Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Ioannou Y.A. Bishop D.F. Desnick R.J. J.

Such secretion occurs although the enzymes appear to have the mannose 6-phosphate signal for targeting to lysosomes, as evidenced by mannose 6-phosphate inhibition of their uptake. There is no detailed information on the structures of the carbohydrate constituents of recombinant lysosomal enzymes. We undertook an analysis of the N-linked carbohydrates of secreted α-l-iduronidase to shed light on processing by overexpressing CHO cells as well as to facilitate interpretation of enzyme uptake in vivo. Since the structure of carbohydrates at each of the six glycosylation sites (Asn residues 110, 190, 336, 372, 415, and 451 (14Scott H.S. Anson D.S. Orsborn A.M. Nelson P.V. Clements P.R. Morris C.P.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: A1108Google Scholar). α-l-Iduronidase was collected from secretions of the overexpressing CHO cell line 2.131 and purified to apparent homogeneity as described previously (4Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Antiserum to this enzyme was raised in rabbits. Reagents were purchased from the following vendors: 33Pi from Amersham Corp.;l-[5,6-3H]fucose from ICN; Expre35s35s 35S protein labeling mix from NEN Life Science Products; fetal bovine serum and other tissue culture reagents from Life Technologies, Inc., except for methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, which was from Biofluids; TPCK-treated trypsin and TLCK-treated chymotrypsin, bradykinin, heparin-acrylic beads, and agarose-linked lectins from Sigma; Pansorbin, Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, andVibrio cholerae neuraminidase from Calbiochem; recombinant endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo-H) from New England Biolabs; deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) from Genzyme; N-glycanase (PNGase-F), V. cholerae sialidase, and α-mannosidase from Oxford Glycosystems; glycopeptidase A from Seikagaku; α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid from Aldrich; sequencing grade carboxypeptidase Y and pyroglutamate aminopeptidase from Boehringer Mannheim. α-Glucosidase II was a gift from Drs. Alan Elbein and Y. Zeng of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Centricon-30 microconcentrators were from Amicon, and Sep-Pak C-18 cartridges were from Waters. The CHO cell line 2.131 was maintained in minimal essential medium-α (with nucleosides) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, 20 mm Hepes, 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, with a final pH of 6.8, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were transplanted to 6-well plates (35-mm well diameter) and used after reaching confluence. They were preincubated under similar conditions in methionine- or phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium supplemented as above except for the use of dialyzed fetal bovine serum and of 2.5 mm Hepes (starvation medium). After 30 min at 37 °C, the starvation medium in each well was replaced with 0.5 ml of medium of similar composition containing 25 μCi of 35S protein labeling mix or 25 μCi of33Pi. After 1 h of labeling, a chase was initiated by the addition of unlabeled methionine to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml or of unlabeled phosphate to 1 mm. Where deoxymannojirimycin was used, it was added to the medium 6 h before labeling and kept through the labeling and chase period. No change was made in medium components when labeling withl-[5,6-3H]fucose. Immunoprecipitation of α-l-iduronidase with rabbit antiserum and Pansorbin was carried out essentially as described for β-hexosaminidase (18Proia R.L. D'Azzo A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3350-3354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, was substituted for Tris-HCl. Because of the high level of expression, the enzyme could be immunoprecipitated from the medium without prior concentration. The immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 0.1% SDS, 0.01% NaN3 and heated at 98 °C for 3 min; after centrifugation, 0.1 volume of 7.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1.5% β-mercaptoethanol were added to the supernatant fluids. The mixtures were heated again at 98 °C for 3 min and centrifuged prior to endoglycosidase digestion. Immunoprecipitates were divided into aliquots for treatment at 37 °C with one of the following: 50 milliunits of PNGase-F in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 100 units of endo-H in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.5 (the amount of enzyme was reduced to 50 units to observe glycosylation intermediates); 5 milliunits of neuraminidase in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6; or 250 milliunits of alkaline phosphatase in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, for the indicated period of time. The immunoprecipitates, with or without enzymatic treatment, were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% gel (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and radiolabeled α-l-iduronidase was visualized by fluorography. Enzyme purified to apparent homogeneity (4Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was stored in 0.15 m NaCl buffered to pH 5.8 with 10 mm sodium phosphate (buffer A). To change the pH for proteolysis, 2 nmol of enzyme (140 μg of protein, excluding the weight of the carbohydrate chains) was buffer-exchanged in a Centricon-30 microconcentrator that had been pretreated overnight with 5% ethylene glycol to block nonspecific binding to the plastic wall. The exchange buffer was 100 mm Tris-HCl containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.2 (buffer B). After three cycles of dilution and concentration, the final protein solution in the reservoir (∼100 μl) was recovered by reverse centrifugation for 5 min. To prepare [33P]α-l-iduronidase for protease digestion, biosynthetic labeling of CHO 2.131 cells was carried out in a 100-mm plate in phosphate-free medium as described above, except for absence of fetal bovine serum during both the starvation and labeling periods. After 30 min preincubation, the medium was changed to 2 ml of the same serum-free starvation medium containing 200 μCi of 33Pi. At the end of a 6-h labeling period, the medium was collected and centrifuged, and the supernatant fluid was applied to a small column (0.8 ml) of heparin-acrylic beads prewashed with buffer A containing 0.02% NaN3. α-l-Iduronidase was eluted in fractions of 0.5 ml with 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, 0.02% NaN3. The purified radiolabeled α-l-iduronidase was concentrated and combined with 2–3 nmol of unlabeled α-l-iduronidase for further processing. The concentrated samples of α-l-iduronidase were denatured under reducing conditions by the addition of 4 μmol of dithiothreitol, 1.2 mmol of solid guanidinium HCl, and buffer B to a total volume of 200 μl. After 2 h at ambient temperature, solid iodoacetamide (18 μmol) was added, and the volume was adjusted to 0.4 ml with buffer B. After further incubation for 3 h in the dark, the samples were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of 50 mm NH4HCO3, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.2. The samples were then incubated with TPCK-treated trypsin or TLCK-treated chymotrypsin for 12–16 h at 37 °C (protease to substrate ratio ∼1:50, w/w). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the tryptic or chymotryptic digests to a final concentration of 1 mm; the mixture was adjusted to pH 5.8 by the addition of 1 m HCl. After the addition of CaCl2 and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mm each, the digest was passed over a series of lectin columns, each having a 0.5-ml bed volume, beginning with ConA-agarose. The column was extensively washed with buffer A untilA 280 was negligible. Glycopeptides were eluted from the ConA-agarose column with 5 ml of 10 mmα-methylglucoside and 5 ml of 0.5 m α-methylmannoside in buffer A, in fractions of 0.5 ml. Unbound fractions were pooled, adjusted to pH 7.4, and passed over a column of wheat germ agglutinin-agarose joined to a column of castor bean agglutinin-agarose. After washing with buffer A, the columns were disconnected and eluted with 0.1 m N-acetylglucosamine or 0.1 m galactose in buffer A, respectively. Lectin column eluates were pooled, concentrated to about 0.5 ml in a Speedvac concentrator, and applied to a reverse phase HPLC column (Keystone Scientific betasil, 2 × 250 mm, particle size 5 μm, and pore size 100 Å). The column was developed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 10 min and eluted with a gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 100 min in fractions of 0.2 ml/min. All fractions were stored at 4 °C. Immediately before use, endo-H was diluted to 20 units/μl with water; PNGase-F to 10 milliunits/μl and alkaline phosphatase to 2 milliunits/μl with 50 mmNH4HCO3; α-mannosidase and sialidase to 0.2 milliunits/μl with buffers provided by the supplier; and glycopeptidase A to 0.2 milliunits/μl with 50 mm(NH4)2 H citrate. α-Glucosidase II, provided in 100 mm Mes buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (20Kaushal G.P. Pastuszak I. Hatanaka K. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16271-16279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was diluted 300-fold with 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.2. In each case, 1 μl of enzyme was incubated with 1 μl of HPLC fraction overnight at ambient temperature. HPLC eluates or their deglycosylation products, 1 μl, were co-spotted on a stainless steel plate with 1 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/ml) in water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (50:50:0.1) containing 0.5 nmol/ml bradykinin). The bradykinin served as an internal standard for calibration. After the spots had been air-dried, each was washed for 30 s with 5 μl of water and dried again. The wash step improved the detection efficiency and resolution of the resulting signals. The dried samples were examined by laser desorption mass spectrometry using a reflection time of flight instrument in the linear mode. Mass signals were analyzed without smoothing. The measured mass of deglycosylated peptides was compared with that calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of α-l-iduronidase cDNA (4Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Scott H.S. Anson D.S. Orsborn A.M. Nelson P.V. Clements P.R. Morris C.P. Hopwood J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Amino-terminal sequence analysis was carried out on a Porton 2090E Sequencer at the UCLA Microsequencing Facility. Cleavage of amino-terminal pyroglutamate was carried out by incubating 1 μl of pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (20 ng/μl in 50 mm NH4HCO3, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) with 1 μl of PNGase-F-treated HPLC fraction overnight at ambient temperature. Carboxyl-terminal sequence analysis was carried out by graded cleavage of the peptide with carboxypeptidase Y and determination of the mass of the resulting peptides (21Anal. Chem. 67, 369–384Patterson, D. H., Tarr, G. E., Regnier, F. E., and Martin, S. A. Anal. Chem. , 67, 369–384.Google Scholar). Equal volumes (0.5 μl) of carboxypeptidase Y (serially diluted in (NH4)2H citrate to give 150–0.3 μg/μl) and PNGase-F-treated HPLC fractions were mixed on the steel plate. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C in a sealed Petri dish humidified with wet cotton wads, the reaction was stopped, and the samples were crystallized by the addition of 1 μl of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After the wash step as above, the peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Susceptibility of radiolabeled α-l-iduronidase to cleavage by endo-H and PNGase-F provided information on the ratio of high mannose to complex oligosaccharides. Newly made intracellular enzyme differed from secreted enzyme in that the former was completely cleaved by endo-H (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 3), whereas secreted enzyme was partially resistant (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7 and 9). The carbohydrate chains not removed from the secreted enzyme by endo-H could be cleaved, although not completely, by PNGase-F (Fig.1 A, lanes 11 and 12); a possible explanation for the incomplete hydrolysis by PNGase-F will be provided below. Only after the labeling had been performed in the presence of dMM, an inhibitor of the Golgi α-mannosidase I and hence of the mannose trimming required for complex sugar formation (22Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), were the migration and endo-H susceptibility of the secreted enzyme equal to those of newly made intracellular enzyme (Fig. 1 A,lanes 2, 4, 8, and 10). Thus, the difference is due to complex oligosaccharides on the secreted enzyme. Intermediate deglycosylation steps were made visible by partial endo-H digestion. Treatment of newly made intracellular α-l-iduronidase with a reduced amount of endo-H gave a ladder of six distinct bands, not including the starting material (Fig.1 B, left panel), showing that all six sites were of the high mannose type. Similar treatment of the secreted enzyme with endo-H resulted in only 3 or 4 bands (Fig. 1 B, right panel), indicating that two or three sites had been processed to the complex form. The bands derived from the secreted enzyme were diffuse and poorly resolved, although the sample had been pretreated with neuraminidase to reduce heterogeneity due to different degrees of sialylation. The diffuse appearance and poor resolution of the bands are attributed to incomplete desialylation and/or glycoform heterogeneity of secreted α-l-iduronidase. When the secreted α-l-iduronidase was biosynthetically labeled with 33P, all of the phosphate label could be removed by treatment with endo-H (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–4), indicating that it was associated with the carbohydrate and not with the protein. The deglycosylated protein itself could be visualized with [35S]methionine labeling (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). The secreted enzyme became strongly labeled after continuous exposure of the cell to 33Pifor 6 and 10 h (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and4), but the intracellular enzyme contained a surprisingly low level of radioisotope at all times (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that it was dephosphorylated after delivery to lysosomes. On the other hand, l-[3H]fucose was incorporated only into endo-H-resistant, PNGase-F-sensitive oligosaccharides of secreted α-l-iduronidase (Fig.2 C), showing that it was present solely onN-linked complex oligosaccharides. Fig.3, A and C, shows the HPLC profile of α-l-iduronidase glycopeptides produced by tryptic and chymotryptic digestion and isolated by α-methylmannoside elution from ConA-agarose; Fig. 3,C and D, show the corresponding radioactivity profile of 33P-labeled α-l-iduronidase glycopeptides similarly treated with trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. MALDI-TOF analysis of HPLC fractions 69–70 of the tryptic digest (Fig.3 A) gave a prominent signal at m/z3802.8. This signal disappeared when the fractions were treated with endo-H or PNGase-F and was replaced by signals ofm/z 2306.2 or 2103.7, respectively. This decrease in mass resulted from the loss of carbohydrate, the structure of which could be deduced from the magnitude of the decrease (TableI). The carbohydrate itself was not detected, since it does not crystallize with the matrix and/or fails to protonate under the conditions used. Treatment of fractions 69–70 with α-mannosidase produced no change in mass, whereas treatment with alkaline phosphatase resulted in a prominent signal atm/z 3644.7. The changes in mass observed upon treatment with endo-H, PNGase-F, and phosphatase were compatible with the structure P2Man7GlcNAc2 (Table I). The33P radiolabel in fractions 69–70 (Fig. 3 B) confirmed the phosphorylated structure of the oligosaccharide. Some minor signals could also be seen in the intact sample, ofm/z 3638.9, 3556.7, and 3390.1, compatible with structures P2Man6GlcNAc2, P1Man6GlcNAc2, and P1Man5GlcNAc2; these accounted for ∼6%, 6%, and 2% of the total, respectively. Amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequence analyses as well as the mass of the deglycosylated glycopeptide identified it as Val-325 to Tyr-343 (TableII). The phosphorylated high mannose oligosaccharide was therefore assigned to Asn-336.Table IExamples of structure assignment based on reduction in mass after enzyme treatmentFractionsTreatmentMass [M + H]+Residues removed−Δ massObservedCalculated69–70None3804.8α-Mannosidase3804.0None0.80Phosphatase3644.72P160.1160.0Endo-H2306.2P2Man7GlcNAc1498.61497.9PNGase-F2103.7P2Man7GlcNAc21701.11701.166None3530.7Phosphatase3530.2None0.50α-Mannosidase2557.76Man973.0972.6Endo-H1867.3Man9GlcNAc1663.41662.1PNGase-F1664.9Man9GlcNAc21865.81865.3None3693.4Phosphatase3693.2None0.20α-Glucosidase II3530.5Glc162.9162.1α-Mannosidase3368.52Man324.9324.2Endo-H1867.3GlcMan9GlcNAc1826.11824.2PNGase-F1664.9GlcMan9GlcNAc22028.52027.4Residue mass used for calculations: Glc and Man, 162.1; GlcNAc, 203.2; P, 80.0.

The overlapping biological properties of IL-4 and IL-13 appear to be due to the existence of shared components of the receptors, and we and others showed that the IL-4 receptor-α is involved in signal transduction paths activated by both. We show here that expression of the IL-13 receptor-α in two factor-dependent cell lines, the premyeloid FD5 and the T lymphoid CT4.S, conferred the ability to grow continuously in response to IL-13; to respond to IL-13 with tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1, Tyk2, IL-4Rα, IRS-2, and STAT6; and to respond to IL-4 with tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 in addition to those induced in parental cell lines. Expression of a truncated IL-13 receptor-α that lacked the cytoplasmic domain demonstrated that this domain was essential for IL-13-dependent growth and phosphorylation of the above substrates. Expression of this truncated IL-13 receptor also resulted in an inhibition of biochemical and biological responses to IL-4 that was exacerbated by the presence of IL-13. These dominant inhibitory effects indicate that the extracellular domain of the truncated IL-13 receptor competes with γc for complexes of IL-4 and the IL-4 receptor-α, or, when itself bound to IL-13, competes with IL-4 for the IL-4 receptor-α.

They induce expression of the low affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRII/CD23) and up-regulate class II major histocompatibility complex expression on both B cells and monocytes (4Defrance T. Carayon P.

Moreover, they suppress synthesis of IL-12 (5de Waal Malefyt R. Fugdor C.G. de Vries J.E. Res.

However, the reverse is not true; human T cells and murine T cells and B cells respond to IL-4 but not to IL-13. The overlapping activities of IL-4 and IL-13 are probably due to the existence of common receptor components, as revealed by studies demonstrating cross-competition between IL-13 and IL-4 for binding to certain cells (8Zurawski S.M.

The IL-13 receptor-α (IL-13Rα) has an apparent molecular mass of 55–65 kDa, and it binds IL-13 with a K d of 2–10 nm when transfected alone into COS cells (16Hilton D.J. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D.

However, when human IL-13Rα was cotransfected with human IL-4Rα into 293 cells and murine IL-13Rα was transfected into CTLL-2 cells that express IL-4Rα, the K d for IL-13 appeared to be 400 and 75 pm, respectively (16Hilton D.J.

Expression of the IL-13Rα in CTLL-2 cells conferred upon these cells the ability to respond to IL-13 with a brief burst of DNA synthesis; long term growth was not investigated, but it is unlikely to occur, since CTLL-2 cells do not continuously grow in response to IL-4. IL-4 and IL-13 were equally effective in competing for 125I-labeled IL-13 binding (16Hilton D.J. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, another IL-13-binding protein (IL-13Rβ) has been cloned from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line (18Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.-M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16921-16926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This protein has a short cytoplasmic domain (only 17 amino acid residues), and bound IL-13 with aK d of 250 pm when transfected alone into COS cells. Cotransfection of IL-13Rβ together with IL-4Rα did not decrease K d values for binding of IL-13. Neither IL-4Rα, γc, nor IL-13Rα encode kinase sequences in their cytoplasmic domains, but all three have Pro-rich sequences (Box 1) that might be involved in docking JAK family kinases. IL-4 and IL-13 activate similar signal transduction pathways. Both induce activation of JAK1, but only IL-4 activates JAK3; Tyk2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-13 but also in response to IL-4 in cells that respond to IL-13, including human myeloid cells and a mouse plasmacytoma cell (19Keegan A.D.

These data are consistent with a model in which there are two types of IL-4Rs but a single type of IL-13R. IL-4 would first bind to the IL-4Rα, and this complex would interact with either the IL-2Rγ or the IL-13Rα to yield active receptors. IL-13, in contrast, would first bind to the IL-13Rα, and this complex would then interact with the IL-4Rα to form an active receptor (20Welham M.J. Learmonth L. Bone H. Schrader J.W. J. Biol.

We report here the crucial role of IL-13Rα, not only in IL-13- but also in IL-4-induced responses. Transfection of IL-13Rα cDNA in FD5, a premyeloid cell line, or CT4.S, a T cell line, resulted in continuous IL-13-dependent growth and IL-13-dependent phosphorylation of JAK1, Tyk2, IL-4Rα, IRS-2, and STAT6. In contrast, a truncated IL-13Rα, encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains but lacking the cytoplasmic domain, failed to mediate detectable biological or biochemical responses to IL-13. Moreover, cells overexpressing this truncated IL-13Rα showed a greatly decreased response to IL-4 in terms of JAK1, JAK3, Tyk2, IL-4Rα, IRS-2, and STAT6 phosphorylation and proliferation. This effect was exacerbated by the presence of IL-13 and reflected sequestration of the IL-4Rα into sterile complexes of the truncated IL-13Rα and IL-4 or IL-13. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Rα is necessary for signaling by IL-13 and in some cases IL-4 and that the extracellular domain of the IL-13Rα interacts with the extracellular domain of the IL-4Rα in the presence of either IL-4 or IL-13. FD5 cells (41Gliniak B.C. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) are a subclone of the premyeloid cell line FDMACII that are dependent upon IL-3, IL-4, GM-CSF, or CSF-1 for proliferation. They were passaged in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin, and either 3% (v/v) IL-4-containing conditioned medium (IL-4-CM) or 2% L cell conditioned medium (LCCM) containing CSF-1. CT4.S cells, an IL-2-responsive derivative of the original IL-4-dependent CT4.S cell line (42Hu L. Ohara J. Watson C. Tsang W. Paul W.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 800-807PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 μm2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin, and either 5% (v/v) IL-4-CM or 2% (v/v) IL-2-containing conditioned media (IL-2-CM), derived in each case from AgX063 cells transfected with cDNA encoding the respective cytokine (43Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Crude preparations of chemically synthesized IL-4, IL-13, and GM-CSF were kindly provided by Dr. I. Clark-Lewis (The Biomedical Research Center, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). Antiserum against IRS-2 was a generous gift of Dr. J. H. Pierce (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Antiserum against STAT6 and Tyk2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antiserum against JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3 and mAb against phosphotyrosine (4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-murine IL-4Rα mAb was purchased from Genzyme, and anti-FLAG mAb was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Electrophoretic chemicals were obtained from Bio-Rad, and restriction enzymes were from New England BioLabs. The full-length cDNA sequence encoding the mouse IL-13Rα was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (44Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) (pEB-13R) under the transcriptional control of the elongation factor-1α promoter and poly(A) adenylation signal from human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The coding sequence was preceded by the IL-3 signal sequence and an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag sequence (16Hilton D.J. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The cDNA encodes the extracellular domain of IL-13Rα (amino acids 27–340), the transmembrane region (amino acids 341–364), and the intracellular domain (amino acids 365–424) (Fig.1 A). The receptor sequence encoding the cytoplasmic domain was removed from pEB-13R by digestion with AflII. Three fragments were generated, one of 4.2 kb encoding most of the vector, another of 1.9 kb encoding a small region of the vector together with the extracellular and transmembrane receptor coding sequences, and a third fragment of 0.5 kb encoding the cytoplasmic domain sequence and part of the poly(A). The fragments of 4.2 and 1.9 kb were purified from 0.8% agarose gels; blunt-ended with Klenow polymerase, creating a new in-frame stop codon downstream of the transmembrane sequence; and ligated to each other. The new plasmid (pEB-13RΔCD) encodes the entire extracellular and transmembrane receptor sequences and the two membrane-proximal amino acid residues of the cytoplasmic domain (Lys, Arg) (Fig. 1 B). The identity of the construct was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. FD5 and CT4.S cells, grown in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 3% IL-4-CM, or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS, 5% IL-4-CM, respectively, were washed and resuspended in transfection buffer (25 mm Hepes, 0.75 mmNa2HPO4, 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Ficoll 400) at a concentration of 1.3 × 107 cells/ml. For each transfection, 1 × 107 cells were mixed with 1 μg of pPGK/Neo, a plasmid conferring neomycin resistance, alone or together with 10 μg of either pEB-13R or pEB-13RΔCD cDNA and were subjected to electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 960 microfarads and 280 V or 300 V for FD5 or CT4.S, respectively. In parallel, 107 cells were electroporated without DNA to subsequently monitor neomycin-induced death. After transfection, these groups of cells were cultured in the appropriate media for 48 h and then transferred to selection media in 96-well plates at 104 cells/well. FD5 cells were selected in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml G418, and 2% LCCM, to avoid selection for responsiveness to IL-4. CT4.S cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS, 1 mg/ml G418, and 2% IL-2-CM to avoid inhibitory effects of IL-4. Individual colonies of neomycin-resistant cells were cloned and propagated for assays. Cells of individual clones were tested for expression of full-length (FD5–13R or CT4.S-13R) or truncated IL-13Rα (FD5–13RΔ or CT4.S-13RΔ) by FACScan analysis using M2, a mAb against FLAG, and goat-anti-mouse IgG-FITC and confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG mAb. A representative clone from each cell population was recloned by limit dilution and used for further experiments. Cytokine-induced proliferation of cells was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation intode novo synthesized DNA (45Schrader J.W. Ziltener H.J. Leslie K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), cell counting, and microscopic visualization. For assessment of DNA synthesis, cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffered salts supplemented with 2% (v/v) FCS. CT4.S or their transfectants were plated at 500 cells/Terisaki well, and varying concentrations of factor were added from a dilution series. Each point was repeated in triplicate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 days, pulsed for 6 h with [3H]thymidine at a final concentration of 15 μCi/ml, harvested, and counted on a scintillation counter. Results were expressed as a percentage of the maximal [3H]thymidine incorporation observed in cultures stimulated with 5% IL-2-CM. To determine long term growth and morphological changes, parental and transfected cells were plated at low density with different factors and counted, and in some cases photographed, at regular intervals. To investigate the biochemical effects of stimulation with different cytokines, selected clones of FD5, FD5–13R, and FD5–13RΔ were placed in RPMI, 10% FCS, 0.2% LCCM for 16 h, washed twice with serum/factor-free media containing 20 mmHepes, and incubated at 1–3 × 107 cells/ml of the same media at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated at 37 °C with either synthetic IL-4 (20 μg/ml), synthetic IL-13 (20 μg/ml), synthetic GM-CSF (10 μg/ml) for 10 min, recombinant insulin (5 μg/ml) for 2 min, or left untreated as control. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with antisera against STAT6, IRS-2, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, or Tyk2 or with mAbs against IL-4Rα or FLAG for 2 h at 4 °C followed by an additional hour with Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer containing decreasing concentrations of detergent and heated in Laemmli sample buffer (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) containing dithiothreitol at a final concentration of 40 mm. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 7.5 or 8.5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were then equilibrated in transfer buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electrophoresis toward the anode at 200 mA for 2 h in a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus (47Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 4–16 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed twice with TBST and incubated for 2 h with anti-Tyr(P) mAb (0.25 μg/ml) or anti-FLAG mAb (1 μg/ml) in TBST, 1% bovine serum albumin. The blots were thoroughly washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO A/S, Denmark) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST. The blots were thoroughly washed and subsequently developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence assay as described by the manufacturer (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.). Afterward, blots were stripped with erasing buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 55 °C, washed twice with TBST, blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in TBST, and incubated for 2 h with antisera against STAT6 (1:2000), IRS-2 (1:2000), JAK1 (1:1000), JAK2 (1:2000), JAK3 (1:1000), or Tyk2 (1:1000) in TBST, 1% bovine serum albumin. The blots were washed several times in TBST and incubated for 1 h in goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO A/S, Denmark), 1:10,000 in TBST. Proteins were detected as described previously. The expression plasmid pEB-13R containing the coding sequence for the full-length IL-13Rα cDNA (16Hilton D.J. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A) was digested withAflII to create the expression plasmid pEB-13ΔCD containing the extracellular, transmembrane and two membrane-proximal amino acid sequences of IL-13Rα cDNA under the transcriptional control of the elongation factor-1α promoter (Fig. 1 B). The truncated and full-length receptor expression plasmids were used to transfect FD5 and CT4.S cells, both of which are unresponsive to IL-13 but grow continuously in IL-4. Transfectants were grown in LCCM or IL-2-CM, respectively, rather than IL-4, to avoid selection for IL-4 responsiveness, which could complicate interpretation of results. Twelve neomycin-resistant colonies from each of the transfections with cDNA encoding the full-length or the truncated IL-13Rα were individually analyzed for IL-13Rα expression by fluorometry using anti-FLAG mAb and FITC conjugated to goat-anti-mouse antibody. Of the colonies of FD5 transfectants, 7 of 12 were positive for expression of the full-length IL-13Rα, and 5 of 12 were positive for expression of the truncated IL-13Rα. Both forms of the IL-13Rα were expressed as surface proteins, although in all five clones expressing IL-13RΔCD, the transfected receptor was expressed at levels that were 10–20-fold higher than those seen in all seven cl"

Its transcriptional activation is mediated by the AlcR transactivator which contains a DNA-binding domain belonging to the C6 zinc binuclear cluster family. AlcR differs from the other members of this family by several features, the most striking characteristic being its binding to both symmetric and asymmetric DNA sites with the same apparent affinity. However, AlcR is also able to bind to a single site with high affinity, suggesting that unlike the other C6 proteins, AlcR binds as a monomer.In this report, we show that AlcR targets, to be functional in vivo, have to be organized as inverted or direct repeats. In addition, we show a strong synergistic activation of alcAtranscription in which the number and the position of the AlcR-binding sites are crucial. The fact that the AlcR unit for in vitrobinding is a single site whereas the in vivo functional unit is a repeat opens the question of the mechanism of the strongalcA transactivation.

The recently identified ethanol regulon in Aspergillus nidulans, localized to chromosome VII (1Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), comprises the structural gene alcA, encoding alcohol dehydrogenase I (2Gwynne D.I. Buxton F.P. Sibley S. Davies R.W.

Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The second structural gene necessary for ethanol utilization is aldA encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase, which maps to chromosome VIII (4Pickett M. Gwynne D.I. Buxton F.P. Elliott R. Davies R.W. Lockington R.A. Scazzocchio C. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 51: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All these genes are inducible by the specific activator AlcR in the presence of an exogenous co-inducer (ethanol, the gratuitous inducer ethyl methyl ketone or other alcohols or ketones) (1Fillinger S.

Biol. 1991; 11: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression can be achieved both by direct and independent repression of the trans-acting gene alcR (6Lockington R.A. Scazzocchio C. Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol.

Both repression and induction are mediated by binding of the regulatory proteins to their cognate targets in thealc promoters (11Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that the two regulators AlcR and CreA compete for the same region of DNA containing both types of targets. Indeed it is the case for the alcR promoter, in which competition occurs even in non-inducing growth conditions (14Fillinger S. Panozzo C. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The AlcR protein belongs to a subclass of the zinc DNA-binding family containing a zinc binuclear cluster (Zn(II)2Cys6) found in ascomycetes (15Kulmburg P. Prangé T. Mathieu M. Sequeval D. Scazzocchio C. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Sequeval D. Felenbok B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with novel features. Previous work has identified two different types of specific targets, direct and inverted repeats with the same consensus core, 5′-CCGCA-3′, separated by DNA of various lengths. Recently the consensus has been extended to 5′-CCGC(A/T)-3′ (17Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the positively autoregulated alcR gene, both direct and inverted repeat targets are closely linked (11Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the alcApromoter, three AlcR targets have been identified by gel retardation assays as well as enzymatic and chemical footprint methods. They are located within a short region of 150 base pairs very close to the transcription start (see Fig. 1). One palindrome is flanked by two tandem repeats (12Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous experiments, we have shown by deleting the two AlcR repeated binding sites in the alcR promoter and two out of three AlcR-binding sites in the alcA promoter, that the AlcR consensus sequence should be functional in A. nidulans (11Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the deletion included both direct and inverted repeats. The alcA promoter is one of the strongest inducible promoters in A. nidulans. It is the most widely used for overexpressing proteins in A. nidulans and other filamentous fungi both for fundamental research and applied aspects in biotechnology (reviewed in Ref. 18Felenbok B. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore one intriguing question is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the strong alcAtranscriptional activation in comparison to promoters of the otheralc genes.In contrast to other proteins of the zinc binuclear cluster family, the AlcR zinc-binding domain is able to bind to a single consensus sitein vitro (17Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore it was important to determine if a single copy site was sufficient to induce transcription.Here we present evidence that two sites, either in direct or inverted orientation, are necessary for full transcriptional activation. We also show that they act synergistically but not as the result of the cooperative binding of AlcR to multiple DNA sites. In addition, we show a strong effect position of the AlcR targets.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have investigated the molecular basis of the high induction level of the alcA gene in A.nidulans. The three AlcR-binding sites, occupying a short 150-base pair region in the alcA promoter are shown to work synergistically to activate alcA transcription. Disruption of the distal AlcR-binding site, a, results in a 70% decrease in alcA expression whereas combined disruption of the two AlcR sites, (a and b), leads to a 95% decrease, resulting in a residual noninducible ADHI activity, sufficient to allow only weak growth on ethanol.This synergism is not explained by cooperative binding of AlcR to the three binding sites, as we observed by in vitro DNA binding experiments. Moreover AlcR was shown to bind to single-site (17Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (results herein). The same AlcR(1:197) apparent affinity was observed upon binding to a palindromic site (b), a direct repeat (a), or a single site (c 2 for example). The absence of cooperativity distinguishes AlcR from GAL4 for which cooperative DNA binding provides an explanation for the synergistic effects observed in vivo (23Giniger E. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Xu H.E. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7677-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have to point out that the AlcR(1:197) protein utilized in these studies was truncated but contained a region downstream to the zinc binuclear cluster shown in most proteins of this C6 family class to contain the linker and dimerization regions (Ref. 15Kulmburg P. Prangé T. Mathieu M. Sequeval D. Scazzocchio C. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, reviewed in Refs. 25Felenbok B. Sealy-Lewis H. Martinelli S. Kinghorn J.R. Genetics and Physiology of Aspergillus nidulans. 29. Elsevier Scientific, Amsterdam1994: 141-179Google Scholar and 26Scherling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Moreover it was shown using the transcription-translation reticulocyte system that no heterodimers were formed (17Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in addition with the λ CI repressor system (27Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) no sequence in AlcR could serve as a dimerization element. 2I. Nikolaev, F. Lenouvel, and B. Felenbok, unpublished results. In agreement with this result, physiological data, obtained after mutagenesis of the most proximal target (c) to the transcription start site, have shown clearly that even a single site (c 3) is necessary for full transcriptional activation of alcA. Therefore all these data are consistent with the finding that AlcR binds DNA as a monomer. The number of AlcR-specific sites in the alcA promoter could be one of the parameters playing a role in the synergistic activation of thealcA gene, but not the only one. In fact, in other induciblealc clustered genes (1Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the localization and the number of AlcR-binding sites are variable and do not seem directly correlated with the strength of the alc promoters (28Fillinger, S. (1996) Identification et étude fonctionnelle de nouveaux gènes appartenant au régulon éthanol chez Aspergillus nidulans, Ph.D. thesis, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France.Google Scholar). 3S. Fillinger and B. Felenbok, unpublished results.Another important parameter in synergistic alcAtranscriptional activation is AlcR's target position effects. The position of the upstream target a is the least important among the three, since its deletion or its mutagenesis, does not abolish inducibility of the alcA promoter. However, both target positions b and c are important, but at different levels. Half-site organization either in symmetric or asymmetric repeats, is not involved in this position effect. In fact, replacing the palindromic site b by the direct repeat sitea, resulting in an alcA promoter containing two direct repeat binding sites, allows transcriptional induction as with the disrupted binding site a. In contrast, disrupting targetc sites leaving single sites, strongly prevented thealcA induction mediated by AlcR binding to the remaining targets a and b. A stronger effect was even observed when target b sites were mutated (either one or both), resulting in a total loss of alcA transcription, as if AlcR was no longer able to occupy the remaining targets aand c in the absence of target b in thealcA promoter. Therefore the position occupied by targetb is crucial in the transcriptional activation process by AlcR. The above data provide evidence that a single copy of the AlcR target is not sufficient to mediate AlcR induced transcriptional activation, and that target positions in the promoter are determinant in this process, unlike transcriptional activation with GAL4. In fact with this later activator a single copy of GAL4 palindromic site is able to activate transcription, with a wide tolerance in position in the GAL4 controlled promoter (24Xu H.E. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7677-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Liang S.D. Marmorstein R. Harrisson S.C. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Finally our results open the question of the functional organization of AlcR targets. Interestingly, to be functional, AlcR targets in thealcA promoter have to be organized in repeats, either in tandem or in palindrome. Mutations in target b, leaving a single site, result in a total loss of alcA transcription. This is also true in the case of target c which contains three sites and has a double overlapping organization with direct sites (c 1 -c 2) and two possible invert repeats (c 2 -c 3 andc 1 -c 3). In fact, the direct repeat sites (c 1 -c 2) contribute predominantly to target c functionality. However, the inverted repeat couple (c 2 -c 3), in which the spacing is important (16 nucleotides), also have a substantial activity when the upstream site c 1 is destroyed. In that case, there is an alternative utilization of the couplec 2 -c 3 as was shown for another transactivator of A. nidulans, AreA, which could utilize alternative GATA-binding sites in the areA promoter region (30Langdon T. Sheerins A. Ravagnani A. Gielkens M. Caddick M.X. Arst Jr., H.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our results rule out completely in vivoutilization of AlcR single sites.These results are not in favor of the dimerization of AlcR in the presence of properly spaced DNA sites. This was described for the zinc finger protein ADR1 (31Cheng C. Kacherovsky N. Dombek K.M. Camier S. Thukral S.K. Rhim E. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3842-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and more recently for the zinc cluster protein HAP1 whose cooperative interaction with the DNA stabilizes dimer binding (32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A number of nuclear receptors are also monomeric in solution but bind as heterodimers, with strong cooperativity, to their cognate targets. This asymmetric dimerization interface provides the molecular basis for receptor heterodimers spacer discrimination for binding to asymmetrical half-sites (33Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar).Therefore to explain the necessity of two AlcR-binding sites, the involvement of another element should be hypothesized. Another nonexclusive and relevant model, other than the cooperative DNA-binding of a dimer activator to its cognate targets, that could explain synergistic transactivation, is the multiple contact model. This model was proposed by Lin et al. (34Lin Y.-S. Carey M. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 345: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and Carey et al. (35Carey M. Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and suggests that synergism is a manifestation of multiple contacts between activators and the general transcription machinery. Multiply bound copies of a single activator could contact a common target interacting with the transcriptional apparatus. In eukaryote cells, some TATA-binding protein-associated factors function as coactivators which mediate synergistic activation by multiple activators (reviewed in Refs. 36Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 37Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 38Kaiser K. Meisterernst M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 342-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, while some of the data seem to support the multiple contact model, there is evidence supporting the cooperative DNA-binding model and discrepancies appear between results for the same GAL4 activator which are not understood (for example, see Refs. 24Xu H.E. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7677-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and 34Lin Y.-S. Carey M. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 345: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is interesting to point out that the AlcR unit for in vitro binding is a single site, whereas the in vivo functional unit is a repeat even when the spacing between the sites is 16 base pairs as forc 2 -c 3. In addition, AlcR discriminates in vitro between these sites with the same consensus sequence, since with c 1 andc 3, for example, no AlcR binding is observed even when the c 2 site is mutated (Fig. 4). It is possible that parts of the AlcR protein missing in our in vitro experiments are necessary for the binding to those sites. This hypothesis has been eliminated by results obtained after a complete mutagenesis of the AlcR site flanking regions to the consensus core.2 Another line of evidence against this idea is that inverted repeats both bind AlcR molecules, suggesting that the remainder of AlcR is not necessary in this case. The hypothesis of a steric hindrance preventing AlcR binding in vitro to the second site of direct repeats, has been also ruled out by site-directed mutagenesis experiments.2 In both crystallographic studies of GAL4 and PPR1-DNA complexes it has been pointed out that other factors could possibility interact with the proteins (39Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 40Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In PPR1, there is a cavity near the DNA-binding site which has been suggested to be a binding site for another component of the transcription machinery or a site of contact from another region of PPR1 (40Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure of the AlcR-DNA complex is under study and we do not know yet if such a cavity exists also in AlcR. The interaction of another protein with AlcR contacting the transcriptional machinery could account for both in vitro binding experiments and physiological results. The recently identified ethanol regulon in Aspergillus nidulans, localized to chromosome VII (1Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), comprises the structural gene alcA, encoding alcohol dehydrogenase I (2Gwynne D.I. Buxton F.P. Sibley S. Davies R.W. Lockington R.A. Scazzocchio C. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 51: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the positive acting regulatory gene alcR (3Pateman J.H. Doy C.H. Olson J.E. Norris U. Creaser E.H. Hynes M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 217: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and at least five new identified alc genes (alcU,alcS, alcM, alcO, alcP), whose functions are unknown (1Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The second structural gene necessary for ethanol utilization is aldA encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase, which maps to chromosome VIII (4Pickett M. Gwynne D.I. Buxton F.P. Elliott R. Davies R.W. Lockington R.A. Scazzocchio C. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 51: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All these genes are inducible by the specific activator AlcR in the presence of an exogenous co-inducer (ethanol, the gratuitous inducer ethyl methyl ketone or other alcohols or ketones) (1Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Creaser E.H. Porter R.L. Britt K.A. Pateman J.A. Doy C.H. Biochem.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 73: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the presence of glucose, the alc genes are subject to carbon catabolite repression mediated by the general repressor CreA (8Bailey C. Arst Jr., H.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar,9Dowzer C.E.A. Kelly J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression can be achieved both by direct and independent repression of the trans-acting gene alcR (6Lockington R.A. Scazzocchio C. Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and of other alc genes such as the structural genesalcA and aldA (10Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), alcS, andalcP (1Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both repression and induction are mediated by binding of the regulatory proteins to their cognate targets in thealc promoters (11Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1993; 7: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It was proposed by Mathieu and Felenbok (10Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that the two regulators AlcR and CreA compete for the same region of DNA containing both types of targets. Indeed it is the case for the alcR promoter, in which competition occurs even in non-inducing growth conditions (14Fillinger S. Panozzo C. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The AlcR protein belongs to a subclass of the zinc DNA-binding family containing a zinc binuclear cluster (Zn(II)2Cys6) found in ascomycetes (15Kulmburg P. Prangé T. Mathieu M. Sequeval D. Scazzocchio C. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Sequeval D. Felenbok B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with novel features. Previous work has identified two different types of specific targets, direct and inverted repeats with the same consensus core, 5′-CCGCA-3′, separated by DNA of various lengths. Recently the consensus has been extended to 5′-CCGC(A/T)-3′ (17Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the positively autoregulated alcR gene, both direct and inverted repeat targets are closely linked (11Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the alcApromoter, three AlcR targets have been identified by gel retardation assays as well as enzymatic and chemical footprint methods. They are located within a short region of 150 base pairs very close to the transcription start (see Fig. 1). One palindrome is flanked by two tandem repeats (12Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous experiments, we have shown by deleting the two AlcR repeated binding sites in the alcR promoter and two out of three AlcR-binding sites in the alcA promoter, that the AlcR consensus sequence should be functional in A. nidulans (11Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the deletion included both direct and inverted repeats. The alcA promoter is one of the strongest inducible promoters in A. nidulans. It is the most widely used for overexpressing proteins in A. nidulans and other filamentous fungi both for fundamental research and applied aspects in biotechnology (reviewed in Ref. 18Felenbok B. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore one intriguing question is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the strong alcAtranscriptional activation in comparison to promoters of the otheralc genes. In contrast to other proteins of the zinc binuclear cluster family, the AlcR zinc-binding domain is able to bind to a single consensus sitein vitro (17Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore it was important to determine if a single copy site was sufficient to induce transcription. Here we present evidence that two sites, either in direct or inverted orientation, are necessary for full transcriptional activation. We also show that they act synergistically but not as the result of the cooperative binding of AlcR to multiple DNA sites. In addition, we show a strong effect position of the AlcR targets. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have investigated the molecular basis of the high induction level of the alcA gene in A.nidulans. The three AlcR-binding sites, occupying a short 150-base pair region in the alcA promoter are shown to work synergistically to activate alcA transcription. Disruption of the distal AlcR-binding site, a, results in a 70% decrease in alcA expression whereas combined disruption of the two AlcR sites, (a and b), leads to a 95% decrease, resulting in a residual noninducible ADHI activity, sufficient to allow only weak growth on ethanol.This synergism is not explained by cooperative binding of AlcR to the three binding sites, as we observed by in vitro DNA binding experiments. Moreover AlcR was shown to bind to single-site (17Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (results herein). The same AlcR(1:197) apparent affinity was observed upon binding to a palindromic site (b), a direct repeat (a), or a single site (c 2 for example). The absence of cooperativity distinguishes AlcR from GAL4 for which cooperative DNA binding provides an explanation for the synergistic effects observed in vivo (23Giniger E. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl.

The tenascins are a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins with a typical multidomain structure. These proteins are widely encountered in the animal kingdom (1Erickson H.P. Curr.

Four members of the tenascin family have been identified in vertebrates so far: tenascin-C (also called cytotactin), tenascin-R (for restrictin), tenascin-X, and the recently characterized tenascin-Y. Tenascins consist of an amino terminus, which is involved in polymerization into oligomers, a series of epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; bp, base pair(s); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FNIII, fibronectin type III; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.-like repeats, a variable number of fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal globular fibrinogen-like domain (1Erickson H.P.

In contrast to other known tenascins, tenascin-Y harbors a domain containing repeated serine-proline-Xaa motifs, which interrupts the series of FNIII domains (7Hagios C. Koch M. Spring J. Chiquet M.

Different isoforms of tenascin-C, tenascin-R, and tenascin-Y arise from various splicing events in the region coding for FNIII repeats (7Hagios C. Koch M. Spring J. Chiquet M. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J.

Immunogenetics. 1992; 36: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By extending genomic sequences, Bristow et al. (14Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) obtained enough data to predict the modular structure of the tenascin-X protein, which comprises an amino-terminal cysteine-rich region with four heptad repeats, 18.5 EGF-like repeats, at least 29 FNIII repeats, and a fibrinogen-like domain. The carboxyl termini of mouse (15Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), rat (16Burch G.H. Bedolli M.A. McDonough S. Rosenthal S.M. Bristow J. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and pig tenascin-X (17Geffrotin C. Garrido J.J. Tremet L. Vaiman M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have been characterized by cDNA cloning. Northern blot analysis showed that the major species of tenascin-X mRNA was about 13 kb (15Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Geffrotin C. Garrido J.J. Tremet L. Vaiman M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Sakai T. Furukawa Y. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Ikemura T. Matsumoto K.I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2069-2077PubMed Google Scholar). Other, smaller bands were detected, suggesting the possibility of alternative splicing (15Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Tenascin-X is expressed much more widely than tenascin-C or tenascin-R (2Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Hagios C. Schenk S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Most tissues express detectable levels of tenascin-X mRNA, but some fetal tissues (skeletal and heart muscles, dermis, testes, nerves, and digestive tract) express high levels (14Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J.

Biochem. 1995; 231: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which are maintained in the adult tissues (except testes) and are also found in tendons, ligaments, and peripheral nerves (17Geffrotin C. Garrido J.J. Tremet L. Vaiman M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several cell lines of various origins, including normal and transformed fibroblasts, carcinoma, and glioma cells, also express tenascin-X (15Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Sakai T. Furukawa Y. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Ikemura T. Matsumoto K.I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2069-2077PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis indicated that the molecular mass of the tenascin-X monomer is 450–500 kDa (15Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Sakai T. Furukawa Y. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Ikemura T. Matsumoto K.I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2069-2077PubMed Google Scholar). A smaller variant of 220 kDa has been described in cultured fibroblasts (18Sakai T. Furukawa Y. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Nakamura M. Kitagawa S. Ikemura T. Matsumoto K.I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2069-2077PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the function of tenascin-X, but indirect evidence suggests that it is vital. Numerous mutations in the gene coding for steroid 21-hydroxylase, which cause adrenal hyperplasia, are observed in humans. The fact that none of these deletions extends to the region coding for tenascin-X suggests that this protein has an essential function (11Morel Y. Bristow J. Gitelman S.E. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6582-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The pattern of tenascin-X expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and limbs during development is consistent with this hypothesis (16Burch G.H. Bedolli M.A. McDonough S. Rosenthal S.M. Bristow J. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we characterized flexilin, a bovine extracellular matrix glycoprotein (19Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Boutillon M.M. Garrone R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This high molecular mass molecule, which appears to be a flexible monomer, is located on collagen fibrils. To characterize flexilin further, specific antibodies were used to screen a fetal calf skin expression library. We report here the complete cDNA structure of flexilin. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the overall domain organization of flexilin is similar to that of tenascins and that it corresponds to the bovine orthologue of human tenascin-X. Thirty FNIII repeats were found in the bovine cDNA, some of which were unusually long (up to 134 amino acids), compared with typical FNIII repeats identified previously (90–100 amino acids). These results, biochemical, cell attachment, rotary shadowing data, and immunofluorescence localizations of flexilin are discussed in relation to the available data on tenascin-X. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were produced according to previously described procedures (20Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Garrone R. van der Rest M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 92-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After immunization with a complex antigenic mixture (containing flexilin and types XII and XIV collagens) and immunofluorescence screening, nine monoclonal antibodies specific for flexilin were selected. They were characterized by comparing their properties with those of the 4E7 clone, which was described previously (19Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Boutillon M.M. Garrone R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), by tests that included enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting against purified flexilin, and immunofluorescence assays in various organs. The 8F2 clone was chosen for this study. Polyclonal antisera were obtained by immunizing mice with three injections (10 μg each) of immunopurified flexilin. Skin from fetal calf (18 weeks old) was dissected, frozen, and powdered in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared with RNA-B™ (Bioprobe Systems), and poly(A)-rich RNAs were selected by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose. A cDNA library was prepared from 5 μg of poly(A)-rich RNA, using random hexamer primers and reagents from a cDNA synthesis kit and a λMOSElox cloning kit (Amersham Corp.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. This expression cDNA library was screened initially with monoclonal antibodies 8F2 and 4E7. About 200,000 recombinant λMOSElox clones were plated with Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 and grown for 6 h at 37 °C. Nitrocellulose filters (Hybond C, Amersham), which had previously been treated with 10 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, were placed on the plates and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The filters were washed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl (Tris-buffered saline) and submitted to the immunodetection procedure using alkaline phosphatase conjugate, as described previously for Western blotting (19Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Boutillon M.M. Garrone R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Three antibody-positive cDNA clones (Flex-1, Flex-2, and Flex-3; Fig. 1) were selected and screened again once or twice with the same monoclonal antibodies. Purified clones were further tested with a polyclonal antibody (see above). Insert cDNAs of the three clones were therefore used to screen the same cDNA library under highly stringent conditions, as described previously (21Exposito J.-Y. Ouazana R. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). From 150,000 plaque-forming units, 25 positive clones were purified; four of them (Flex-11–Flex-13) are presented in Fig. 1. To avoid the purification and characterization of numerous cDNAs, an oligonucleotide strategy was preferred. For this purpose, 5′- and 3′-specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 1) were used to screen the skin cDNA library, using 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides by standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, duplicate filters were probed at 50 °C for 2 h in hybridization buffer containing 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, 6 × SSC (1 × SSC is 15 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm NaCl), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 × Denhardt's solution (0.02% each of polyvinylpyrrolidone, Ficoll, and bovine serum albumin), and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed twice in 3 × SSC and 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate at room temperature for 15 min and then with 6 × SSC and 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate at 50 °C for 15 min. Three successive oligonucleotide screenings were performed, and five cDNA clones (Flex-21–Flex-23, Flex-31, and Flex-41; see Fig. 1) were obtained. None of the cDNA clones extended upstream of Flex-21. With the previously isolated clones, 9253 base pairs of sequence, including the 3′-untranslated region, were obtained. The available data predicted that flexilin is the bovine orthologue of human tenascin-X. To extend the sequence in the 5′ direction, human genomic data were used to generate two genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments. The human genomic regions that were amplified corresponded to nucleotides 122–452 and 3353–3574 of the human tenascin-X gene (numbering from Bristow et al., Ref. 14Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), which code for the domain responsible for the oligomerization and the furthest amino-terminal FNIII repeat of human tenascin-X, respectively. The amplified fragments were cloned, sequenced, and used as a probe to screen 400,000 plaque-forming units under moderately stringent conditions, as described previously (21Exposito J.-Y. Ouazana R. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two positive clones, TX-1 and TX-2, were isolated (Fig. 1). The last two gaps between clones TX-1–TX-2 and TX-2–Flex-21 were filled up by the reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR strategy. First-strand cDNA of poly(A)-rich RNA was synthesized using Expand™ RT (Boehringer Mannheim) and random hexamer primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNAs were used for PCR with Long Expand™ Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). For the first gap, between clones TX-1 and TX-2, two primers were used to generate the PCR-1 clone (Fig. 1): PCR-1, forward (5′-GGACTGCGGTACGCGTGCCTGCCCTGGCGA-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 1652–1681; and PCR-1, reverse (5′-GCAGTCCTCACCCTCGTAGCCGTCGTC-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 1910–1937. For the second gap, between clones TX-2 and Flex-21, two primer pairs with a common 5′-oligonucleotide were used to generate clones PCR-2 and PCR-3 (Fig. 1). The primers are: PCR-2 and -3, forward (5′-CCAGCCTGACACCTTTACCCACTTCCAGC-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 3131–3159; PCR-2, reverse (5′-TTGCGGCCGACGTCCAGGTTGGAGATGAGG-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 3524–3553; and PCR-3, reverse (5′-AGAGCCCTGGGCCACCGTCC-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 4021–4040. PCR was performed in the reaction mixture described in the Boehringer Mannheim protocol. Initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min was followed by 30 PCR cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 61 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 45 s and an additional elongation time of 20 s/cycle for the last 20 cycles. After a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min, the PCR products were purified from agarose gels, cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene), and sequenced. To obtain information about human sequences coding for the FNIII motifs VII to IX (numbering from Bristow et al., Ref. 14Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), RT-PCR experiment was carried out as above using poly(A)-rich RNAs purified from MG63 cells. The RT-PCR product coded for amino acids 1284–1350 of the human tenascin-X (14Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Using the poly(A)-rich RNAs, a MG63 cDNA library was prepared in the λMOSElox cloning kit (see above) and screened with the RT-PCR product. This allowed the purification of one cDNA clone (HFX1). For genomic analyses, PCR experiment was performed using human genomic DNA (Promega). The amplified human genomic region corresponds to nucleotides 6486–6797 of the human tenascin-X gene (numbering from Bristow et al., Ref.14Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed with the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure on double-stranded DNA. Both DNA strands were sequenced using universal primers and synthetic oligonucleotides (Isoprim, Toulouse, France) corresponding to the appropriate cDNA sequences. For G- and C-rich regions, the sequencing reactions were carried out with dITP, an analogue of dGTP. The DNA sequences were analyzed by the DNAid computer program (23Dardel F. Bensoussan P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 483-486PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple alignments and identity studies were performed via the IBCP site server 2The IBCP site server is accessible via the World Wide Web (http://www.ibcp.fr). with the Antheprot (24Deléage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar) and Multalin (25Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar) programs. Northern blotting was performed as described elsewhere (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose, 0.66 m formaldehyde gel. The gel was soaked in 50 mm NaOH and 10 mmNaCl for 20 min and neutralized twice in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 20 min. The RNAs were transferred overnight onto nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham). The filters were hybridized with a32P-labeled cDNA probe (5′ PstI fragment of clone Flex-12) overnight at 65 °C in 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The final washing was done in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The 0.28–6.58-kb RNA ladder from Promega was used as a size marker. Flexilin was extracted from bovine fetal skin with 0.5 m NaCl in the presence of proteases inhibitors and immunopurified on a column prepared with the 8F2 antibody. The purification procedures, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), immunoblotting, rotary shadowing, and immunofluorescence were performed as described previously (19Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Boutillon M.M. Garrone R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The osteosarcoma cell line MG63 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Adhesion substrates were prepared by adding 50 μl of immunopurified bovine tenascin-X (at 5 μg/ml) to 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. Cell suspension was obtained by a brief treatment of the cell layer with 0.25% trypsin and 0.05% EDTA, centrifugation with medium containing 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and resuspension in DMEM without serum. To perform the adhesion, 100 μl of cell suspension was added to each well and left for 50 min at 37 °C. For inhibition studies, cells were suspended with DMEM containing synthetic peptides, GRGDS as inhibitor, or SDGRG as control (Sigma). Incubation with peptides was performed for 10 min at room temperature before adding cell suspension to the wells. Non-adherent cells were removed and adherent cells submitted to fixative treatment using the buoyancy method (26Goodwin A.E. Pauli B.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 187: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Wells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and adherent cells were quantitated by coloration with 0.1% crystal violet, lysis with 0.2% Triton, and reading absorbance at 570 nm on a MR5000 spectrophotometer (Dynatech). Three wells were averaged for each point tested, and the standard deviation of the three points was above 10% of the mean. For morphological studies of adherent cells, eight chamber culture slides (Falcon) were coated with tenascin-X or fibronectin as described above. After blocking, cells were added, left for 50 min at 37 °C, and gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline. After fixation with 2% glutaraldehyde, cells were examined by phase contrast microscopy and photographed. Inhibition studies were performed as described above. Poly(A)+ RNAs extracted from early embryonic calf skin, a flexilin-rich tissue (19Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Boutillon M.M. Garrone R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), were used to construct an expression cDNA library. Screening of this library with monoclonal antibodies specific for flexilin resulted in the detection of three cDNA clones (Flex-1, Flex-2, and Flex-3; Fig. 1), which were also immunoreactive with polyclonal anti-flexilin serum. The 5′ ends of these clones were sequenced according to the expression vector. The sequence NLYGFHDR, previously obtained by amino acid sequencing of flexilin tryptic peptides (19Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Boutillon M.M. Garrone R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was identified in two of these cDNA clones (Flex-1 and Flex-2; Fig. 2). Moreover, complete characterization of the three immunoreactive clones shows that none of them overlap. Analysis of their sequences reveals that they potentially code for FNIII repeats, the highest score being shared with the central FNIII repeats of human tenascin-X (14Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Owing to large gaps between the bovine and human sequences, the percentage of identity could not be determined precisely. Multiple screenings of the cDNA library with specific cDNA and oligonucleotide probes (see “Experimental Procedures”), allowed us to purify eight new clones (Flex-11–Flex-13, Flex-21–Flex-23, Flex-31, and Flex-41; Fig. 1). These overlapping cDNA clones cover 9253 bp, with an open reading frame of 3045 codons ended by a stop codon TAG, and 113 bp of 3′-untranslated region. The open reading frame could be divided into two parts (Fig. 1), comprising a succession of 27 FNIII repeats and a fibrinogen-like carboxyl-terminal motif. The last FNIII repeats (numbered 26–29, Fig. 1) and the fibrinogen-like motif share more than 80% of identity with comparable domains of human, mouse, and pig tenascin-X (14Bristow J. Tee M.K. Gitelman S.E. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J.

Moreover, the 3′ end of flexilin cDNA is 100% identical to the 3′ end of the bovine cytochrome P450c21 gene (data not shown; Ref. 28Chung B.-C. Matteson K.J. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4243-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The same overlap was identified in human, rodents, and pig genes (11Morel Y. Bristow J. Gitelman S.E. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6582-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Matsumoto K. Saga Y. Ikemura T. Sakakura T. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J.

Taken together, these findings indicate that bovine flexilin and human tenascin-X are orthologous proteins. Since even extensive screening was insufficient to obtain the full cDNA sequence, PCR products coding for either the amino terminus or the furthest amino-terminal FNIII repeats of human tenascin-X were generated and used to screen our cDNA library again. With this procedure, we obtained two clones, TX1 and TX2 (Fig. 1). The two last gaps, of 69 and 135 bp, were filled by sequence analysis of RT-PCR products. The complete cDNA sequence is 12,706 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 4135 codons. The deduced amino acid sequence is presented in Fig. 2. The 5′-untranslated region (185 bp long) is comparable to the counterpart sequence of the major mRNA of human tenascin-X (29Speek M. Barry F. Miller W.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of total RNAs from fetal skin showed that bovine tenascin-X transcript is about 13 kb (Fig. 1). Bovine tenascin-X harbors a typical tenascin structure, which is presented in Figs. 1 and 2. The first 22 amino acids may correspond to a typical signal peptide (30von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Thus, the predicted molecular size of mature bovine tenascin-X monomer was calculated to be 445 kDa. The signal peptide is followed by a cysteine-rich region (amino acids 23–152). Except for the furthest amino-terminal sequence, this domain is comparable to the region responsible for the trimerization of tenascin-C and tenascin-R monomers and is composed of four heptad repeats flanked by seven cysteine residues. Next is found the carboxyl-terminal half of an EGF-like domain, separated from 18 complete EGF-like domains by a proline- and serine-rich spacer of 15 amino acids (amino acids 153–744). The cysteine residues in these EGF-like repeats are organized in the same way as in other tenascins,i.e. X 4CX 3CX 5CX 4CX 1CX 8C (26Goodwin A.E. Pauli B.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 187: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As in human tenasc"

Using the cloned PAFR and its mutants expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, we showed that activation of PAFR leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, elevation of intracellular calcium concentration, arachidonic acid liberation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. These intracellular effectors differed in their sensitivities to pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment (16Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Sato S. Waga I. Kume K. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), an event further supporting its role in control of cell growth. In the present work, we used NRK cells to examine the effect of PAF on cellular growth. NRK cells are immortalized fibroblasts derived from the kidney of a normal rat. These cells are regarded as a pertinent model of growth and oncogenic transformation as their growth is tightly regulated like that of normal cells (30de Larco J.E. Todaro G.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 94: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). They are contact-inhibited and do not grow in the absence of serum. They do not grow in soft agar either in an anchorage-independent manner. However, they can be reversibly transformed by various growth factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF), and irreversibly transformed by a variety of oncogenes such as v-K-ras and v-src (31Roberts A.B. Anzano M.A. Lamb L.C. Smith J.M. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5339-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). To delineate functions of PAF in cellular growth and transformation, we established NRK cells overexpressing PAFR and examined their response to PAF with respect to growth and transformation. We obtained evidence that this lipid mediator modulates cell growth in a dual manner. PAF stimulated the growth of G0-arrested cells in a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway, while it inhibited the G1 to S transition and the accelerated cell growth of transformed cells through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. NRK cells (clone 49F, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). PAFR expression plasmid was constructed by inserting guinea pig PAFR cDNA into pCXN2 expression vector (32Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar), which contains cytomegalovirus enhancer, β-actin promoter, and β-globin polyadenylation signal for cDNA expression and neomycin resistant gene for selection (29Ishii S. Nagase T. Tashiro F. Ikuta K. Sato S. Waga I. Kume K. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). NRK cells were transfected with pCXN2-PAFR, using a LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Independent colonies were isolated using iron cylinders after selection by 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks, and 60 clones were tested for PAF receptor expression by [3H]WEB 2086 (DuPont) binding, as described (15Ishii S. Matsuda Y. Nakamura M. Waga I. Kume K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in a 6-well culture plate, and incubated with 10 nm [3H]WEB 2086 (521.7 GBq/mmol) at 25 °C for 60 min. Cells were washed 3 times with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 1 ml of 10% Triton X-100, and radioactivity was counted. For the measurement of the nonspecific binding, 1 μm WEB 2086 was added. Clones with high PAFR expression designated as NP3 and NP5 were used. PAF (C16) and methylcarbamyl-PAF (C-PAF) (C16) were purchased from Cayman Chemical, and EGF (mouse) was from Takara (Japan). WEB 2086 and BN50730 were generous gifts from Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany) and Dr. Nicholas Bazan (Louisiana State University), respectively. For the generation of oncogene-transformants, cells were transfected with a retroviral vector carrying v-K-ras or v-src, as described (33Masuda A. Kizaka K.S. Miwatani H. Terada Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. New Biol. 1992; 4: 489-503PubMed Google Scholar), and transformed foci were isolated. For Northern blot analysis, poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) prepared with a QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia Biotech) was separated on 1% agarose gel containing 3% formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane (Paul) by capillary blotting followed by detection with [32P]dCTP-labeled probes, prepared with a Megaprime kit (Amersham). The probes used were human c-fos cDNA (Japan Cancer Research Bank, Japan), rat c-myc and rat cyclin D1 cDNA (gifts from Dr. Y. Terada, Okayama Cell Switching Project, Kyoto, Japan), and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (CLONTECH). For Western blot analyses, total cell lysate (50 μg) prepared in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin-A was separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, then transferred to a Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. The blot was probed with a polyclonal anti-cyclin D1 (PRAD1) antibody (Santa Cruz), using an ECL system (Amersham), and according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rapidly growing cells were trypsinized and seeded in a 96-well microplate (5,000 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% FCS. After a 48-h culture, reagents for examinations were added. After 10 h, [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well, 20 Ci/mmol, DuPont) was added to each well and the preparations were incubated for an additional 8 h. Finally, cells were collected onto a 96-well format filter (Unifilter 96 GF/C, Packard) and washed with distilled water with a FilterMate Harvester and radioactivities were counted with a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard). For growth curve analysis, rapidly growing cells were seeded in a 96-well microplate (500 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% FCS. After the indicated days of culture, the medium was replaced with 150 μl of the medium without phenol red, supplemented with XTT (sodium 3′-[1-(phenylamino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate) and PMS (N-methyl dibenzopyrazine methyl sulfate) reagents (Cell Proliferation Kit II, Boehringer Mannheim). After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, absorbance at 415 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, model 3550). The absorbances obtained according to the manufacturer's protocol proved to be proportional to the cell number, as determined in our preliminary control experiments (data not shown). For coating of plates used in the anchorage-independent growth assay, 50 μl of 5 mg/ml poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) (Sigma) in 95% ethanol was placed on a 96-well plate, dried overnight at 37 °C, and used as described (34Fukazawa H. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For soft agar assay, 1 × 104 cells were plated in 3 ml of growth media containing 0.33% Noble agar overlaid on 2 ml of pre-fixed bottom agar containing 0.5% agar in a 6-cm dish. Cell cycle analysis using a flow cytometry was performed using a fluorescence-activated cell analyzer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson), as described (35Kume K. Jinno S. Miwatani H. Kizaka K.S. Terada Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. New Biol. 1992; 4: 504-511PubMed Google Scholar). NRK-49F cells were transfected with pCXN2-PAFR, and two clones with high PAFR expression, designated NP3 and NP5, were obtained, as described under “Materials and Methods.” These two clones possess 5.4 × 105 and 4.3 × 105 [3H]WEB 2086-binding sites per cell, respectively (the wild type NRK cells have less than 2 × 103 sites). These numbers are higher than that (2.8 × 104/cell) reported for rat peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (36Hwang S.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 196: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The growth rate and morphology of both NP3 and NP5 cells were not distinguishable from that of the wild type cells. Both clones showed a contact inhibition comparable to the wild type when they reached confluency in culture dishes, and the final cell densities of both clones did not differ significantly from that of the wild type. Both clones, but not wild type NRK cells, responded to 1 nmPAF by evidence of elevated intracellular calcium concentrations, as examined using Fura-2 (data not shown). As shown in Fig.1, c-fos and c-mycmRNAs were induced when NP3 and NP5 cells, preincubated with a low concentration of FCS (0.5%) for 48 h, were stimulated either by PAF or a synthetic PAF agonist, C-PAF. PAF and C-PAF similarly induced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, as demonstrated by the mobility shift of erk1 and erk2 kinases in NP3 and NP5 cells, but not in wild type NRK cells (data not shown). These immediate responses are evidence of the expression of a functional PAFR. Mitogenic responses of PAFR-expressing NP3 and NP5 cells were then examined. The cells were growth arrested at G0 by incubation with 0.5% FCS for 48 h, then various concentrations of PAF were applied. After a 10-h incubation, [3H]thymidine was added and cells were harvested after a further 8-h incubation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, low concentrations (up to 100 nm) of PAF induced a significant mitogenic response. C-PAF, a synthetic PAF analogue and a metabolically stable PAFR agonist, did not induce a growth response, at any concentration used (Fig. 2 B). Because EGF induces mitogenic responses of NRK cells (30de Larco J.E. Todaro G.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 94: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), PAF or C-PAF was simultaneously applied with EGF to search for additive effects. However, as shown in Fig.2 C, PAF completely suppressed the EGF-induced mitogenic response. C-PAF also suppressed this response, and was about a hundred times as effective as PAF (Fig. 2 D). PAF or C-PAF had no apparent effects on wild type NRK cells. When a PAF antagonist, WEB 2086 (10 μm) or BN50730 (1 μm), was added together with PAF or C-PAF, both stimulatory and inhibitory effects disappeared (data not shown), thereby indicating that all these effects were receptor-mediated and not due to nonspecific actions. Because C-PAF is slightly less potent than PAF regarding receptor binding of NP3 cells (data not shown), its metabolic stability might explain the effects different from those of PAF. Since PAF is rapidly inactivated by PAF acetylhydrolase in serum (37Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4223-4230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Miwa M. Miyake T. Yamanaka T. Sugatani J. Suzuki Y. Sakata S. Araki Y. Matsumoto M. J. Clin.

Nature. 1994; 370: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), its effect is relatively transient at low concentrations. Since C-PAF is resistant to enzymatic inactivation by virtue of the methylcarbamyl moiety at itssn-2 position, its half-life is much longer than that of PAF. We therefore attempted to restrict the exposure of cells to C-PAF to a limited period of time by neutralizing it with WEB 2086. In Fig.3, EGF, C-PAF, and WEB 2086 were applied sequentially at designated intervals. The addition of WEB 2086 3 h after C-PAF addition resulted in mitogenic activation (Fig. 3,column 3), an event not observed at any concentrations of C-PAF in the experiments shown in Fig. 2 B. When WEB 2086 was added 6 h after C-PAF addition, this positive mitogenic response was no longer observed (columns 4 and 5). Furthermore, C-PAF induced an additive mitogenic response to EGF, when WEB 2086 was added within 4 h after the addition of C-PAF (columns 8 and 9). Delayed addition of WEB 2086 after 6 h resulted in the manifestation of the inhibitory effect of C-PAF (columns 10–13). The addition of C-PAF 4 h after EGF-stimulation was still inhibitory (column 14), but was not inhibitory after 10 h (column 15). The reversal point from stimulation to inhibition was about 4 h after addition of the growth factor, therefore PAF induced different responses at different phases of the cell cycle. Under the conditions we used, NRK cells began to enter S phase around 8–10 h and the phase completed about 16–18 h after the stimulation, as observed by pulse [3H]thymidine uptake labeling and flow cytometric analyses (35Kume K. Jinno S. Miwatani H. Kizaka K.S. Terada Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. New Biol. 1992; 4: 504-511PubMed Google Scholar). This means that PAF drives G0-arrested cells to proceed through the G1 phase, but arrests them before entry into S phase. It is, therefore, not the concentration of PAF but the phase of the cell cycle that determines the dual response to PAF.Figure 3Restriction of exposure time of the cells to C-PAF by a PAF antagonist WEB 2086. The mitogenic responses of NP3 cells were examined under various conditions when C-PAF (10 nm), PAF antagonist WEB 2086 (1 μm), and EGF (5 ng/ml) were added separately at designated times (indicated in hours). 1, control; 2–4, C-PAF was added at 0 time followed by WEB 2086 with 0–6 h intervals; 5, C-PAF alone; 6, EGF alone; 7–12, EGF and C-PAF were added at 0 time followed by WEB 2086 with 0–10 h intervals;13–15, EGF was added at 0 time followed by C-PAF with 0–10 h intervals. The values are the averages of triplicate cultures and expressed as in Fig. 2. The vertical bars show the standard errors of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because PAFR is shown to couple with at least 2 types of G proteins, PTX-sensitive and -insensitive (16Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Liu B. Nakashima S. Kanoh H. Takano T. Shimizu T. Nozawa Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 882-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we treated NRK cells with PTX. Preincubation with 10 ng/ml PTX for 24 h, which inactivates Gi and Goproteins, abolished the growth stimulatory effects of PAF, but the responses to EGF were not affected (Fig.4). PTX treatment did not influence the inhibitory activity of C-PAF against EGF. Thus PTX-sensitive components, probably Gi, might participate in PAF-induced growth stimulatory responses in NRK cells, while PTX resistant components, probably Gq, function in inhibitory responses. Because only one cell cycle can be monitored by the [3H]thymidine uptake assay, long-term effects of PAF on cellular growth were examined by the XTT assay, as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig.5, B and C, C-PAF had no detectable effects on PAFR expressing cells grown in regular media supplemented with 5% FCS, but did completely block EGF-induced growth acceleration. The inhibitory effects of C-PAF were abolished by the PAF antagonist WEB 2086, and were not observed in wild type cells (Fig. 5 A). We detected no growth stimulatory effects in this assay. We next examined the effect of C-PAF on anchorage-independent growth, using poly-HEMA-coated plates (34Fukazawa H. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NRK cells do not attach to poly-HEMA-coated plates and thus failed to grow (Fig. 5 D, open circle). The addition of EGF promotes growth without anchorage (Fig. 5 D, closed circle). The addition of C-PAF suppressed EGF-induced anchorage-independent growth of NP3 and NP5 cells (Fig. 5,E and F, closed square), but not that of wild type NRK cells (Fig. 5 D, closed square). The addition of C-PAF alone was without effect. We obtained similar results using conventional soft agar methods. C-PAF inhibited EGF-induced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar of PAFR overexpressing cells, but not of NRK cells (data not shown). EGF not only induces mitogenic responses in NRK cells, but also changes growth characteristics from normal to transformed cells (41Shin S. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), resulting in accelerated growth rate, loss of contact inhibition, focus formation, and the potential for anchorage-independent growth. In addition, the EGF signal transduction pathway in NRK cells appears to be a main pathway utilized by oncogenes, including ras andsrc, as EGF-insensitive mutants are not transformed by these oncogenes (33Masuda A. Kizaka K.S. Miwatani H. Terada Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. New Biol. 1992; 4: 489-503PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kume K. Jinno S. Miwatani H. Kizaka K.S. Terada Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. New Biol. 1992; 4: 504-511PubMed Google Scholar). As PAF inhibited the EGF signal, PAF may also inhibit oncogene signals. To further examine this point, we made use of activated oncogenes instead of EGF. NP3, NP5, and wild type NRK cells were transfected with retrovirus carrying either v-K-ras or v-src oncogene. Many foci appeared 4–5 days after transfection, and the cells isolated from the foci showed a phenotypical transformation. There was no difference in the number of foci or the morphology of the transformed cells in NP3, NP5, and NRK cells (data not shown). All the transformed cells showed prominent morphological changes, focus formations, and rapid growth in soft agar. Supplementation of 10 nm C-PAF reversed the shape changes (Fig. 6 A) and strongly inhibited anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 6 B) of the oncogene transformants of NP3 and NP5 cells, but not that of NRK cells. Wild type NRK transformants were insensitive to C-PAF treatment. Naturally-occurring PAF showed similar albeit weaker effects on v-K-ras and v-src transformants (data not shown). Since C-PAF inhibited the EGF-induced mitogenic response at the G1 phase, as shown in Fig. 3, we examined the effect of C-PAF on the cell cycle, using flow cytometry. Rapidly growing v-K-ras and v-src transformants of NP3 cells were treated with 10 nm C-PAF and their cell cycles examined. As shown in Fig. 7, prior to C-PAF treatment, approximately 50% of the cells were in the G1phase. However, after adding C-PAF, nearly 90% of the cells accumulated into the G1 phase within 24 h. These results, together with findings as shown in Fig. 3, indicate that C-PAF inhibits the oncogene-induced transformation phenotype, as well as the effects induced by EGF at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, through a receptor-mediated pathway. Since the inhibition by C-PAF targeted on the G1 to S transition (4–8 h after stimulation), we examined the expression of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) known to play critical roles in this transition (42Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). NP3 cells were growth-arrested by low serum, stimulated by EGF with or without C-PAF, and mRNA and protein were collected at various intervals. Western blots showed that Cdk2 and Cdk4 protein levels were not significantly changed by EGF or C-PAF treatment (data not shown). In contrast, cyclin D1 mRNA and protein accumulated and peaked at 4–6 h after EGF addition (Fig.8, A and B). Simultaneous addition of C-PAF and EGF abolished the accumulation of both mRNA and protein. Similarly, the addition of C-PAF to the rapidly growing ras and src transformants resulted in a rapid decrease in cyclin D1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 8,C and D). The reduction of cyclin D1 protein correlated well with the inhibitory effects of C-PAF. PAF is a phospholipid mediator with versatile biological activities. This mediator is involved in inflammatory processes and in reproductive, nervous, and cardiovascular systems (43Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). While several groups of investigators reported that PAF induces cell growth or differentiation of various types of cells (8Behrens T.W. Goodwin J.S. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1990; 12: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9Bennett S.A. Leite L.C. Birnboim H.C.

Camussi G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 940-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), it was not evident whether these actions might involve the receptor-G-protein system, or nonspecific actions of polar lipids. The present study clearly demonstrated that PAF has dual regulatory effects, growth stimulatory and inhibitory, mediated through the cloned, seven transmembrane spanning PAFR, depending on phases of the cell cycle. PAF induced mitogenic responses in NRK fibroblasts expressing PAFR. The dose-response curves of the stimulatory effect were bell-shaped (Fig.2 A), suggesting that high doses of PAF result in growth inhibitory effects. Because C-PAF, a metabolically stable analogue of PAF, cancelled out these stimulatory and inhibitory effects at all doses used (Fig. 2 B), the bell-shape observed for PAF is not due to the concentration itself, but possibly due to the exposure time of cells to effective doses of PAF. Thus, by restricting the exposure time of cells to C-PAF using the PAF antagonist WEB 2086 (Fig. 3), we found that C-PAF is growth-stimulatory when present only in the first 3 h. The reversal point from stimulation to inhibition was around 4 h after addition of the growth factors (Fig. 3, columns 9 and 10). These observations are interpreted to mean that PAF acts in the opposite direction depending on phase of the cell cycle. As schematically illustrated in Fig.9, PAF may drive G0-arrested cells into the G1 phase, but inhibit cell cycle progression from G1 to S (see below). Under physiological conditions, the growth stimulatory effect might be predominant, since PAF concentrations in vivo are very low, and PAF is rapidly inactivated by the PAF acetylhydrolase present in the serum and cells. We obtained in vivo evidence to support the idea by using transgenic mice overexpressing PAFR. In the skin of transgenic mice, proliferations of keratinocytes and melanocytes was abnormally enhanced and progression to skin tumors with aging sometimes occurred (29Ishii S. Nagase T. Tashiro F. Ikuta K. Sato S. Waga I. Kume K. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). On the other hand, growth inhibitory effects of PAF are also important. PAF inhibited EGF-induced growth acceleration and anchorage independent growth (Fig. 5) and also reversed morphological changes and anchorage-independent growth of oncogene transformants (Fig. 6). These results suggest that PAF inhibited component(s) shared by both EGF and oncogenes. The molecular mechanisms governing these opposite functions of PAF remain elusive. PAF exerts biological functions through both PTX-sensitive and -insensitive G-proteins (16Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PTX-sensitive pathway is responsible for growth stimulatory effects, and PTX-resistant pathway functions for inhibitory effects (Figs. 4 and 9). It is widely recognized that activation of Gi proteins leads to cell growth; a constitutively active mutant Giprotein was found to be oncogenic (46Lyons J. Landis C.A. Harsh G. Vallar L. Grunewald K. Feichtinger H. Duh Q.Y. Clark O.H. Kawasaki E. Bourne H.R. McCormick F. Science. 1990; 249: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The activation of G16, one of the Gq family proteins, was found to be growth inhibitory (47Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with our previous findings, these results suggest that PAFR activates both Gi and Gq, resulting in two opposing effects on cell growth. The downstream cellular components activated in response to these G proteins are not fully defined. However, as for growth inhibitory effects, our data do suggest a role for cyclins. Cyclin D1, also known as PRAD1, is an oncogene isolated from pituitary adenoma cells (48Motokura T. Bloom T. Kim H.G. Juppner H. Ruderman J.V. Kronenberg H.M. Arnold A. Nature. 1991; 350: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar), and is amplified in various types of cancers. Cyclin D1, an activator of Cdk2 and Cdk4, is induced by various growth stimuli or activated oncogenes (49Filmus J. Robles A.I. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3627-3633PubMed Google Scholar), and is suppressed by growth inhibitory factors such as transforming growth factor-β (50Ko T.C. Sheng H.M. Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Beauchamp R.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of cyclin D1 accelerates the cell cycle resulting in cellular transformation (51Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Cdk activator CDC25 and inhibitor INK4 were reported to be transforming and suppressive to transformation, respectively (52Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 53Serrano M. Gomez L.E. DePinho R.A. Beach D. Bar S.D. Science. 1995; 267: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that PAF inhibits the mitogenic response and transformation phenotypes by altering cyclin D1 levels. We entertain the notion that the PAF-PAFR system may possibly be used as a tool to investigate the mechanism of cell growth and oncogenic transformation. PAF or its metabolically-stable analogue which suppresses oncogenic transformation, may even prove to be a new type of anti-tumor drug. We are grateful to Drs. Y. Terada (Okayama project), J.

We have examined the 5′-regulatory sequences that are important for the transcriptional regulation of this gene in T cells. DNase I mapping of genomic DNA identified a hypersensitive element near the transcription initiation site. Fine mapping by in vivo footprinting demonstrated five transcription factor binding sites that are occupied in both resting and activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes; these are tandem CRE motifs, a Sp1 site, an overlapping Egr-1/Sp1 site, and a novel palindromic octamer sequence (POS). The tandem CRE and POS sites are of major functional importance as judged by mutational and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses. These data provide evidence that expression of the human IMPDH type II gene is predominantly regulated by the nuclear factors ATF-2 and an as yet unidentified POS-binding protein. Additional major protein-DNA interactions do not occur within the promoter region after T lymphocyte activation, indicating a requirement for additional protein-protein interactions and/or post-translational modifications of pre-bound transcription factors to account for the observed increase in IMPDH type II gene expression.

IMPDH catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of inosine 5′-monophosphate to xanthosine 5′-monophosphate in the de novo synthesis of guanine deoxy- and ribonucleotides required for DNA and RNA biosynthesis, respectively. Increased IMPDH activity has been correlated with both cellular proliferation and malignant transformation (6Jackson R.C. Weber G. Nature. 1975; 256: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Weber G. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3466-3492PubMed Google Scholar). The IMPDH type II mRNA transcript is the predominant of the two species in most normal cells and tissues and is expressed at significantly increased levels in replicating and neoplastic cells and upon T lymphocyte activation (8Collart F.R.

Natsumeda Y. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 258-261PubMed Google Scholar). The pivotal role that this increase in enzymatic activity and concomitant increase in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis plays in T lymphocyte activation is illustrated by the ability of selective IMPDH inhibitors, such as mycophenolic acid and mizoribine, to abrogate T lymphocyte responses both in vitro and in vivo (12Dayton J.S. Turka L.A. Thompson C.B. Mitchell B.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 671-676PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tricot G.J. Jayaram H.N. Lapis E. Natsumeda Y. Nichols C.R. Kneebone P. Heerema N. Weber G. Hoffman R.

Such inhibitors are in current clinical use as immunosuppressive drugs in the prevention of allograft rejection (19Danovitch G. Deierhoi M. Ferguson R. Linna J. Monroe S. Tomlanovich S.

We have recently shown that the human IMPDH type II gene located on chromosome 3p21.2 → 24.2 (3Glesne D. Collart F. Varkony T. Drabkin H. Huberman E. Genomics. 1993; 16: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) is approximately 5.8 kb in length and consists of 14 exons varying in size from 49 to 207 bp (21Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transcription initiation site was located by primer extension analysis and RNase protection to a position 50 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon. The 5′-flanking region of the type II gene previously identified as containing promoter activity consists of 463 base pairs upstream of and including the translation initiation site. Transfection of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene construct containing this DNA sequence into human peripheral blood T lymphocytes resulted in a significant increase in expression over base line after activation of the cells with phorbol ester and ionomycin, suggesting that it contains the regulatory elements necessary for the activation associated increase in gene expression. In vitro DNase I footprinting analysis using Jurkat T cell nuclear extract identified four protected regions in the promoter that coincided with consensus transcription factor binding sites including AP2, tandem CREs, an overlapping Egr-1/Sp1 site, and an Nm23 motif, but the functional significance of these sites remained a subject of speculation (21Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In view of the important role of IMPDH type II gene expression in both T lymphocyte activation and neoplasia, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms governing the regulation of this gene in the most physiologically relevant system, human primary T lymphocytes. To identify the specific elements required for differential expression at the transcriptional level, we have asked whether differential occupancy of specific transcription factor binding sites occurs in vivo as a consequence of T lymphocyte activation and have further examined the functional significance of these sites. Buffy coats from normal donors were obtained from the American Red Cross (Charlotte, NC), and the mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma). Cells at the interface were removed, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (350 × g, 37 °C), and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Monocytes were depleted by adherence and B lymphocytes by maintaining cells in culture for 3 days prior to stimulation. Flow cytometric analysis of the isolated T lymphocytes with an anti-CD2+ marker revealed a greater than 95% enrichment of CD2+ T cells. Cellular [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA from resting and activated T lymphocytes was determined as a measure of proliferative activity. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes (107 cells/sample) from a single donor were stimulated consecutively with 1 μg/ml PHA (Sigma) and 10 units/ml IL-2 (Sigma) for 48, 24, 3, and 0 h. At time 0 h, the cells were treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated with Tri-Reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH), dissolved in Formazol (MRC), and 5 μg analyzed on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels. The RNA was transferred to ZetaProbe GT membranes (Bio-Rad) using Northern transfer solution (MRC). Membranes were prehybridized and hybridized according to and using the high efficiency hybridization system (MRC) and sequentially probed with random-primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeled full-length IMPDH type II cDNA (provided by Dr. F. Collart, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) and a [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled human 28 S rRNA-specific oligonucleotide (5′-AAAACGATCAGAGTAGTGGTATTTCACCG-3′)(CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). mRNA levels were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) after a 3-day exposure for the IMPDH type II probe and a 4.5-h exposure for the 28 S rRNA probe. IMPDH type II mRNA levels were normalized for 28 S rRNA loading, and the values were plotted on a logarithmic scale. The locations of DNase I-hypersensitive sites were mapped according to the method of Wu (22Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei from 108 Jurkat T E6–1 cells (23Weiss A. Wiskocil R.L. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 123-128PubMed Google Scholar) were swollen on ice for 5 min by incubation in 50 ml of hypotonic reticulocyte standard buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), isolated by centrifugation (500 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), and subsequently lysed (4 °C, 5 min) in 25 ml of reticulocyte standard buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (500 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), resuspended in 0.5 ml of DNase I digestion buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2), and digested with various concentrations of DNase I (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 2 μg/ml) (Worthington) for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with the addition of freshly prepared proteinase K (10 mg/ml) (Sigma) in stop solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 600 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, the DNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, once with chloroform and subsequently precipitated with isopropyl alcohol in the presence of 2.5 mNH4OAc. The DNA (15 μg) was digested overnight withSacI and separated on a 1% agarose gel. The gel was denatured in 0.5 m NaOH for 1 h, neutralized in 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 m NaCl for 1 h, and transferred overnight onto ZetaProbe GT membrane (Bio-Rad). The blots were prehybridized (50% formamide, 0.12 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, 0.25 m NaCl, 7% SDS) for 1 h at 42 °C and hybridized overnight in high efficiency hybridization system (MRC) with [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled probes obtained by PCR of exon 5 (forward primer, 5′-TTCATCACAGACCCTGTGGTCCTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCAAGAAACAGTCATGTTCCTCCT-3′) and exons 6 and 7 (forward primer, 5′-AAGACTTGGTGGTAGCCCCTGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACTTGTCATCCTCATGAGTGCC-3′), washed, and autoradiographed for 4 and 2 days, respectively. In vivo methylation and isolation of DNA from T lymphocytes and Jurkat T E6–1 cells were performed as described previously (24Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood T lymphocytes were cultured in the absence or presence of PHA-L (6 μg/ml) and IL-2 (10 units/ml) for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Jurkat E6–1 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of PMA (10 ng/ml) for 3 h. IL-2 receptor expression in resting and activated T lymphocytes was determined by flow cytometry using the CD25 antibody M-A251 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Cells (108) were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI 1640, and methylated using 1 μl/ml dimethyl sulfate for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold PBS containing 60 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The cells were recovered by centrifugation (900 × g, 4 °C, 2 min), washed in PBS/Tris, and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 500 μg/ml proteinase K) for 4 h at room temperature. Genomic DNA was extracted by the addition of 1 ml of phenol followed by an equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The aqueous phase was removed and extracted with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. The DNA was spooled in the presence of110 volume of 3 m NaOAc and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mmEDTA, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and digested with 100 units ofHindIII restriction enzyme for 4 h at 37 °C. Digests stored overnight (4 °C) were extracted as described above, resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, and stored at 4 °C. Control DNA was methylatedin vitro with 1 μl of dimethyl sulfate for 15 s. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1.5 mNaOAc, pH 7, 1 m β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml tRNA, and the DNA was precipitated with 750 μl of ethanol. Piperidine diluted 1:10 (200 μl) was added to the pellet, and the samples were incubated at 90 °C for 30 min, frozen, and lyophilized. Two additional lyophilizations were performed from 100 and 50 μl of distilled H2O volumes, respectively, and the DNA was diluted to 1.5 μg/μl in distilled H2O. The ligation-mediated PCR was performed as described previously (25Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) with modifications (26Wright K.L. Ting J.P.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7601-7605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two primer sets were used to encompass the IMPDH type II 5′-flanking region (bp −267 to −14) upper strand: P1(−333), 5′-TTTTGGGGAGGAGCCCG-3′ (T m = 60 °C); P2(−318), 5′-CGGCGGGACAGTAGAAGTAAACCCTTGC-3′ (T m = 65 °C); P3(−318), 5′-CGGCGGGACAGTAGAAGTAAACCCTTGCCTG-3′ (T m = 67 °C), and lower strand: P1(83), 5′-TCTCCGCAGTTGAAGAGC-3′ (T m = 58 °C); P2(29), 5′-GTGCCCCCACTAATCAGGTAGTCGGC-3′ (T m = 65 °C); P3(29), 5′-GTGCCCCCACTAATCAGGTAGTCGGCCATG-3′ (T m = 67 °C). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter constructs (10 μg) were transfected into 107 exponentially growing Jurkat T E6-1 cells. Promoter-deletion CAT constructs were transfected in equimolar ratios adjusted for promoter insert size. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO2. Electroporations were performed at room temperature in the presence of RPMI 1640 lacking Ca2+ using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with settings at 250 V/960 microfarads. The transfected cells were cultured for 48 h, harvested, washed three times with PBS, resuspended in 150 μl of 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and extracted with three cycles of freeze-thawing. Aliquots were heated to 60 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were assayed with 0.1 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol and 25 μg of n-butyryl coenzyme A for 2 h, extracted with xylenes according to the Promega CAT Enzyme Assay System (Madison, WI), and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were determined with the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce). Nuclear extracts from control and PMA (10 ng/ml)-treated Jurkat T E6–1 cells and peripheral blood T lymphocytes cultured in the absence or presence of PHA-L (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) and IL-2 (10 units/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively, were prepared according to the method of Dignamet al.

Cells were washed twice with 50 ml of PBS and resuspended in 5 pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF), incubated for 5 min, homogenized with a B pestle in a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 s. The nuclei were resuspended in 1 pellet volume of buffer C (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mmspermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 20% glycerol), the NaCl concentration adjusted to 0.4 m, the nuclei agitated for 20 min, and the nuclear extract subsequently obtained by pelleting the nuclei at 30,000 × g for 60 min. Control Jurkat T cell nuclear extract was subsequently dialyzed 2 × 90 min in buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 17% glycerol). The extracts were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Wild-type and mutant double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides and either labeled by fill-in using Klenow DNA polymerase or kinasing using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were purified on 1 ml of Sephadex G-50 (Sigma) columns. The flow-through was precipitated with 110 volume of 3 m NaOAc and 3 volumes of ethanol, washed with 95% ethanol, and resuspended at 20,000 cpm/μl. For competition experiments, unlabeled wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides were prepared by using unlabeled deoxynucleotides for fill-in and precipitated as described above. One μl of probe (approximately 0.1 ng of DNA) was incubated with 8 μg of nuclear extract in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). Reactions were preincubated on ice for 10 min in the presence of competitor or 30–60 min in the presence of antibodies. Probe was added to the mixture, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on native 4% polyacrylamide (30:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 0.5 × Tris/borate/EDTA minigels at 100 V, dried, and autoradiographed. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) supershift experiments were performed with 1 μg of each antibody as follows: the ATF-1 antibody (sc-270X) that cross-reacts with CREB-1 and CREM-1, and the specific antibodies ATF-1 (sc-241X), ATF-2 (sc-187X), CREB-1 (sc-186X), CREM-1 (sc-440X), Sp1 (sc-59X), and Egr-1 (sc-110X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Promoter fragments were subcloned into the Klenow DNA polymerase filled-in HindIII site of pCATBasic unless stated otherwise. A 466-bp construct containing the 5′-flanking region extending from an EcoRI to anNcoI site at the ATG initiation codon in the first exon (bp −463 to +3) was obtained by isolating the region from pGEM466 (21Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using the multiple cloning region (MCR)HindIII/XbaI sites and subcloning the fragment into the identical sites of pCATBasic. To remove the translation initiation codon, a 461-bp promoter fragment was released by aHindIII/MscI digest, the insertHindIII site filled in, and the fragment subcloned into pCATBasic in the 5′ → 3′ orientation (pCATBasic461). A pCATBasic1027 promoter construct was obtained by cloning a 1029-bp NcoI 5′ fragment containing the translation initiation site into pCATBasic in 5′ → 3′ orientation and removing the translation initiation site by replacing the 3′ region with the SphI fragment (bp −199 to MCR) obtained from pCATBasic461. The SphI fragment was subcloned into the pCATBasic MCR SphI in 5′ → 3′ orientation to obtain pCATBasic197. The SphI fragment was digested with NlaIV (bp −143), treated with mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and the 3′ region subcloned into pCATBasic to yield the 5′ → 3′ construct pCATBasic141. The constructs were sequenced, and the amount of transfected DNA was normalized for promoter insert size. Transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region were mutagenized according to the method of Jones et al. (29Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 62-66PubMed Google Scholar). Primary and secondary PCR reactions were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The template for the site-directed mutagenesis consisted of the 4.8-kb genomic clone contained in pGEM7Zf(+) (21Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The 22-bp forward primer 5′-TGGGCTGACAGACTTTGCTGAC-3′ annealing to position −716 to −695 bp and the 26-bp reverse complementary primer 5′-GTTGAAGAGCTGCTGTGCTGTGAGTC-3′ annealing to position +49 to +75 bp relative to the translation initiation site were used as the flanking primers for the PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Sequences of oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis are shown in Table I. The mutated 461-bp promoter fragments were released with anEcoRI/MscI digest, filled-in with Klenow DNA polymerase, gel-purified, subcloned into the filled-inHindIII site of pCATBasic, and sequenced. A promoter construct containing both CRE site mutations was generated and assayed in transient transfection assays. This double mutation resulted in a single cytosine-bp deletion in the CRE(B) site.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis and gel mobility shift assaysWild-typeMutantPOS5′-TGTGCTATACGCATGCGCTGTTTCTTCAGC-3′5′-CCACTATGTGCTATACACATACACTGTTTCTTCAGCGCC-3′Egr-1/Sp15′-GCCAGCTCCGCCCCCGCCGCAGCGAG-3′5′-CAGCGCCAGCTCCAACCCAACCGCAGCGAGGCG-3′CRE(B)5′-ACTACGCCCTGACGTCAGCGTCGCGC-3′5′-CACTACGCCCTGAATTCAGCGTCGCGCG-3′CRE(A)5′-CGCAGCGCAGTGACGAAATCGGCTGG-3′5′-CGCAGCGCAGTGAATAAATCGGCTGGTTTATATTGG-3′AML15′-GGTCTCTGCGGCGCGGTCCTCGGAGACA-3′5′-GAGGTCTCTGCGGCGCAATCCTCGGAGACACGC-3′Mutated bases are shown in bold, and transcription factor binding sites are underlined.

To determine whether differential mRNA stability could play a role in the increase in IMPDH type II expression, mRNA levels were quantitated in resting and activated T lymphocytes following actinomycin D treatment. IMPDH type II mRNA levels increased in a time-dependent fashion upon T lymphocyte stimulation with PHA and IL-2 (Fig.1 A). Levels increased 2-, 19-, and 15-fold over those in unstimulated T lymphocytes after 3, 24, and 48 h of stimulation, respectively, in the absence of actinomycin D (time 0 h). The rate of decrease in IMPDH type II mRNA after actinomycin D treatment was similar in resting and activated T lymphocytes with t½ values of 6, 4.5, 5, and 5 h at 0, 3, 24, and 48 h of stimulation, respectively (Fig.1 B). The lack of an increase in mRNA stability in activated T lymphocytes confirms our previous studies implicating a primary role for transcriptional regulation in the increased expression of this gene (21Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, in a separate experiment, we quantitated the increase in IMPDH type II mRNA by Northern blot analysis in isolated CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte subpopulations. IMPDH type II mRNA levels increased 11-fold in CD4 and 5-fold in CD8 cells after 24 h, indicating up-regulation of gene expression on activation of both lymphocyte populations (data not shown). To define cis-acting regulatory regions in the IMPDH type II gene, the chromatin structure of the gene and surrounding regions encompassing approximately 11 kb were mapped for sites that are hypersensitive to digestion with DNase I (Fig.2 A). An exon 5 probe corresponding to the 3′ end of a 4.8-kb SacI genomic fragment revealed a DNase I-hypersensitive element (I) that localizes to the 5′-flanking region of the IMPDH type II gene previously demonstrated to contain promoter activity and a cluster of potential transcription factor binding motifs that include AP2, CRE, Egr-1, Nm23, and Sp1 (21Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B). An exon 6 probe corresponding to the 5′ end of a 6.4-kb SacI genomic fragment identified a region containing two hypersensitive elements (II and III) approximately 0.5 kb apart and located 2.5 and 3.0 kb 3′ to the end of the coding region (Fig. 2, A and C). Further sequencing of this region demonstrated sequence identities with several cDNA sequences (W01132, D61550, D81230, and N27626) in GenBank. Alignment of these overlapping cDNA fragments with the region 3′ to the IMPDH type II gene identified a 2-kb gene that is oriented tail-to-tail with respect to the IMPDH type II gene and terminates 1 kb 3′ to it. This gene contains 6 exons of 289, 113, 190, 67, 99, and 232 bp with corresponding introns of 80, 120, 161, 107, and 79 bp (Fig. 2 A, shaded boxes). DNase I-hypersensitive sites II and III are located at the 5′ end of this gene, suggesting that they may be involved in its regulation rather than in that of the IMPDH type II gene. Additional GenBank cDNA sequences (N51229, H56404, and H80241) were found to be 100% identical to a 713-bp region extending 5′ from bp −307 relative to the transcription initiation site of the IMPDH type II gene (21Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A, hatched box). Similar sequences were found at the same location upstream of the mouse IMPDH type II coding region. From these data, it appears that the IMPDH type II gene and another unidentified gene 5′ to it are oriented head-to-head to one another, raising the possibility that the intergenic region could serve as a bidirectional promoter for both genes. Indeed, our previous results demonstrated that a 466-bp IMPDH type II promoter CAT construct was active in both the 5′ → 3′ and 3′ → 5′ orientations, with 7-fold less activity with the latter construct (21Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6808-6814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The identity and function of the proteins encoded by the two genes closely flanking the IMPDH type II gene are currently unknown. To define the boundaries of the promoter region and the relevance of the specificcis-acting elements that were previously identified byin vitro footprinting (21Zimmermann A.G. Spychala J.

The functional consequences of the sequential 5′ deletions of the promotor revealed that multiple positive and negative regulatory elements participate in regulating transcription of theMsx-1 gene. Surprisingly, however, the optimal expression of Msx-1 promoter in either NIH3T3 or C2C12 cells required only 165 bp of the upstream sequence to warrant detailed examination of its structure. Therefore, the functional consequences of site-specific deletions and point mutations of the cis-acting elements of the minimalMsx-1 promoter were systematically examined. Concomitantly, potential transcriptional factor(s) interacting with thecis-acting elements of the minimal promoter were also studied by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting. Combined analyses of the minimal promoter by DNase I footprinting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and super shift assays with specific antibodies revealed that 5′-flanking regions from −161 to −154 and from −26 to −13 of the Msx-1 promoter contains an authentic E box (proximal E box), capable of binding a protein immunologically related to the upstream stimulating factor 1 (USF-1) and a GC-rich sequence motif which can bind to Sp1 (proximal Sp1), respectively. Additionally, we observed that the promoter activation was seriously hampered if the proximal E box was removed or mutated, and the promoter activity was eliminated completely if the proximal Sp1 site was similarly altered. Absolute dependence of theMsx-1 minimal promoter on Sp1 could be demonstrated by transient expression assays in the Sp1-deficient Drosophilacell line cotransfected with Msx-1-luciferase and an Sp1 expression vector pPacSp1. The transgenic mice embryos containing −165/106-bp Msx-1 promoter-LacZ DNA in their genomes abundantly expressed β-galactosidase in maxillae and mandibles and in the cellular primordia involved in the formation of the meninges and the bones of the skull. Thus, the truncated murine Msx-1promoter can target expression of a heterologous gene in the craniofacial tissues of transgenic embryos known for high level of expression of the endogenous Msx-1 gene and found to be severely defective in the Msx-1 knock-out mice.

Homeobox (Hox) genes of vertebrates are closely related in sequence and genomic organization to the homeotic genes ofDrosophila. Most vertebrate Hox genes are located in four unique clusters in the genome (e.g. HoxA,HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD complexes), each cluster consisting of about 10 genes; there is striking correlation between the linear order of Hox genes on the chromosome and their regional expression in the developing embryo (1Manak, J. R., and Scott, M. P. (1994)Development (suppl.), 61–71.Google Scholar, 2Carroll S.B. Nature. 1995; 376: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In contrast, the members of the Msx class of hox genes, which also share remarkable homology to the msh gene ofDrosophila, are found physically unlinked in the vertebrate genome (3Holland, P. W. H., Garcia-Fernandez, J., Williams, N. A., and Sidow, A. (1994) Development (suppl.), 125–133.Google Scholar, 4Davidson D. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although Hox genes encode transcription factors, characterized by the presence of a highly conserved 60-amino acid-long helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain, the homeodomain, the downstream genetic targets of their regulation, and the underlying molecular mechanisms of their action are only beginning to be unraveled (5Mann R.S.

In the developing embryo, Hox genes play a central role in positional specification, pattern formation, and organogenesis; it is thought that inductive interactions among the various cell layers, mediated through the action of intercellular ligands with their receptors, and a cascade of signaling events regulate the temporal and spatial expression of Hox genes (4Davidson D.

Defective expression of Msx-1 in the limb bud mesenchyme of chicken mutants limbless and talpid has been reported; apparently the embryos of limbless mutants failed to assemble an active apical ectodermal ridge, and the underlying mesoderm expressed little or no Msx-1 transcripts (33Coelho C.D.

Takahashi T. Guron C. Raghow R. Genomics. 1994; 21: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We carried out a detailed functional analysis of ∼5 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; TSP, transcription start point. of 5′-flanking genomic DNA of Msx-1 with an aim to elucidate the putative cis-acting elements which mediateMsx-1 gene transcription in NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells. We report that a −165/+106-bp minimal Msx-1 promoter, containing sequence motifs capable of interacting with helix-loop-helix proteins (proximal E box) and a ubiquitous transcriptional modulator, Sp1 (proximal Sp1), is sufficiently active in driving the expression of luciferase in cells in culture. Furthermore, our analysis of the bacterial LacZ expression driven by the minimal Msx-1 promoter in transgenic mice suggests that the minimal Msx-1 promoter is exquisitely activated in the structures derived from the interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cell layers during craniofacial morphogenesis. NIH3T3 cells (ATCC, CRL1658) and C2C12 cells (ATCC, CRL1772) were bought from the American Tissue Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD; cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. C2C12 cells are capable of differentiation into multinucleated myotubes when cultivated in DMEM with 0.2% fetal bovine serum. Drosophila Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells, provided by Dr. Carl Wu, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, were grown in the Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone at 25 °C in an incubator without CO2 (44Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar). The Msx-1 promoter-luciferase plasmids for the transfection experiments were constructed by cloning DNA fragments from an Msx-1 genomic clone (43Kuzuoka M. Takahashi T. Guron C. Raghow R. Genomics. 1994; 21: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) into the pGL2-Basic Vector (Promega). A 1.4-kb EcoRI-BamHIMsx-1 genomic DNA fragment was cloned into pBluescript-IISK+ (pBEB) and was used as the source of DNA for all other promoter-luciferase or promoter-LacZ constructs. DNA fragments, prepared either by digestion with restriction enzymes or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with oligonucleotides designed according to the sequence of the genomic DNA and containing desirable restriction sites, were cloned into pGL2-Basic. Thus, −1282/+106-bp promoter was constructed by inserting aHincII-BamHI fragment (HincII was derived from the polylinker of pBluescript, and the BamHI site came from Msx-1 genomic DNA), encompassing 1282 bp upstream and 106 bp downstream of the transcription start site (43Kuzuoka M. Takahashi T. Guron C. Raghow R. Genomics. 1994; 21: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), into the SmaI-BglII sites of pGL2-Basic Vector. PCR-amplified promoter fragments −1168/+106, −1042/+106, −886/+106, −811/+106, −726/+106, −588/+106, −509/+106, −268/+106, or −165/+106 with SstI-BglII termini were cloned into SstI and BglII sites of the pGL2-Basic. The −127/+106-bp promoter was generated by digesting pBEB withKpnI and BamHI and by cloning the DNA fragment into the homologous restriction sites of pGL2-Basic. The promoter fragments −91/+106, −52/+106, −32/+106, +10/+106, and +33/+106 were prepared by PCR and cloned into KpnI-BglII sites of pGL2-basic. Fragments with 5′ or 3′ site deletions, −886/−33, −886/−166, −268/−33, −268/−166, and −165/−33, were created by PCR-based strategy using oligonucleotides withSstI-BamHI ends. The nucleotide sequences of all PCR-amplified DNA fragments inserted in reporter plasmids were verified by the dideoxynucleotide method of DNA sequencing (45Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989–1996Google Scholar). NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells were seeded (105 cells per 35-mm diameter well) in 6-well tissue culture dishes, 1 day prior to transfection. Both cell lines were transfected using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Four μl of LipofectAMINETM and 1 μg of plasmid DNA were diluted individually in 100-μl aliquots of OptiMEMTM I Reduced-Serum Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated with DNA lipid complexes for 5 h and then fed DMEM; 24–30 h after transfection, cells were rinsed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 150 μl of 1 × Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega). Aliquots of cell extracts were mixed with 100 μl of 470 mm luciferin, and light intensity was measured in a Turner Designs Luminometer Model 20. Expression of luciferase in cells transfected with pGL2-Basic Vector, which lacks eukaryotic promoter and enhancer, and the pGL2-Control Vector (Promega), which contains SV40 promoter and enhancer, were used as negative and positive controls, respectively (46Wang Q. Raghow R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 158: 33-42PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with a given construct in triplicate, and expression of the cotransfected pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega) was used to correct for the variable transfection efficiencies. The protein content of cell extracts was quantitated by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Protein Assay System). The luciferase activities were expressed as arbitrary units of light intensity per μg of protein. To examine transactivation of Msx-1 promoter with Sp1, SL-2 cells were cotransfected with Msx-1 promoter-luciferase and Sp1 expression constructs. Twenty-four h before transfection,Drosophila SL-2 cells were transferred to 35-mm well plates at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Msx-1 promoter-luciferase plasmid mixed with 0.05 μg of Sp1 expression vector, pPacSp1 (47Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R.

Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), using 2 μl of Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Parallel aliquots of SL-2 were also cotransfected with Msx-1luciferase constructs mixed with 0.05 μg of pPacSp1 in antisense orientation and were used as negative controls. Luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection as outlined above. Nuclear extracts from NIH3T3 or C2C12 cells were prepared according to Dignam et al. (49Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and as described in detail previously (50Armendariz-Borunda J. Simkevich C.P. Roy N. Raghow R. Kang A.H. Seyer J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), and homogenized. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation and resuspended in low-salt buffer (20 mmHEPES, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The salt concentration of the nuclear suspension was adjusted to 0.3m KCl which released soluble nuclear proteins. Nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation, and the protein extracts were dialyzed against a buffer containing 100 mm KCl. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides (Table I) with 3–4-nucleotide-long 5′ overhangs were annealed and radiolabeled by end-filling with Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, using [α-32P]dCTP. Radiolabeled DNA probes (10,000 cpm/μl) were incubated with nuclear extracts in the presence or absence of competitor oligonucleotides. To each tube, 17 μl of the premixed incubation buffer (Stratagene) and 1 μl of radiolabeled probe were added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with polyclonal antibodies against MyoD, myogenin, c-Myc, Max, USF-1, USF-2, or Sp-1 for 2 h at 4 °C prior to initiation of the binding reaction. The contents of the binding reactions were electrophoresed at 4 °C on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE (135 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 2.5 mm Na2 EDTA, pH 8.9) and fluorographed; we have described EMSA methods in detail previously (50Armendariz-Borunda J.

DNA fragments encompassing −91/+106 bp and −268/+106 bp, cloned intoSstI-BglII sites of pGL2-Basic, were linearized with XmaI and end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and E. coli DNA polymerase. After labeling, DNA polymerase was inactivated by incubation at 75 °C for 15 min. The 3′ end of the insert was cut with HindIII and purified. Nuclear extracts or recombinant human Sp1 (Promega) were incubated with radiolabeled DNA (10,000 cpm). For competition, radiolabeled probes were mixed with 50 ng of Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Stratagene) before initiating binding; the binding reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min on ice and incubated for an additional 2 min at room temperature. After addition of DNase I, the mixture was incubated for exactly 2 min and was combined with 100 μl of a stop solution. The digested probe was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and electrophoresed in 8% polyacrylamide containing 7 m urea, alongside a nucleotide sequence ladder. Msx-1promoter fragment, −886/+106, was cloned intoSstI-BamHI sites of pALTER-1 Vector (Promega), which is resistant to tetracycline (tet) and sensitive to ampicillin (amp). Mutagenic oligonucleotide, Ampr repair oligonucleotide, and TCr knock-out oligonucleotide were annealed to single-stranded DNA templates. M−161/−158, M−22/−19, M−18/−15, and M−14/−11 (Table I) were used as mutagenic oligonucleotides. The complementary DNA strand was synthesized with T4 DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and T4 DNA ligase. BMH71-18mutS cells were transformed with mismatched double-stranded DNA plasmids; E. coli DNA isolated from individual clones was used to transform JM109 cells. Mutated DNAs were sequenced and cloned into SstI-BglII sites of pGL2-Basic and used in transient transfections. The incrementally truncated murineMsx-1 promoter fragments were cloned in front of the LacZ gene in the plasmid pLacF (52Mercer E.H. Hoyle G.W. Kapur R.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Neuron. 1991; 7: 703-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The detailed experimental strategies used to generate transgenic mice which contain the full-length (5.0 kb) or serially truncated variants of Msx-1 promoter-LacZ vectors in their genome will be described elsewhere. The minimal −165/+106-bp Msx-1 promoter DNA fragment containingXbaI recognition termini was ligated in the XbaI site of pLacF (52Mercer E.H. Hoyle G.W. Kapur R.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Neuron. 1991; 7: 703-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The BglII-linearized plasmid DNA was microinjected into fertilized eggs obtained from FVB/NHsd females, and embryos were implanted in the pseudopregnant mice; the transgenic founders were identified by analyzing their tail DNA by Southern hybridization and PCR methods as detailed previously (53Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 1-497Google Scholar). Four independent lines of transgenic founders containing the −165/+106-bpMsx-1-LacZ DNA were studied extensively. Founders were back-crossed, and timed-mated FVB females were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The embryos were partially fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and stained with X-gal at 37 °C overnight (53Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 1-497Google Scholar). The stained embryos were submerged in 70% ethanol, illuminated uniformly by scattered light, and photographed under a dissecting microscope. To assess expression of the endogenousMsx-1 gene, normal FVB/NHsd mouse embryos were obtained at different stages of development and processed for wholemount in situ hybridization by previously published protocols (54Conlon R.A. Herrmann B.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 55Wilkinson D.G.

A 700-bp SstI-EcoRI DNA fragment containing the 5′ half of the Msx-1 cDNA was cloned in pGEM+ vector (Boehringer Mannheim). Antisense or sense RNAs were transcribed by T7 or Sp6 polymerases, respectively, according to the directions provided by the manufacturer. RNA was synthesized to incorporate digoxigenin-UTP and purified. Fixed embryos were subject to wholemount in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled RNAs according to the published protocols"

Substitutions in the proximal virus-responsive element of the interferon-A (IFN-A) promoters contribute to their differential gene expression. The 5′ distal silencing region in the weakly virus-inducible murine IFN-A11 gene has been previously delimited. DNase I footprinting experiments and transient gene expression assays demonstrate identical silencing activity in equivalent regions of the genes for IFN-A11 and IFN-A4 promoters. A minimal 20-mer distal negative regulatory element (DNRE) in both promoters is necessary and sufficient for the silencing and a region in the highly inducible IFN-A4 promoter located between the silencer and the virus-responsive element overrides the silencer activity. Mutations in the central region of the DNRE, causing derepression, also altered the formation of one of the two major DNA-protein complexes. One of these contains a protein related to or identical to the high mobility group I(Y) proteins, while the other complex contains a major protein present in uninduced and virus-induced cells with a molecular mass of 38 kDa, which may be related to the silencer activity. Similar DNREs are present in other virus-uninducible IFN-A promoters, and these data suggest that a common silencer may mediate the transcriptional repression in different genes of this family.

The regulatory sequences that control the transcription of the IFN-A and -B genes are generally located within a 110-base pair region immediately upstream from the transcription site. The cis-elements present in the IFN promoters and their trans-regulator proteins have been extensively studied within the human IFN-B promoter. Analysis of this region has revealed a complex organization of several synergistic overlapping positive (PRDI to -IV) and negative regulatory domains (NRDI and NRDII) (5Goodbourn S. Zinn K.

The IRF-1 (−/−) and IRF-2 (−/−) knockout studies have indicated that, for IFN virus induction, an IRF-1-independent pathway exists, whereas IRF-2 plays a role in the transcriptional shut-off of IFN-B and IFN-A gene transcription (13Matsuyama T.

In the virus-responsive element, −109/−64 of the IFN-A promoters, several proteins bind to this sequence and may be specific IFN-A regulators. An uncharacterized TG protein binds to the virus-responsive element of the human IFN-A1 (2MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Näf D. Gallant P. Goswamy A. Hug H. Büeler H. Chaturvedi M. de la Fuente J. Ruffner H. Meyer F. Weissmann C. Cell. 1990; 60: 767-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Analysis of the murine IFN-A4 gene promoter has delimited the inducible element (IE), −109/−75, that confers both virus inducibility and cell type-specific expression (29Au W.C. Raj N.B.K. Pine R. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). IRF-2 binds to the IE because it contains an IRF-Es (27Génin P. Bragança J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Au W.C. Raj N.B.K. Pine R. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The αF1/B complex binds to the IE (30Au W.C. Su Y. Raj N.B.K. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24032-24040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was suggested to cooperate with IRF-1 for efficient activation. Furthermore, the virus-induced factor (VIF), which also binds to the IE, participates in transcriptional activation of the murine IFN-A4 gene after virus induction (27Génin P. Bragança J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, none of the specific IFN-A factors has yet been isolated.This study concerns the differential expression of two murine IFN-A genes. The IFN-A11 was found to be poorly expressed upon Newcastle disease virus (NDV) induction in L929 cells (31Coulombel C. Vodjdani G. Doly J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 104: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas the IFN-A4 gene is highly induced under the same conditions (25Raj N.B.K. Israeli R. Kellum M. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11149-11157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The repression of the IFN-A11 gene is due in part to a single point substitution in the IE. This substitution inhibits the binding of VIF (27Génin P. Bragança J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, negative regulatory sequences were found in the promoter of the IFN-A11 gene surrounding the IE that suppressed in part its expression (4Civas A. Dion M. Vodjdani G. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4450-4497Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These data suggest that both substitutions in the IE and the presence of negative regulatory regions contribute to the differential expression of IFN-A genes. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated the presence of a silencer E1E2 (−241/−203) region in the IFN-A11 promoter (28Roffet P. Lopez S. Navarro S. Bandu M-T. Coulombel C. Vignal M. Doly J. Vodjdani G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).In this report, we study a corresponding E1E2 region in the highly inducible IFN-A4 promoter, which is protected from nuclease digestion by nuclear extracts. Transient transfection assays in L929 and HeLa cells with both IFN-A11 and -A4 E1E2 elements revealed identical negative regulatory activity within promoter constructs and the presence of a region in the IFN-A4 native promoter that overcame the silencer activity. A minimal distal negative regulatory element (DNRE) within the E1E2 regions in both gene promoters has been delimited by transfection assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) and UV cross-linking, with the DNRE containing an AT-rich region, characterized one of the binding nuclear proteins as being related to, or identical with, the HMG I(Y). Since HMG I(Y) proteins are not transcriptional regulators themselves and mutated DNRE elements able to prevent the binding of HMG I(Y) do not abrogate silencer function, our results show that the DNRE, which has no demonstrable homology with known binding sites for transcription repressors, is specifically the binding site for a constitutive nuclear factor related to the silencer activity.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have within the IFN-A11 promoter, between −228 and −209, a silencer element (DNRE) that is necessary and sufficient for the distal repression of the IFN-A11 gene after NDV induction in both L929 and HeLa cell lines. The isolated DNRE of the IFN-A11 promoter or the similar element 4DNRE found in IFN-A4 is able to reduce the inducibility of both the native proximal (−119/+19) promoters of the IFN-A11 and -A4 genes. These results suggest that DNRE may exert a more general modulation of the transcriptional strength of the promoters of the IFN-A genes. Among eukaryotic gene promoters examined (Eukaryotic Promoter Database), in the 20 best scores, the DNRE of the murine IFN-A11 gene sequence is highly homologous to a sequence within the promoters of two other IFN-A genes that are different from the murine IFN-A4: the human IFN-A6 (−387 to −368, ATTTAACTTTTAGTTAAATT, 75.0% identity in a 20-nucleotide overlap in the coding strand; and −388 to −369, ATTTAACTAAAAGTTAAATT, 75.0% identity in a 20-nucleotide overlap in the noncoding strand) and the murine IFN-A7 (−275 to −258, ATCTAA-TCTAATATAAAG, 84.2% identity in a 19-nucleotide overlap in the noncoding strand) cloned in our laboratory (43Dion M. Vodjdani G. Doly J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In these two cases, the genes are weakly inducible or uninducible after virus induction. Indeed, the human IFN-A6 has been described as an uninducible gene in several cell types and with different virus (44Hiscott J. Cantell K. Weissmann C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3727-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Human IFN-A6 may be in fact a pseudogene with regard to its promoter, since the gene has a deletion of 12 nucleotides, from −73 to −61, within the presumed virus-responsive element. In contrast, the murine IFN-A7 gene may be repressed by the existence of a silencer element such as DNRE. This gene is poorly expressed or not expressed after NDV induction in several cell lines, and transient transfection assays in L929 and HeLa cell lines have demonstrated that its promoter is weakly inducible by NDV (data not shown). The participation of the DNRE in the silencing of the transcription of the murine IFN-A7 gene in different cell types remains to be elucidated. It is interesting to note that other gene promoters have been shown to contain sequence homologies with the DNRE silencer element of the IFN-A11 and -A4 promoters. Therefore, homologies were found with the canavalin, the serum albumin, the adenovirus 7 E1b, the globin, and the interleukin-4 promoters. The repressive effect of DNRE-related factors, suggested by this IFN-A study, may participate in the transcriptional modulation of these different promoters.The mutations in DNRE responsible for the derepression of the transcriptional activity of the IFN-A11 promoter also alter the formation of complexes using nuclear extracts from uninduced or virus-induced L929 and HeLa cells. These results indicate the presence of constitutive binding proteins involved in the silencing effect. One of the complexes corresponds to a protein related to or identical to HMG I(Y) but does not seem to modulate the binding to DNRE of a factor present in uninduced and virus-induced nuclear extracts with a molecular mass of 38 kDa. HMG I(Y) has been implicated in the regulation of a number of genes, including the IFN-B (19Thanos D. Maniatis T.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3738-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) genes. To date, HMG I(Y) proteins have not been shown to be implicated in the regulation of the expression of the IFN-A genes. In human IFN-B gene expression, HMG I(Y) proteins facilitate the binding of both NF-κB and activating transcription factor-2 to mediate virus induction and play an essential role in the assembly of a higher order transcription enhancer complex named enhanceosome (51Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In the case of DNRE, it seems that HMG I(Y) does not modify the binding of the 38-kDa protein. Indeed, complex I is also formed in the absence of complex II. Furthermore, the formation of complex II but not complex I was inhibited by anti-HMG I(Y) antibody and distamycin. In these experiments, it seems that the formation of complex I may not be dependent on the presence of complex II. Furthermore, we have shown a strict correlation between the activity of DNRE ex vivo and its capacity to form complex I but not complex II in vitro. Nevertheless, our observations cannot exclude completely the possibility that HMG I(Y) may account for part of the repression of the IFN-A genes and may interact with the 38-kDa protein. This hypothesis will be explored when this latter protein will be isolated.Recently, it has been demonstrated in the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain promoter that both Elf-1 and HMG I(Y) can be detected in the same complex in EMSAs and that they can interact with each other in the absence of DNA (48John S. Reeves R.B. Lin J-X. Child R. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results from EMSAs in the presence of antibodies against HMG I and from cross-linking experiments suggest that HMG I(Y) is not a component of complex I. Another function of HMG I(Y) could be to alter the structure of the bound DNA, which may result in its bending, bringing distant regulator factors, already bound to the elements, into closer proximity, thus facilitating interaction between these factors and therefore bringing regulating elements closer to the start site (52Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Whereas an increase of positive transcriptional factors may result in stronger recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery, the opposite effect may be observed when negative transcriptional factors are involved.For most of the IFN-A promoters as well as the IFN-B promoter, positive activator proteins bind to the proximal virus-responsive element and can act to overcome the constitutive silencing of the genes and allow high levels of transcription initiation after virus induction. Here we show that novel elements located upstream from the IE of the IFN-A promoters may also modulate the transcription of the genes. Indeed, the same distal silencer elements DNRE and 4DNRE are present in both IFN-A4 and IFN-A11 promoters, and similar DNA-binding proteins may be implicated in the negative activity. However, the presence of acis-acting region, 4D, located between the 4DNRE and the IE of the IFN-A4 promoter, overcomes the silencer activity and could be considered as an antisilencer. Antisilencer or antirepressor elements in different genes have been identified by their ability to override a negative effect and restore gene transcription without themselves showing a true positive activity, since they function only in the presence of the silencers (53Stover D.M. Zehner Z.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2230-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 54Frenkel B. Montecino M. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Multiple upstream silencer elements as well as a unique antisilencer element have been shown to be responsible for regulating the vimentin gene (53Stover D.M. Zehner Z.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2230-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). During myogenesis, down-regulated vimentin gene expression is correlated with the increased binding activity of the silencer proteins and coordinated with the decreased binding activity of the antisilencer protein. Therefore, these upstream silencer and antisilencer elements correlate with the developmental expression pattern of vimentin.In this report, we demonstrate that the presence of the 4D region overcame the silencer activity of the 4E1E2 element in the natural context of the IFN-A4 gene. Therefore, we suggest that the 4D region be considered as an antisilencer. The presence or absence of silencer and antisilencer elements may contribute to the differential expression of the IFN-A genes. We have searched for sequence homologies within the 4D antisilencer region that would be absent in the 11D region (see Fig.2 E), and we have found a perfect homology to the consensus recognition DNA sequence for IRF-1 and IRF-2, G(A)AAA(G/C)(T/C)GAAA(G/C)(T/C) (IRF-Es), found within the promoters of IFN-A, IFN-B, and many IFN-inducible genes (8Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The 4D antisilencer element, which contains the IRF-Es, GAAACTGAAAGC (−187/−176), shares two nucleotide substitutions in the corresponding element within the nonfunctional 11D region, GAAAGAGAAAGC (−173/−162). Different genes of the IRF family have been cloned and characterized, but, to date, none of them has been described as an antisilencer (9Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X-Y. Aebersold R.

Experiments are in progress to elucidate the mechanism by which the 4D antisilencer element overcomes the silencer 4DNRE in the IFN-A4 gene promoter. The isolation of the 38-kDa DNRE-binding protein will be critical and could contribute in the precise characterization of the 4Dcis-acting antisilencer element and the differenttrans-acting factors that may bind to the 4D and 11D regions. Indeed, protein-protein interactions between silencer and antisilencer as described for the carbamyl phosphate synthetase I promoter (55Goping I.S. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be suggested. Clearly, additional experiments are required for a more detailed understanding of the complex differential expression pattern of the IFN-A gene family, which involves a combination of the actions of different activator(s) and also silencer(s) and antisilencer(s).

The Escherichia coli methyl-directed mismatch repair system monitors the fidelity of DNA replication and recombination in this organism (1Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The methyl-directed reaction has been reconstituted in a purified system (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The reaction is composed of hemimethylated DNA substrate containing a mispair, E. coli MutH, MutL, MutS, and DNA helicase II, along with single-stranded DNA-binding protein, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, DNA ligase, and any one of the DNA exonucleases Exo I, Exo VII, or RecJ (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 3Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major steps in the excision repair pathway for methyl-directed removal of mismatched DNAs have been well defined. The requisite strand specificity for processing of replication errors is provided by patterns of adenine methylation at d(GATC) sequences (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Repair is initiated by binding of MutS to the mismatch (4Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), followed by the addition of MutL (5Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of this complex leads to activation of a latent d(GATC) endonuclease of MutH protein, which incises the unmodified strand at a hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence (6Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting strand break, which can occur either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch on the unmethylated strand, suffices to target correction to this strand (3Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ensuing excision reaction, which depends on MutS, MutL, and the cooperative action of DNA helicase II with an appropriate exonuclease, removes that portion of the unmodified strand spanning the d(GATC) site and the mismatch (7Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resynthesis of the excised strand by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme subsequently replaces the misincorporated nucleotide, with ligase restoring covalent integrity to the helix. In E. coli mismatch correction, adenine methylation of d(GATC) sequences determines the strand on which repair occurs (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 8Lahue R.S. Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). With hemimethylated heteroduplex, which is methylated at d(GATC) sequences on only one DNA strand, repair is highly biased to the unmethylated strand, with the methylated strand serving as template for correction. Mismatch repair also occurs on heteroduplex in which neither strand is methylated, but in this case correction shows little strand preference. Regions of DNA in which d(GATC) sequences are fully adenine-methylated are refractory to mismatch repair (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 9Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It appears to be the transient undermethylation of newly synthesized d(GATC) sequences in the region immediately following the replication fork that allows mismatch repair to operate only on newly synthesized strands and thereby remove replication errors (9Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Pukkila P.J. Peterson J. Herman G. Modrich P. Meselson M. Genetics. 1983; 104: 571-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli mismatch repair system does not recognize and repair all base-base mismatches with equal efficiency. Generally, the transition G-T mispair is corrected most efficiently, with A-C, C-T, A-A, T-T, G-G, and A-G are repaired at different efficiency. C-C is refractory to the repair (2Lahue R.S. Au K.G.

The mutator effects observed in E. coli mutH,mutL, mutS, and mutU mismatch repair-deficient mutants, are primarily transition and frameshift mutations (12Claverys J.P.L. Lacks S.A. Microbiol.

The fact that mutants deficient in mismatch repair show increased frequencies of frameshift mutations suggests that theE. coli mismatch repair system can recognize and repair heteroduplexes with one or more unpaired bases. Transfections ofE. coli with artificially constructed heteroduplexes andin vitro assays have demonstrated that the different heterologies are subject to correction with different efficiencies. The methyl-directed repair of heteroduplex with one-, two-, and three-base deletions is as efficient as the repair of G-T mismatches (13Dohet C. Wagner R. Radman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3395-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Learn B.A. Grafstrom R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6473-6481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Heteroduplexes with a four-base deletion are marginally repaired, and DNA with a five-base deletion is not detectably repaired by the MutHLS system (15Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Carraway M. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but an alternative pathway such asrecF-dependent activity may repair large deletions (17Fishel R.A. Siegel E.C. Kolodner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The elements of heterologous structure that are recognized by mismatch binding proteins and features of the repair system that determine repair efficiency are not understood. Mismatch repair genes are conserved in bacteria and higher organisms. Yeast MSH2 and human hMSH2 are analogous to the E. coli MutS protein, whereas yeast MLH1 and PMS1 and human hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2 correspond to the bacterial MutL protein (reviewed in Ref. 18Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). A number of studies suggest a functional similarity between the postreplication repair pathway in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 1Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Recently, Umar et al. (19Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) reported the correction of loops of five or more unpaired bases by human cell extracts. They showed that the repair of 1–4-base loops was strongly dependent on hMLH1 and hMSH2 (19Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, in 5–16-base loops, repair was independent of hMLH1 (19Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Human MSH2 had shown specific binding to loops as large as 14 nucleotides (20Fishel R. Ewel A. Lee S. Lescoe M.K. Griffith J. Science. 1994; 266: 1403-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), although repair of loops larger than five bases has not been tested in the hMSH2-deficient extracts. The E. coli methyl-directed repair of heteroduplexes containing more than a three-base insertion/deletion has not yet been examined in vitro. Thus, we used the in vitrorepair assay and a set of M13mp18 derivatives containing 1–8 or 22 unpaired bases as substrates to determine the size constraints of the repair pathway. We demonstrate here that the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway efficiently corrects heteroduplexes containing up to five unpaired bases. We also show that loop repair efficiency of heteroduplex is affected by base composition of the heterology. E. coli strain NM522 (supE thi Δ(hsdMS-mcrB)5 Δ(lac-proAB) F′[proAB + lacI q lacZΔM15]) was from Klim King (Sinica Academia, Taipei).

Bacteriophage M13mp18 was from a commercial source. The nucleotide numbering at restriction endonuclease cleavage sites has been described (21Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar).E. coli DNA ligase, ATP-dependent DNase,dam methylase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs or Amersham Corp. A Synthetic 22-base pair oligonucleotide linker was inserted into the HindIII cleavage site of M13mp18 (Fig. 1). The product of this construction is dubbed M13LR1, which was further mutagenized with oligonucleotides partially complementary to the inserted linker (22Kramer W. Drutsa V. Jansen H.W. Kramer B. Pflugfelder M. Fritz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9441-9456Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) to create other derivatives. Each of the oligonucleotides used carried 1–8 additional bases, disrupting the recognition sequence of a unique restriction endonuclease site in vector and creating a new, unique restriction endonuclease recognition sequence (see Table I). Mutant M13LR phages were identified by restriction analysis of replication form minipreparation, and mutant sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc.

Replicative form DNAs fully methylated at d(GATC) sites were isolated from strain NM522 or JJ119. DNAs devoid of dam methylation at d(GATC) sequences were prepared by using strain RS5033 as host. Heteroduplex DNA substrates were constructed essentially under the conditions of Luet al. (9Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). M13LR derivative RF DNA (1 mg) was linearized with BglI and mixed with a 4-fold molar excess of viral DNA, followed by alkaline denaturation and annealing. After isolation of double-stranded DNAs by hydroxylapatite chromatography, linear homoduplex DNA was removed by hydrolyzing with ATP-dependent DNase as described (24Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The open circular heteroduplex was purified by Sephadex G-200 (Phamacia Biotech Inc.) chromatography and benzoylated naphthylated DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) chromatography in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The strand break was subjected to closure with E. coli DNA ligase in the presence of ethidium bromide (96 mmol of dye/mol of nucleotide). Covalently closed DNA circles were then isolated by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl/ethidium bromide (9Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Substrates used in this study are summarized in Table II. By pairing different M13LR insertion derivatives, a heteroduplex containing base-base mismatch or a site-specific nucleotide insertion/deletion can be constructed. Unpaired extra nucleotides can be located at either the viral or complementary strand.Table IIM13LR heteroduplex substratesDNAHeteroduplex site (loop on complementary strand)M13DNAHeteroduplex site (loop on viral strand)M13GT5′-CCTCGAG AGCTTG-vLR1AC5′-CCTCGA AAGCTTG-vLR33′-GGAGCT TTCGAAC-cLR33′-GGAGCTC TCGAAC-cLR1C15′-CCTCG-AGCTTG-vLR12V15′-CCTCGAG AGCTTG-vLR13′-GGAGC TTCGAAC-cLR53′-GGAGCT-TCGAAC-cLR5C2cc5′-CCTCGA--AGCTTG-vLR5V2gg5′-CCTCGAG GAGCTTG-vLR73′-GGAGCTC CTCGAAC-cLR73′-GGAGCT--TCGAAC-cLR5C2tt5′-CCTCGA--GCTTG-vLR12V2aa5′-CCTCGA AAGCTTG-vLR33′-GGAGCT TTCGAAC-cLR33′-GGAGCT--CGAAC-cLR12C2ac5′-CCTCGA--AGCTTG-vLR5V2gt5′-CCTCGAG TAGCTTG-vLR63′-GGAGCTC ATCGAAC-cLR63′-GGAGCT--TCGAAC-cLR5C35′-CCTCGA---AGCTTG-vLR5V35′-CCTCGAG GGAGCTTG-vLR83′-GGAGCTC CCTCGAAC-cLR83′-GGAGCT---TCGAAC-cLR5C45′-CCTCGA----GAGCTTG-vLR1V45′-CCTCGATATC GAGCTTG-vLR93′-GGAGCTATAGCTCGAAC-cLR93′-GGAGCT----C TCGAAC-cLR1C4n5′-CCTCGA----GGGAGCTTG-vLR8V4n5′-CCTCGA CCATGGGAGCTTG-vLR103′-GGAGCT GGTACCCTCGAAC-cLR103′-GGAGCT----CCCTCGAAC-cLR8C55′-CCTCGA-----AGCTTG-vLR5V55′-CCTCGATATC GAGCTTG-vLR93′-GGAGCTATAG CTCGAAC-cLR93′-GGAGCT-----TCGAAC-cLR5C5n5′-CCTCGA-----GGAGCTTG-vLR7V5n5′-CCTCGA CCATGGGAGCTTG-vLR103′-GGAGCT GGTACCCTCGAAC-cLR103′-GGAGCT-----CCTCGAAC-cLR7C65′-CCTCGA------GAGCTTG-vLR1V65′-CCTCGA CCATGG GAGCTTG-vLR103′-GGAGCT GGTACC CTCGAAC-cLR103′-GGAGCT------CTCGAAC-cLR1C75′-CCTCGA-------AGCTTG-vLR5V75′-CCTCGA CCATGG GAGCTTG-vLR103′-GGAGCT GGTACC CTCGAAC-cLR103′-GGAGCT-------TCGAAC-cLR5C85′-CCTCGA--------GCTTG-vLR12V85′-CCTCGA CCATGG GAGCTTG-vLR103′-GGAGCT GGTACC CTCGAAC-cLR103′-GGAGCT--------CGAAC-cLR12C225′------------------------vmp18V225′-AGCTAGCAGCAGCAGCCTCGAG -vLR13′-TCGTCGTCGTCGGAGCTCTCGA-cLR13′------------------------cmp18Covalently closed, circular heteroduplexes containing a set of base pair mismatches or small nucleotide insertions/deletions were prepared using the phage DNAs shown.

Hemimethylated heteroduplexes prepared by using methylated RF and unmethylated viral strands (V−/C+) were resistant to cleavage byDpnII, indicating that all d(GATC) sites were in the hemimethylated state. In contrast, substrates prepared from unmethylated RF and methylated viral strands (V+/C−) were subject to some cleavage by DpnII. Only 25% of the heteroduplexes were resistant to DpnII, 25% were cleaved once, and 50% were cleaved more than once. Fully unmethylated heteroduplexes (V−/C−) were formed by annealing unmethylated complementary strands to unmethylated viral strands. Fully methylated heteroduplexes (V+/C+) were prepared by in vitro methylation of hemimethylated heteroduplexes with dam methylase as described (9Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In V+/C+ heteroduplexes, the complementary strands were fully methylated at more than 95% of the d(GATC) sequences, and the viral strands were methylated at about 80%. Growth of cells and preparation of cell extracts were as described by Lu et al. (9Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The repair reaction in concentrated E. coli lysate was carried out in 10 μl containing 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6); 5 mm MgCl2; 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; 1 mm ATP; 0.1 mm concentration each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP; and 0.1 μg (20 fmol) of heteroduplex DNA. Cell-free E. coli extracts were included at optimal amounts at 7.5–10 mg of protein/ml. Incubation was at 37 °C for 1 h. Then 30 μl of 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) was added, and the DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was then analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. The ethidium complexes of DNA products were quantitated using a gel documentation CCD camera (UVP Ltd.) (25Fang W. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Starting from phage M13mp18, we have prepared a set of M13LR derivatives that contain extra nucleotides within the polylinker region located between the singleEcoRI and HindIII sites of M13mp18 (Fig.1 and TableI). This set of M13LR derivatives permits construction of heteroduplexes representing base pair mismatches and 1–8- and 22-base insertion/deletion heterologies. In each of these heteroduplexes the heterology is located in a similar environment. Moreover, as shown in Table II, each insertion/deletion mispair is located within overlapping restriction endonuclease recognition sites. This approach allows an independent assay of correction on either DNA strand. Digestion of the heteroduplex DNA with AlwNI (Fig. 1) and the indicator restriction endonuclease, whose recognition site is inactive because of the heterology, will yield a 7.2-kilobase pair fragment only. Similar digestion of DNA in which the recognition sequence has been restored by repair reaction will yield 4.1- and 3.1-kilobase pair fragments. In the case of the heteroduplexes constructed, almost all substrates were refractory to the digestion by the indicator restriction endonucleases (Fig. 2, B and D), except C2cc and C3 were susceptible to the star activity by one of the indicator restriction endonuclease HindIII. In these cases, 20–40% of untreated C2cc and C3 heteroduplexes were cleaved byHindIII. Thus, the repair on the complementary strand of these two substrates was not determined (TableIII).Table IIIEfficiency of methyl-directed mismatch repair and loop repair in E. coli extractsSubstratesRepairWild type extractsmutS::Tn5extractsV−C+V−C+fmolG-T13.1<0.50.8<0.5A-C12.71.32.30.6C1t111.01.12.1Vlg10.71.91.90.9C2cc12.6ND0.7NDV2gg13.5<0.51.7<0.5C2ac9.41.61.22.0V2gt9.01.10.51.7C2tt11.30.70.60.8V2aa8.80.51.20.8C37.5ND<0.5NDV38.51.2<0.5<0.5C47.8<0.50.50.5V47.20.60.70.8C4n9.41.8<0.50.8V4n4.7<0.50.6<0.5C54.91.3<0.50.7V57.70.60.70.7C5n8.72.80.6<0.5V5n6.70.5<0.5<0.5C63.71.40.5<0.5V62.2<0.50.50.7C71.6<0.5<0.5<0.5V76.6<0.5<0.5<0.5C82.00.5<0.5<0.5V81.11.8<0.51.6C221.50.9<0.50.8V221.91.80.71.1Repair was determined in extracts of NM522 and RK1517 (7.5 mg/ml protein) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C+, repair occurring on the methylated complementary strand; V−, repair occurring on the unmethylated viral strand.

Open table in a new tab Repair was determined in extracts of NM522 and RK1517 (7.5 mg/ml protein) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C+, repair occurring on the methylated complementary strand; V−, repair occurring on the unmethylated viral strand. Repair results are averages of several experiments. Complete repair would correspond to 20 fmol. ND, not determined. To determine whether base insertions/deletions were corrected via the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway in vitro, hemimethylated heteroduplexes containing 1–8-, or 22-base insertion/deletion heterologies were tested for repair in a cell extract from mismatch repair-proficient E. coli strain. A G-T mismatch and an A-C mismatch at position 6303 of M13LR1 were used as positive controls. We choose to compare the efficiency of correction of DNA containing nucleotide heterologies with that of G-T and A-C mismatches, since a methyl-directed repair system has been shown to correct them with high efficiency (11Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Table III compares the efficiency of correction of all heteroduplexes as scored by restriction endonuclease digestion, and Fig. 2 illustrates the behavior of the several repair classes in the restriction assay. As shown in Table III, members of this set were corrected in vitro with different efficiencies. Hemimethylated heteroduplexes of G-T, A-C, and one-, two-, and three-base insertions/deletions were subject to efficient repair in cell-free extracts of E. coli (Table III; Fig.2 A, lanes 1–4). As judged by repair levels, the G-T and A-C base pair mismatches were preferred substrates, with an efficiency comparable with that observed in previous studies (9Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heteroduplexes of one-, two-, and three-base insertion/deletion corrected at levels of 50–100% of that observed for the G-T mispair. Repair of hemimethylated heteroduplexes occurred preferentially on the unmethylated strand. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table III, repair bias exceeded 7:1 (unmethylated:methylated) in all cases of preferred substrates. This finding is similar to previous in vivo (15Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and in vitro (14Learn B.A. Grafstrom R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6473-6481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results. Previous studies examined the repair of heteroduplexes containing more than four extra bases have only been performed by transfection assays with a single set of heteroduplexes (15Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Consequently, several heteroduplex substrates containing at least four extra unmatched bases were constructed and tested for in vitro methyl-directed repair. As shown in Table III, substrates containing four- or five-base insertion/deletion were corrected at reduced levels, 30–70% of the correction observed for G-T mispair, depending on the sequence environment of the loops. As sizes of insertion/deletion increased to six bases and more, the correction level further decreased to 5–50% that of G-T mispair, and showed much less methylation-dependent strand bias (Table III). The differences in repair efficiencies do not reflect the presence of inhibitors in some DNA preparations, since experiments in which each heteroduplex was competed with the G-T or A-C substrate resulted in the same hierarchy of correction (not shown). The heteroduplexes containing loops were subject to kinetic analysis along with well repaired G-T heteroduplex. The methyl-directed reactions of all substrates reached 50% of final repair levels at 15 min of incubation (data not shown), which is consistent with previousin vitro methyl-directed reactions (8Lahue R.S. Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A comparison of the in vitro repair of C- and V-heteroduplexes (with the former containing nucleotide deletions and the latter containing nucleotide insertions on the unmethylated viral strand) is shown in Table III and Fig. 3. The results demonstrated that repair of both heteroduplex configurations was preferentially directed to the unmethylated strand, indicating that both deletions and insertions were corrected in a methyl-directed fashion. Methyl-directed mismatch repair is dependent on the product ofmutH, mutL, and mutS genes. In addition, MutHLS have been implicated in the repair of one-, two-, and three-base deletion heteroduplexes (14Learn B.A. Grafstrom R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6473-6481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Consequently, cell extracts were prepared from E. coli strains that were defective in each of these gene products and were assayed with small nucleotide insertion/deletion heteroduplexes described above. As shown in Table III and Fig. 3, methyl-directed correction of small nucleotide heterologies was highly dependent on the presence of themutS gene product in crude extracts. As shown in TableIV, repair of these small nucleotide heterologies also required the presence of mutH,mutL, a"

Although it has been shown that MAP1B localizes both in cytosol and particulate fractions, the underlying molecular mechanism in the membrane localization has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we show that MAP1B purified from young rat brain can bind to acidic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine, but not to a neutral phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, the binding of MAP1B to taxol-stabilized microtubules was inhibited by the addition of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol. The addition of phosphatidylcholine showed no effect on the binding of MAP1B to the microtubules. A 120-kDa microtubule-binding fragment of MAP1B was also released from microtubules by the addition of acidic phospholipids. Synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal half of the tubulin-binding domain, but not that corresponding to the N-terminal half, bound to acidic phospholipids specifically. These results suggest that MAP1B binds to biological membranes through its tubulin-binding site, and the binding may play a regulatory role in MAP1B-microtubule interaction.

Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP, phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP, phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. are thought to regulate the formation and stability of the microtubules. Protein phosphorylation of MAPs is known to alter their interaction with tubulin and to affect the stability of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Mitogen-activated protein kinase, for example, has been initially purified as a protein kinase that phosphorylates MAP2, and the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton after various cellular stimuli has been well established (1Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoskeletal proteins including the MAPs are, in fact, one of the major targets of the signaling pathways. Phosphorylation of the MAPs plays important roles not only in the physiological functions but also in pathological aspects. For example, tau protein that accumulates in paired helical filaments, pathological structures that develop within neurons in Alzheimer's disease, is aberrantly phosphorylated (2Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 480-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Lee V.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated MAP1B is also found in paired helical filaments (5Hasegawa M. Arai T. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1990; 4: 909-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). MAP1B (microtubule-associated protein 1B, also known as MAP1X, MAP1.2, or MAP5) is a component of neuronal cytoskeleton in developing brain or in the regenerating region of adult brain such as the olfactory bulb (6Bloom G.S. Luca F.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5404-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Safaei R. Fischer I. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1871-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1712-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although MAP1B is classified as a MAP, MAP1B is different from other MAPs in several respects. While MAP1B lacks the microtubule-binding motifs common to MAP2, MAP4, and tau protein, it contains a unique microtubule-binding domain composed of multiple KKE(E/I/V) repeats (9Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MAP1B shows relative inefficiency in microtubule co-sedimentation (6Bloom G.S. Luca F.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5404-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of MAP1B has yet to be elucidated, its phosphorylation has been suggested to be important for synaptogenesis and synapse formation. Phosphorylation by casein kinase II has been proposed to be required for neuritogenesis (10Ulloa L. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1633-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). MAP1B is strongly phosphorylated in cultured cortical neurons undergoing synaptogenesis, and the inhibition of the phosphorylation of the protein results in the suppression of the synapse formation (11Muramoto K. Taniguchi H. Kawahara M. Kobayashi K. Nonomura Y. Kuroda Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the phosphorylation of MAP1B plays an important role. Recent data from gene targeting experiments in mice indicate that MAP1B is necessary for normal development of the central nervous system (12Edelmann W. Zervas M. Costello P. Roback L. Fischer I. Hammarback J.A. Cowan N. Davies P. Wainer B. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1270-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although the molecular basis of abnormalities seen in the MAP1B-deficient pups has yet to be elucidated. Protein phosphorylation is not the only regulatory means of the MAP functions. Phosphatidylinositol has been shown to bind specifically to MAP2, and the binding affects the interaction between MAP2 and tubulin (13Yamauchi P.S. Purich D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3369-3375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Surridge C.D. Burns R.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6140-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Surridge C.D. Burns R.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8051-8057Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MAP1B is suggested to be localized both in cytosolic and particulate fractions (16Ulloa L. Avila J. Diaz-Nido J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is also known that MAP1B is localized to the particular fraction of the growth cone (17Rocha M.G. Avila J. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MAP1B of these two fractions shows different immunostaining with several antibodies that recognize different epitopes of phosphorylated MAP1B, suggesting that the MAP1B localization may be regulated by its phosphorylation. Although it has been speculated that the localization to a particular fraction of MAP1B may be due to the association to microfilaments, no molecular basis for the membrane localization of MAP1B has been presented. In the present study, we show that purified MAP1B can bind specifically to acidic phospholipids. The binding of acidic phospholipids to the C-terminal half of the tubulin-binding domain induced MAP1B dissociation from taxol-stabilized microtubules, suggesting that acidic phospholipids may play a regulatory role in the MAP1B function. MAP1B was purified from the cytoplasmic fractions of young rat brain as described (18Pedrotti B. Islam K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The whole brain was homogenized in 100 mm PIPES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.8) containing 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. After adding 20 μm paclitaxel, the supernatant was incubated at 25°C for 60 min. Assembled microtubule proteins were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant containing most of the MAP1B protein was adjusted to 0.2m NaCl and applied onto a Resource 15Q column (1 × 15 cm; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Bound proteins were eluted by a 0.2–1m NaCl gradient in 100 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.4) containing 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (MES buffer). MAP1B-containing fractions were pooled, diluted, and applied to a Mono S column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia), and the column was eluted by a 0–1m NaCl gradient in MES buffer. MAP1B thus purified was stored at −80°C until use. Tubulin was prepared from bovine brain as described (19Matsubara M. Kusubata M. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21108-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) were obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal AA6, HM-1, and E12 antibodies were purchased from Sigma, while monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibody was purchased from Chemicon International Inc. Peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Amersham Corp. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Three peptides of 24 residues corresponding to the microtubule-binding domain of rat MAP1B, peptide 1 (KEEAKKEIKKEIKKEEKKELKKEV, residues 2Residue numbers refer to the combined amino acid sequence deduced from two cDNA sequences (23Zauner W.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 171: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with one exception. Although Arg335 found in the mouse sequence is missing in the original rat sequence, our mass spectrometric analysis indicated the presence of an Arg in the position (data not shown). 675–698), peptide 2 (KKSTPLSDTKKPAALKPKVAKKEE, residues 738–761), and peptide 3 (KKEPIAAGKLKDKGKVKVIKKEGK, residues 764–786), synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, were obtained from Research Genetics. The peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C-18 column (Waters μBondasphere 5 μ C18–300 Å, 1.9 × 15 cm). Phospholipids in chloroform solution were dried to a thin film under a stream of argon gas and kept under vacuum for 30 min. The lipid films were dispersed in a 170 mm sucrose solution containing 1 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), followed by 10 cycles of extrusion through a stack of polycarbonate filter (0.1-μm pore size) in a LiposoFast-Basic apparatus (AVESTIN). Sucrose was removed from the solution outside the vesicles by diluting the vesicle solution 5-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and by centrifuging at 100,000 × gat 25 °C for 60 min. Pellets were resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and used as large unilamellar vesicles. Small unilamellar vesicles were made by sonication using a tip-type sonicator (Branson Sonifier 250) for 30 min as described (20Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14651-14658Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After centrifugation in a table top centrifuge for 20 min, supernatants were used as small unilamellar vesicles. Binding of MAP1B and that of the MAP1B-derived peptides to phospholipid membranes were analyzed by sedimentation analysis. MAP1B (2.5 μg) was mixed with large unilamellar vesicles (5 μg) in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 60 min, protein co-sedimented with vesicles was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis (20Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14651-14658Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Peptides (10 μg) were mixed with PS or PC vesicles (2.4 mg) in 60 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and incubated at 30°C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min. Peptides remaining in supernatants were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. MAP1B (7.5 μg) was mixed with paclitaxel-stabilized tubulin (0.2 mg) and small unilamellar vesicles of phospholipids (15 μg) in 85 μl of 100 mm PIPES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.9) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.9 m glycerol, and 0.1 mmpaclitaxel. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the mixture was layered on 50 μl of 50% (w/w) sucrose containing 100 mmPIPES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.9), 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.9 m glycerol, and 0.1 mmpaclitaxel and was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min in a Beckman table top ultracentrifuge. MAP1B remaining in supernatants and that co-sedimented with tubulin in pellets were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. A 120-kDa microtubule-binding fragment of MAP1B was obtained by chymotryptic cleavage of MAP1B as described previously (8Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1712-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAP1B (5 μg) was mixed with paclitaxel-stabilized tubulin (0.2 mg) and digested with chymotrypsin (Worthington, 0.08 μg) in 70 μl of 100 mm PIPES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.9) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.9m glycerol, and 0.06 mm paclitaxel at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 mm (final concentration) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and phospholipid vesicles were added to make final concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the mixture was layered on 50 μl of 50% (w/w) sucrose containing 100 mm PIPES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.9), 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.9m glycerol, and 0.1 mm paclitaxel and was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman table top ultracentrifuge. The 120-kDa fragment that remained in supernatants and the fragment that co-sedimented with tubulin in pellets were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. For Western blots, proteins separated by SDS gel electrophoresis were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry blotting apparatus (MARYSOL, Tokyo, Japan), and the membranes were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies against MAP1B, MAP2, MAP1A, and LC-1 using ECL (Amersham). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. MAP1B was purified from cytosolic fractions of young (1-week-old) rat brain after sedimenting most of the microtubule-associated proteins other than MAP1B as microtubules (18Pedrotti B. Islam K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although GTP- and temperature-dependent polymerization of microtubules in the original procedure was substituted with paclitaxel-dependent polymerization, most of the MAP1B protein remained in the supernatant and could be purified to an apparent homogeneity after two successive column chromatography steps (Fig. 1 a). The purified protein contained one heavy chain of around 250 kDa and two light chains of 30 (LC1) and 15 kDa (LC3). The presence of LC3 was seen only when the gel was overloaded (data not shown). Purified MAP1B was stained in the immunoblot only by the anti-MAP1B monoclonal antibody, and no significant staining was observed with anti-MAP1A or anti-MAP2 antibody, suggesting that the purified MAP1B was free from other MAPs of similar molecular weights. In addition, MAP1B preparation was also stained with anti-MAP1 light chain antibody (Fig. 1 b). The identity of the purified protein as MAP1B was further confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis. The purified protein was digested with lysyl endoprotease, and the resulting peptide mixture was subjected to liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry (21Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As will be described elsewhere, 3E. Yamauchi, K. Muramoto, Y. Kuroda, and H. Taniguchi, manuscript in preparation. more than 70 peptides could be assigned to the sequence deduced from the published cDNA sequence of rat MAP1B (23Zauner W. Kratz J. Stauton J. Feick P. Wiche G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liu D. Fischer I. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 171: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), establishing the identity of the protein. To examine whether MAP1B can interact with membrane phospholipids, binding of MAP1B to phospholipid vesicles was directly studied by sedimentation assay. When purified MAP1B was incubated with large unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), or phosphatidic acid (PA) and subjected to centrifugation, similar bindings were observed with all of the acidic phospholipids used, demonstrating that MAP1B has an intrinsic ability to bind to phospholipid membranes (Fig.2). Similar binding was observed with phospholipid vesicles containing a mixture of PC (80%) and PS (20%) that mimics that of biological membranes such as the cytoplasmic leaflet of typical mammalian plasma membranes (data not shown). On the contrary, no significant binding was observed when phosphatidylcholine (PC), a neutral phospholipid, was used. These results suggest that the ionic interactions rather than the hydrophobic interactions play an important role in the MAP1B-membrane interaction. Since the main physiological function of MAP1B is in the interaction with microtubules, the effects of phospholipids on the MAP1B-tubulin interaction were studied. Purified rat MAP1B was found in the pellets when paclitaxel-stabilized tubulin was sedimented by centrifugation (Fig. 3 a, lanes 1and 2), demonstrating that the purified MAP1B has the ability to bind to microtubules. The addition of PC, which did not show significant binding to MAP1B, to the mixture did not show any effect on the MAP1B-tubulin interaction as expected (lanes 3 and4). However, when acidic phospholipids were included in the mixture, MAP1B did not co-sediment with tubulin but remained in the supernatants (lanes 5–10). Under the experimental conditions employed, most of the lipids remained above the 50% sucrose cushion, while the polymerized tubulin was found in the pellets. Therefore, the addition of the acidic phospholipids induced dissociation of MAP1B from the polymerized tubulin. The formation of a ternary complex among the phospholipid membranes, MAP1B, and tubulin was not observed, suggesting either that the binding of acidic phospholipids to MAP1B induces a conformational change that results in the loss of binding to tubulin or that the acidic phospholipids share the same binding site(s) in MAP1B with tubulin. PI (lanes 9and 10) and PS (lanes 7 and 8) seem to be more effective than PA (lanes 5 and 6) in the dissociation of MAP1B from polymerized tubulin. The order of acidic phospholipid addition prior to or after the binding of MAP1B to tubulin did not change the observed behavior of MAP1B release (Fig.3 b, lanes 1–4). Phosphatidylinositol is known to be metabolized further to various messengers upon cellular stimulation. It is, therefore, of interest to test the effects of phosphatidylinositol phosphates on the MAP1B-tubulin interactions. Two acidic metabolites of PI,i.e. phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, were tested for their abilities to bind MAP1B as well as to affect the MAP1B-tubulin interaction. Under the same experimental conditions, MAP1B bound to PI completely but not to phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate to a significant extent (data not shown). The addition of the phosphatidylinositol phosphates did not affect the MAP1B-microtubules interaction significantly, while PI inhibited the interaction effectively (Fig. 3 c, lanes 1–4). These results demonstrate that the interaction between MAP1B and phospholipids is not effected by simple ionic interactions but involves specific structural interactions. Assuming a molecular weight of 300,000 for MAP1B and 100,000 for tubulin dimer, the concentrations of the proteins used in these binding assays were 0.3 μm for MAP1B and 24 μm for tubulin. These values were chosen from their concentrations in vivo; tubulin constitutes around 13–25% of total protein in brain, and the molar concentration can be calculated to be 20–50 μm (25Anderson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2168-2171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hiller G. Weber K. Cell. 1978; 14: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), while the amount of MAP1B in neonatal brain has been estimated to be around 0.35 μm (27Guzman L. Bustos R. Maccioni R.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of MAP1B with acidic phospholipids seems to occur at physiologically relevant concentrations. We performed a similar binding assay with a series of MAP1B and tubulin concentrations at a fixed PS concentration (Fig. 4). When the protein concentrations were lowered by a factor of 5, about 75% of MAP1B was found in the supernatant with the phospholipid (Fig. 4, lane B). However, most of MAP1B remained associated with tubulin when the protein concentrations were further reduced to one-tenth of the original concentrations. These results not only indicate that the acidic phospholipids have high affinities to MAP1B but also suggest that the tubulin-MAP1B interaction can be reversibly regulated by acidic phospholipids. This raises the possibility that the acidic phospholipids play a regulatory role in the tubulin-MAP1B interactions in cells. To identify the phospholipid-binding domain, MAP1B was treated with chymotrypsin, which has been shown to produce a 120-kDa microtubule-binding fragment, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of the molecule (8Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1712-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of PS on the 120-kDa microtubule-binding fragment-tubulin interaction were then studied in the same way as above. The fragment behaved similarly to the intact MAP1B; the addition of PS vesicles to a complex of the 120-kDa microtubule-binding fragment and tubulin induced the dissociation of the fragment from microtubules, while PC had no effect on the interaction (Fig. 5). Since the phospholipid binding to MAP1B facilitates its dissociation from tubulin, the simplest explanation is that phospholipids and tubulin share the same binding site in MAP1B. To test this hypothesis, three peptides corresponding to the different parts of the microtubule-binding domain were designed as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see also Fig. 7). The rationale of the present design of peptides is as follows. Previous deletion and recombination studies (9Noble M. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the “domain X” between amino acids 646 and 732 can bind to tubulin, but a deletion mutant lacking the domain can still bind to tubulin. Therefore, another domain either N- or C-terminal to domain X constitutes a second tubulin-binding site. The typical KKE(E/I/V) tubulin-binding motif is clustered in domain X, while the domain C-terminal to it contains fewer KKE(E/I/V) motifs, and each motif becomes less characteristic. The overall effect is that the domain C-terminal to domain X contains fewer acidic residues, the net charge becomes more positive, and the content of hydrophobic amino acid increases. Therefore, peptide 1 was chosen from the central part of domain X, and peptide 3 was chosen from the C-terminal half of the tubulin-binding domain. Peptide 2 is adjacent to peptide 3 and similar to the latter, but it still retains one typical KKEE motif. It also contains fewer basic residues compared with peptide 3. This gives the peptide a character that is intermediate between the two other peptides. When these peptides were mixed with PS or PC vesicles, three peptides showed different affinities to phospholipids (Fig. 6). Peptide 1 did not show any significant binding either to PC or PS. On the contrary, peptides 2 and 3 bound to PS vesicles specifically. No significant binding to PC vesicles was observed with all of the peptides examined. Thus, the C-terminal half of the microtubule-binding domain of MAP1B, but not the N-terminal half containing typical KKE(E/I/V) repeats, has the ability to bind to acidic phospholipids specifically. These results suggest that the C-terminal half of the microtubule-binding domain of MAP1B serves as a membrane or acidic phospholipid-binding domain, and the binding of lipids decreases the MAP1B-tubulin interaction.Figure 6Binding of MAP1B tubulin-binding domain peptides to phospholipids. MAP1B peptides 1, 2, and 3 (0.17 mg/ml) were mixed with PS or PC vesicles (40 mg/ml). After centrifugation, peptides remaining in supernatant were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. The intensities of the bands quantified by densitometry were 97% (peptide 1 and PC), 84% (peptide 1 and PS), 93% (peptide 2 and PC), 27% (peptide 2 and PS), 100% (peptide 3 and PC), and 33% (peptide 3 and PS) of control values obtained without lipids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MAP1B is a major MAP in nerve growth cone and is enriched in its membrane-cytoskeleton fraction (17Rocha M.G. Avila J. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 89: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since MAP1B is a very hydrophilic protein without any apparent hydrophobic membrane-binding sites, either direct binding to other proteins such as actin filaments (28Pedrotti B. Islam K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is involved in the localization or the protein binds to the membranes through a domain(s) that is not simply hydrophobic. The present study established that MAP1B has an intrinsic ability to bind to acidic phospholipids and that a subdomain with a basic amphiphilic nature within the microtubule-binding domain is responsible for the binding. Furthermore, we found that the binding of acidic phospholipids to the protein affects its interaction with tubulin. A hydropathy plot of MAP1B sequence shows a single hydrophobic domain between residues 791 and 817 that is located just C-terminal to the tubulin-binding domain (11Muramoto K. Taniguchi H. Kawahara M. Kobayashi K. Nonomura Y. Kuroda Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the apparent high hydrophobicity of the region is mainly due to the lack of hydrophilic charged amino acids, and the domain lacks large hydrophobic residues (Fig.7). Since MAP1B binds to acidic phospholipids rather than to neutral phospholipids, such a neutral domain cannot be the primary binding site. On the contrary, a closer look of the adjacent tubulin-binding site revealed an interesting variation of the character within the domain. The N-terminal half of the domain consists mainly of the typical KKE(E/I/V) motif, while the C-terminal half contains a derivative of the motif that lacks the acidic residues. This gives the latter domain a basic amphiphilic character, in which basic residues and hydrophobic residues appear alternatingly. This is reminiscent of the membrane-binding domains, which have been identified in various proteins including MARCKS (29Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GAP-43 (30Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol.

In fact, such a basic amphiphilic domain seems to be a common membrane-binding motif in a variety of proteins (32Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 6: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 33Hayashi N.

Since MAP1B is known to be phosphorylated at multiple sites (16Ulloa L. Avila J. Diaz-Nido J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the interactions of other MAPs such as tau and MAP2 with tubulin are regulated by protein phosphorylation of the binding domains (34Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 35Ainsztein A.M. Purich D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28465-28471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this raises an intriguing possibility that such a regulatory mechanism is operational in the MAP1B-membrane interactions. MAP1B is the first MAP expressed highly during development of the brain. The level of its expression, however, decreases rapidly during synaptogenesis with a concomitant increase in the MAP1A expression level. Both proteins share a high homology, especially at the N-terminal half of the molecules including the N-terminal half of the tubulin-binding domain (36Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Muller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C-terminal half of the MAP1B tubulin-binding site, which is identified as the phospholipid-binding site in the present study, is lacking in the MAP1A sequence. It is of interest to note in this context that the MAPs fractions prepared from adult bovine brain containing mostly MAP1A, MAP1C, and MAP2 behave differentially upon addition of acidic phospholipids. Namely, only MAP2 but not MAP1 dissociates from microtubules (13Yamauchi P.S. Purich D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3369-3375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This corresponds well with the lack of the phospholipid-binding site in the MAP1A tubulin-binding domain. The difference may be important for the functional difference between MAP1A and MAP1B. As mentioned above, MAP1B is not the only MAP whose function is regulated by the specific binding of phospholipids. MAP2C and tau have been shown to bind acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol with a high affinity (15Surridge C.D. Burns R.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8051-8057Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Many actin-binding proteins also bind to phospholipids, and their functions are regulated by the specific binding as well (37Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Developing neurons, especially at their growth cone, should undergo dynamic rearrangements of membrane-cytoskeleton, and phospholipid-binding cytoskeletal proteins, which now include MAP1B, may play important roles in these events.

The retained 5′ products result from cleavage at uridine residues during retraction, whereas the yield of mononucleotides and dinucleotides released indicates that multiple cuts occur near the 3′ end. Comparison of the cleavage patterns of uridine-containing and 5-bromouridine-containing transcripts suggests that RNA within an RNA-DNA hybrid duplex is the substrate for the 3′-5′ exonuclease.

To explore the possibility that these oligonucleotides are released by the action of the RNA polymerase III nuclease at previously observed uridine-rich pause sites, we tested modified templates lacking the arrest sites present in the SUP4 tRNATyr gene. Comparative studies of cleavage during transcription for these templates show a direct correlation between the number of natural pause sites and the yield of 3′ products made.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2833-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the only previous report of an intrinsic nuclease in RNA polymerase III, Whitehall, Bardeleben, and Kassavetis (8Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) noted the excision of dinucleotide cleavage products when transcription was halted within the sequence 5′-UCUC in a yeast tRNATyr gene. In this paper we have extended the study of pol III nuclease activity to elongation complexes stalled within a number of different sequence contexts. For several of these we characterized both products of nuclease cutting, the released 3′ oligonucleotides as well as the shortened 5′ transcript. An examination of the respective 3′ product sizes relative to that of the RNA transcript underscores a surprising dilemma. More than one oligonucleotide fragment must have been produced per surviving 5′ fragment to satisfy conservation of mass. That is, during conversion of the initial RNA into the first large product observed, the nuclease must have catalyzed multiple cleavage events. The pattern of exonuclease degradation is also distinctive as regards the sequences within which the 3′ termini of shortened transcripts occur. For most of the artificially arrested Pol III elongation complexes that we examined, the cleavage occurs just 5′ to an internal uridylate residue. Because the bond between a 3′-terminal uridylate and the penultimate nucleotide is not efficiently cleaved, we infer that in growing RNAs having an oligouridine stretch at the 3′ end, the last residue is not base paired to the DNA template. This suggests that at arrest sites, the 3′ transcript end becomes detached from the template due to the exceptional instability of (rU·dA) hybrids (17Martin F.H. Tinoco Jr., I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 2295-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Nucleolytic removal of several residues from the RNA 3′ terminus can effectively “reset” elongation by restoration of the DNA-RNA heteroduplex. Although elongation arrest, 3′ end misalignment, and retraction with restoration of alignment provide an attractive scenario for polymerase-nuclease function, our data suggest that the system possesses one additional element. The RNase H-like activity associated with yeast Pol III chooses to cut nascent RNA just 5′ of unstable RNA-DNA base pairs. A base pair even more unstable than those we have studied would result from base misincorporation. This line of reasoning suggests that Pol III nuclease may have a proofreading function similar to the well known 3′-5′ exonuclease of many DNA polymerases (18Kornberg A. DNA Replication. W. H.

Biol. 1982; 2: 1501-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was inserted into m13mp18 vector. To provide a Pol III template devoid of oligoA sequences, prior to the terminator, a chimeric gene was fabricated by placing an artificial terminator between a synthetic A block and the B block of yeast tRNALeu3 gene.SUP4 tRNATyr sequences preceded the A block. The resulting ∼1300-bp EcoRI-PstI fragment was subcloned into plasmid pUC119. Resulting circular double-stranded plasmid DNAs were used as a templates for polymerase chain reaction amplification of ∼400–500 bp linear double-stranded fragments carrying original, mutantSUP4 tRNATyr or chimeric Pol III genes. Oligonucleotides complementary to sequences ∼200 bp upstream of the starting site and ∼100 bp (or in the case of chimeric gene ∼200 bp) downstream of the termination site for transcription were used as primers. Because forward primer was synthesized using a biotin derivative as the first nucleotide at the 5′ end, the resulting polymerase chain reaction products had 5′-terminal biotin on the noncoding strand. Linear double-stranded DNA fragments obtained as described above were attached to the magnetic beads through streptavidin-biotin interactions. These DNA templates immobilized on magnetic beads were used in all transcription experiments. The average concentration of template was about 300 pmol/ml of beads.

Ternary complexes stalled at position +17 were formed in a 0.18-ml reaction mixture that contained 0.06 ml of P-11 extract, 18 pm linear double-stranded template attached to the magnetic beads, 0.5 mm ATP and CTP, 0.3 μm [α-32P]UTP in transcription buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (7.9), 100 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol) for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm. Ternary complexes were magnetically concentrated and washed three times with excessive volume of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (7.9), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol) prior to their use in cleavage assays or for further transcription in reaction mixtures lacking one or more of the nucleoside triphosphates. For the analysis of 5′-proximal products, transcript cleavage was performed at 25 °C in 20-μl reactions of transcription buffer. After incubation for various times, reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop-mixture (1 mg/ml Proteinase K, 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 0.25 mg/ml carrier RNA) followed by 65 °C incubation for 20 min, magnetic separation of RNA products from magnetic beads, ethanol precipitation, and drying. Samples were dissolved in 10 μl of loading buffer (100 mm NaAc (5.5), 8 m urea, 0.025% xylene cyanole dye) and loaded on 15%-polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) 7 m urea gels. The polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic separation was performed with TBE (45 mm Tris borate (8.0), 1 mm EDTA) as running buffer. For the analysis of short cleavage products, the 3′ end of RNA was labeled by using [α-32P]GTP as a substrate with the addition of other appropriate NTPs, when necessary. After purification of ternary complexes, cleavage was carried out in 6-μl reactions that were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm final concentration, followed by the addition of 3.6 μl of 98% formamide and heating at 95 °C for 30 min. After removal of the magnetic beads, samples were analyzed by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. For the analysis of cleavage concurrent with transcription, 17-mer ternary complexes were formed in the presence of “cold” ATP, CTP, and UTP, magnetically separated, and washed as described above. Transcription was then restarted by the addition of 0.2 mm CTP, ATP, and GTP and 2 μm[α-32P]UTP, and 0.5 mg/ml heparin to prevent reinitiation. Total volume of each reaction was 6 μl. After transcription was allowed to proceed for various times, reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm concentration and 1:3 v/v of 98% formamide. After heating at 95 °C for 30 min and magnetic separation, samples were analyzed by the autoradiography of dried 20% gels.

The fraction of poly(A) with a length of 17–21 nucleotides was obtained after MonoQ HR 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography separation in a 50 ml of 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl (7.2). After isopropanol precipitation, ethanol washing, and drying, RNA was dissolved in H2O. Concentration of poly(A)17–21 was 0.7 × 10−4m with 18 mm of retained NaCl.

To obtain sufficient amounts of the short 3′ products formed during transcription of the SUP4 gene we carried out the transcription reaction according to the procedure described above (see “Cleavage during Transcription”) in a scaled up variation. Elongation with unlabeled 17-mer ternary complexes was restarted in the presence of 0.2 mm CTP, ATP, GTP and 14 μm [α-32P]UTP and heparin (0.5 mg/ml; molecular weight, ∼6000) in a total reaction volume of 90 μl. To separate short products from full-length transcripts and heparin, we used Microcon 3 microconcentration, which allowed us to get rid of molecules longer than 10 nucleotides in length or larger than ∼3000 in molecular weight. Then 3′ products were desalted by G-10 gel filtration using spin columns pre-equilibrated with water. Digestion with cytidine-specific RNase CL3 was performed by incubation in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9) in the presence of 8 murea at 50 °C for 1 h. Pyrimidine-specific reactions with RNase A and guanosine-specific digestions with RNase T1 were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 25 °C for 1 h. Adenosine-specific reactions with RNase U2 were performed in 8 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.5) in the presence of 1.25 m urea at 50 °C for 1 h. Calf intestinal phosphatase was added, when necessary, and dephosphorylation was carried out at 25 °C for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 1:3 v/v of 98% formamide and heating at 95 °C for 30 min. Samples were loaded on sequencing size 20% polyacrylamide gels with appropriate marker ribooligonucleotides. Electrophoretic separation was carried out at 800 V, and after xylene cyanole had entered the gel, the voltage was being increased to 1200 V. This allowed us to obtain undistorted picture of short mono- and dinucleotide products with mobility that depended on length and sequence composition. We identified short 3′ products by their mobility relative to the mobility of corresponding ribooligonucleotide markers and by digestion with sequence-specific RNases (see Fig. 9). The main product had the mobility of pPypPy (lane 5), the major purine-containing products were pG*pU and pA*pU, with minor ones *pUpG/pPypPypPy and *pUpA (compare lane 5 with lanes 9 and11). Quantitative PhosphorImager analysis of various RNase digests of the 3′ products, with or without dephosphorylation, allowed us to evaluate the ratios between different pPypPy products that could not be resolved electrophoretically. Because two lower bands of dephosphorylated products disappeared when they were treated with pyrimidine-specific RNase A (see Fig. 9, compare lanes 6 and8), we concluded that they correspond to U*pU and C*pU products, which are present in equal amounts. According to the number of radioactive phosphate groups, we assumed that the intensity of *pU*pU product should be two times higher than that of pC*pU. Because we observed a ∼10% difference between the total 32P content in all pPypPy dinucleotide and the intensities of *pU*pU and pC*pU calculated from the amounts of U*pU and C*pU, we concluded that ∼45% of pPypPy product consists of *pU*pU, ∼45% consists of pC*pU, and ∼10% consists of *pUpC. We did not observe any noticeable digestion with the cytidine-specific RNase CL3 (see Fig. 9, comparelanes 1 and 3). We attribute this to the inability of this enzyme to work efficiently with substrates as short as dinucleotides. Dephosphorylation in the presence of guanosine-specific RNase T1 and adenosine-specific RNase U2 showed that the upper dephosphorylated band corresponds to G*pU and A*pU products (see Fig. 9, compare lane 6 withlanes 10 and 12). We explain the appearance of an additional unidentified band during dephosphorylation in the presence of RNase U2 (see Fig. 9, lane 12, band marked with an asterisk) by the known ability of this enzyme to catalyze oligonucleotide synthesis (25Uchida T. Arima T. Egami F. J. Biochem. 1970; 67: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In their studies of Pol III elongation complexes made with highly purified Pol III and a 3′ extended template, Whitehall et al. (8Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that stalled polymerase can efficiently degrade the nascent transcript. From their experiments with a ternary complex having UCUC at the 3′ end, these authors concluded that the hydrolytic activity cuts primarily in dinucleotide increments. They noticed that mononucleotides were also produced but at a lower frequency. To examine this process in detail, we studied cleavage reactions in Pol III transcription complexes stalled within many different sequence contexts. All complexes were formed in a promoter-dependent system that required Pol III factors for initiation. The transcripts were elongated up to the first G of the SUP4 gene (see Fig.1), and then the 17-mer ternary complexes were isolated magnetically, extensively washed, and “walked” to other positions of interest on the template. To generate additional types of 3′-terminal sequences, we mutagenized the SUP4 gene triply at positions +15, +16, and +17, thereby changing the TCT sequence in SUP4 to AAA in mutant template SUP4-AAA and to TTT in mutant SUP4-TTT (see Fig. 1). To detect the cleavage products that remain in ternary complex (5′ products) we labeled the 5′-proximal 17-mer with 32P. When the washed 17-mer complex was incubated with 7 mm Mg2+, both the rate and the pattern of cleavage were similar to those reported previously (8Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). In this experiment the sequence of the transcript 3′ end was the same as that made and cleaved by Whitehall et al. (8Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows the cleavage of 17-mer formed on the SUP4-AAA template. The observed pattern of 5′ products indicates cleavage at positions +16 and +14, with +14 as the preferred cut site. At first glance, this would appear to confirm the previously proposed dinucleotide mode of cleavage. However, the patterns of nuclease cleavage of 19- and 22-mer arrested products made on the SUP4 and SUP4-AAA templates (Figs.3, A and B, and 4, A and B) suggest that preferential cleavage occurs at certain sites. Comparison of the gel patterns with the SUP4 and SUP4-AAA sequences shows that selective cleavage occurs at the 5′-phosphate groups of uridine residues, beginning with the uridine nearest the 3′ end and then proceeding processively in the 3′-5′ direction. When a cluster of at least three consecutive A residues is present, Pol III can also cut 5′ to the central adenosine residue.Figure 3Cleavage of 19- (A) and 22-mer (B) transcript RNAs in ternary complexes formed on SUP4-template. 17-mer complexes were formed in the presence of ATP, CTP, and [α-32P]UTP and after purification were chased to positions +19 and +22 with GTP or (UTP + GTP + ATP), respectively.

SUP4-TTT transcripts limited to length 17 were made either with UTP, CTP, and ATP or with BUTP, CTP, and ATP. The mode of exonuclease degradation for the two stalled ternary complexes is shown in Fig. 5 (A andB). Cleavage of the bromouridine transcript occurs processively beginning next to the 3′-terminal bromouridine residue (position +17), whereas for uridine-containing RNA it occurs mainly at position +16 rather than +17. This difference is clearly seen after 1 and 5 min of incubation in the presence of Mg2+. Only a small fraction of the 3′-terminal uridine residues are recognized by the nuclease as a cleavage substrate, whereas bromouridine-terminal residues are cleaved more effectively. We attribute this difference in nuclease action between uridine RNA and bromouridine RNA to a greater extent of duplex formation by the 3′-terminal bromouridine than by the 3′-terminal uridine of uridine RNA. Such a difference is expected from the known enhancement in base pairing between dA·rBU in comparison with dA·rU (26Sonenberg N. Guertin D. Cleveland D. Trachsel H. Cell. 1981; 27: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Jacobs B.L. Mijamoto N.G. Samuel C.E. J. Interferon Res. 1988; 8: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This conclusion is further supported by differences in the ability of uridine- and bromouridine-containing ternary complexes to restart elongation. After 5 min of incubation with Mg2+, all bromouridine-ternary complexes were chased quantitatively into full-length RNA upon the addition of NTP substrates, whereas in the case of uridine-containing complexes, only products resulting from degradation (+16 and +15 ternary complexes) were elongated. The residual +17 complex was totally incompetent for elongation. These considerations suggest to us that the substrate for the Pol III nuclease activity is an RNA involved in duplex structure with template DNA. For transcripts that contain internal uridine stretches, substitution of uridine by bromouridine has the effect opposite to that noted above. The results of cleavage of uridine- and bromouridine-containing 19-mer RNAs formed on SUP4-TTT are shown in Fig. 5 (C andD). In the case of uridine-containing 19-mer, RNA cleavage occurs at each uridine residue starting from that nearest the 3′ end and proceeds sequentially (Fig. 5 C). The major cleavage sites observed were at positions +17, +16, and +15. In the case of bromouridine-containing 19-mer, similar sequential cleavage at positions +17, +16, and +15 was observed but to a significantly lesser extent at the last two positions than for the uridine-containing transcript (Fig. 5 D). The major cleavage site was at position +17. Hence, when a UUUU sequence was located at the very 3′ end of transcript (17-mer complex), it was not cleaved effectively, whereas for the 19-mer complex that has two guanosine residues at the 3′ end to stabilize the heteroduplex structure, this same oligouridine stretch was recognized as a nuclease substrate and cleaved at each uridylate. The opposite effect was observed for the (BU)4 stretch. When located at the 3′ end, it was readily cleaved, whereas when it is followed by two guanosines (in the 19-mer) the nuclease cut only at the 3′-most bromouridylate (position +17). These data imply that the nuclease activity is sensitive to the secondary structure of RNA-DNA heteroduplex rather than to the chemical structure of the ribonucleotide bases in selecting cleavage sites. To analyze the small products cleaved from the 3′ terminus of nascent RNA we made 19-, 22-, 24-, and 27-mer ternary complexes in which RNA was labeled with [α-32P]GTP. If the 5′ products of nuclease action upon 19- and 22-mer stalled transcripts were generated by a single nuclease cut, we would have expected to observe pUpC*pG*pG as the 3′ product of 19-mer cleavage and pUpA*pG and pUpC*pG*pG as products of 22-mer degradation. Instead of these, significantly shorter 3′ products were formed, suggesting cutting at additional positions (Fig.6). To further analyze the 3′ products formed concurrently with the 5′ products, we performed cleavage experiments with 24- and 27-mer ternary complexes. In these the uridine residues nearest the 3′ terminus were five and eight nucleotides away, respectively. Results on the cleavage of 24- and 27-mer ternary complexes are shown in Fig. 6 (C and D). Although a 5′ product was observed that corresponds to the expected cleavage at U20, 3′ products longer than two nucleotides were not detected. Hence, for all ternary complexes investigated we observed 5′ products corresponding to uridine-specific cleavage but multiple 3′ products that were shorter than expected. The data on 3′ products formed during cleavage of 19- and 22-mer are summarized in Table I. According to their mobility in the 20% polyacrylamide gel the 3′ products formed by 19-mer cleavage are identified as *pG, pC*pG, and *pG*pG (Fig.7 A, lane 2). In the case of 22-mer cleavage *pG, pC*pG, pA*pG, and *pG*pG 3′ products were produced (panel A, lane 7). When transcripts were synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]UTP *pU, *pUpC, and *pUpA 3′ cleavage products were observed in the case of 19-mer (panel B, lane 2) and *pU, *pUpC, *pUpA, trace amounts of *pUpApG, *pUpC*pU, and/or pC*pUpC 3′ products were formed during 22-mer cleavage (panel B, lane 6)Table IIdentification of 3′ cleavage products3′ cleavage products19-mer22-merPredictedpUpCpGpG pUpC pUpApCpUpApG pUpCpGpG pUpC pUpApCObservedpGpG pUpC pUpApUpApG pGpG pCpUpC pUpApCpG pU pUpApG pCpG pUpC pUpUpCpUpA pUpC pUpGpU pU Open table in a new tab To examine the possibility that the apparent contradiction between observed 5′ and 3′ products results from the action of an exogeneous contaminating RNase activity, we analyzed the effect of two potential nuclease inhibitors. These were UpA and poly(A)17–21, having 5′-phosphate and 3′-OH groups at the termini (Fig.7 A, lanes 4 and 3). The pattern of products was unaffected by the presence of exogenous RNA (compare with the cleavage in the presence of only Mg2+, Fig.7 A, lane 2). To test for the presence of a 5′-phosphate group, the 3′ products were also treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Fig. 7 A,"
https://openalex.org/W2043974909,"UvrB protein plays an essential role in the prokaryotic excision repair system. UvrB protein shows cryptic ATPase activity, DNA binding, helicase-like activity, and incision activity by interacting with UvrA or UvrC proteins. To reveal the structure-function relationship of this multifunctional protein, the domain structure of Thermus thermophilus UvrB protein (ttUvrB) was studied by limited proteolysis and denaturation experiments. Proteolytic profiles indicated that ttUvrB consists of four domains: the N domain (residues 2–105), M domain (106–455), C1 domain (456–590), and C2 domain (591–665). The properties of the proteolytic fragments indicated the involvement of the respective domains in the functions of the protein as follows: the N and C1 domains are necessary for ATPase activity, the C1 domain is indispensable for DNA binding, and the N and/or M domains are involved in UvrA binding. The structural stability of the C1 and C2 domains was higher than that of the N and M domains, which supports the proposed domain nature of ttUvrB. Based on these results and the crystal structure of PcrA helicase (Subramanya, H. S., Bird, L. E., Brannigan, J. A., and Wigley, D. B. (1996) Nature384, 379–383), the domain organization of ttUvrB was proposed. UvrB protein plays an essential role in the prokaryotic excision repair system.

(1996) Nature384, 379–383), the domain organization of ttUvrB was proposed. DNA reacts easily with various chemical compounds and with some physical agents like UV radiation in the environment. Such reactions cause alterations in the chemistry or the sequence of DNA, resulting in mutagenesis or even cell death. To avoid these alterations, living organisms possess repair systems such as direct repair, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and recombinational repair (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Nucleotide excision repair is one of the most important repair systems, since this system is involved in the repair of a wide range of DNA damage (2Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli this system involves at least six proteins: UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins, UvrD helicase (DNA helicase II), DNA polymerase I, and DNA ligase (2Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). UvrA and UvrB proteins form a UvrA2B complex in an ATP-dependent reaction. This complex recognizes a lesion in the DNA and a UvrA2B·DNA complex is formed, in which the DNA is unwound and kinked. The UvrB protein tightly binds to the damaged site, forming a UvrB·DNA preincision complex, and the UvrA protein dissociates from the complex. Then UvrC protein binds to the stable UvrB·DNA complex, and the UvrB and UvrC proteins make 3′ and 5′ incisions, respectively. After the incision event, UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I, and DNA ligase complete the repair by excision of the damaged nucleotide, repair synthesis, and DNA ligation, respectively. Years of study using E. coli indicate that UvrB protein is a multifunctional protein; it shows cryptic ATPase activity, DNA binding, helicase-like activity, and incision activity by interacting with UvrA or UvrC proteins (2Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Analyses of many mutants with amino acid substitutions and deletions have suggested the functional regions of the E. coli UvrB that are involved in binding of UvrA, UvrC, and DNA (3Seeley T.W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); however, the detailed relationship between its structure and function is still uncertain. In particular, there is only limited information available about the structural properties of UvrB protein. Generally, large proteins contain multiple domains (7Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 287-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In the case of a multifunctional protein, the respective functions are often associated with individual domains. UvrB protein is a relatively large multifunctional protein (about 80 kDa), so it is probable that UvrB protein is a multidomain protein. Protein domains can often be dissected by limited proteolysis if they are loosely assembled and the connecting segments are exposed to the environment. The domain structure can also be elucidated by denaturation experiments if the structural stabilities of the domains are different from each other. We have studied several repair systems including nucleotide excision repair by using an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8 (8Kato R. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9118-9612Google Scholar, 10Takamatsu S. Kato R.

Gene ( Amst .). 1996; 171: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). T. thermophilus is a Gram-negative eubacterium that can grow at temperatures over 75 °C (12Oshima T. Imahori K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1974; 24: 102-112Crossref Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In general, proteins isolated from T. thermophilus are heat-stable and suitable for physicochemical examination, including x-ray crystallographic analysis. T. thermophilus uvrA (11Yamamoto N. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Gene ( Amst .). 1996; 171: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and uvrB (9Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9118-9612Google Scholar) genes have already been cloned and sequenced. Since the amino acid sequences of T. thermophilus UvrA (ttUvrA) 1The abbreviations used are: ttUvrA, T. thermophilus UvrA protein; ttUvrB, T. thermophilus UvrB protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TRCF, transcription-repair coupling factor; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate; DTE, dithioerythritol; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: ttUvrA, T. thermophilus UvrA protein; ttUvrB, T. thermophilus UvrB protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TRCF, transcription-repair coupling factor; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate; DTE, dithioerythritol; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and UvrB (ttUvrB) proteins show homology with those of other prokaryotes includingE. coli, the mechanism of nucleotide excision repair inT. thermophilus is considered to be similar to that ofE. coli. Nevertheless, ttUvrB differs from E. coli in terms of its ability to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of UvrA protein and DNA (9Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9118-9612Google Scholar). Additionally, ttUvrB is stable from 5 to 80 °C at pH 7.5 and between pH 6 and pH 11 at 25 °C (9Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9118-9612Google Scholar). These features of ttUvrB are useful for elucidating not only its structural properties but also its structure-function relationship using the methods described above. In this study we conducted limited proteolysis and denaturation experiments of ttUvrB to reveal the organization of its structural domains. The results indicate that ttUvrB consists of at least four domains. Furthermore, three proteolytic fragments were purified, and their activities were assayed. Based on the results, we propose a model of the domain arrangement of UvrB protein and discuss the relationship between its structure and function. ttUvrB was prepared as described previously (9Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9118-9612Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined using an ε value of 60,000m−1 cm−1 at an absorbance maximum of around 277 nm. Enzymes and reagents were purchased as follows: trypsin from bovine pancreas (type IX), soybean trypsin inhibitor (type I-S), pyruvate kinase (type II), ATP, and ADP from Sigma; lactate dehydrogenase (grade II) from Toyobo Co.; 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) from Boehringer Mannheim; and poly(dT), with an average length of 270 bases, and poly(dA)· poly(dT) from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The concentrations of adenine nucleotides were determined from an ε259 value of 1.54 × 104m−1 cm−1. The concentration of poly(dT) was determined from an ε260 value of 8.52 × 103m−1 cm−1 (13Lee J.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7666-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thermolysin was a gift from Dr. Keiichi Fukuyama (Osaka University). All the other chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial sources. ttUvrB (15 μm) was treated with trypsin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at a protein to protease molar ratio of 100:1 or 20:1 for various times at 37 °C. To examine the effect of nucleotides on ttUvrB digestion, ttUvrB (5 μm) was treated in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 40 mm MgCl2 with trypsin at a protein to protease molar ratio of 200:1 in the presence of 20 mm ATP, AMP-PNP, or ADP. Proteolysis was stopped by adding trypsin inhibitor in a 2-fold excess to trypsin. ttUvrB (13 μm) was digested with thermolysin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm CaCl2 at a protein to protease molar ratio of 200:1 for various times at 60 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding diisopropylfluorophosphate in a 2-fold excess to thermolysin. The digests were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 10% gels (14Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The proteolytic fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-PSQ transfer membrane, Millipore) (15Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bands stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue were excised from the membrane, and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined with a gas-phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 473A). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the small fragment (Tc fragment) generated by tryptic digestion was determined as follows: ttUvrB (13 μm) was treated with trypsin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at a protein to protease molar ratio of 200:1 for 1 min at 37 °C; the reaction products were dialyzed in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA; and the dialysate, containing the mixture of the fragments, was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. ttUvrB (10 μm) was treated with trypsin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at a protein to protease molar ratio of 400:1 and 50:1 for 3 and 60 min at 37 °C, respectively. The reaction products were separated by high performance liquid chromatography using a MonoQ HR5/5 column (Pharmacia) eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (from 0.2 to 0.4m) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were collected and assessed for fragmentation by SDS-PAGE. The tryptic fragments obtained were dialyzed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol and stored at 4 °C. The concentrations of the tryptic fragments, T-1, T-3, and Tc fragments, were determined using an ε value of 53,000, 41,000, and 8,700 m−1 cm−1 at an absorbance maximum of around 277 nm, respectively, which were calculated by a previously described procedure (16Kuramitsu S. Hiromi K. Hayashi H. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). DNA binding was assayed by native PAGE (17Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15912) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out using poly(dT) as a substrate. Each reaction mixture for the binding assay, 5 μm ttUvrB or its fragments and 1 mm poly(dT) in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixture was then electrophoresed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions (17Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15912) Google Scholar), which was followed by staining of the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Hydrolysis of ATP was measured at 25 °C by an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay (18Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 76-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change of absorbance at 340 nm was measured with a Hitachi spectrophotometer, model U-3000. ATP was reacted with 0.2 or 0.5 μm ttUvrB or its fragments in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol (DTE), 2 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.32 mm NADH, 25 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 25 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase at 25 °C. To examine the interaction of ttUvrB or its fragments with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or ttUvrA, 50 μm poly(dT) or 0.4 μmttUvrA was added to each reaction mixture containing 0.2 μm ttUvrB. Interaction of ttUvrB or its fragments with ttUvrA was detected by native PAGE (17Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15912) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was composed of the indicated concentrations of ttUvrA, 5 μm ttUvrB or its fragments, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm ATP, and 10 mmMgCl2. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 5 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 in running buffer containing 5 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. The bands of proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out with a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model J-720W. CD spectra of 2 μm ttUvrB or its fragments were measured in a 1-mm cell in the far UV region between 200 and 250 nm, and the CD spectrum of 10 μm ttUvrB was measured in a 10-mm cell in the near UV region between 250 and 320 nm. Measurements were made after incubation at 25 °C for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTE, and the indicated concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). No further change in the ellipticity values was observed after incubation at various concentrations of GdnHCl for 24 h. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Hitachi spectrofluorometer, model F-4500. The spectra of 5 μm ttUvrB or its fragments were measured in a 5-mm cell with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm light at 25 °C after incubation at 25 °C for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTE, and the indicated concentration of GdnHCl. To reveal the organization of the structural domains, we analyzed the limited proteolysis process of ttUvrB (76 kDa) (9Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9118-9612Google Scholar) with two endoproteases of different substrate specificities, trypsin and thermolysin. Under mild conditions, endoproteases will cleave a protein preferentially at the sites exposed to the solvent, which are often within interdomain linkers. A time course of digestion by trypsin is shown in Fig.1 A. The fragments produced by trypsin digestion were observed as relatively discrete bands on the gels. Just after the addition of trypsin, a 66-kDa band appeared (lanes 3 and 6). As the band of intact ttUvrB disappeared, bands of two products with masses of 56 and 51 kDa occurred (lanes 4 and 5). After a 4-h incubation, the 66-kDa band had almost disappeared and a 40-kDa band had increased (lane 8). The major tryptic digest fragments with masses of 66, 56, 51, and 40 kDa were designated as T-1, T-2, T-3, and T-4, respectively. A time course of ttUvrB digestion by thermolysin is shown in Fig.1 B. At a very early time point, a 66-kDa band appeared as in the trypsin digest (lane 3). After incubation for 5 min, the intact band had disappeared and 57- and 50-kDa bands appeared (lane 4). As the reaction proceeded, the 66- and 57-kDa bands disappeared and instead a 36-kDa band appeared (lanes 5–7). The four major products with masses of 66, 57, 50, and 36 kDa were designated as Th-1, Th-2, Th-3, and Th-4, respectively. The array of digest fragments produced by thermolysin was similar to those obtained with trypsin in terms of number and fragment sizes. These results indicate that cleavages by both trypsin and thermolysin occurred at some specific sites of ttUvrB. To identify the cleavage sites, the N-terminal amino acid sequences of each band were determined. Both the T-1 and T-3 bands started at Thr2, which is also the N-terminal residue of the intact protein. This indicates that for the T-1 and T-3 fragments the cleavages occurred in the C-terminal region. Under mild conditions (ttUvrB to trypsin ratio of 200:1, for 1 min), only T-1 and small fragments were yielded (see Fig. 5 A). The digest obtained under such mild conditions was directly subjected to sequencing and was shown to contain two peptides: one began from Thr2 and the other from Ala589. Residue 588 is arginine, so we concluded that cleavage under these conditions occurred between Arg588 and Ala589. The fragment starting from Ala589 was designated as Tc fragment. The T-4 band started at Asp109, indicating that the cleavage site was the Lys108-Asp109 bond. Sequence analysis of the T-2 band showed the presence of two fragments starting from Thr2 and Asp109. A comparison of the T-2 fragment and the T-3 and T-4 fragments suggested that the putative fragments starting from Thr2 and Asp109 in the T-2 band were longer than the T-3 and T-4 fragments, respectively. Similarly, N-terminal sequences of the bands obtained by thermolysin digestion were determined. Both the Th-1 and Th-3 fragments started from Thr2, indicating cleavages in the C-terminal region. Both the Th-2 and Th-4 fragments started from Leu104 or Ile106. These cleavages were consistent with the substrate specificity of thermolysin, which predominantly hydrolyzes peptide bonds involving the amino groups of the hydrophobic amino acids Leu, Ile, Met, Phe, Trp, and Val (19Matsubara H. Sasaki R.M. Singer A. Jukes T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 115: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The locations of these fragments in ttUvrB are summarized in Fig.2. The C-terminal amino acid residues of the fragments were estimated from their apparent mass assessed by their relative mobility on the gels and from the substrate specificity of each protease. As shown in Fig. 2, the cleavages by trypsin and thermolysin occurred at sites very close to each other, although the substrate specificities of these proteases differ. In particular, it should be emphasized that thermolysin, a relatively nonspecific protease, produced only a limited number of fragments. The discreteness and restricted distribution of the cleavage sites suggest that they are located in the exposed regions between the domains. Based on the time-dependent changes in the proteolytic products, the initial cleavage by the proteases is considered to have been at around residue 590. The next cleavages are thought to have occurred at around residues 105 and 455 with similar lability. The presence of three preferential cleavage sites suggests that ttUvrB is organized into at least four domains: the N terminus to residue 105, residues 106–455, residues 456–590, and residue 591 to the C terminus (the indicated residue numbers represent the vicinity of that residue). In the following text, these domains are referred to as the N, M, C1, and C2 domains, respectively. In the presence of ATP, AMP-PNP, or ADP, the proteolysis pattern of ttUvrB with trypsin was essentially unaltered compared with that in their absence (data not shown); however, the rate of the cleavage reaction was affected (Fig. 1 C). Addition of ATP significantly lowered the rate of cleavage of the intact protein. AMP-PNP, an unhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, had little effect on the cleavage rate. ADP had no effect on the cleavage rate. These results suggest that binding of ATP or its analogue to ttUvrB causes certain conformational changes that alter the lability of the C1-C2 interdomain linker to trypsin. Addition of poly(dT) or poly(dA)·poly(dT) had no effect on the digestion pattern and had little, if any, effect on the cleavage rate (data not shown). To further investigate the domain structure, the stability of ttUvrB in the presence of denaturants was examined. The effect on ttUvrB of increasing the GdnHCl concentration was studied by CD and fluorescence measurements. As shown in Fig.3 A, the intensity of the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm decreased as the denaturant concentration was increased. The denaturation curve at 222 nm contained two highly cooperative transitions. The midpoints of the first and second transitions were at 2.5 and 4.0 m GdnHCl, respectively. In addition to these transitions, a gradual change was observed from 5.0 to 7.0 m GdnHCl; however, this was less cooperative than those at lower concentrations. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the denaturation curve at 295 nm consisted of two large transitions, whose midpoints were at 2.5 and 4.0m GdnHCl, close to those at 222 nm. Additional small changes were observed in the regions from 0 to 0.5 m GdnHCl and above 5.0 m GdnHCl. No significant change at 0 to 0.5m was observed in the far UV region. This discrepancy suggests that only local changes around aromatic amino acid residues occurred at 0 to 0.5 m GdnHCl. As a consequence, the results obtained from CD measurements indicate the presence of the stable intermediate states in the denaturation process of ttUvrB. To further examine ttUvrB denaturation by GdnHCl, fluorescence measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 2, ttUvrB contains three tryptophan residues at 263, 545, and 622 (9Kato R. Yamamoto N. Kito K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9118-9612Google Scholar). The emission spectrum in the absence of the denaturant is shown in Fig.6 B. As shown in Fig.4 A, the emission maximum shifted toward higher wavelengths as the denaturant concentration was increased. The denaturation curve of the wavelength at the maximum intensity consisted of a small change and a large transition. Similar changes were also observed in the denaturation curve of fluorescence intensity at 340 nm (Fig. 4 B). The midpoint of the large transition was at 4.0 m GdnHCl, at which concentration large transitions were observed in the CD measurements. A small change at 0 to 1.0 m GdnHCl was also observed in the near UV CD spectra. These results support the notion that a local structural change surrounding the aromatic residues, including the tryptophan residues, occurred at 0 to 1.0 m GdnHCl. At around 2.5m GdnHCl, at which the first transition was observed in the far UV CD spectra, little change was observed in the fluorescence spectra. This discrepancy suggests that the region without tryptophan residues have lower stabilities than the region containing tryptophan residues.Figure 4Effect of GdnHCl concentration on fluorescence of ttUvrB. ttUvrB (5 μm) was denatured at the indicated GdnHCl concentrations.

If the domains of ttUvrB have distinct stabilities, the protein might have folded and unfolded domains in the intermediate state; however, it is also possible that the intermediate state is a molten globule state. It is generally agreed that a molten globule state has a high content of secondary structure and diminished tertiary contacts compared with the native state (20Kuwajima K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Our CD and fluorescence spectroscopy results suggest that at around 3.0 m GdnHCl ttUvrB largely retained its tertiary structure around the tryptophan residues, indicating that the intermediate state corresponds to a protein with some domains unfolded. To verify this notion, a fluorescent dye, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS), was used. The fluorescence of ANS is enhanced upon specific binding to a hydrophobic surface, such as the surfaces exposed in a molten globule state (21Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar). In the case of ttUvrB, no increase in ANS fluorescence was observed during the denaturation process (date not shown). These observations strongly suggest that the intermediate state of ttUvrB at around 3.0m is not a molten globule state. Therefore, we think that GdnHCl denaturation of ttUvrB is a stepwise unfolding of individual domains. In other words, these results indicate that ttUvrB consists of domains of at least two different stabilities. To examine the functions of the four domains identified by limited proteolysis, we tried to purify the tryptic fragments. The digestion of ttUvrB with trypsin under mild conditions (ttUvrB to trypsin molar ratio of 400:1, for 3 min) produced only two fragments, the T-1 and Tc fragments. These fragments were separated by ion exchange chromatography using a MonoQ HR5/5 column. As shown in Fig. 5 A, peak 1contained only the T-1 fragment. Peak 2 was shown to contain only the Tc fragment by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and native PAGE (Fig. 7). The digest containing T-1, T-2, and T-3 fragments (ttUvrB to trypsin molar ratio of 50:1, for 60 min) was also applied to the MonoQ HR5/5 column, but only two peaks were obtained (Fig.5 B). Peak 1 contained only the T-3 fragment, whereas peak 2 contained both the T-1 and T-2 fragments. We were unable to separate the T-1 and T-2 fragments by other chromatographic techniques. To examine the structural properties of the purified T-1, T-3, and Tc fragments, the CD and fluorescence spectra were measured (Fig.6). The α-helix content of ttUvrB, T-1, T-3, and Tc fragments was estimated to be about 47, 38, 31 and 51%, respectively, using the method of Chen et al. (22Chen Y.H. Yan J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). The purified T-1, T-3, and Tc fragments contained two, one, and one tryptophan residues, respectively. All three fragments showed fluorescence emission spectra excited at 295 nm, although their intensities varied. The wavelengths of the maximum emissions for the T-3 and Tc fragments were longer than that of ttUvrB, suggesting that the tryptophan residues within these fragments are in more hydrophilic environments than those within ttUvrB. The results of fluorescence experiment including the denaturation experiment of ttUvrB and its fragments (see Fig. 11) suggest that each fragment retains its tertiary structure, supporting the hypothesis that the limited proteolysis occurred within the interdomain linkers. The ability of ttUvrB and the purified fragments to bind DNA was assayed by native PAGE (17Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15912) Google Scholar). Adding poly(dT) to ttUvrB caused the band of the protein to smear upwards (Fig.7). This decrease in mobility indicates that ttUvrB can bind to ssDNA; however, it should be noted that a discrete band could not be obtained despite of the high concentration (1 mm) of poly(dT). This observation indicates that ttUvrB gradually dissociated from the poly(dT) during the electrophoresis. Thus, DNA binding of ttUvrB is considered to be relatively weak. Adding poly(dT) to the T-1 fragment also caused the band to smear upwards, but less extensively. This observation indicates that the T-1 fragment can bind to ssDNA but with a lower affinity than that of the intact protein. This result also suggests that the C2 domain is involved in, but is not essential for, binding to ssDNA. In contrast, poly(dT) caused no change in the mobility of T-3 or Tc bands,"
https://openalex.org/W1991583885,"The <i>Drosophila</i> proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene promoter contains at least three transcriptional regulatory elements, the URE (upstream regulatory element), DRE (DNA replication-related element), and E2F recognition sites. In nuclear extracts of <i>Drosophila</i> Kc cells, we detected a novel protein factor(s), CFDD (common regulatory factor for DNA replication and DREF genes) that appeared to recognize two unique nucleotide sequences (5′-CGATA and 5′-CAATCA) and bind to three sites in the PCNA gene promoter. These sites were located at positions −84 to −77 (site 1), −100 to −93 (site 2) and −134 to −127 (site 3) with respect to the transcription initiation sites. Sites 2 and 3 overlapped with DRE and URE, respectively, and the 5′-CGATA matched with the reported recognition sequence of BEAF-32 (boundary element-associated factor of 32 kDa). Detailed analyses of CFDD recognition sequences and experiments with specific antibodies to DREF (DRE-binding factor) and BEAF-32 suggest that CFDD is different from DREF, UREF (URE-binding factor) and BEAF-32. A UV cross-linking experiment revealed that polypeptides of ∼76 kDa in the nuclear extract interact directly with the CFDD site 1 sequence. Transient expression assays of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in Kc cells transfected with PCNA promoter-CAT fusion genes carrying mutations in CFDD site 1 and examination of <i>lacZ</i> expression from PCNA promoter-<i>lacZ</i> fusion genes carrying mutations in site 1, introduced into flies by germ line transformation, revealed that CFDD site 1 plays an important role for the promoter activity both in cultured cells and in living flies. In addition to the PCNA gene, multiple CFDD sites were found in promoters of the DNA polymerase α and DREF genes, and CFDD binding to the DREF promoter was confirmed. Therefore, CFDD may play important roles in regulation of<i>Drosophila</i> DNA replication-related genes."
https://openalex.org/W1992804228,"The cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain of the human insulin receptor (hIR) contains a single copy of the tetrameric amino acid sequence Asn-Pro-Glu-Tyr (NPEY) (residues 969-972 in the exon 11-containing B-isoform), which exists in the context of NPXY. In this study, we examined the role of NPEY972 in mediating insulin signal transduction and cellular biological effects. Transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing either the wild-type hIR-B isoform (hIR.WT) or a mutant receptor lacking the NPEY972 sequence (hIRDeltaNPEY) and control Chinese hamster ovary.Neo cells were used to comparatively analyze the following insulin effects: in vivo receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation and kinase activity, signal transduction to downstream signaling molecules, and stimulation of glycogen and DNA synthesis. The results showed that in comparison to hIR.WT, the hIRDeltaNPEY mutant demonstrated the following: (a) normal insulin-mediated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, but approximately 50% reduction in phosphorylation of p185-(insulin receptor substrate-1) and binding of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), (b) an enhanced stimulation of PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity, (c) a complete inability to phosphorylate Shc, (d) minimal impairment of insulin sensitivity for glycogen synthesis, and (e) an augmented response to insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis via a high capacity, low sensitivity pathway. These results demonstrate the following: 1) the NPEY972 sequence is important but not absolutely essential for coupling of hIR kinase to insulin receptor substrate-1 and p85 or for mediating insulin's metabolic and mitogenic effects, 2) the NPEY972 sequence is necessary for Shc phosphorylation, and 3) the absence of Shc phosphorylation releases the constraints on maximal insulin-stimulated mitogenic response, thus indicating that alternate signaling pathway(s) exist for this insulin action. This alternate pathway appears to be associated with enhanced activation of PI 3-kinase and is of high capacity and low sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1996297965,"We demonstrate that p107 and p130 immune complexes exhibit kinase activity. We have tested such immune complexes with four substrates commonly utilized to assay Cdk activity, including all three known members of the retinoblastoma family. Immunodepletion revealed this kinase activity could be abolished by removal of either cyclin A or Cdk2 but was unaffected by removal of Cdk4 or any D-type cyclin. The appearance of p107 associated activity followed the accumulation of p107 protein. In contrast, the kinase activity associated with p130 immune complexes became apparent after mid-G1, coincident with p130 hyperphosphorylation. GST-Rb, GST-p107, and GST-p130 (where GST indicates glutathioneS-transferase) were equally suitable substrates in p107 and p130 immune complex kinase assays, yielding activity equal to 25% of the cyclin A activity present. The p107 and p130 associated activity was unable to phosphorylate histone H1, suggesting the p107 and p130 associated cyclin A/Cdk2 may represent a distinct pool with a distinct substrate specificity. The p107 and p130 associated activity was released from the immune complexes upon incubation with ATP and Mg2+ and exhibited the same substrate preference observed with the untreated immune complex. Our data suggest that p107 and p130 recognize, or form by association, a distinct pool of cyclin A/Cdk2 that preferentially phosphorylates retinoblastoma family members."
https://openalex.org/W2040702867,"Cytochromes P450 (P450) are anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane sequence with the catalytic domain facing the cytoplasmic side. Within the peptide sequence linking these two domains in P450 2C2 is a glycine-rich region from residues 22 to 28. To examine the role of this region, deletion and substitution mutations were constructed, and the activities and spectral properties were determined for the mutant proteins expressed in COS-1 cells, insect cells, and bacteria. Deletion of residues 22 to 28 or substitution of 7 valines for this region inactivated the proteins in COS-1 cells, and no P450 species was detected for these mutations in bacteria or insect cells. Substitution of the three glycine residues with alanine or proline or the entire sequence from 22 to 28 with 7 alanines did not reduce lauric acid hydroxylase activity of the proteins expressed in COS-1 cells. Reducing the number of alanines substituted to 4, 3, and 2 progressively decreased activity in COS-1 cells to undetectable levels when 2 alanines were substituted. The loss of activity in COS-1 cells correlated with decreased expression of hemoprotein with a reduced difference spectrum of 450 nm (P450 species) and a corresponding increase in the inactive P420 species in insect cells and bacteria. The activities expressed per nanomole of P450 in insect microsomes were similar for P450 2C2 and the alanine substitution mutants, including the mutant with 2 alanines which was inactive in COS-1 cells. The rates of conversion of P450 to P420 resulting from incubation at 48 degrees C in vitro were not changed sufficiently to explain the increase in expressed P420 observed for the mutants with 3 or 7 alanines substituted. These data are consistent with a role for the residue 22-28 region as a linker that facilitates the folding of P450; however, once the protein is properly folded into the functional P450 species, this region has little influence on the stability and activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2150150575,"Methionine adenosyltransferase is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the only known route of biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, the major methyl group donor in cell metabolism. In mammals, two different methionine adenosyltransferases exist: one is confined to the liver, and the other one is distributed in extrahepatic tissues. In the present study, we report the cloning of the 5′-flanking region of liver-specific methionine adenosyltransferase gene from rat. Two closely spaced sites for transcriptional initiation were identified by primer extension analysis. The major transcription start site was determined to be 29 nucleotides downstream from the putative TATA box. Transient transfection assays of constructs containing sequentially deleted 5′-flanking sequences fused to the luciferase gene showed that rat hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase promoter was able to efficiently drive reporter expression not only in liver-type cells (rat hepatoma H35 cells and human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells) but also in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Two regions spanning nucleotides −1251 to −958 and −197 to +65 were found to be crucial for the promoter efficiency. The distal upstream region contains elements that positively regulate promoter activity in H35 and HepG2 cells but are ineffective in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Eight protein binding sites were characterized in both regions by DNase I footprinting analysis. Two of these elements, sites A and B, located in the distal region, were found to be essential for the regulation of promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and competition experiments showed that site A is recognized by an NF1 protein. Site B was able to interact with a member of HNF-3 family when nuclear extracts from rat liver and H35 cells were used in the in vitro assay, but an additional binding activity to an NHF1-like protein was obtained with the hepatoma cell extracts. It is suggested that this differential binding can contribute to the cell specificity of promoter function."
