https://openalex.org/W2008718743,"From the adult lens of Triturus viridescens, a fraction of proteins was isolated which corresponds to γ-crystallins of higher vertebrates. Tests by immunoelectrophoresis indicate that the antiserum against this fraction reacts with γ-crystallins, but not with α- or β-crystallins. With this antiserum, an immunofluorescent reagent has been prepared for detection of γ-crystallins from newts. In the normal lens of the adult newt, these crystallins are detected in fiber cells and fiber material, but not in the epithelial cells. During transformation of the iris into the lens after lens removal, the staining reaction is negative in the regenerating tissue up to the time the prospective primary fiber cells begin to elongate. Subsequently, without exception those cells in fiber differentiation indicate a γ-crystallin reaction. When the secondary fiber cells are produced at the equatorial zone of the regenerating lens, they also begin to show a γ-crystallin reaction. Thus, γ-crystallins characterize fiber differentiation."

An amino-terminal octadecapeptide containing the sole methionine residue occurs in many but not all immunoglobulins of antigenic type I. The carboxyl-terminal octapeptide appears invariant in type I proteins and ends in cysteine, which may have a cross-linking function."

Suzuki et al.4 have also shown that the structure of colistin A is identical with that of polymyxin B1, except that the D-Phe in the latter is replaced by D-Leu (that is, 1; R = (+)-6-methyloctanoyl, X = D-Leu)."

https://openalex.org/W2090241254,"Mycoplasma of the ‘N’ strain are frequently isolated from turkey poults affected with airsacculitis but free of Mycoplasma gallisepticum1. Research on the ‘N’ strain has been impeded by the presence of a high proportion of turkey poults with airsacculitis in all breeding flocks examined1,2,4,5, by the difficulty of culturing and identifying the Mycoplasma strains, and by the lack of a practical serologic test. This communication describes the establishment of a small nucleus of ‘N’-free turkeys from a commercial breeding flock known to carry ‘N’ Mycoplasma. Hens and toms for the production of ‘N’-free poults were selected from the parent flock by serology and culture."

This communication concerns their more complete identification by silica-gel thin-layer chromatography."

The complex nature of the factors that are involved in the separation of marrow cells by sedimentation technique are emphasized in his comprehensive paper. Tsuji reported a method for separation of guinea-pig bone marrow cells by using layers of gum acacia solutions of varying densities2. Myeloid cells were obtained in practically pure state. Gradient techniques involving several kinds of solutions, such as sucrose and bovine plasma albumin, have been used by others3."

Macht demonstrated in a large number of papers that, under standard experimental conditions, sera from healthy persons inhibit the growth of Lupinus albus roots. The sera from patients suffering from various diseases, especially cancer, were also investigated by Rønnike1. So far as we know, no experiments of this type have previously been made in children. From this point of view, we investigated 113 sera from children and healthy adolescents as well as 273 sera from patients affected by various diseases. In 113 sera from healthy individuals aged 9 months to 23 years we found that, with sera from individuals of increasing age and height, the growth of roots of Lupinus albus was increasingly inhibited. We found also that there is no substantial difference between the average inhibition caused by sera from boys or girls. Fig. 1 summarizes our experiments."
