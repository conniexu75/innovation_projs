https://openalex.org/W2032295238,"The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho is implicated in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which results in contraction of smooth muscle and interaction of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells. The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound, active form of RhoA (GTP.RhoA) specifically interacted with the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, which regulates the extent of phosphorylation of MLC. Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which is activated by GTP.RhoA, phosphorylated MBS and consequently inactivated myosin phosphatase. Overexpression of RhoA or activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of MBS and MLC. Thus, Rho appears to inhibit myosin phosphatase through the action of Rho-kinase."

Tetrahedral, cubic, irregular-prismatic, icosahedral, and cubo-octahedral particle shapes were observed, whose distribution was dependent on the concentration ratio of the capping polymer material to the platinum cation. Controlling the shape of platinum nanoparticles is potentially important in the field of catalysis."

A monoclonal antibody raised to the mouse homolog of CD34 (mCD34) was used to purify mouse HSCs to near homogeneity. Unlike in humans, primitive adult mouse bone marrow HSCs were detected in the mCD34 low to negative fraction. Injection of a single mCD34(lo/-), c-Kit+, Sca-1(+), lineage markers negative (Lin-) cell resulted in long-term reconstitution of the lymphohematopoietic system in 21 percent of recipients. Thus, the purified HSC population should enable analysis of the self-renewal and multilineage differentiation of individual HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2093778976,"A class of thermoelectric materials has been synthesized with a thermoelectric figure of merit ZT (where T is temperature and Z is a function of thermopower, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity) near 1 at 800 kelvin. Although these materials have not been optimized, this value is comparable to the best ZT values obtained for any previously studied thermoelectric material. Calculations indicate that the optimized material should have ZT values of 1.4. These ternary semiconductors have the general formula RM4X12 (where R is lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, or europium; M is iron, ruthenium, or osmium; and X is phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony) and represent a new approach to creating improved thermoelectric materials. Several alloys in the composition range CeFe4-xCoxSb12 or LaFe4-xCoxSb12 (0 < x < 4) have large values of ZT."
https://openalex.org/W1965480387,"Data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project and other helioseismic experiments provide a test for models of stellar interiors and for the thermodynamic and radiative properties, on which the models depend, of matter under the extreme conditions found in the sun. Current models are in agreement with the helioseismic inferences, which suggests, for example, that the disagreement between the predicted and observed fluxes of neutrinos from the sun is not caused by errors in the models. However, the GONG data reveal subtle errors in the models, such as an excess in sound speed just beneath the convection zone. These discrepancies indicate effects that have so far not been correctly accounted for; for example, it is plausible that the sound-speed differences reflect weak mixing in stellar interiors, of potential importance to the overall evolution of stars and ultimately to estimates of the age of the galaxy based on stellar evolution calculations."
https://openalex.org/W2064615886,"Double-ended aryl dithiols [alpha,alpha'-xylyldithiol (XYL) and 4,4'-biphenyldithiol] formed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold(111) substrates and were used to tether nanometer-sized gold clusters deposited from a cluster beam. An ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunneling microscope was used to image these nanostructures and to measure their current-voltage characteristics as a function of the separation between the probe tip and the metal cluster. At room temperature, when the tip was positioned over a cluster bonded to the XYL SAM, the current-voltage data showed ""Coulomb staircase"" behavior. These data are in good agreement with semiclassical predictions for correlated single-electron tunneling and permit estimation of the electrical resistance of a single XYL molecule (approximately18 &plusmn; 12 megohms)."
https://openalex.org/W1974487446,"The addition of ions in micromolar (CaCl2 or HCl) or millimolar (NaCl) concentrations can change the morphology of “crew-cut” aggregates of amphiphilic block copolymers in dilute solutions. In addition to spherical, rodlike, and univesicular or lamellar aggregates, an unusual large compound vesicle morphology can be obtained from a single block copolymer. Some features of the spontaneously formed large compound vesicles may make them especially useful as vehicles for delivering drugs and as models of biological cells. Gelation of a dilute spherical micelle solution can also be induced by ions as the result of the formation of a cross-linked “pearl necklace” morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2007110714,"Rapamycin, a potent immunosuppressive agent, binds two proteins: the FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and the FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP). A crystal structure of the ternary complex of human FKBP12, rapamycin, and the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain of human FRAP at a resolution of 2.7 angstroms revealed the two proteins bound together as a result of the ability of rapamycin to occupy two different hydrophobic binding pockets simultaneously. The structure shows extensive interactions between rapamycin and both proteins, but fewer interactions between the proteins. The structure of the FRB domain of FRAP clarifies both rapamycin-independent and -dependent effects observed for mutants of FRAP and its homologs in the family of proteins related to the ataxia-telangiectasia mutant gene product, and it illustrates how a small cell-permeable molecule can mediate protein dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2004101002,"Analyses of fossil mammal faunas from 2945 localities in the United States demonstrate that the geographic ranges of individual species shifted at different times, in different directions, and at different rates in response to late Quaternary environmental fluctuations. The geographic pattern of faunal provinces was similar for the late Pleistocene and late Holocene, but differing environmental gradients resulted in dissimilar species composition for these biogeographic regions. Modern community patterns emerged only in the last few thousand years, and many late Pleistocene communities do not have modern analogs. Faunal heterogeneity was greater in the late Pleistocene."
https://openalex.org/W2037796326,"The mechanisms underlying the profound suppression of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) accompanying measles are unclear. Interleukin-12 (IL-12), derived principally from monocytes and macrophages, is critical for the generation of CMI. Measles virus (MV) infection of primary human monocytes specifically down-regulated IL-12 production. Cross-linking of CD46, a complement regulatory protein that is the cellular receptor for MV, with antibody or with the complement activation product C3b similarly inhibited monocyte IL-12 production, providing a plausible mechanism for MV-induced immunosuppression. CD46 provides a regulatory link between the complement system and cellular immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1992470362,"Pore fluids from the upper 60 meters of sediment 3000 meters below the surface of the tropical Atlantic indicate that the oxygen isotopic composition (delta18O) of seawater at this site during the last glacial maximum was 0.8 &plusmn; 0.1 per mil higher than it is today. Combined with the delta18O change in benthic foraminifera from this region, the elevated ratio indicates that the temperature of deep water in the tropical Atlantic Ocean was 4&deg;C colder during the last glacial maximum. Extrapolation from this site to a global average suggests that the ice volume contribution to the change in delta18O of foraminifera is 1.0 per mil, which partially reconciles the foraminiferal oxygen isotope record of tropical sea surface temperatures with estimates from Barbados corals and terrestrial climate proxies."
https://openalex.org/W2015090760,"The three-dimensional structure of the amino-terminal core domain (residues 1 through 151) of the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) capsid protein has been solved by multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure is unlike those of previously characterized viral coat proteins and is composed of seven α helices, two β hairpins, and an exposed partially ordered loop. The domain is shaped like an arrowhead, with the β hairpins and loop exposed at the trailing edge and the carboxyl-terminal helix projecting from the tip. The proline residue Pro1 forms a salt bridge with a conserved, buried aspartate residue (Asp51), which suggests that the amino terminus of the protein rearranges upon proteolytic maturation. The binding site for cyclophilin A, a cellular rotamase that is packaged into the HIV-1 virion, is located on the exposed loop and encompasses the essential proline residue Pro90. In the free monomeric domain, Pro90 adopts kinetically trapped cis and trans conformations, raising the possibility that cyclophilin A catalyzes interconversion of the cis- and trans-Pro90 loop structures."
https://openalex.org/W2119078215,"Helioseismology requires nearly continuous observations of the oscillations of the solar surface for long periods of time in order to obtain precise measurements of the sun's normal modes of oscillation. The GONG project acquires velocity images from a network of six identical instruments distributed around the world. The GONG network began full operation in October 1995. It has achieved a duty cycle of 89 percent and reduced the magnitude of spectral artifacts by a factor of 280 in power, compared with single-site observations. The instrumental noise is less than the observed solar background."
https://openalex.org/W2034426631,"Microbial mats discovered in a ground-water ecosystem in southern Romania contain chemoautotrophic bacteria that fix inorganic carbon, using hydrogen sulfide as an energy source. Analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes showed that this chemoautotrophic production is the food base for 48 species of cave-adapted terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, 33 of which are endemic to this ecosystem. This is the only cave ecosystem known to be supported by in situ autotrophic production, and it contains the only terrestrial community known to be chemoautotrophically based."
https://openalex.org/W2028198182,"A thermal reaction of Li3N and GaCl3 in which benzene was used as the solvent under pressure has been carried out for the preparation of 30-nanometer particles of gallium nitride (GaN) at 280&deg;C. This temperature is much lower than that of traditional methods, and the yield of GaN reached 80%. The x-ray powder diffraction pattern indicated that sample was mainly hexagonal-phase GaN with a small fraction of rocksalt-phase GaN, which has a lattice constant a = 4.100 angstroms. This rocksalt structure, which had been observed previously only under high pressure (at least 37 gigapascals) was observed directly with high-resolution electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2056190679,"The basic magnetic properties of three-dimensional nanostructured materials can be drastically different from those of a continuous film. High-resolution magnetic force microscopy studies of magnetic submicrometer-sized cobalt dots with geometrical dimensions comparable to the width of magnetic domains reveal a variety of intricate domain patterns controlled by the details of the dot geometry. By changing the thickness of the dots, the width of the geometrically constrained magnetic domains can be tuned. Concentric rings and spirals with vortex configurations have been stabilized, with particular incidence in the magnetization reversal process as observed in the ensemble-averaged hysteresis loops."
https://openalex.org/W1991796807,"Splitting of the sun's global oscillation frequencies by large-scale flows can be used to investigate how rotation varies with radius and latitude within the solar interior. The nearly uninterrupted observations by the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) yield oscillation power spectra with high duty cycles and high signal-to-noise ratios. Frequency splittings derived from GONG observations confirm that the variation of rotation rate with latitude seen at the surface carries through much of the convection zone, at the base of which is an adjustment layer leading to latitudinally independent rotation at greater depths. A distinctive shear layer just below the surface is discernible at low to mid-latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2034063874,"Analyses of air sampled from remote locations across the globe reveal that tropospheric chlorine attributable to anthropogenic halocarbons peaked near the beginning of 1994 and was decreasing at a rate of 25 ± 5 parts per trillion per year by mid-1995. Although bromine from halons was still increasing in mid-1995, the summed abundance of these halogens in the troposphere is decreasing. To assess the effect of this trend on stratospheric ozone, estimates of the future stratospheric abundance of ozone-depleting gases were made for mid-latitude and polar regions on the basis of these tropospheric measurements. These results suggest that the amount of reactive chlorine and bromine will reach a maximum in the stratosphere between 1997 and 1999 and will decline thereafter if limits outlined in the adjusted and amended Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer are not exceeded in future years."
https://openalex.org/W2042055643,"C2 domains are found in many proteins involved in membrane traffic or signal transduction. Although C2 domains are thought to bind calcium ions, the structural basis for calcium binding is unclear. Analysis of calcium binding to C2 domains of synaptotagmin I and protein kinase C-beta by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed a bipartite calcium-binding motif that involves the coordination of two calcium ions by five aspartate residues located on two separate loops. Sequence comparisons indicated that this may be a widely used calcium-binding motif, designated here as the C2 motif."
https://openalex.org/W2023456894,"Protonated and deuterated ices (H2O and D2O) compressed to a maximum pressure of 210 gigapascals at 85 to 300 kelvin exhibit a phase transition at 60 gigapascals in H2O ice (70 gigapascals in D2O ice) on the basis of their infrared reflectance spectra determined with synchrotron radiation. The transition is characterized by soft-mode behavior of the nu3 O-H or O-D stretch below the transition, followed by a hardening (positive pressure shift) above it. This behavior is interpreted as the transformation of ice phase VII to a structure with symmetric hydrogen bonds. The spectroscopic features of the phase persisted to the maximum pressures (210 gigapascals) of the measurements, although changes in vibrational mode coupling were observed at 150 to 160 gigapascals."
https://openalex.org/W1987174800,"Circulating lymphocytes gain access to lymph nodes owing to their ability to initiate rolling along specialized high endothelial venules (HEVs). One mechanism of rolling involves L-selectin binding to peripheral node addressin (PNAd) on HEVs. Activated platelets are shown to bind to circulating lymphocytes and to mediate rolling in HEVs, in vivo, through another molecule, P-selectin, which also interacts with PNAd. In vitro, activated platelets enhanced tethering of lymphocytes to PNAd and sustained lymphocyte rolling, even in the absence of functional L-selectin. Thus, a platelet pathway operating through P-selectin provides a second mechanism for lymphocyte delivery to HEVs."
https://openalex.org/W2023471512,"A flat epitaxial silver film on a gallium arsenide [GaAs(110)] surface was synthesized in a two-step process. Deposition of a critical thickness of silver at low temperature led to the formation of a dense nanocluster film. Upon annealing, all atoms rearranged themselves into an atomically flat film. This silver film has a close-packed (111) structure modulated by a ""silver mean"" quasi-periodic sequence. The ability to grow such epitaxial overlayers of metals on semiconductors enables the testing of theoretical models and provides a connection between metal and semiconductor technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2053702480,"An inheritable muscular hypertrophy was recently described in sheep and shown to be determined by the callipyge gene mapped to ovine chromosome 18. Here, the callipyge phenotype was found to be characterized by a nonmendelian inheritance pattern, referred to as polar overdominance, where only heterozygous individuals having inherited the callipyge mutation from their sire express the phenotype. The possible role of parental imprinting in the determinism of polar overdominance is envisaged."
https://openalex.org/W2064932453,"The 351-nanometer photoelectron spectrum of the planar cyclooctatetraene radical anion (COT⋅−) shows transitions to two electronic states of cyclooctatetraene (COT). These states correspond to the D4h 1A1g state, which is the transition state for COT ring inversion, and the D8h 3A2u state. The electron binding energy of the 1A1g transition state is 1.099 ± 0.010 electron volts, which is lower by 12.1 ± 0.3 kilocalories per mole than that of the 3A2u state. The photoelectron spectrum shows that the singlet lies well below the triplet in D8h COT and confirms ab initio predictions that the molecule violates Hund's rule. Vibrational structure is observed for both features and is readily assigned by use of a simple potential energy surface."
https://openalex.org/W2048394610,"The field-effect mobility in thin-film transistors based on alpha-sexithiophene (alpha-6T) and related materials displays a temperature dependence that is remarkably nonmonotonic. Above a transition temperature TT (specific to a given material) the transport is thermally activated, whereas below TT there is a very steep enhancement of the mobility. In the activated regime, the results are well described by the theoretical predictions for small polaron motion made by Holstein in 1959. An analysis of the transistor characteristics shows that the hopping transport in these devices is intrinsic. Performance limits for devices based on alpha-6T and related materials were established; these limits point to the strong possibility that better molecular materials for transistor applications may be designed from first principles."
https://openalex.org/W1999986344,"Global Oscillation Network Group data reveal that the internal structure of the sun can be well represented by a calibrated standard model. However, immediately beneath the convection zone and at the edge of the energy-generating core, the sound-speed variation is somewhat smoother in the sun than it is in the model. This could be a consequence of chemical inhomogeneity that is too severe in the model, perhaps owing to inaccurate modeling of gravitational settling or to neglected macroscopic motion that may be present in the sun. Accurate knowledge of the sun's structure enables inferences to be made about the physics that controls the sun; for example, through the opacity, the equation of state, or wave motion. Those inferences can then be used elsewhere in astrophysics."
https://openalex.org/W2074361882,"The electrical resistance of wires consisting of either a single xenon atom or two xenon atoms in series was measured and calculated on the basis of an atom-jellium model. Both the measurement and the calculation yielded a resistance of 10(5) ohms for the single-xenon atom system and 10(7) ohms for the two-xenon atom system. These resistances greatly exceeded the 12,900-ohm resistance of an ideal one-dimensional conduction channel because conduction through the xenon atoms occurs through the tail of the xenon 6s resonance, which lies far above the Fermi level. This conduction process in an atom-sized system can now be understood in terms of the electronic states of individual atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2049519337,"Maya blue paint was often used in Mesoamerica. The origin of its color and its resistance to acids and biocorrosion have not been fully understood. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and x-ray microanalysis studies of authentic samples show that palygorskite crystals in the paint form a superlattice that probably occurs as a result of mixing with indigo molecules. An amorphous silicate substrate contains inclusions of metal nanoparticles encapsulated in the substrate and oxide nanoparticles on the surface. The beautiful tone of the color is obtained only when both the particles and the superlattice are present."
https://openalex.org/W2009152635,"Small van der Waals clusters of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and mixed SF6-rare gas clusters were prepared inside large droplets of helium-4, with each droplet consisting of about 4000 helium atoms. A diode laser was used to measure the high-resolution infrared spectra of these clusters in the vicinity of the nu3 vibrational mode. In all cases rotational structure was observed, indicating that the embedded species rotate nearly freely, although they had been cooled to a temperature of 0.37 kelvin. The results indicate that helium droplets are probably superfluid and thereby provide a uniquely cold yet gentle matrix for high-resolution spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1987267671,"The elongation of RNA chains during transcription occurs in a ternary complex containing RNA polymerase (RNAP), DNA template, and nascent RNA. It is shown here that elongating RNAP from Escherichia coli can switch DNA templates by means of end-to-end transposition without loss of the transcript. After the switch, transcription continues on the new template. With the use of defined short DNA fragments as switching templates, RNAP-DNA interactions were dissected into two spatially distinct components, each contributing to the stability of the elongating complex. The front (F) interaction occurs ahead of the growing end of RNA. This interaction is non-ionic and requires 7 to 9 base pairs of intact DNA duplex. The rear (R) interaction is ionic and requires approximately six nucleotides of the template DNA strand behind the active site and one nucleotide ahead of it. The nontemplate strand is not involved. With the use of protein-DNA crosslinking, the F interaction was mapped to the conserved zinc finger motif in the NH2-terminus of the beta' subunit and the R interaction, to the COOH-terminal catalytic domain of the beta subunit. Mutational disruption of the zinc finger selectively destroyed the F interaction and produced a salt-sensitive ternary complex with diminished processivity. A model of the ternary complex is proposed here that suggests that trilateral contacts in the active center maintain the nonprocessive complex, whereas a front-end domain including the zinc finger ensures processivity."
https://openalex.org/W1985073670,"Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using DNA-based experiments to compute solutions to combinatorial problems. However, a prerequisite for designing a computer useful in a wide range of applications is the ability to perform mathematical calculations. The development of a DNA-based algorithm for addition is presented. The DNA representation of two nonnegative binary numbers is presented in a form permitting a chain of primer extension reactions to carry out the addition operation. To demonstrate the feasibility of this algorithm, a simple example was executed biochemically."
https://openalex.org/W2020672963,"Petrological experiments on oceanic crust samples characterize the recycling of potassium from mid-ocean ridge basalts and sediments. Metasomatism could develop directly and continuously from subducted potassium-bearing crust from shallow levels to a maximum depth of 300 kilometers. Phengite (a potassium-rich mica) is the principal potassium host at subsolidus conditions. It transports potassium and water to depths of up to 300 kilometers and could yield over the entire depth range potassium-rich fluids or melts (depending on the specific geotherm), which are likely to constitute one of the primary metasomatic agents for generation of calc-alkaline magmas."
https://openalex.org/W2049450494,"The literature describing the energy needs for a communications channel has been dominated by analyses of linear electromagnetic transmission, often without awareness that this is a special case. This case leads to the conclusion that an amount of energy equal to kTln 2, where kT is the thermal noise per unit bandwidth, is needed to transmit a bit, and more if quantized channels are used with photon energies hnu > kT. Alternative communication methods are proposed to show that there is no unavoidable minimal energy requirement per transmitted bit. These methods are invoked as part of an analysis of ultimate limits and not as practical procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2080508462,"Airborne in situ observations of molecules with a wide range of lifetimes (methane, nitrous oxide, reactive nitrogen, ozone, chlorinated halocarbons, and halon-1211), used in a tropical tracer model, show that mid-latitude air is entrained into the tropical lower stratosphere within about 13.5 months; transport is faster in the reverse direction. Because exchange with the tropics is slower than global photochemical models generally assume, ozone at mid-latitudes appears to be more sensitive to elevated levels of industrial chlorine than is currently predicted. Nevertheless, about 45 percent of air in the tropical ascent region at 21 kilometers is of mid-latitude origin, implying that emissions from supersonic aircraft could reach the middle stratosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2061330821,"The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project estimates the frequencies, amplitudes, and linewidths of more than 250,000 acoustic resonances of the sun from data sets lasting 36 days. The frequency resolution of a single data set is 0.321 microhertz. For frequencies averaged over the azimuthal order m, the median formal error is 0.044 microhertz, and the associated median fractional error is 1.6 x 10(-5). For a 3-year data set, the fractional error is expected to be 3 x 10(-6). The GONG m-averaged frequency measurements differ from other helioseismic data sets by 0.03 to 0.08 microhertz. The differences arise from a combination of systematic errors, random errors, and possible changes in solar structure."
https://openalex.org/W2011143675,"Lower Cretaceous bulk carbonate from deep sea sediments records sudden inputs of strontium resulting from the exposure of continental shelves. Strontium data from an interval spanning 7 million years in the Berriasian-Valanginian imply that global sea level fluctuated about 50 meters over time scales of 200,000 to 500,000 years, which is in agreement with the Exxon sea level curve. Oxygen isotope measurements indicate that the growth of continental ice sheets caused these rapid sea level changes. If glaciation caused all the rapid sea level changes in the Cretaceous that are indicated by the Exxon curve, then an Antarctic ice sheet may have existed despite overall climatic warmth."
https://openalex.org/W2077063235,"Observations obtained with a mobile pencil-beam Doppler radar revealed many previously unresolved structures within tornadic storms and tornadoes and helped verify various aspects of conceptual models. Radar data from the parent circulations indicate the existence of spiral reflectivity bands, intense radial wind shear zones, and multiple larger-scale velocity maxima. Tornado structures observed include debris shields, clear axial (eye) regions, multiple reflectivity bands surrounding the center of the eye, and occasional reflectivity protrusions into the eye. Velocity and reflectivity data from tornado-scale circulations show evidence of axial downdrafts."
https://openalex.org/W1991873878,"Models of biogenic carbon (BC) flux assume that short herbivorous food chains lead to high export, whereas complex microbial or omnivorous food webs lead to recycling and low export, and that export of BC from the euphotic zone equals new production (NP). In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, particulate organic carbon fluxes were similar during the spring phytoplankton bloom, when herbivory dominated, and during nonbloom conditions, when microbial and omnivorous food webs dominated. In contrast, NP was 1.2 to 161 times greater during the bloom than after it. Thus, neither food web structure nor NP can predict the magnitude or patterns of BC export, particularly on time scales over which the ocean is in nonequilibrium conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2053081761,"Doppler velocity observations obtained by the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) instruments directly measure the nearly steady flows in the solar photosphere. The sun's differential rotation is accurately determined from single observations. The rotation profile with respect to latitude agrees well with previous measures, but it also shows a slight north-south asymmetry. Rotation profiles averaged over 27-day rotations of the sun reveal the torsional oscillation signal-weak, jetlike features, with amplitudes of 5 meters per second, that are associated with the sunspot latitude activity belts. A meridional circulation with a poleward flow of about 20 meters per second is also evident. Several characteristics of the surface flows suggest the presence of large convection cells."
https://openalex.org/W2031778707,"Greenland ice core records provide clear evidence of rapid changes in climate in a variety of climate indicators. In this work, rapid climate change events in the Northern and Southern hemispheres are compared on the basis of an examination of changes in atmospheric circulation developed from two ice cores. High-resolution glaciochemical series, covering the period 10,000 to 16,000 years ago, from a central Greenland ice core and a new site in east Antarctica display similar variability. These findings suggest that rapid climate change events occur more frequently in Antarctica than previously demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1980134060,"The circumstellar silicon carbide (SiC) grain X57 from the Murchison meteorite contains large amounts of radiogenic calcium-44 (20 times its solar system abundance) and has an anomalous silicon isotopic composition, different from other circumstellar SiC grains. Its inferred initial 44Ti/Si and 44Ti/48Ti ratios are 1.6 x 10(-4) and 0.37. In addition, it contains radiogenic magnesium-26; the inferred initial 26Al/27Al ratio is 0.11. The isotopic and elemental data of X57 can be explained by selective mixing of matter from different zones of a typical type II supernova of 25 solar masses during its explosion. The high 44Ti/Si ratio requires contributions from the innermost nickel zone of the supernova to the SiC condensation site, as similarly suggested by astronomical observations."
https://openalex.org/W1969161202,"The microscopic particle motions from the crystal to the disordered state of a dusty plasma with micrometer-sized silicon dioxide particle suspensions in a radio-frequency glow discharge system were studied through an optical microimaging system. Small-amplitude random motion around the lattice sites of the crystal state, relative domain motion with varying boundaries, cooperative hopping in the liquid state, and highly disordered motion with increasing radio-frequency power were observed. Chaotic states with different spatial scales under the coherent and stochastic coupling between dust particles and self-organized background plasma fluctuations were also demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2009158112,"Major chemical exchange between the crust and mantle occurs in subduction zone environments, profoundly affecting the chemical evolution of Earth. The relative contributions of the subducting slab, mantle wedge, and arc lithosphere to the generation of island arc magmas, and ultimately new continental crust, are controversial. Isotopic data for lavas from a transect of volcanoes in a single arc segment of northern Honshu, Japan, have distinct variations coincident with changes in crustal lithology. These data imply that the relatively thin crustal lithosphere is an active geochemical filter for all traversing magmas and is responsible for significant modification of primary mantle melts."

At 400&deg;C and 40 megapascals, the in situ pH of the fluids, ranging from 3.3 to 6.2, differs greatly from its original value of 1.9 to 7.6 at ambient conditions. The measurements agree well with theoretical predictions, showing strong associations of HCl&deg; and NaOH&deg; complexes in high-temperature fluids. The pH sensor provides a powerful tool to investigate unambiguously the distribution of species in aqueous fluids at elevated temperatures and pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2145129468,"Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are important for the chemical activation of chlorine compounds and subsequent ozone depletion. Solid PSCs can form on sulfuric acid tetrahydrate (SAT) (H2SO4⋅4H2O) nuclei, but recent laboratory experiments have shown that PSC nucleation on SAT is strongly hindered. A PSC formation mechanism is proposed in which SAT particles melt upon cooling in the presence of HNO3 to form liquid HNO3-H2SO4-H2O droplets 2 to 3 kelvin above the ice frost point. This mechanism offers a PSC formation temperature that is defined by the ambient conditions and sets a temperature limit below which PSCs should form."
https://openalex.org/W2078587048,"Helioseismology is probing the interior structure and dynamics of the sun with ever-increasing precision, providing a well-calibrated laboratory in which physical processes can be studied under conditions that are unattainable on Earth. Nearly 10 million resonant modes of oscillation are observable in the solar atmosphere, and their frequencies need to be known with great accuracy in order to gauge the sun's interior. The advent of nearly continuous imaged observations from the complementary ground-based Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) observatories and the space-based Solar and Heliospheric Observatory instruments augurs a new era of discovery. The flow of early results from GONG resolves some issues and raises a number of theoretical questions whose answers are required for understanding how a seemingly ordinary star actually operates."

If, however, the time it takes light to travel between A and B exceeds a characteristic oscillation period of A or B, the way in which the potential function depends on the separation of the systems can be altered. Called the Casimir effect, it has only recently been confirmed, and it arises in physics, chemistry, and biology. It is the clearest physical manifestation of the fact that, even in a vacuum, electromagnetic fields cannot all vanish."

High-pressure phases then crystallized rapidly when the temperature was increased to 400&deg;C. These results suggest that amorphization of serpentine is an unlikely mechanism for generating deep-focus earthquakes, as the temperatures of subducting slabs are significantly higher than those of the rapid crystallization regime."
https://openalex.org/W1984877597,"Recent syntheses of high-pressure alkali and alkaline earth silicates reveal a class of framework structures with corner-linked 4- and 6-coordinated silicon. These compounds possess the structural formula (A4-2x1+Bx2+)SimVI(SinIVO2(m+n)+2), where x, m, and n specify the amounts of alkaline earth, 6-coordinated silicon, and 4-coordinated silicon, respectively. Appropriate values of m and n yield a range of high-pressure structures, from fully 4-coordinated to fully 6-coordinated silicate frameworks. Recognition of this class of framework silicates leads to predictions of high-pressure structures as well as room-pressure isomorphs of high-pressure silicates."
https://openalex.org/W1997484012,"A bistatic radar experiment in 1994, involving reception on Earth of a specularly reflected, linearly polarized 13-centimeter-wavelength signal transmitted from the Magellan spacecraft in orbit around Venus, has established that the surface materials viewed at low and intermediate altitudes on Venus have a relative dielectric permittivity of 4.0 &plusmn; 0.5. However, bistatic results for the Maxwell Montes highlands imply an electrically lossy surface with an imaginary dielectric permittivity of -i 100 &plusmn; 50, probably associated with a specific conductivity of about 13 mhos per meter. Candidates for highlands surface composition include ferroelectrics, a thin frost of elemental tellurium, or a plating of magnetite or pyrites."
