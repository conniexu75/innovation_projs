https://openalex.org/W2077520330,1) 3-Acetyl pyridine has been found to be quite toxic when administered to mice. Simultaneous administration of nicotinamide or DPN protects against the toxicity of acetyl pyridine. Nicotinic acid and tryptophan do not protect animals from the lethal effects of the compound. 2) Nicotinamide inhibits the formation of the 3-acetyl pyridine analog of DPN from acetyl pyridine and DPN in mouse brain homogenates. Nicotinic acid has no inhibitory effect on analog synthesis. 3) Administration of acetyl pyridine results in a fourfold increase in the DPN level of the lever. No acetyl pyridine analog of DPN is found in the liver after injection of the antimetabolite. 4) Injection of acetyl pyridine into tumor mice results in the formation of the acetyl pyridine analog of DPN in the neoplastic tissues. A decrease in DPN concentration is associated with the analog synthesis. The DPN analog has been isolated from tumor tissue and identified. 5) The results are discussed with respect to the significance of enzymatically catalyzed exchange reactions in chemotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W1987373932,"YEAST polygalacturonase is an exo-cellular pectic enzyme produced by Saccharomyces fragilis in a synthetic, protein-free medium. The enzyme is constitutive and is not accompanied by pectinesterase1. When it is allowed to act on pectic acid, the following series of reactions occurs2: (a) Pectic acid → penta- + tetra- + tri- + digalacturonic acids; (b) Pentagalacturonic acid → tetra- + galacturonic acids; Pentagalacturonic acid → tri- + digalacturonic acids; (c) Tetragalacturonic acid → tri- + galacturonic acids; (d) Trigalacturonic acid → di- + galacturonic acids."

https://openalex.org/W2072724091,"IN the course of our studies on methods of synthesis of thiazole derivatives and their possible useful applications, it appeared of interest to examine their fungicidal properties, since these contain in a cyclic ring structure the grouping N—C—S which is present in known fungicides like tetramethyl thiuram disulphide, thioureas and thioacetamide. Some new mercurated derivatives of thiazoles have also been prepared by us, and since mercury is a powerful fungicidal element, phenyl mercuric acetate being actually used for such diseases as apple scab, it was considered worth while to test these mercurated thiazoles for their fungicidal action."

https://openalex.org/W1972038277,"IN 1911, Looss1 noticed first- and second- stage larvæ of Ancylostoma duodenale ingesting the bacteria ‘contaminating’ his cultures. He dismissed bacteria as a regular food source, however, because such larvæ “all show the outward signs of insufficient nutrition”. Later, it was established by McCoy2, and confirmed by Lawrence3, that living bacteria were normally necessary for the nutrition of hookworm larvæ. Lapage4 also reared the third stages of a number of strongyloid worms, including Trichostrongylus retortaeformis, in broth cultures of coliform bacteria. Although McCoy5 made measurements of Ancylostoma caninum larvæ reared in coliform cultures, none of these workers reported any comparisons made between such measurements and those of larvæ grown in ordinary fæcal culture."

No reports are known to me of the detection of norvaline as a free amino-acid in tissues. It has, however, been reported3 that on addition of α-ketovaleric acid and glutamine to extracts of rat liver, the α-ketovaleric acid was converted to norvaline. A number of other α-keto acids were converted to the corresponding amino-acid by the extract. The conversion to norvaline, therefore, could be attributed to low specificity of the postulated enzyme. In spite of this, it was decided to include DL-norvaline in a series of amino-acids tested for ability to replace pyridoxine in the nutrition of a clone of excised tomato roots. Some nutritional requirements of this clone and the experimental techniques are given elsewhere4."

https://openalex.org/W2017576899,"The conversion of DCA to progestin in vivo, which has been shown in the case of the monkey (4) and now the rat, indicates one possible mechanism by which progestin may occur in the male. In addition, these studies also show that, at least in the rodent, the adrenals and the kidneys are the sites of this conversion. Investigations on the conversion of DCA to progestin in other species, as well as studies on the release See PDF for Table of progestin by tissue slices incubated with or without DCA, are currently in progress."
