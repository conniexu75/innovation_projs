https://openalex.org/W2970008479,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects bone metabolism and leads to osteoporosis; however, its pathogenetic mechanisms remain unknown. We found that high glucose (HG) conditions induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of proteins related to MAPKs [phosphorylated (p)-ERK, p-JNK, and p-p38], NF-κB (NF-κB, p-IκB, and IKK), and NACHT-LRR-PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NALP3) (NLRP3) [apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1, IL-18, IL-1β, and NLRP3] in osteoclasts (OCs) in vitro. Further analysis showed that in HG-induced OCs, ROS is an upstream signal for MAPKs, NF-κB, and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, MAPKs mediated the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3, whereas NF-κB up-regulated the NLRP3 inflammasome response. Interestingly, HG inducement enhanced the bone resorption of OCs but inhibited their efferocytosis, whereas insulin and lipoxin A4 (4) treatment reversed this phenomenon. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats in vivo, the numbers and the bone-resorption capacity of OCs as well as the serum levels of TRACP-5b were significantly increased, and the expression of MAPK-, NF-κB-, and NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins in the proximal tibia were also significantly elevated; however, treatment with insulin and LXA4 reversed this elevation. Together, these results demonstrated that the activation of ROS/MAPKs/NF-κB/NLRP3 and the inhibition of efferocytosis in OCs are the main causes of osteoporosis in DM.-An, Y., Zhang, H., Wang, C., Jiao, F., Xu, H., Wang, X., Luan, W., Ma, F., Ni, L., Tang, X., Liu, M., Guo, W., Yu, L.

https://openalex.org/W2970640684,"The importance of probiotics in swine production is widely acknowledged as crucial. However, gaps still remain in the exact roles played by probiotics in modulation of gut microbiota and immune response. This study determined the roles of probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum strain JDFM LP11in gut microbiota modulation and immune response in weaned piglets. L. plantarum JDFM LP11 increased the population of lactic acid bacteria in feces and enhanced the development of villi in the small intestine. Metagenome analysis showed that microbial diversity and richness (Simpson, Shannon, ACE, Chao1) and the relative abundance of the Firmicutes were higher in weaned piglets fed probiotics. Five bacterial families were different in the relative abundance, especially; Prevotellaceae occupied the largest part of microbial community showed the most difference between two groups. Transcriptome analysis identified 25 differentially expressed genes using RNA-sequencing data of the ileum. Further gene ontology and immune DB analysis determined 8 genes associated with innate defense response and cytokine production. BPI, RSAD2, SLPI, LUM, OLFM4, DMBT1 and C6 genes were down-regulated by probiotic supplementation except PLA2G2A. PICRUSt analysis predicting functional profiling of microbial communities indicated branched amino acid biosynthesis and butyrate metabolism promoting gut development and health were increased by probiotics. Altogether, our data suggest that L. plantarum JDFM LP11 increases the diversity and richness in the microbial community, and attenuates the ileal immune gene expression towards gut inflammation, promoting intestinal development in weaned piglets."
https://openalex.org/W2971119963,"RNA editing critically regulates neurodevelopment and normal neuronal function. The global landscape of RNA editing was surveyed across 364 schizophrenia cases and 383 control postmortem brain samples from the CommonMind Consortium, comprising two regions: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. In schizophrenia, RNA editing sites in genes encoding AMPA-type glutamate receptors and postsynaptic density proteins were less edited, whereas those encoding translation initiation machinery were edited more. These sites replicate between brain regions, map to 3'-untranslated regions and intronic regions, share common sequence motifs and overlap with binding sites for RNA-binding proteins crucial for neurodevelopment. These findings cross-validate in hundreds of non-overlapping dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples. Furthermore, ~30% of RNA editing sites associate with cis-regulatory variants (editing quantitative trait loci or edQTLs). Fine-mapping edQTLs with schizophrenia risk loci revealed co-localization of eleven edQTLs with six loci. The findings demonstrate widespread altered RNA editing in schizophrenia and its genetic regulation, and suggest a causal and mechanistic role of RNA editing in schizophrenia neuropathology."
https://openalex.org/W2970351044,"Plant NLRs are modular immune receptors that trigger rapid cell death in response to attempted infection by pathogens. A highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain shared with APAF-1, various R-proteins and CED-4 (NB-ARC domain) is proposed to act as a molecular switch, cycling between ADP (repressed) and ATP (active) bound forms. Studies of plant NLR NB-ARC domains have revealed functional similarities to mammalian homologues, and provided insight into potential mechanisms of regulation. However, further advances have been limited by difficulties in obtaining sufficient yields of protein suitable for structural and biochemical techniques. From protein expression screens in Escherichia coli and Sf9 insect cells, we defined suitable conditions to produce the NB-ARC domain from the tomato NLR NRC1. Biophysical analyses of this domain showed it is a folded, soluble protein. Structural studies revealed the NRC1 NB-ARC domain had co-purified with ADP, and confirmed predicted structural similarities between plant NLR NB-ARC domains and their mammalian homologues."
https://openalex.org/W2971053901,"The main goal of this paper is to study the effects of (1) trust in government medical experts and (2) proximity to a recent disease outbreak on vaccine propensity. More specifically, we explore how these variables affect attitudes with regards to measles. Using original survey data, collected in January/February 2017, we obtain three main empirical findings. First, contrary to our expectations, an individual’s proximity to a recent measles outbreak has no independent effect on vaccination attitudes. Second, corroborating previous studies in the field, we find that trust in institutions such as the CDC has a positive effect on our dependent variable. Third, there is a significant interactive relationship between proximity and trust in governmental medical experts. While distance from a previous measles outbreak has no effect on vaccination attitudes for respondents with medium or high levels of trust, the variable exerts a negative effect for subjects with little confidence in government medical experts. In other words: low-trust individuals who live farther away from a recent measles outbreak harbor less favorable views about vaccination for this particular disease than low-trust respondents who live close to an affected area. This implies that citizens who are skeptical of the CDC and similar institutions base their vaccination decision-making to some degree on whether or not a given disease occurs in close vicinity to their community."
https://openalex.org/W2970783645,"The physical basis for fish schooling is examined using three-dimensional numerical simulations of a pair of swimming fish, with kinematics and geometry obtained from experimental data. Energy expenditure and efficiency are evaluated using a cost of transport function, while the effect of schooling on the stability of each swimmer is examined by probing the lateral force and the lateral and longitudinal force fluctuations. We construct full maps of the aforementioned quantities as functions of the spatial pattern of the swimming fish pair and show that both energy expenditure and stability can be invoked as possible reasons for the swimming patterns and tail-beat synchronization observed in real fish. Our results suggest that high cost of transport zones should be avoided by the fish. Wake capture may be energetically unfavorable in the absence of kinematic adjustment. We hereby hypothesize that fish may restrain from wake capturing and, instead, adopt side-to-side configuration as a conservative strategy, when the conditions of wake energy harvesting are not satisfied. To maintain a stable school configuration, compromise between propulsive efficiency and stability, as well as between school members, ought to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2970343933,"Chemokines play diverse roles in human pathophysiology, ranging from trafficking leukocytes and immunosurveillance to the regulation of metabolism and neural function. Chemokine function is intimately coupled to binding tissue glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and dermatan sulfate (DS). Currently, very little is known about how the structural features and sequences of a given chemokine, the structure and sulfation pattern of a given GAG, and structural differences among GAGs and among chemokines impact binding interactions. In this study, we used solution NMR spectroscopy to characterize the binding interactions of two related neutrophil-activating chemokines, CXCL1 and CXCL5, with HS, CS, and DS. For both chemokines, the dimer bound all three GAGs with higher affinity than did the monomer, and affinities of the chemokines for CS and DS were lower than for HS. NMR-based structural models reveal diverse binding geometries and show that the binding surfaces for each of the three GAGs were different between the two chemokines. However, a given chemokine had similar binding interactions with CS and DS that were different from HS. Considering the fact that CXCL1 and CXCL5 activate the same CXCR2 receptor, we conclude that GAG interactions play a role in determining the nature of chemokine gradients, levels of free chemokine available for receptor activation, how chemokines bind their receptors, and that differences in these interactions determine chemokine-specific function.

https://openalex.org/W2970279691,"Orthorexia Nervosa (ON) is an eating disorder marked by an excessive control over the quality of the food eaten. Some groups present a higher prevalence of ON and people practicing sports seems to be a population at risk. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of ON in endurance athletes and to compare their prevalence with the ones recorded in the sedentary population and in athletes playing other sports. A cross-sectional survey was carried in Piedmont and Valle d’Aosta, among 549 participants in local sports events aged between 18 and 40 years old. The questionnaire assessed socio-demographic characteristics, physical activity, nutrition and diet, the ORTO-15 questionnaire and Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ). The sample was stratified according to the minutes of sport practiced in a week and the type of sport played. Crosstab chi-square analyses to determine group differences on categorical variables (e.g. gender), and ANOVAs or t tests to determine group differences on continuous variables were performed. When required, post hoc analyses were performed. Linear and logistic regressions were performed in order to investigate potential predictors of orthorexia. The EHQ mean scores ware significantly higher in people who practice sports >150 minutes/week. EHQ score resulted to be positively correlated with endurance sport practice >150 minutes/week, with a coefficient of 2.407 (I.C.95% [0.27;4.54], p = 0.027). Analyses carried out suggested a correlation between endurance sport practice and ON. Further studies should be performed to identify diagnostic criteria and to compare different questionnaire used to assess them."
https://openalex.org/W2970868080,"One fundamental but understudied mechanism of gene regulation in disease is allele-specific expression (ASE), the preferential expression of one allele. We leveraged RNA-sequencing data from human brain to assess ASE in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). When ASE is observed in ASD, the allele with lower population frequency (minor allele) is preferentially more highly expressed than the major allele, opposite to the canonical pattern. Importantly, genes showing ASE in ASD are enriched in those downregulated in ASD postmortem brains and in genes harboring de novo mutations in ASD. Two regions, 14q32 and 15q11, containing all known orphan C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), are particularly enriched in shifts to higher minor allele expression. We demonstrate that this allele shifting enhances snoRNA-targeted splicing changes in ASD-related target genes in idiopathic ASD and 15q11–q13 duplication syndrome. Together, these results implicate allelic imbalance and dysregulation of orphan C/D box snoRNAs in ASD pathogenesis. The authors leverage extensive RNA sequencing data from postmortem brains of controls and individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to identify altered patterns of allele specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2970912997,"A growing body of evidence has shown that active learning has a considerable advantage over traditional lecture for student learning in undergraduate STEM classes, but there have been few large-scale studies to identify the specific types of activities that have the greatest impact on learning. We therefore undertook a large-scale, curriculum-wide study to investigate the effects of time spent on a variety of classroom activities on learning gains. We quantified classroom practices and related these to student learning, assessed using diagnostic tests written by over 3700 students, across 31 undergraduate biology classes at a research-intensive university in the Pacific Northwest. The most significant positive predictor of learning gains was the use of group work, supporting the findings of previous studies. Strikingly, we found that the addition of worksheets as an active learning tool for in-class group activities had the strongest impact on diagnostic test scores. This particular low-tech activity promotes student collaboration, develops problem solving skills, and can be used to inform the instructor about what students are struggling with, thus providing opportunities for valuable and timely feedback. Overall, our results indicate that group activities with low barriers to entry, such as worksheets, can result in significant learning gains in undergraduate science."

Their clinical features and chest radiographs were reviewed. Radiographic findings were categorized and grouped as consolidation group (lobar or segmental consolidation) and non-consolidation group (patchy infiltration, localized reticulonodular infiltration, or parahilar peribronchial infiltration).Lobar or segmental consolidation (37%) was the most common finding, followed by parahilar or peribronchial infiltration (27%), localized reticulonodular infiltration (21%) and patchy infiltration (15%). The consolidation group was more frequently accompanied by pleural effusions (63%), compared to the non-consolidation group (16%). Compared with patients in the non-consolidation group, those in the consolidation group were associated with a significantly higher rate of hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, extrapulmonary manifestations, prolonged fever, and longer periods of anti-mycoplasma therapy and hospitalization. Lobar or segmental consolidation was significantly more frequent in children ≥5 years old (44%) compared with children 2-5 years old (34%) and <2 years old (13%). Parahilar peribronchial infiltration was significantly more frequent in children <2 years old (56%) compared with children 2-5 years old (32%) and ≥5 years old (18%).The chest radiographic findings of children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia correlate well with the clinical features. Consolidative lesions were frequently observed in older children and were associated with more severe clinical features."

https://openalex.org/W2970028759,"Acute mountain sickness (AMS) occurs in up to 25% of unacclimatized persons who ascend to 3000 m and can result in high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). MicroRNAs (miRs) can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Hypoxia selectively disrupts endothelial tight junction complexes through a hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)-dependent mechanism. Though increased HIF-1α expression is associated with adaptation and protection from AMS development in the early stage of hypoxia, a downstream effector of HIF-1α, VEGF, can induce overzealous endothelial barrier dysfunction, increase vascular permeability, and ultimately result in HAPE and high-altitude cerebral edema. We hypothesized that the fine-tuning of downstream effectors by miRs is paramount for the preservation of endothelial barrier integrity and the prevention of vascular leakage. We found that several miRs were up-regulated in healthy volunteers who were subjected to a 3100-m height. By reviewing the literature and using online bioinformatics prediction software, we specifically selected miR-424 for further investigation because it can modulate both HIF-1α and VEGF. Hypoxia-induced miR-424 overexpression is HIF-1α dependent, and miR-424 stabilized HIF-1α, decreased VEGF expression, and promoted vascular endothelial cadherin phosphorylation. In addition, hypoxia resulted in endothelial barrier dysfunction with increased permeability; miR-424 thus attenuated hypoxia-induced endothelial cell senescence and apoptosis. miR-322 knockout mice were susceptible to hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular leakage. miR-322 mimics improved hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular leakage in vivo. We conclude that several miRs were up-regulated in healthy adult volunteers subjected to hypobaric hypoxemia. miR-424/322 could modulate the HIF-1α-VEGF axis and prevent hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular leakage under hypoxic conditions.-Tsai, S.-H., Huang, P.-H., Tsai, H.-Y., Hsu, Y.-J., Chen, Y.-W., Wang, J.-C., Chen, Y.-H., Lin, S.-J.

https://openalex.org/W2970426327,"Electric fields can be a powerful tool to interact with enzymes or proteins, with an intriguing perspective to allow protein manipulation. Recently, researchers have focused the interest on intracellular enzyme modifications triggered by the application of nanosecond pulsed electric fields. These findings were also supported by theoretical predictions from molecular dynamics simulations focussing on significant variations in protein secondary structures. In this work, a theoretical study utilizing molecular dynamics simulations is proposed to explore effects of electric fields of high intensity and very short nanosecond duration applied to the superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD or SOD-1), an important enzyme involved in the cellular antioxidant defence mechanism. The effects of 100-nanosecond pulsed electric fields, with intensities ranging from 108 to 7x108 V/m, on a single SOD1 enzyme are presented. We demonstrated that the lowest intensity of 108 V/m, although not inducing structural changes, can produce electrostatic modifications on the reaction centre of the enzyme, as apparent from the dipolar response and the electric field distribution of the protein active site. Electric pulses above 5x108 V/m produced a fast transition between the folded and a partially denatured state, as inferred by the secondary structures analysis. Finally, for the highest field intensity used (7x108 V/m), a not reversible transition toward an unfolded state was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2970959072,"Diabetes plays an important role in the complex relationship between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease. This retrospective observational study compared the influence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria on the risk of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; myocardial infarction or stroke) in CKD patients with and without diabetes. Data were from a linked database of UK electronic health records. Individuals with CKD and no prior MACE were classified as type 1 diabetes (T1DM; n = 164), type 2 diabetes (T2DM; n = 9,711), and non-diabetes (non-DM; n = 75,789). Monthly updated time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for progression to MACE from first record of abnormal eGFR or proteinuria (index date). In non-DM, aHRs (95% CIs) by baseline eGFR category (referent G2) were G1: 0.70 (0.55-0.90), G3a: 1.28 (1.20-1.35), G3b: 1.64 (1.52-1.76), G4: 2.19 (1.98-2.43), and G5: 3.12 (2.44-3.99), and by proteinuria category (referent A1) were A2: 1.13 (1.00-1.28), A2/3 (severity indeterminable): 1.58 (1.28-1.95), and A3: 1.64 (1.38-1.95). In T2DM, aHRs were G1: 0.98 (0.72-1.32), G3a: 1.18 (1.03-1.34), G3b: 1.31 (1.12-1.54), G4: 1.87 (1.53-2.29), G5: 2.87 (1.82-4.52), A2: 1.22 (1.04-1.42), A2/3: 1.45 (1.17-1.79), and A3: 1.82 (1.53-2.16). Low numbers in T1DM precluded analysis. Modelling T2DM and non-DM together, aHRs were, respectively, G1: 3.23 (2.38-4.40) and 0.70 (0.55-0.89); G2: 3.18 (2.73-3.70) and 1.00 (referent); G3a: 3.65 (3.13-4.25) and 1.28 (1.21-1.36); G3b: 4.01 (3.40-4.74) and 1.65 (1.54-1.77); G4: 5.78 (4.70-7.10) and 2.21 (2.00-2.45); G5: 9.00 (5.71-14.18) and 3.14 (2.46-4.00). In conclusion, reduced eGFR and proteinuria were independently associated with increased risk of MACE regardless of diabetes status. However, the risk of MACE in the same eGFR state was 4.6-2.4 times higher in T2DM than in non-DM."
https://openalex.org/W2970688302,"In genetic control programmes, including the sterile insect technique (SIT), it is crucial to release insects of the highest quality with maximum survival. It is likely that male mosquitoes will follow the trend of other insects in SIT programmes and be stored, transported and eventually released under chilled conditions. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of different chilling temperatures on male Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus survival by exposing them to a range of temperatures for different durations. Ae. aegypti were found to be less sensitive to the impact of chilling, with only 6°C causing a marginal decrease in survival in comparison to non-chilled controls. Conversely, Ae. albopictus displayed a significantly reduced survival at all chilling temperatures even when exposed for a short time. In both species, longer exposure to low temperatures reduced survival. Our results uncovered that Ae. albopictus are more sensitive to chilling, regardless of the temperature, when compared to Ae. aegypti. Such results indicate differences in thermal tolerances between species and the necessity of conducting experiments on a species by species basis when determining temperature limits for any insect destined for release as part of a genetic control programme."
https://openalex.org/W2970753013,"Translocated saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia often return to their original capture sites, which complicates management interventions aimed at reducing human-crocodile conflict. We examined the spatial events implicated in this homing ability, using ARGOS satellite tracking devices. Five large male C. porosus (3.03 m to 4.02 m TL) were shifted and released 100–320 km from their capture sites, and 3 additional ones (3.67 m to 4.23 m TL) were released at their site of capture as controls. Translocated crocodiles were more mobile than the controls, and moved at sea in the direction of their original capture site. However, they were unable or unwilling to swim around a geographic structure, Cobourg Peninsula, which prevented homing being achieved in all five cases. Two control crocodiles remained near their capture sites, but one, after the first year, made a 900km journey for six months, before returning to its original capture and release site. Genetic analysis of tissue samples from nests across the NT coast demonstrated significant genetic structure across the coast, and confirmed that Cobourg Peninsula contributes to genetic differentiation among populations along the NT coast. These results provide new insights into C. porosus movements, which have management significance for the maintenance of public safety."
https://openalex.org/W2970845837,"Chaotic spiral or scroll wave dynamics can be found in diverse systems. In cardiac dynamics, spiral or scroll waves of electrical excitation determine the dynamics during life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation. In numerical studies it was found that chaotic episodes of spiral and scroll waves can be transient, thus they terminate spontaneously. We show in this study that this behavior can also be observed using models which describe the ion channel dynamics of human cardiomyocytes (Bueno-Orovio-Cherry-Fenton model and the Ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov model). For both models we find that the average lifetime of the chaotic transients grows exponentially with the system size. With this behavior, we classify the systems into the group of type-II supertransients. We observe a significant difference of the breakup behavior between the models, which results in a distinct dynamics during the final phase just before the termination. The observation of a (temporally) stable single-spiral state affects the prevailing description of the dynamics of type-II supertransients as being “quasi-stationary” and also the feasibility of predicting the spontaneous termination of the spiral wave dynamics. In the long term, the relation between the breakup behavior of spiral waves and properties of chaotic transients like predictability or average transient lifetime may contribute to an improved understanding and classification of cardiac arrhythmias."

Data were collected from consented participants recruited using multistage sampling technique. Data were entered, checked for quality and analyzed by SPSS for Windows version 20.0. Since the outcome variables were ordered categorical, we used multinomial logistic regression model to identify associated factors. Among the independent variables included in the model no multicolinearity was observed. The level of significance was set at P value ≤ 0.05.The observed prevalence of hypertension (21.8%) was remarkable in rural setting. Out of hypertensive participants, 195 (45.9%) were newly diagnosed. About one third of the participants (31.4%) had central obesity measured by waist-to-height ratio ≥0.50. Being male, age advancement, high BMI (≥25.0 kg/m2) and central obesity (waist-to-height ratio ≥0.50) were positively associated with both systolic and diastolic hypertension. Systolic hypertension was negatively associated with high family income. The likely hood of developing diastolic hypertension increased in participants with family history of hypertension.The overall prevalence of hypertension, 21.8%, is alarmingly high that it can be said that hypertension is becoming a silent epidemic in Ethiopia.

Clinical and demographic characteristics, a frequency of use of each diabetes mellitus treatment type, and the association of insulin pen use with health outcomes are reported using descriptive analysis and propensity score modeling.There were 1,999(10.85%) individuals diagnosed with diabetes in the population, while 1,160(56.87%) cases were taking antihyperglycemic treatments. In this subset, 240(21.14%) individuals administered insulin with or without using oral agents at the same time. 52.28% of participants who were under insulin therapy used insulin pens. None of the socioeconomic determinants, including gender (p-value = 0.11), type of residential areas (p-value = 0.52), years of schooling (p-value = 0.27), wealth index (p-value = 0.19), marital status (p-value = 0.37), and insurance types (p-value = 0.72) were significantly different among groups using insulin pens and insulin vials. Moreover, in the propensity score modeling, pen usage was not associated with a lower heart attack and ischemic stroke histories, systolic blood pressure, serum lipid profile, blood glucose, or HbA1c levels.Results showed that the use of the higher-costing insulin pens compared to traditional vials and syringes is not associated with improved glycemic control and better lipid profile in our sample. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and to compare other aspects of insulin pen use, including adherence to treatment and cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2970353241,The study of affective disorders among young population has become increasingly relevant in the last years. The PANAS is a widely used questionnaire devoted to assess positive and negative affect. The main purpose of the current study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the PANAS for children (PANAS). The sample consisted of 1032 children and adolescents aged between 10 and 15 years. The ESEM two factor model (Positive Affect and Negative Affect) was found as the most suitable model. The PANAS scores also showed acceptable internal consistency. The ESEM two factor model was invariant across gender and educational level. Results showed statistically significant differences in the latent mean scores with females scoring higher than males in and younger students scoring lower in PA. Positive and negative affect were related with external variables of well-being. The present psychometric study supports the PANAS as a brief and useful tool for the screening of PA and NA in children and adolescents.
https://openalex.org/W2970367136,"Colonization of in-dwelling catheters by microbial biofilms is a major concern in patient health eventually leading to catheter-related blood stream infections. Biofilms are less susceptible to standard antibiotic therapies that are effective against planktonic bacteria. Standard procedure for the detection of microorganisms on the catheter tip is culture. However, viable but non-culturable cells (VBNCs) may be missed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as an indicator to visualize and quantify the effect of the antibiotics daptomycin and vancomycin on biofilms in situ. We established an in vitro catheter biofilm model of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms on polyurethane catheters. Biofilm activity was measured by FISH and correlated to colony forming units (CFU) data. Digital image analysis was used for quantification of total biofilm mass and the area of the FISH positive biofilm cells. FISH showed a pronounced effect of both antibiotics on the biofilms, with daptomycin having a significantly stronger effect in terms of both reduction of biofilm mass and number of FISH-positive cells. This supports the anti-biofilm capacity of daptomycin. Interestingly, neither antibiotic was able to eradicate all of the FISH-positive cells. In summary, FISH succeeded in visualization, quantification, and localization of antibiotic activity on biofilms. This technique adds a new tool to the arsenal of test systems for anti-biofilm compounds. FISH is a valuable complementary technique to CFU since it can be highly standardized and provides information on biofilm architecture and quantity and localization of survivor cells."

This is despite the fact that annual degree-day models (that estimate accumulated warmth over the year above the development threshold), indicate that B. tabaci has the thermal potential for multiple summer generations in the UK. A set of 49 climate indices calculated using the present day climate (1986-2015) were therefore compared between the UK and the south of France, where B. tabaci is able to establish outdoors, to identify the factors limiting its establishment. The number of cold days and nights in summer, as well as the time spent within the whitefly's optimum temperature range, were most significantly different between the two areas. These indices may impact the development of B. tabaci and offer an explanation for the absence of the whitefly outdoors in the UK during the summer. Further analyses undertaken with climate projections suggest that in a 2-4°C warmer world this pest could pose a risk to outdoor UK crops in July and August. A clear south-north gradient can be demonstrated for these indices. Linking any possible northwards spread of B. tabaci populations outdoors in France with changes in these indices could therefore provide an important indicator of any change in the risks of outdoor populations of this species developing in the UK. The effectiveness of climate indices in pest risk analysis is compellingly demonstrated, and it is recommended that in-depth comparisons of climatic indices between areas of pest presence and absence are conducted in other situations where forecasting the risks of pest establishment are complex and challenging."
https://openalex.org/W2971063941,"Background Leg length inequalities (LLIs) are a common finding in patients with a total hip arthroplasty (THA). Therefore, we compared the effects of simulated LLIs in patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) with a matched control group. Research question Do LLIs lead to different effects on the musculoskeletal apparatus of patients with a THA then in a control group? Methods In 99 patients with a THA the effects of simulated LLIs were compared to a matched control group of 101 subjects without a hip arthroplasty. First, we compared methods for LLI quantification (tape measurements, pelvic x- ray and rasterstereography). Second, the effects of simulated LLIs on the spine and pelvis were evaluated in both groups using surface topography. LLIs of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 mm were simulated on both sides with a simulation platform. The changes of pelvic position (pelvic obliquity & pelvic torsion) and the effects on spinal posture (surface rotation & lateral deviation) were measured and analysed using a surface topography system. Results Mean LLI measured with a tape was 0.9 mm (SD +/- 14.8). Mean pelvic obliquity measured on x-rays was 1.2 mm (SD +/- 11.6) and with surface topography 0.9 mm (SD +/- 7.9). Simulated LLIs resulted in significant changes of pelvic position and spinal posture in the patient and control group. Interestingly, our study showed that simulated LLIs lead to greater changes in pelvic position (p<0.05) in patients with a THA. Significance This is the first study to demonstrate that LLIs might have a greater impact on the pelvic position of THA patients than in native hips, which could indicate that LLIs do need to be compensated differently in patients with THA than in patients without a THA."
https://openalex.org/W2970249600,"The reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway is the most widespread pathway for pyrimidine degradation in bacteria, enabling assimilation of nitrogen for growth. This pathway, which has been studied in several bacteria including Escherichia coli B, releases only one utilizable nitrogen atom from each molecule of uracil, whereas the other nitrogen atom remains trapped in the end product β-alanine. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of a β-alanine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (PydD) and an NAD(P)H-dependent malonic semialdehyde reductase (PydE) from a pyrimidine degradation gene cluster in the bacterium Lysinibacillus massiliensis. Together, these two enzymes converted β-alanine into 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) and generated glutamate, thereby making the second nitrogen from the pyrimidine ring available for assimilation. Using bioinformatics analyses, we found that PydDE homologs are associated with reductive pyrimidine pathway genes in many Gram-positive bacteria in the classes Bacilli and Clostridia. We demonstrate that Bacillus smithii grows in a defined medium with uracil or uridine as its sole nitrogen source and detected the accumulation of 3-HP as a waste product. Our findings extend the reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway and expand the diversity of enzymes involved in bacterial pyrimidine degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2970259359,"Loss of corneal transparency, as occurs with various pathologies, infections, immune reactions, trauma, aging, and surgery, is a major cause of visual handicap worldwide. However, current means to assess corneal transparency are extremely limited and clinical and eye-bank practice usually involve a subjective and qualitative observation of opacities, sometimes with comparison against an arbitrary grading scale, by means of slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Here, we describe a novel objective optical data analysis-based method that enables quantifiable and standardized characterization of corneal transparency from depth-resolved corneal images, addressing the demand for such a means in both the laboratory and clinical ophthalmology setting. Our approach is based on a mathematical analysis of the acquired optical data with respect to the light attenuation from scattering processes in the corneal stroma. Applicable to any depth-resolved corneal imaging modality, it has been validated by means of full-field optical coherence tomographic microscopy (FF-OCT or FF-OCM). Specifically, our results on ex-vivo corneal specimens illustrate that 1) in homogeneous tissues, characterized by an exponential light attenuation with stromal depth (z), the computation of the scattering mean-free path (ls) from the rate of exponential decay allows quantification of the degree of transparency; 2) in heterogeneous tissues, identified by significant deviations from the normal exponential z -profile, a measure of exponential-decay model inadequacy (e.g., by computation of the Birge ratio) allows the estimation of severity of stromal heterogeneity, and the associated depth-dependent variations around the average ls enables precise localization of the pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2970594694,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a major cause of end stage renal disease. Many patients prove unresponsive to available therapies. An improved understanding of the molecular basis of the disease process could provide insights leading to novel therapeutic approaches. In this study we carried out an RNA-seq analysis of the altered gene expression patterns of podocytes, mesangial cells and glomerular endothelial cells of the bigenic Cd2ap+/-, Fyn-/- mutant mouse model of FSGS. In the podocytes we observed upregulation of many genes related to the Tgfβ family/pathway, including Gdnf, Tgfβ1, Tgfβ2, Snai2, Vegfb, Bmp4, and Tnc. The mutant podocytes also showed upregulation of Acta2, a marker of smooth muscle and associated with myofibroblasts, which are implicated in driving fibrosis. GO analysis of the podocyte upregulated genes identified elevated protein kinase activity, increased expression of growth factors, and negative regulation of cell adhesion, perhaps related to the observed podocyte loss. Both podocytes and mesangial cells showed strong upregulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase genes involved in the synthesis of retinoic acid. Similarly, the Cd2ap+/-, Fyn-/- mesangial cells, as well as podocytes in other genetic models, and the glomeruli of human FSGS patients, all show upregulation of the serine protease Prss23, with the common thread suggesting important functionality. Another gene with strong upregulation in the Cd2ap+/-, Fyn-/- mutant mesangial cells as well as multiple other mutant mouse models of FSGS was thrombospondin, which activates the secreted inactive form of Tgfβ. The Cd2ap+/-, Fyn-/- mutant endothelial cells showed elevated expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, angioblast migration, angiogenesis, and neovasculature, all consistent with the formation of new blood vessels in the diseased glomerulus. The resulting global definition of the perturbed molecular pathways in the three major cell types of the mutant glomerulus provide deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2970775147,"The development of a new drug is an extremely high-risk enterprise. The attrition rates of development projects and the average costs for each launched product are daunting, and the completion of a development program requires a very long time horizon. These facts imply that there are huge potential gains, should one be able to improve efficiency and enhance decision-making capabilities. In this paper, we argue that substantial gains can be achieved by adapting a holistic view of drug development. Historically, too much planning, design and decision-making in the pharmaceutical development has been based on locally optimising separate parts of the development program, and too often important sources of uncertainty are ignored. We propose instead a model-based approach built on two essential pillars; (1) an integrated holistic view of the development program, including post-launch marketing and sales, with all parts evaluated simultaneously; (2) an explicit appreciation of all relevant sources of uncertainty. Computer simulations are utilised to evaluate the properties of the program options at hand, and to provide valuable quantitative decision support. Applications of this modelling approach have proven to add large value to development projects in terms of better program options being generated and more value-adding decisions taken."
https://openalex.org/W2971174310,"In this study, we assumed that correct functional movements for weightlifting can be learned with the help of a music-based biofeedback system. We compared musical feedback with verbal feedback from experienced trainers using two independent groups. The focus was on one specific movement called deadlift. Physical parameters under considerations were the spine (i.e. loss of midline stability resulting in flexion) and the forward displacement of the barbell during the repetitions relative to the mid-foot. We recruited 31 recreational weight lifters (21-42 years of age). Results revealed that both feedback types are effective in improving the movements for deadlift. No significant differences were found across the two feedback types, neither in terms of movement, nor in terms of clarity and motivation. The results suggest that the proposed feedback system is a valid tool for technology-aided training and self-training practices."
https://openalex.org/W2971179732,"The objective was to determine the effects of sleep or lying deprivation on the behavior of dairy cows. Data were collected from 8 multi- and 4 primiparous cows (DIM = 199 ± 44 (mean ± SD); days pregnant = 77 ± 30). Using a crossover design, each cow experienced: 1) sleep deprivation implemented by noise or physical contact when their posture suggested sleep, and 2) lying deprivation imposed by a grid placed on the pen floor. One day before treatment (baseline), and treatment day (treatment) were followed by a 12-d washout period (with the first 7 d used to evaluate recovery). Study days were organized from 2100 to 2059. During habituation (d -3 and -2 before treatment), baseline (d -1), and trt (d 0), housing was individual boxstalls (mattress with no bedding). After treatment, cows returned to sand-bedded freestalls for a 7-d recovery period (d 1 to 7) where data on lying behaviors were collected. Following the recovery period, an additional 5-d period was provided to allow the cows a 12-d period between exposures to treatments. Daily lying time, number lying bouts, bout duration, and number of steps were recorded by dataloggers attached to the hind leg of cows throughout the study period. Data were analyzed using a mixed model including fixed effects of treatment (sleep deprivation vs. sleep and lying deprivation), day, and their interaction with significant main effects separated using a PDIFF statement (P ≤ 0.05). Interactions between treatment and day were detected for daily lying time and the number of bouts. Lying time was lower for both treatments during the treatment period compared to baseline. Lying time increased during the recovery period for both lying and sleep deprived cows. However, it took 4 d for the lying deprived cows to fully recover their lying time after treatment, whereas it took the sleep deprived cows 2 d for their lying time to return to baseline levels. Results suggest that both sleep and lying deprivation can have impact cow behavior. Management factors that limit freestall access likely reduce lying time and sleep, causing negative welfare implications for dairy cows."
https://openalex.org/W2970637699,"Pseudomonas fluorescens is considered to be a typical plant-associated saprophytic bacterium with no pathogenic potential. Indeed, some P. fluorescens strains are well-known rhizobacteria that promote plant growth by direct stimulation, by preventing the deleterious effects of pathogens, or both. Pseudomonas fluorescens C7R12 is a rhizosphere-competent strain that is effective as a biocontrol agent and promotes plant growth and arbuscular mycorrhization. This strain has been studied in detail, but no visual evidence has ever been obtained for extracellular structures potentially involved in its remarkable fitness and biocontrol performances. On transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained C7R12 cells, we observed the following appendages: multiple polar flagella, an inducible putative type three secretion system typical of phytopathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strains and densely bundled fimbria-like appendages forming a broad fractal-like dendritic network around single cells and microcolonies. The deployment of one or other of these elements on the bacterial surface depends on the composition and affinity for the water of the microenvironment. The existence, within this single strain, of machineries known to be involved in motility, chemotaxis, hypersensitive response, cellular adhesion and biofilm formation, may partly explain the strong interactions of strain C7R12 with plants and associated microflora in addition to the type three secretion system previously shown to be implied in mycorrhizae promotion."
https://openalex.org/W2970765627,"Pearl millet is an important crop for arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Genomic regions associated with combining ability for yield-related traits under irrigated and drought conditions are useful in heterosis breeding programs. Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) are excellent genetic resources for precise QTL mapping and identifying naturally occurring favorable alleles. In the present study, testcross hybrid populations of 85 CSSLs were evaluated for 15 grain and stover yield-related traits for summer and wet seasons under irrigated control (CN) and moisture stress (MS) conditions. General combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects of all these traits were estimated and significant marker loci linked to GCA and SCA of the traits were identified. Heritability of the traits ranged from 53–94% in CN and 63–94% in MS. A total of 40 significant GCA loci and 36 significant SCA loci were identified for 14 different traits. Five QTLs (flowering time, panicle number and panicle yield linked to Xpsmp716 on LG4, flowering time and grain number per panicle with Xpsmp2076 on LG4) simultaneously controlled both GCA and SCA, demonstrating their unique genetic basis and usefulness for hybrid breeding programs. This study for the first time demonstrated the potential of a set of CSSLs for trait mapping in pearl millet. The novel combining ability loci linked with GCA and SCA values of the traits identified in this study may be useful in pearl millet hybrid and population improvement programs using marker-assisted selection (MAS)."
https://openalex.org/W2970178148,"Fish spawning aggregations (FSA) act as biological hotspots that concentrate food and nutrients across a broad trophic spectrum. In Pohnpei (Federated States of Micronesia), 20 female grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) were acoustically tagged at two multi-species grouper (Epinephelidae) FSA to examine the likelihood that these mesopredators utilize FSA as a seasonal food source. Both FSA sites are within small-scale MPAs, thus providing a secondary opportunity to examine their conservation potential during these ephemeral events. Shark movement and residency was gauged against known spatial and temporal grouper reproductive patterns using an array of 15 and 50 acoustic receivers at Ant Atoll and Pohnpei (Island), respectively. Activity space was investigated using Kernel Density estimates of individual sharks, and residency indices (RI) were analyzed based on daily and monthly occurrence at the array. Three distinct residency patterns were identified: transient, semi-transient, or resident (Daily RI <0.40, >0.40 to 0.80, or >0.80, respectively). Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to identify biological and environmental factors influencing shark activity space, including month, temperature, shark size, spawning month, and residency pattern. Findings revealed significant changes in average monthly residency indices and kernel densities during spawning months in support of an opportunistic foraging strategy around FSA. Monthly residency was higher during spawning months among semi-resident and transient sharks, while average monthly activity space was concentrated around FSA. Best-fit models for the GLMM indicated that activity spaces were most influenced by month and grouper spawning month. Seven of 20 sharks demonstrated inter-island movement and wide variations in individual movement and spatial requirements were shown. The concentration of sharks and groupers at unprotected FSA sites increases their vulnerability to fishing and supports the need for combined area and non-area management measures to effectively protect these species."

In this study, we used the AOM/DSS-induced mouse model to show Hltf-deletion caused poor survival concomitant with increased tumor multiplicity, and dramatically shifted the topographic distribution of lesions into the rectum. Differential isoform expression analysis revealed both the truncated isoform that lacks a DNA-repair domain and the full length isoform capable of DNA damage repair are present during adenocarcinoma formation in controls. iPathwayGuide identified 51 dynamically regulated genes of 10,967 total genes with measured expression. Oxidative Phosphorylation (Kegg: 00190), the top biological pathway perturbed by Hltf-deletion, resulted from increased transcription of Atp5e, Cox7c, Uqcr11, Ndufa4 and Ndufb6 genes, concomitant with increased endogenous levels of ATP (p = 0.0062). Upregulation of gene expression, as validated with qRT-PCR, accompanied a stable mtDNA/nDNA ratio. This is the first study to show Hltf-deletion in an inflammation-associated CRC model elevates mitochondrial bioenergetics."
https://openalex.org/W2970547302,"During enteroviral infections, the canonical translation factor eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 γ I (eIF4GI) is cleaved by viral protease 2A. The resulting C-terminal fragment is recruited by the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) for efficient translation of the viral RNA. However, the 2A protease is not present in the viral capsid and is synthesized only after the initial round of translation. This presents the conundrum of how the initial round of translation occurs in the absence of the C-terminal eIF4GI fragment. Interestingly, the host protein DAP5 (also known as p97, eIF4GIII, and eIF4G2), an isoform of eIF4GI, closely resembles the eIF4GI C-terminal fragment produced after 2A protease–mediated cleavage. Using the Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) IRES as a model system, here we demonstrate that DAP5, but not the full-length eIF4GI, is required for CVB3 IRES activity for translation of input viral RNA. Additionally, we show that DAP5 is specifically required by type I IRES but not by type II or type III IRES, in which cleavage of eIF4GI has not been observed. We observed that both DAP5 and C-terminal eIF4GI interact with CVB3 IRES in the same region, but DAP5 exhibits a lower affinity for CVB3 IRES compared with the C-terminal eIF4GI fragment. It appears that DAP5 is required for the initial round of viral RNA translation by sustaining a basal level of CVB3 IRES activity. This activity leads to expression of 2A protease and consequent robust CVB3 IRES-mediated translation by the C-terminal eIF4GI fragment."
https://openalex.org/W2970811995,"Here we present novel method development and instruction in the construction and use of Field Portable Gas Analyzers study of belowground aerobic respiration dynamics of deep soil systems. Our Field-Portable Gas Analysis (FPGA) platform has been developed at the Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory (CCZO) for the measurement and monitoring of soil O2 and CO2 in a variety of ecosystems around the world. The FPGA platform presented here is cost-effective, lightweight, compact, and reliable for monitoring dynamic soil gasses in-situ in the field. The FPGA platform integrates off-the-shelf components for non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 measurement and electro-chemical O2 measurement via flow-through soil gas analyses. More than 2000 soil gas measurements have been made to date using these devices over 4 years of observations. Measurement accuracy of FPGAs is consistently high as validated via conventional bench-top gas chromatography. Further, time series representations of paired CO2 and O2 measurement under hardwood forests at the CCZO demonstrate the ability to observe and track seasonal and climatic patterns belowground with this FPGA platform. Lastly, the ability to analyze the apparent respiratory quotient, the ratio of apparent CO2 accumulation divided by apparent O2 consumption relative to the aboveground atmosphere, indicates a high degree of nuanced analyses are made possible with tools like FPGAs. In sum, the accuracy and reliability of the FPGA platform for soil gas monitoring allows for low-cost temporally extensive and spatially expansive field studies of deep soil respiration."
https://openalex.org/W2970838958,"Hyperinsulinemia affects 72% of Fanconi anemia (FA) patients and an additional 25% experience lowered glucose tolerance or frank diabetes. The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the dysfunction of FA pancreas β cells is unknown. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the functional role of FANCA, the most commonly mutated gene in FA, in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). This study reveals that FANCA or FANCB knockdown impairs GSIS in human pancreas β cell line EndoC-βH3. To identify potential pathways by which FANCA might regulate GSIS, we employed a proteomics approach to identify FANCA protein interactions in EndoC-βH3 differentially regulated in response to elevated glucose levels. Glucose-dependent changes in the FANCA interaction network were observed, including increased association with other FA family proteins, suggesting an activation of the DNA damage response in response to elevated glucose levels. Reactive oxygen species increase in response to glucose stimulation and are necessary for GSIS in EndoC-βH3 cells. Glucose-induced activation of the DNA damage response was also observed as an increase in the DNA damage foci marker γ-H2AX and dependent upon the presence of reactive oxygen species. These results illuminate the role of FANCA in GSIS and its protein interactions regulated by glucose stimulation that may explain the prevalence of β cell-specific endocrinopathies in FA patients."
https://openalex.org/W967024217,"Although it is well established that the vertebrate retina contains endogenous circadian clocks that regulate retinal physiology and function during day and night, the processes that the clocks affect and the means by which the clocks control these processes remain unresolved. We previously demonstrated that a circadian clock in the goldfish retina regulates rod-cone electrical coupling so that coupling is weak during the day and robust at night. The increase in rod-cone coupling at night introduces rod signals into cones so that the light responses of both cones and cone horizontal cells, which are post-synaptic to cones, become dominated by rod input. By comparing the light responses of cones, cone horizontal cells and rod horizontal cells, which are post-synaptic to rods, under dark-adapted conditions during day and night, we determined whether the daily changes in the strength of rod-cone coupling could account entirely for rhythmic changes in the light response properties of cones and cone horizontal cells. We report that although some aspects of the day/night changes in cone and cone horizontal cell light responses, such as response threshold and spectral tuning, are consistent with modulation of rod-cone coupling, other properties cannot be solely explained by this phenomenon. Specifically, we found that at night compared to the day the time course of spectrally-isolated cone photoresponses was slower, cone-to-cone horizontal cell synaptic transfer was highly non-linear and of lower gain, and the delay in cone-to-cone horizontal cell synaptic transmission was longer. However, under bright light-adapted conditions in both day and night, cone-to-cone horizontal cell synaptic transfer was linear and of high gain, and no additional delay was observed at the cone-to-cone horizontal cell synapse. These findings suggest that in addition to controlling rod-cone coupling, retinal clocks shape the light responses of cone horizontal cells by modulating cone-to-cone horizontal cell synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2970514710,"Good hearing is a fundamental skill that allows children to develop properly, both socially and intellectually. In contrast to defects in inner ear function, however, auditory processing disorders (APDs)-which can affect up to 2-3% of school-children-are not easily identified with basic screening programs and must be diagnosed using special tests. Although such psychoacoustic tests are available, the scores achieved depend highly on the social, cultural, and linguistic characteristics of the population, and norms must be established for each population separately. Reference values are still lacking for the Polish population, especially for children in school-age, so that practitioners must interpret test scores themselves, often intuitively or using potentially biased thresholds from other countries.We investigated a sample of 94 Polish schoolchildren with normal hearing, divided into four age groups: from 7 years-olds to 10 years-olds. All children had no speech or language development disorder, learning problem, or symptom of APD. Participants were volunteers who had previously taken part in a large screening study. The group consisted of 56 girls (60%) and 38 boys (40%) with an average age of 8.6 years (SD = 1.1). The test battery included the Duration Pattern Test (DPT), Frequency Pattern Test (FPT), Time-Compressed Speech Test (CST), and Dichotic Digit Test (DDT).The scores on all tests increased consistently with age. The difference between each age-group for DPT, CST, and left- and right-ear DDT tests was significant (Kruskal-Wallis test, p-values = 0.002, 0.006, 0.005, 0.020, respectively), but the effect of age on the FPT test was not (p-value = 0.143). The analysis showed a clear and significant separation between a merged group of ages 7 and 8 and another of ages 9 and 10. We, therefore, propose, for each test, separate reference values for these two particular age-groups. Using thresholds based on a 10% quantile, we offer the following reference values for ages 7-8 and 9-10 respectively: DPT, 28.5% and 53.8%; FPT, 18.5% and 27.5%; CST, 68.6% and 77.2%; left-ear DDT, 34.3% and 52.5%; right-ear DDT, 56% and 72.5%.The scores on psychoacoustic tests to diagnose APD differ between cultures and linguistic backgrounds. Clinicians should, therefore, use norms that have been designed for the population most similar to their patients. Here, we report the use of a test battery designed for the Polish language that accounts for various aspects of APD when screening school children. Together with a full methodology of those tests, we provide norms that can be used as cut-offs in clinical diagnosis. Practitioners are invited to use them to obtain more accurate, evidence-based decisions."

To facilitate the experimental approach of these studies, several collections of expression vectors have been generated (YXplac, pRS series, etc.). Subsequently, these collections have been expanded by adding more diversity to many of the plasmid features, including new selection markers and new promoter sequences. However, the ever growing number of plasmid features makes it unrealistic for research labs to maintain an up-to-date collection of plasmids. Here, we developed the COSPLAY toolbox: a Golden Gate approach based on the scheme of a simple modular plasmid that recapitulates and completes all the properties of the pRS plasmids. The COSPLAY toolbox contains a basal collection of individual functional modules. Moreover, we standardized a simple and rapid, software-assisted protocol which facilitates the addition of new personalized modules.

https://openalex.org/W2970439326,"Background Increasingly, genetic analyses are conducted using information from subjects with established disease, who often receive concomitant treatment. We determined when treatment may bias genetic associations with a quantitative trait. Methods Graph theory and simulated data were used to explore the impact of drug prescriptions on (longitudinal) genetic effect estimates. Analytic derivations of longitudinal genetic effects are presented, accounting for the following scenarios: 1) treatment allocated independently of a genetic variant, 2) treatment that mediates the genetic effect, 3) treatment that modifies the genetic effect. We additionally evaluate treatment modelling strategies on bias, the root mean squared error (RMSE), coverage, and rejection rate. Results We show that in the absence of treatment by gene effect modification or mediation, genetic effect estimates will be unbiased. In simulated data we found that conditional models accounting for treatment, confounding, and effect modification were generally unbiased with appropriate levels of confidence interval coverage. Ignoring the longitudinal nature of treatment prescription, however (e.g. because of incomplete records in longitudinal data), biased these conditional models to a similar degree (or worse) as simply ignoring treatment. Conclusion The mere presence of (drug) treatment affecting a GWAS phenotype is insufficient to bias genetic associations with quantitative traits. While treatment may bias associations through effect modification and mediation, this might not occur frequently enough to warrant general concern at the presence of treated subjects in GWAS. Should treatment by gene effect modification or mediation be present however, current GWAS approaches attempting to adjust for treatment insufficiently account for the multivariable and longitudinal nature of treatment trajectories and hence genetic estimates may still be biased."
https://openalex.org/W2970505529,"The neural computational model GrowthEstimate is introduced with focusing on new perspectives for the practical estimation of weight specific growth rate (SGR, % day-1). It is developed using recurrent neural networks of reservoir computing type, for estimating SGR based on the known data of three key biological factors relating to growth. These factors are: (1) weight (g) for specifying the age of the growth stage; (2) digestive efficiency through the pyloric caecal activity ratio of trypsin to chymotrypsin (T/C ratio) for specifying genetic differences in food utilization and growth potential, basically resulting from food consumption under variations in food quality and environmental conditions; and (3) protein growth efficiency through the condition factor (CF, 100 × g cm-3), as higher dietary protein level affecting higher skeletal growth (length) and resulting in lower CF. The computational model was trained using four datasets of different salmonids with size variations. It was evaluated with 15% of each dataset, resulting in an acceptable range of SGR outputs. Additional tests with different species indicated similarity between the estimated SGR outputs and the real SGR values, and the same ranking of wild population growth. The developed model GrowthEstimate is exceptionally useful for the precise and comparable growth estimation of living resources at individual levels, especially in natural ecosystems where the studied individuals, environmental conditions, food availability and consumption rates cannot be controlled. It is a revelation and will help to minimize uncertainty in wild stock assessment process. This will improve our knowledge in nutritional ecology, through the biochemical effects of climate change and environmental impact on the growth performance quality of aquatic living resources in the wild, as well as in aquaculture. The original GrowthEstimate software is available at GitHub repository (https://github.com/RungruangsakTorrissenManoonpong/GrowthEstimate). All other relevant data are within the paper. It will be improved for generality for future use, and required co-operations of the biodata collections of different species from different climate zones. Therefore, a co-operation will be available."
https://openalex.org/W2971339681,"Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen and the causative agent of diphtheria, a severe disease of the upper respiratory tract of humans. Factors required for C. diphtheriae to survive in the human host are not well defined, but likely include the acquisition of essential metals such as zinc. In C. diphtheriae, zinc-responsive global gene regulation is controlled by the Zinc Uptake Regulator (Zur), a member of the Fur-family of transcriptional regulators. In this study, we use transcriptomics to identify zinc-regulated genes in C. diphtheriae by comparing gene expression of a wild-type strain grown without and with zinc supplementation. Zur-regulated genes were identified by comparing wild-type gene expression with that of an isogenic zur mutant. We observed zinc repression of several putative surface proteins, the heme efflux system hrtBA, various ABC transporters, and the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase cluster sidAB. Furthermore, increased gene expression in response to zinc was observed for the alcohol dehydrogenase, adhA. Zinc and Zur regulation were confirmed for several genes by complementing the zur deletion and subsequent RT-qPCR analysis. We used MEME to predict Zur binding sites within the promoter regions of zinc- and Zur-regulated genes, and verified Zur binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Additionally, we characterized cztA (dip1101), which encodes a putative cobalt/zinc/cadmium efflux family protein. Deletion of cztA results in increased sensitivity to zinc, but not to cobalt or cadmium. This study advances our knowledge of changes to Zur-dependent global gene expression in response to zinc in C. diphtheriae. The identification of zinc-regulated ABC transporters herein will facilitate future studies to characterize zinc transport in C. diphtheriae."

For this type of study, a chromosome-level sequence assembly of the strain or population at time zero is required to compare with the genomes derived later. However, there is no fully automated computational approach in experimental evolution studies to establish the chromosome-level genome assembly using unique features of sequencing data. Methods and results In this study, we developed a new software pipeline, the integrative meta-assembly pipeline (IMAP), to build chromosome-level genome sequence assemblies by generating and combining multiple initial assemblies using three de novo assemblers from short-read sequencing data. We significantly improved the continuity and accuracy of the genome assembly using a large collection of sequencing data and hybrid assembly approaches. We validated our pipeline by generating chromosome-level assemblies of yeast strains W303 and SK1, and compared our results with assemblies built using long-read sequencing and various assembly evaluation metrics. We also constructed chromosome-level sequence assemblies of S. cerevisiae strain Sigma1278b, and three commonly used fungal strains: Aspergillus nidulans A713, Neurospora crassa 73, and Thielavia terrestris CBS 492.74, for which long-read sequencing data are not yet available. Finally, we examined the effect of IMAP parameters, such as reference and resolution, on the quality of the final assembly of the yeast strains W303 and SK1. Conclusions We developed a cost-effective pipeline to generate chromosome-level sequence assemblies using only short-read sequencing data. Our pipeline combines the strengths of reference-guided and meta-assembly approaches. Our pipeline is available online at http://github.com/jkimlab/IMAP including a Docker image, as well as a Perl script, to help users install the IMAP package, including several prerequisite programs. Users can use IMAP to easily build the chromosome-level assembly for the genome of their interest."

The goal of this study was to determine if combining a phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor (PDE4i); with a type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i); would have a beneficial effect on OAB symptoms and if a reduced dose of PDE4i in combination with PDE5i could also provide a beneficial effect in OAB. We hypothesized that PDE5i and PDE4i combination treatment could be utilized to reduce non-voiding contractions and smooth muscle disruption in a rat model of OAB. Methods Fifty-eight age-matched Sprague-Dawley rats underwent PBOO and daily gavage with PDE4i alone (roflumilast; 1mg/kg), PDE5i alone (tadalafil;10mg/kg), high dose combination (PDE4i 1mg/kg, PDE5i 10mg/kg), low dose combination (PDE4i 0.2mg/kg, PDE5i 10mg/kg), or vehicle for 28 days. Fourteen animals underwent sham PBOO with vehicle. Rats underwent conscious and anesthetized cystometry 28 days after PBOO and were euthanized for qualitative bladder histology. One-way ANOVA on ranks with a Dunn’s post hoc test was used to indicate statistically significant differences between groups (p<0.05). Results Bladder & urethral weight was significantly increased after PBOO with vehicle, PDE4i alone, and PDE5i alone, but not with either combination treatment. Frequency of non-voiding contractions during both conscious and anesthetized cystometry increased significantly after PBOO with vehicle, but not after PDE4i or high dose combination treatments compared to sham PBOO. Threshold pressure for voiding was significantly decreased with high dose combination compared to vehicle. PBOO treated with PDE4i alone or high dose combination showed less bladder smooth muscle fibrosis than vehicle, PDE5i alone, or low dose combination treatments. Conclusion A PDE4i and PDE5i combination treatment has potential benefit in reducing OAB symptoms, but future research is needed."

This may result in economic losses and threats to food security. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or antiviral therapies for ASFV. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated congocidine congeners and a tris-benzimidazole as potential inhibitors of ASFV transcription using an in silico approach. We applied redocking of congocidine and docking of its congeners and a tris-benzimidazole to a receptor containing B-DNA with AT-motifs as a target to mimic conserved ASFV late gene promoters. Subsequently, the binding scores of DNA-ligand docked complexes were evaluated and their binding affinity was estimated. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was then used to assess ligand behavior within the minor groove. From our results, it is evident the less toxic congocidine congeners and tris-benzimidazole could dock to AT-rich regions significantly. Additionally, the predicted binding affinities had suitable values comparable to other experimentally determined minor groove binders, MD simulation of the docked DNA-ligand complexes and subsequent molecular trajectory visualization further showed that the ligands remained embedded in the minor groove during the time course of simulation, indicating that these ligands may have potential applications in abrogating ASFV transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2970659206,"This study investigated the effect of using a cycling workstation on mouse dexterity, including if and how this changed with practice. Thirty-four healthy adults were allocated to a sitting group (n = 17) or cycling group (n = 17). All participants completed standardised computer tasks on 6 occasions: baseline and final—all participants were seated; practice 1 to 4—sitting group participants were seated, cycling group participants pedalled on an under desk cycle. Three computer tasks were employed: (1) Tracking (continuous task)—participants used the mouse pointer to track a dot in a figure of 8 pattern at 3 different speeds without a guide then with a guide (2) Aiming (discrete task)—participants moved the mouse pointer to a dot which repeatedly disappeared then reappeared again in different locations, creating the outline of a pentagram (3) Steering (continuous task)—participants steered the mouse pointer around two different pathways. Accuracy was measured during the Tracking and Steering tasks as the root mean square error and penalised path accuracy respectively. Speed was measured during the Aiming task as the movement time. Data was analysed using frequentist and Bayes Factor analyses. During the continuous tasks (Tracking and Steering), accuracy was impaired among participants using the cycling workstation, both compared to their accuracy when seated and to the accuracy of participants in the sitting group. In contrast, no deficits in speed were noted among participants using the cycling work station during the discrete task (Aiming). No learning effects were observed among either group for any tasks. These findings suggest using a cycling workstation may impair the accuracy but not speed of mouse use, regardless of task practice. Overall this supports the implementation of cycling workstations in typical office settings, but suggests cycling workstations may impair productivity among workers performing high precision mouse tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2970635226,"To examine how individuals perceive synchrony between music and body motion, we investigated the characteristics of synchrony perception during observation of a Japanese Radio Calisthenics routine. We used the constant stimuli method to present video clips of an individual performing an exercise routine. We generated stimuli with a range of temporal shifts between the visual and auditory streams, and asked participants to make synchrony judgments. We then examined which movement-feature points agreed with music beats when the participants perceived synchrony. We found that extremities (e.g., hands and feet) reached the movement endpoint or moved through the lowest position at music beats associated with synchrony. Movement onsets never agreed with music beats. To investigate whether visual information about the feature points was necessary for synchrony perception, we conducted a second experiment where only limited portions of video clips were presented to the participants. Participants consistently judged synchrony even when the video image did not contain the critical feature points, suggesting that a prediction mechanism contributes to synchrony perception. To discuss the meaning of these feature points with respect to synchrony perception, we examined the temporal relationship between the motion of body parts and the ground reaction force (GRF) of exercise performers, which reflected the total force acting on the performer. Interestingly, vertical GRF showed local peaks consistently synchronized with music beats for most exercises, with timing that was closely correlated with the timing of movement feature points. This result suggests that synchrony perception in humans is based on some global variable anticipated from visual information, instead of the feature points found in the motion of individual body parts. In summary, the present results indicate that synchrony perception during observation of human motion to music depends largely on spatiotemporal prediction of the performer's motion."
