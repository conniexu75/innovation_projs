https://openalex.org/W2022190942,"Gold clusters ranging in diameter from 1 to 6 nanometers have been prepared on single crystalline surfaces of titania in ultrahigh vacuum to investigate the unusual size dependence of the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and elevated pressure reaction kinetics measurements show that the structure sensitivity of this reaction on gold clusters supported on titania is related to a quantum size effect with respect to the thickness of the gold islands; islands with two layers of gold are most effective for catalyzing the oxidation of carbon monoxide. These results suggest that supported clusters, in general, may have unusual catalytic properties as one dimension of the cluster becomes smaller than three atomic spacings."
https://openalex.org/W1983398917,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) binding to the TNF receptor (TNFR) potentially initiates apoptosis and activates the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which suppresses apoptosis by an unknown mechanism. The activation of NF-κB was found to block the activation of caspase-8. TRAF1 (TNFR-associated factor 1), TRAF2, and the inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) proteins c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were identified as gene targets of NF-κB transcriptional activity. In cells in which NF-κB was inactive, all of these proteins were required to fully suppress TNF-induced apoptosis, whereas c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were sufficient to suppress etoposide-induced apoptosis. Thus, NF-κB activates a group of gene products that function cooperatively at the earliest checkpoint to suppress TNF-α–mediated apoptosis and that function more distally to suppress genotoxic agent–mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2105184358,"A strategy for the design of molecules with large two-photon absorption cross sections, delta, was developed, on the basis of the concept that symmetric charge transfer, from the ends of a conjugated system to the middle, or vice versa, upon excitation is correlated to enhanced values of delta. Synthesized bis(styryl)benzene derivatives with donor-pi-donor, donor-acceptor-donor, and acceptor-donor-acceptor structural motifs exhibit exceptionally large values of delta, up to about 400 times that of trans-stilbene. Quantum chemical calculations performed on these molecules indicate that substantial symmetric charge redistribution occurs upon excitation and provide delta values in good agreement with experimental values. The combination of large delta and high fluorescence quantum yield or triplet yield exhibited by molecules developed here offers potential for unprecedented brightness in two-photon fluorescent imaging or enhanced photosensitivity in two-photon sensitization, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2089574530,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is activated and phosphorylated on serine-15 in response to various DNA damaging agents. The gene product mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, ATM, acts upstream of p53 in a signal transduction pathway initiated by ionizing radiation. Immunoprecipitated ATM had intrinsic protein kinase activity and phosphorylated p53 on serine-15 in a manganese-dependent manner. Ionizing radiation, but not ultraviolet radiation, rapidly enhanced this p53-directed kinase activity of endogenous ATM. These observations, along with the fact that phosphorylation of p53 on serine-15 in response to ionizing radiation is reduced in ataxia telangiectasia cells, suggest that ATM is a protein kinase that phosphorylates p53 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4212962560,"The ATM protein, encoded by the gene responsible for the human genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), regulates several cellular responses to DNA breaks. ATM shares a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related domain with several proteins, some of them protein kinases. A wortmannin-sensitive protein kinase activity was associated with endogenous or recombinant ATM and was abolished by structural ATM mutations. In vitro substrates included the translation repressor PHAS-I and the p53 protein. ATM phosphorylated p53 in vitro on a single residue, serine-15, which is phosphorylated in vivo in response to DNA damage. This activity was markedly enhanced within minutes after treatment of cells with a radiomimetic drug; the total amount of ATM remained unchanged. Various damage-induced responses may be activated by enhancement of the protein kinase activity of ATM."
https://openalex.org/W2126426760,"Leptin is a hormone that regulates food intake, and its receptor (OB-Rb) is expressed primarily in the hypothalamus. Here, it is shown that OB-Rb is also expressed in human vasculature and in primary cultures of human endothelial cells. In vitro and in vivo assays revealed that leptin has angiogenic activity. In vivo, leptin induced neovascularization in corneas from normal rats but not in corneas from fa/fa Zucker rats, which lack functional leptin receptors. These observations indicate that the vascular endothelium is a target for leptin and suggest a physiological mechanism whereby leptin-induced angiogenesis may facilitate increased energy expenditure."
https://openalex.org/W2140799285,"The localization of substance P in brain regions that coordinate stress responses and receive convergent monoaminergic innervation suggested that substance P antagonists might have psychotherapeutic properties. Like clinically used antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs, substance P antagonists suppressed isolation-induced vocalizations in guinea pigs. In a placebo-controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe major depression, robust antidepressant effects of the substance P antagonist MK-869 were consistently observed. In preclinical studies, substance P antagonists did not interact with monoamine systems in the manner seen with established antidepressant drugs. These findings suggest that substance P may play an important role in psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2017215902,"Currently, the industrial production of adipic acid uses nitric acid oxidation of cyclohexanol or a cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture. The nitrous oxide emission from this process measurably contributes to global warming and ozone depletion. Therefore, the development of an adipic acid production process that is less damaging to the environment is an important subject in chemical research. Cyclohexene can now be oxidized directly to colorless crystalline adipic acid with aqueous 30 percent hydrogen peroxide under organic solvent- and halide-free conditions, which could provide an ideal solution to this serious problem."
https://openalex.org/W1967218150,"The c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) group of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases is activated by the exposure of cells to multiple forms of stress. A putative scaffold protein was identified that interacts with multiple components of the JNK signaling pathway, including the mixed-lineage group of MAP kinase kinase kinases (MLK), the MAP kinase kinase MKK7, and the MAP kinase JNK. This scaffold protein selectively enhanced JNK activation by the MLK signaling pathway. These data establish that a mammalian scaffold protein can mediate activation of a MAP kinase signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2072243374,"Signal transduction is controlled both by regulation of enzyme activation and by organization of enzymatic complexes with nonenzymatic adapters, scaffolds, and anchor proteins. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is one of several evolutionarily conserved mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades important in the regulation of growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. A two-hybrid screen was conducted to identify nonenzymatic components of this signaling cascade that might be important in regulating its activity. A protein called MP1 (MEK Partner 1) was identified that bound specifically to MEK1 and ERK1 and facilitated their activation. When overexpressed in cultured cells, MP1 enhanced activation of ERK1 and activation of a reporter driven by the transcription factor Elk-1. Expression of MP1 in cells increased binding of ERK1 to MEK1. MP1 apparently functions as an adapter to enhance the efficiency of the MAP kinase cascade."

Here it is shown that calcineurin, a calcium-regulated phosphatase, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of HCM. Administration of the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin and FK506 prevented disease in mice that were genetically predisposed to develop HCM as a result of aberrant expression of tropomodulin, myosin light chain–2, or fetal β-tropomyosin in the heart. Cyclosporin had a similar effect in a rat model of pressure-overload hypertrophy. These results suggest that calcineurin inhibitors merit investigation as potential therapeutics for certain forms of human heart disease."

Cattle are a natural reservoir for pathogenic E. coli , and cattle fed mostly grain had lower colonic pH and more acid-resistant E. coli than cattle fed only hay. On the basis of numbers and survival after acid shock, cattle that were fed grain had 10 6 -fold more acid-resistant E. coli than cattle fed hay, but a brief period of hay feeding decreased the acid-resistant count substantially."
https://openalex.org/W2019599792,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces sustained activation of classical MAP kinase (MAPK, also known as ERK) and neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells, whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces transient activation of ERK/MAPK and stimulates proliferation of the cells. Although previous studies showed that sustained activation of ERK/MAPK is important for neuronal differentiation of the cells, a recent report revealed that inhibition of the sustained phase of ERK/MAPK activation alone does not block neurite outgrowth caused by NGF.

The phaeochromocytoma cell line PC12 is a well studied model of actions of neurotrophic factors such as NGF1 (1Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NGF treatment of PC12 cells leads to their differentiation into sympathetic-like neurons characterized by neurite outgrowth.

However, a recent finding that although the sustained activation of ERK/MAPK results from activation of Rap1, expression of a mutant Rap1 that blocks the sustained phase of ERK/MAPK activation does not inhibit neurite outgrowth triggered by NGF demonstrates that neurite outgrowth by NGF does not require sustained activation of ERK/MAPK (9York R.D.

Moreover, there was another finding that bone morphogenetic protein-2 is able to induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells without marked activation of ERK/MAPK (10Iwasaki S. Hattori A. Sato M. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17360-17365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Bone morphogenetic protein-2 was also reported to induce neuronal differentiation in neural crest stem cells (11Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the existence of an additional signaling pathway(s) important for neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. On one hand, we observed activation of p38 as well as ERK/MAPK in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a member of an NGF family of neurotrophic factors, in cultured cerebellar granule cells. 2T. Morooka, H. Kawasaki, Y. Gotoh, and E. Nishida, unpublished data. We therefore examined a possible involvement of p38 in NGF actions. We have shown that NGF treatment induces rapid and relatively long activation of p38 and that inhibition of p38 by a specific inhibitor SB203580 or by expression of dominant-negative constructs of the p38 pathway blocks neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Surprisingly, expression of constitutively active MAPKK/MEK resulted in p38 activation as well as ERK/MAPK activation, and treatment with the p38 inhibitor blocked neurite induction caused by the constitutively active MAPKK/MEK. Moreover, we have shown that constitutive activation of p38 is able to induce neurite outgrowth when combined with EGF treatment, which induces transient activation of ERK/MAPK and p38. These results demonstrate an essential role of sustained activation of p38 in neuronal differentiation and suggest the importance of sustained activation of either the p38 or the ERK/MAPK pathway in determining the differentiation response in PC12 cells.

Rat phaeochromocytoma PC12 cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.35% glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum. After various treatments as indicated, the cell extracts were prepared as described previously (3Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J.

Transfection into PC12 cells was done by the LipofectAMINE method with the PLUS Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the use of 3 μg of total DNA/60-mm dish. Transfected cells were identified by cotransfection with pEGFP-C1, an expression vector encoding a variant of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP). After various treatments as indicated, cells were fixed and stained as described previously (13Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We first tested whether NGF treatment induces activation of p38 in PC12 cells. An immune complex kinase assay for p38 in extracts of PC12 cells treated with NGF revealed that p38 became activated within 5 min of the treatment, and the activity was maximal at 10 min and then gradually decreased (Fig. 1 A, left). The maximal level was similar to the level of activation induced by arsenite, a well known p38-activating stimulus. A paper that reported p38 activation by NGF in PC12 cells appeared (16Xing J. Kornhauser J. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) during the course of preparation of this manuscript. The NGF-induced activation of p38 was dependent on the concentration of NGF (Fig. 1 A, right), and the low level of activation was sustained for more than 3 h after NGF treatment (Fig. 1 A, left). The immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-p38 antibody that specifically recognizes the activated form of p38 showed similar kinetics of NGF-induced activation of p38 (Fig. 1 A, anti-P-p38). The protein level of p38 did not change upon NGF treatment (Fig. 1 A, anti-p38). As the NGF-induced activation of p38 was marked, we examined the effect of inhibition of p38 on the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Incubation of PC12 cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 (17Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), resulted in marked inhibition of the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth; the effect being dependent on the concentration of SB203580 (Fig. 2,A and B). The SB203580 at 10 μm was as effective as 30 μm PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPKK/MEK (8Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), in blocking neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the NGF-induced activation of ERK/MAPK was inhibited by 30 μm PD98059 by more than 85% (data not shown), it was not inhibited at all by 10 μm SB203580 (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the sustained activation of ERK/MAPK alone is not sufficient for neurite induction, and the activated p38 activity is required for the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. To confirm this, we expressed dominant-negative constructs of the p38 pathway in PC12 cells. Expression of a kinase-dead form of MKK6 (MKK6 is a direct and specific activator of p38) significantly blocked neurite outgrowth induced by NGF (Fig. 2, C and D, KN-MKK6). Furthermore, expression of a nonactivable form of p38 (AGF-p38, in which threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation phosphorylation site were replaced by alanine and phenylalanine, respectively), but not that of wild type p38, resulted in marked inhibition of the neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2, C and D, AGF-p38, WT-p38). These results clearly indicate that p38 activation is necessary for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. The previous finding that expression of a constitutively active mutant of MAPKK/MEK, a direct activator of ERK/MAPK, is capable of inducing neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in the absence of NGF (7Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3 A) seemed to apparently contradict the above results. Surprisingly, however, we have found that expression of the constitutively active MAPKK/MEK (=SESE-KK) induces constitutive activation of p38, although the level of the activation is lower than the maximal level of p38 activation induced by NGF treatment (Fig. 3 B). This activation of p38 was also demonstrated by immunofluorescent cell staining with anti-phospho-p38 antibody of SESE-KK-expressing cells (Fig. 3 C). The activation of p38 was dependent on the activated kinase activity of MAPKK/MEK, as expression of wild type MAPKK/MEK did not induce the activation of p38 (Fig. 3 B, WT-KK). Although the mechanism by which MAPKK/MEK activation results in p38 activation remains to be revealed, it may be an indirect effect, because the activated forms of MAPKK/MEK, including dually phosphorylated MAPKK/MEK and SESE-MAPKK/MEK purified from the expressed cells, did not directly activate p38 in vitro (data not shown). Remarkably, treatment with a p38 inhibitor SB203580 at 10 μm blocked the constitutively active MAPKK/MEK (SESE-KK)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Fig. 3 A). In these cells, ERK/MAPK was strongly and constitutively activated (Fig. 3 B), indicating again that sustained activation of ERK/MAPK alone, even if strongly activated, is not sufficient for neurite induction and that p38 activation is necessary. The PC12 cell line has been extensively used as an experimental system to study the specificity of the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling; although NGF induces neuronal differentiation, EGF does not (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). If EGF treatment could not activate p38 in PC12 cells, we could hypothesize that p38 activation would determine the differentiation. However, we found that EGF treatment of PC12 cells induces strong activation of p38 (Fig. 4, Aand B). This is consistent with the recent report showing EGF-induced activation of p38 in NIH-3T3 cells (16Xing J. Kornhauser J. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our detailed analysis, however, revealed a marked difference in the kinetics of p38 activation between EGF and NGF treatments. The EGF-induced activation of p38 was more transient than the NGF-induced activation. The immune complex kinase assay showed that the EGF-induced activation declined to near basal levels by 30 min, whereas the NGF-induced activation remained higher than the basal level even at 120 min (Fig. 4 A). In the indirect immunofluorescent staining with anti-phospho-p38 antibody, the NGF-induced activation of p38 was clearly observed in PC12 cells at 60 min after stimulation (Fig. 4 B, NGF 60′), whereas no staining was detected in EGF-stimulated cells at 60 min (Fig. 4 B, EGF 60′). Thus, it may be the duration of p38 activation that is important for determining the cellular response. Then, to examine whether sustained activation of p38 alone is able to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, we overexpressed both p38 and MKK6 in PC12 cells. As MKK6 has a relatively high basal activity (12Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E. Kuroyanagi N. Hagiwara M. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26981-26988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), overexpression of both MKK6 and p38 leads to strong and constitutive activation of p38, the level comparable with the maximal level of activation of endogenous p38 induced by NGF (data not shown). However, this overexpression did not induce neurite outgrowth in the cells, although it did induce some morphological changes (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, constitutive activation of p38 alone is not sufficient for neurite induction. Importantly, when combined with EGF treatment, the constitutive activation of p38 was able to induce neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4 C), which was blocked by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 4 C). The constitutive activation of p38 did not change the transient nature of the EGF-induced activation of ERK/MAPK (data not shown). We further found that arsenite treatment plus EGF treatment led to neurite induction in PC12 cells (Fig. 4 D), which was also blocked by SB203580 (data not shown). The EGF treatment induces transient activation of both ERK/MAPK (3Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J.

Therefore, sustained activation of p38 in combination with transient activation of ERK/MAPK may be sufficient for neurite induction in PC12 cells. An attractive model has been proposed previously that differentiation or proliferation responses are determined by the duration of ERK/MAPK activation (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar), as there was considerable evidence that neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells correlates with sustained activation of ERK/MAPK (6Traverse S.

This model, however, is apparently inconsistent with the observation that blockade of the sustained phase of ERK/MAPK activation does not inhibit NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (9York R.D. Yao H.

Our results here demonstrate that NGF induces longer activation of p38 than does EGF, which is required for neurite induction, and that sustained activation of p38 in combination with EGF treatment is able to induce neurite outgrowth. From these results the above inconsistency would be dissolved and a modified model could be formed; sustained activation of either of the two signaling pathways, the ERK/MAPK or the p38 pathway, combined with transient activation of the other or both, is critical for neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. Thus, control of the duration of the both pathways may underlie the mechanism that determines the specificity of the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. We thank R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2078129398,"Streptokinase is a plasminogen activator widely used in treating blood-clotting disorders. Complexes of streptokinase with human plasminogen can hydrolytically activate other plasminogen molecules to plasmin, which then dissolves blood clots. A similar binding activation mechanism also occurs in some key steps of blood coagulation. The crystal structure of streptokinase complexed with the catalytic unit of human plasmin was solved at 2.9 angstroms. The amino-terminal domain of streptokinase in the complex is hypothesized to enhance the substrate recognition. The carboxyl-terminal domain of streptokinase, which binds near the activation loop of plasminogen, is likely responsible for the contact activation of plasminogen in the complex."

The net synthesis reactions of 11 amino acids were exergonic in the hydrothermal solution, but all were endergonic in surface seawater. The synthesis of the requisite amino acids of nine thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins in a 100°C hydrothermal solution yielded between 600 and 8000 kilojoules per mole of protein, which is energy that is available to drive the intracellular synthesis of enzymes and other biopolymers in hyperthermophiles thriving in these ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2034752841,"DOCK180 is one of the two principal proteins bound to the SH3 domain of the adaptor protein CrkII. Here, we have studied the involvement of DOCK180 in integrin signaling. DOCK180 was neither phosphorylated nor bound to CrkII in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells and 3Y1 cells. We found that DOCK180 was phosphorylated and bound to CrkII in NIH 3T3 cells stimulated with integrin and also in 3Y1 cells transformed by v-src or v-crk. The binding of DOCK180 to CrkII correlated with the binding of CrkII to p130Cas, which is a major CrkII SH2 domain-binding protein at focal adhesions. In a reconstitution experiment, expression of DOCK180 induced hyperphosphorylation of p130Cas and a concomitant increase in the amount of CrkII bound to p130Cas. Similarly, binding of DOCK180 to CrkII was also enhanced by the coexpression of p130Cas. Finally, we found that coexpression of p130Cas and CrkII with DOCK180 induced local membrane spreading and accumulation of DOCK180-CrkII-p130Cas complexes at focal adhesions. These findings suggest that DOCK180 positively regulates signaling from integrins to CrkII-p130Cas complexes at focal adhesions.

Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins consist mostly of SH2 (Srchomology 2) and SH3 domains and include proteins such as CrkII, CrkL, Grb2, and Nck. Adaptor proteins are recruited to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins via their SH2 domains (2Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). This allows for proteins bound to the SH3 domain of adaptor proteins to be associated with intracellular locations where their substrates are located (3Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). It has been reported that integrin stimulation phosphorylates p130Cas and paxillin and induces the binding of CrkII to these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (4Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D.

These observations implicate CrkII in the signaling pathways of both cell adhesion and cell proliferation. It has been shown that the SH3 domain of CrkII binds to proteins of 135–145, 160, and 180 kDa. We have isolated the cDNAs of the 135–145- and 180-kDa proteins and designated them as C3G and DOCK180, respectively (12Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T.

C3G is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap-1, which was originally reported to be a suppressor of Ras (14Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Activation of C3G reverses the Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, as does Rap-1 (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). DOCK180 did not show any significant homology to any known protein at the time the cDNA was isolated, except that it contains an SH3 domain at its amino terminus. To study the biological function of DOCK180, we constructed a DOCK180 mutant that is membrane-targeted by the addition of a farnesylation signal. The rationale for this approach is based on the observation that other proteins bound to the SH3 domain of adaptor proteins, such as murine Sos and C3G, are functionally activated by membrane targeting (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell.

Expression of the farnesylated DOCK180 induced the spreading of spindle-shaped NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that DOCK180 may be involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (13Hasegawa H. Kiyokawa E.

Here, we present data implicating DOCK180-CrkII-p130Cas complexes in the integrin-mediated signaling at focal adhesions. Molecular cloning of DOCK180 and its expression vectors has been described previously (13Hasegawa H. Kiyokawa E. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell.

The anti-Crk monoclonal antibody and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody RC20 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-His, anti-FLAG, and anti-vinculin antibodies were from QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany), Eastman Kodak Co., and Cymbus Bioscience (Southampton, United Kingdom), respectively. Anti-p130Cas antibodies were from Dr. H. Hirai (29Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

Crk-3Y1 and SR-3Y1 are 3Y1-derived cell lines transformed by v-crk and v-src, respectively (20Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H.

Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells in a 60-mm diameter dish. After 16 h, cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml32Pi in phosphate-free minimum Eagle's medium for 4 h and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 500 μm Na3VO4, 10 mmNaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). DOCK180 was immunoprecipitated with anti-DOCK180 serum, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were stimulated by integrin essentially as described previously (32Yamaguchi R. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Sabe H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were grown in tissue culture dishes, labeled with 32Pi for 4 h, trypsinized, suspended in the same32Pi labeling medium containing 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and kept at 37 °C. After 1 h, the cells were plated onto dishes coated either with fibronectin for integrin stimulation or with poly-l-lysine as a control. Cells were washed, lysed in lysis buffer, and cleared by centrifugation after various plating periods. In some experiments, 1 mg/ml cytochalasin D was incubated in the cell suspension 10 min prior to plating onto the fibronectin-coated dish. Thirty minutes after plating, cytochalasin D-treated cells were similarly processed. DOCK180 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. To demonstrate that equivalent amounts of DOCK180 were immunoprecipitated, we performed anti-DOCK180 immunoprecipitation from unlabeled cells, followed by immunoblotting with anti-DOCK180 serum. NIH 3T3 cells expressing the human EGF receptor were serum-starved for 16 h before stimulation. Cells were labeled with 32Pi for 4 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF. After various incubation periods, DOCK180 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described above. Cells, with or without integrin stimulation, were lysed in lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min, the protein concentrations of the cleared lysates were determined using the micro-BCA kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of cell lysate were incubated with anti-Crk monoclonal antibody 3A8 (28Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and protein A/G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. After several washings, the immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies against Crk, DOCK180, C3G, and p130Cas. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding CrkII, p130Cas, and DOCK180. After 48 h, cells were lysed in lysis buffer. Cleared cell lysates were incubated with antibody against FLAG, Crk, His, or p130Cas for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant immune complexes were precipitated with a mixture of protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. After several washings, the immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibody against Crk, DOCK180, p130Cas, or phosphotyrosine. NIH 3T3 cells were plated subconfluently onto fibronectin-coated glass dishes (Mattek Corp., Ashland, MA) 16 h before microinjection. Expression plasmids were injected into the nucleus by use of an automated microinjection system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). After 16 h, cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.33 m sucrose at 25 °C for 15 min; permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 3 min; preincubated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min; and incubated with various combinations of anti-DOCK180, anti-Crk, anti-p130Cas, and anti-vinculin antibodies for 2 h. The cells were further incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy5 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), mounted in 90% glycerol containing 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma), and observed with a confocal laser microscope (Carl Zeiss). In a preliminary experiment, we found that DOCK180 was phosphorylated on serine residue(s) upon membrane recruitment, suggesting that phosphorylation could be used as an indicator of activation of DOCK180 (data not shown). Because two of the three major proteins bound to the SH2 domain of CrkII (p130Cas and paxillin) have been shown to be involved in signaling from integrins (4Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 6Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), we examined whether DOCK180 was phosphorylated upon integrin stimulation. NIH 3T3 cells were trypsinized and plated onto dishes coated with either fibronectin or poly-l-lysine (Fig. 1 A). Phosphorylation of DOCK180 was evident 15 min after plating, when most of the NIH 3T3 cells plated onto fibronectin began to spread, and persisted for 60 min after plating. Cells plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated dishes attached to the dish after 15 min; however, they did not start spreading until several hours after plating. DOCK180 was not phosphorylated when cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine. Cytochalasin D, which inhibits actin polymerization and integrin-dependent p130Cas activation (22Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), prevented the phosphorylation of DOCK180. Recently, we showed that CrkII plays a pivotal role in EGF-dependent transformation of normal rat kidney cells (33Kizaka-Kondoh S. Matsuda M. Okayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12177-12182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This finding led us to examine whether EGF induces phosphorylation of DOCK180 in NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, phosphorylation of DOCK180 was not detected at any time upon EGF stimulation. Because integrins play a significant role in transformation (34Schwartz M.A. Toksoz D. Khosravi-Far R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6525-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), we examined the phosphorylation of DOCK180 in transformed rat 3Y1 cells. We used the Crk-3Y1 and SR-3Y1 cell lines, which express v-Crk and v-Src, respectively. DOCK180 is heavily phosphorylated in the SR-3Y1 and Crk-3Y1 cell lines. In contrast, DOCK180 was only slightly phosphorylated in the parental 3Y1 cell line (Fig. 1 C). We next examined the binding of DOCK180 to CrkII. In quiescent NIH 3T3 cells, the binding of CrkII to DOCK180 was undetectable (data not shown). To our surprise, integrin stimulation induced the binding of DOCK180 to CrkII in the same NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2, left panel). In contrast, binding of C3G, the other major Crk SH3 domain-binding protein, was not changed by integrin stimulation. Binding of p130Cas to CrkII was also induced by integrin stimulation, as reported previously (23Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of DOCK180 to CrkII was compared in normal and transformed 3Y1 cells (Fig. 2, right panel). Binding of DOCK180 to CrkII was not detected in the parental 3Y1 cells, as we observed in NIH 3T3 cells. However, DOCK180 was co-immunoprecipitated with CrkII in 3Y1 cells transformed by v-Crk or v-Src. The anti-Crk antibody used for this experiment, 3A8, does not recognize chicken v-Crk protein 2E. Kiyokawa and M. Matsuda, unpublished observation.; therefore, DOCK180 was co-immunoprecipitated with the endogenous rat CrkII protein, but not with v-Crk, in the v-Crk-transformed 3Y1 cells. Similar amounts of C3G were bound to CrkII in the parental, v-Crk-transformed, or v-Src-transformed cells. The amount of CrkII-associated p130Cas was increased significantly in the cells transformed by v-Crk or v-Src compared with the parental 3Y1 cells. These results demonstrate that integrin stimulation induces the binding of DOCK180 to CrkII, whereas the other principal Crk SH3 domain-binding protein, C3G, constitutively binds to CrkII. To further study the binding of CrkII to p130Cas and DOCK180, we overexpressed these proteins in 293T cells. Mutants of DOCK180 and CrkII were also used to determine the domains required for interaction (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to the results obtained using NIH 3T3 cells, we found that FLAG-tagged DOCK180 was bound to CrkII in 293T cells with or without the coexpression of p130Cas (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3and 7). p130Cas was bound to CrkII without the coexpression DOCK180; however, the amount of CrkII-associated p130Cas was remarkably increased by the expression of DOCK180 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 4). In addition, we observed the appearance of a slowly migrating form of p130Cas, which is a hallmark of hyperphosphorylation, by the expression of DOCK180 (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Association of DOCK180 with p130Cas required the expression of CrkII (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3). Mutation of the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkII, CrkII W169L, abolished the DOCK180-dependent increase in the binding of CrkII to p130Cas and also the appearance of the slowly migrating form of p130Cas (Fig. 3 C). The SH2 mutant of CrkII, CrkII R38V, did not bind to p130Cas as expected. The DOCK180-delPS mutant, which lacks the Crk SH3 domain-binding domain, did not enhance the binding of CrkII to p130Cas (Fig. 3 D). By contrast, the DOCK180-delGS mutant, which consists of the carboxyl-terminal Crk SH3 domain-binding domain, did enhance the binding of CrkII to p130Cas; however, it did not induce the slowly migrating form of p130Cas. It has been shown that phosphorylation of p130Cas on multiple tyrosine residues causes the retardation of its migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (29Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Induction of the slowly migrating form of p130Cas by DOCK180 urged us to examine the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in the presence of CrkII and DOCK180 (Fig. 4 A). Expression of CrkII alone induced a slight tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas. Expression of DOCK180 alone did not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas; however, coexpression of DOCK180 with CrkII strongly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, concomitant with the appearance of the slowly migrating form of p130Cas. Both the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain-binding sites and the amino-terminal region of DOCK180 were required for the hyperphosphorylation of p130Cas (Fig. 4 B). In addition, we confirmed that both the SH2 and SH3 domains of CrkII were also required for the enhancement of p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation by DOCK180 (Fig. 4 B). Finally, we found that the slowly migrating form of p130Cas bound to CrkII and DOCK180 in the cells overexpressing all three proteins (Fig. 4 C). This result further suggests that DOCK180-CrkII complexes are involved in the hyperphosphorylation of p130Cas. Finally, we examined the effect of the coexpression of CrkII and p130Cas with DOCK180 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. DOCK180 expressed in NIH 3T3 cells localized diffusely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 A). Expression of CrkII with DOCK180 induced local membrane spreading at the periphery of the cells. Both DOCK180 and CrkII were localized diffusely in the cytoplasm. Coexpression of p130Cas and CrkII without DOCK180 also induced slight membrane spreading. Both p130Cas and CrkII were detected mostly in the cytoplasm. The most prominent morphological change was observed when both p130Cas and CrkII were coexpressed with DOCK180. These cells showed remarkable membrane spreading, and in these cells, all of DOCK180, CrkII, and p130Cas were concentrated at the focal adhesions, particularly near the edge of membrane spreading. Because our antibodies against CrkII, DOCK180, and p130Cas were derived from either mouse or rabbit, we could not detect all three proteins simultaneously. However, most of the DOCK180-expressing cells also expressed p130Cas and CrkII; colocalization of DOCK180 with CrkII and of DOCK180 with p130Cas indicates the existence of a DOCK180-CrkII-p130Cas complex. To confirm that this DOCK180-CrkII-p130Cas complex was concentrated at focal adhesions, cells were doubly stained with antibodies against DOCK180 and vinculin, which is a component of the focal adhesion complex. As shown in Fig. 5 B, DOCK180 colocalized very well with vinculin, particularly at the periphery of the cells. We did not observe remarkable differences in the number and size of focal adhesions between the parental NIH 3T3 cells and the cells expressing DOCK180, CrkII, and p130Cas. CrkII is involved in many signaling cascades, including those stimulated by integrins and the EGF receptor (36Matsuda M. Kurata T. Cell Signalling. 1996; 8: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the role of DOCK180, one of the two principal Crk SH3 domain-binding proteins, has not been studied in great detail. We have made several observations that DOCK180 is one of the downstream effectors of the integrin-p130Cas signaling cascade. First, the phosphorylation of DOCK180 correlates very well with the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, which occurs in integrin-stimulated cells as well as in cells transformed by v-src or v-crk (6Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21468-21471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Second, cytochalasin D, which inhibits the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of 130Cas (22Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), also inhibits the phosphorylation of DOCK180. Third, binding of DOCK180 to CrkII was detected only in the cells that contained the CrkII-p130Cas complex. Fourth, expression of DOCK180 enhanced the binding of CrkII to p130Cas and the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas. Finally, we found that the DOCK180-CrkII-p130Cas complex was concentrated at focal adhesions. CrkII is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with the EGF receptor upon EGF stimulation (25Ota S. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Hashimoto Y. Nishihara H. Nagashima K. Kurata T. Okayama H. Matsuda M. Cell Signalling. 1998; 10: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, DOCK180 was neither phosphorylated nor bound to CrkII upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 1 B).2 This result indicates that not all Crk SH3 domain-binding proteins are recruited equally to Crk SH2 domain-binding proteins, and various stimuli may result in the formation of the distinct Crk complexes. By contrast to the phosphotyrosine-dependent binding of proteins to SH2 domains, it was initially believed that adaptor proteins and their SH3 domain-binding proteins form constitutive complexes (38Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). However, the binding of proteins to the SH3 domain of NADPH is regulated by a conformational change of NADPH (39Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding between Grb2 and the Sos exchange factor for Ras is decreased by insulin stimulation (9Buday L. Khwaja A. Sipeki S. Farago A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6159-6163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6328-6332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, SH3 domain binding is also subject to regulation. We have found that the binding of CrkII to DOCK180 upon integrin stimulation is another example of signal-mediated binding of an SH3 domain to its target molecule. CrkII and Src have been suggested to play an important role in integrin signaling (42Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the association of CrkII with p130Cas promotes further phosphorylation of p130Cas by a mechanism termed processive phosphorylation (43Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We have found that binding of CrkII to DOCK180 is required for this hyperphosphorylation of p130Cas in 293T cells (Fig. 4). This hyperphosphorylation, which cause p130Cas to migrate more slowly on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, may function to amplify signaling to CrkII, judging from the increased amount of p130Cas-associated CrkII (Fig. 3 B). Currently, we do not know the biochemical function of DOCK180; therefore, we do not know how DOCK180 contributes to the hyperphosphorylation of p130Cas. The amino-terminal SH3 domain of DOCK180 may serve as a binding site for another tyrosine kinase. Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have shown that defects in their DOCK180 homologs, ced-5 and mbc, respectively, resulted in an abnormality of cell movement. ced-5 mutants are defective in the engulfment of cell corpses and the migration of the gonadal tip cells (44Wu Y.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The latter phenotype is rescued by the expression of human DOCK180, demonstrating that Ced-5 and DOCK180 are functionally conserved. The mbc mutant is defective in myoblast fusion, dorsal closure, and cytoskeletal organization (45Erickson M.S. Galletta B.J. Abmayr S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that DOCK180, coexpressed with p130Cas and CrkII, localizes at focal adhesions and induces cellular spreading (Fig. 5). Thus, the abnormality observed in ced-5 or mbc mutants may be due to defective signaling from cell adhesion molecules including integrins. We thank Dr. H. Hirai for the p130Cas antibody and plasmid and Drs. T. Ichiba, S. Ota, and R. J. Ingham for critical reading of the manuscript."

FcγRIIA cross-linking induces platelet secretion and aggregation, together with a number of cellular events such as tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of phospholipase C-γ2 (PLC-γ2), and calcium signaling. Here, we show that in response to FcγRIIA cross-linking, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) is rapidly produced, whereas phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate accumulates more slowly, demonstrating a marked activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin or LY294002 abolished platelet secretion and aggregation, as well as phospholipase C (PLC) activation, indicating a role of this lipid kinase in the early phase of platelet activation. Inhibition of PLCγ2 was not related to its tyrosine phosphorylation state, since wortmannin actually suppressed its dephosphorylation, which requires platelet aggregation and integrin αIIb/β3 engagement. In contrast, the stable association of PLCγ2 to the membrane/cytoskeleton interface observed at early stage of platelet activation was fully abolished upon inhibition of PI 3-kinase. In addition, PLCγ2 was able to preferentially interact in vitro with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Finally, exogenous PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 restored PLC activation in permeabilized platelets treated with wortmannin.

In addition to specific interactions involving their Fab domains, immunoglobulins G can interact with various membrane receptors by their Fc region. These so-called Fc receptors are coded by a heterogeneous family of at least eight genes forming a complex locus on chromosome 1. Based on both functional and structural criteria, these proteins can be differentiated into three groups (I–III) displaying various expression patterns in cells of the immune system (1Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 2Van de Winkel J.G.J. Capel P.J.A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 215-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Platelets possess a single class of Fcγ receptors, FcγRIIA.1 As reviewed by Anderson et al. (3Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), clustering of FcγRIIA induces shape change, secretion, and aggregation, which are typical platelet responses contributing to their hemostatic function. In addition, there is a close link between secretion and aggregation, since released ADP was shown recently to be very critical for platelet aggregation evoked by FcγRIIA cross-linking (4Polgar J. Eichler P. Greinacher A. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 549-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise role of platelet FcγRIIA is still obscure, although it explains how these cells are activated by specific antibodies directed against various membrane antigens, by immune complexes or by aggregated IgG (3Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On a pathophysiological point of view, platelet FcγRIIA might involve an hemostatic response at inflammatory sites displaying IgG deposits, and there is increasing evidence for a direct involvement of FcγRIIA in heparin-associated thrombocytopenia occurring in patients under heparin therapy (3Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). FcγRIIA is a 40-kDa polypeptide bearing two IgG-like domains in its extracellular region, a single transmembrane segment, and an ITAM, also known as Reth motif, in the cytoplasmic tail (5Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). ITAM sequences contain two variably spaced tyrosine residues; they are present in Fcγ receptors, FcεR, various subunits of both T cell and B cell antigen receptors, and the γ-chain of Fc receptor in platelets (6Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C-L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); and they support the paradigm of immune cell activation (7Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 8Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 553-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 9Cohen G.B. Ren R.

Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Indeed, clustering of membrane receptors present in cells of the immune system promotes the phosphorylation, presumably by Src kinases, of the two tyrosine residues of ITAM. This results in the specific anchoring to ITAM sequences of tyrosine kinases bearing two SH2 domains,i.e. either Syk or ZAP-70. These two tyrosine kinases then induce a complex set of signaling events including calcium mobilization as well as activation of PI 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases, the latter ones via an upstream cascade involving Grb2-Sos and the small GTPase Ras (7Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 8Ravetch J.V.

Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide metabolism plays a key role during the stimulation of immune cell receptors and involves two types of enzymes, PLC and PI 3-kinase. Among various isoforms identified so far, PLC-γ2 is abundant in hematopoietic cells, it is activated downstream of tyrosine kinases, and it promotes both calcium mobilization and activation of protein kinase C via the two second messengers produced upon hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (13Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 14Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the heterodimeric IA class PI 3-kinase is also regulated by tyrosine kinases and promotes the accumulation of D3-phosphoinositides, which are considered as potential second messengers (15Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 17Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have shown specific interactions between PLC-γ1 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but depending on the authors this might involve either the N-terminal PH domain or the SH2 domains of the protein (18Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 19Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, no direct link between PLC-γ2, which is inactive toward the products of PI 3-kinase, and PI 3-kinase itself has been demonstrated so far in cells activated via FcγRIIA cross-linking. Besides the fact that FcγRIIA might play a key role in the hemostatic and inflammatory function of platelets, these cells are interesting to consider in so far they contain a single class of Fcγ receptor (FcγRIIA), in contrast to neutrophils or monocytes, for instance (1Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar,3Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Clustering of platelet FcγRIIA promotes phosphorylation of the two tyrosine residues of the ITAM motif, which is followed by the classical set of signaling events occurring under similar conditions,i.e. various tyrosine phosphorylations and calcium mobilization, through activation of PLCγ2 (3Anderson C.L. Chacko G.W. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1995; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Anderson G.P. Anderson C.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) provided evidence that PI 3-kinase associates transiently with FcγRIIA upon platelet receptor clustering, probably via Syk. The present study was thus undertaken in order to determine possible changes of phosphoinositide metabolism occurring upon clustering of platelet FcγRIIA. In addition, taking advantage of the use of two specific and unrelated inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002), we have focused our interest on signaling events occurring downstream of PI 3-kinase. Our present data unravel a causal relationship between PI 3-kinase and PLC-γ2, which might also function in the signaling cascade evoked by other membrane receptors involved in the immune response. Anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody IV.3 and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragments were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, rabbit polyclonal anti-PLC-γ2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. [32P]Orthophosphate, 5-hydroxy[14C]tryptamine (56.0 mCi/mmol), and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, whereas [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. DiC16-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3and diC16-PtdIns(3,4)P2 were from Matreya Inc. PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, crude brain phosphoinositides, phosphatidylserine, thrombin, wortmannin, and RGDS were purchased from Sigma, and TLC plates from Merck. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Platelets were isolated from concentrates obtained from the local blood bank (Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine, Toulouse, France) essentially as described previously (24Cazenave J.P. Hemmendinger S. Beretz A. Sutter-Bay A. Launay J. Ann. Biol. Clin. 1983; 41: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar). They were washed in washing-buffer (pH 6.5) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmMgSO4, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, 0.35% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The same buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 was added to the final suspension, and pH was adjusted to 7.4. In experiments dealing with inositol lipid analysis, platelets were labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate during 60 min in a phosphate-free washing buffer (pH 6.5) at 37 °C. 32P-Labeled platelets were then washed once in the same buffer and finally suspended at a final concentration of 1 × 109 cells/ml (pH 7.4). Cross-linking of FcγRIIA was achieved by preincubation of platelets for 1 min with the monoclonal antibody IV.3 (2 μg/ml) followed by addition of anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C under gentle shaking as described previously (25Yanaga F.

Reactions were stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v) containing 0.4 nHCl, and lipids were immediately extracted following the modified procedure of Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar, 27Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, lipids were immediately deacylated by 20% methylamine and analyzed by HPLC on a Whatman Partisphere 5 SAX column (Whatman International Ltd., UK) as described previously (27Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3quantification, lipids were first resolved by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (80/30/26/24/14, v/v). The spots corresponding to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were then scraped off, deacylated, and analyzed by HPLC as described above. For PtdOH quantification, lipids were resolved by TLC using chloroform/methanol/10 N HCl (87/13/0.5, v/v) as described previously (28Cohen P. Broekman M.J. Verkleij A. Lisman J.W.W. Derksen A. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 762-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The spots corresponding to PtdOH were directly quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Aggregation was monitored using a Chrono-log dual channel aggregometer with stirring at 900 rev/min at 37 °C (5 × 108 platelets/ml). 5-Hydroxytryptamine secretion was determined as described previously (29Holmsen H.

Briefly, platelets labeled with 5-hydroxy[14C]tryptamine were preincubated or not with increasing concentrations of wortmannin or LY294002 for 15 min and stimulated by FcγRIIA cross-linking during 3 min in presence of 5 μm imipramine. Incubations were stopped by addition of 3% formaldehyde and 0.1 m EDTA, cooling on ice, and centrifugation. The radioactivity of 5-hydroxy[14C]tryptamine released from platelet dense granules was determined by liquid-scintillation counting. Proteins were resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mmdithiothreitol, and 3% SDS, boiled for 5 min, separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Gelman Sciences). The nitrocellulose was blocked for 60 min at room temperature with 1% (w/v) milk powder, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Immunodetection was achieved using the relevant antibody, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and ECL system. The various bands were quantified by densitometric analysis measuring the pixel volume in each area (Gel Doc 1000, Bio-Rad). Reactions were stopped by addition of twice-concentrated ice-cold lysis buffer containing 80 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm NaF, 20 mm EDTA, 80 mmNa4P2O7, 4 mmNa3VO4, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. After gentle shaking during 20 min at 4 °C and centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the soluble fraction was collected and precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL4B. The precleared suspensions were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the adequate antibody, and immune complexes were then precipitated by addition of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose CL4B for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifugation (6,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). The immunoprecipitates were washed once in lysis buffer and twice in washing buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting. Reaction was stopped and the cytoskeleton immediately extracted by adding one volume of ice-cold twice-concentrated cytoskeleton buffer containing 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EGTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 4 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 as described previously (30Grondin P.

After 10 min at 4 °C, the cytoskeleton was pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), washed once in cytoskeleton buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100, and once with the same buffer without Triton X-100. Cytoskeleton was then immediately suspended in electrophoresis sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). After stimulation, platelets were centrifuged (3,000 × g for 30 s) and suspended in 20 mm Pipes buffer (pH 6.8) containing 150 mmKCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 30 μg/ml saponin. After 3 min at room temperature under shaking, supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 40 s). The pellet was suspended in Laemmli's sample buffer, and PLC-γ72 was probed by Western blotting using a specific antibody as described above. [32P]PtdIns(3)P, [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2, and [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were prepared by incubating crude brain phosphoinositides (60 μg) mixed with phosphatidylserine (120 μg) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4(1 μg of phosphoinositides/μl), vortexed, and sonicated (20 kHz for 3 × 10 s). Lipid vesicles were then incubated with immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase in the presence of 30 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP (33Payrastre B. Gironcel D. Plantavid M. Mauco G. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After 30 min at 37 °C, reaction was stopped by addition of acidified chloroform/methanol and the lipids were immediately extracted as described above. Radiolabeled phosphoinositides were dried under a nitrogen stream and suspended in HNE buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. After sonication, HNE buffer supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 was added to obtain a final concentration of 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (34Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thirty μl of this suspension were added to immunoprecipitated PLC-γ2 resuspended in 30 μl of HNE buffer supplemented with 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. After 45 min of incubation at room temperature under gentle shaking, samples were washed twice with 1 ml of HNE buffer supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (34Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Lipids that remained associated with the immune complex were extracted as described above and resolved by TLC using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (20/30/26/24/14, v/v) (35Matsuo T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Katada T. Ui M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Platelet suspensions were adjusted to 5 × 109 cells/ml in 132 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 0.86 mmMgCl2, 8.9 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm Hepes, 5.6 mm glucose, 12.2 mmNa3 citrate, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.1 as described (36Kucera G.L. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5345-5348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then 100 μl of platelet suspension was mixed with 400 μl of buffer containing 120 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.269 mm CaCl2 and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.1. Platelets were incubated with 10 nm wortmannin or Me2SO for 15 min at 37 °C and then permeabilized during 3 min at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml saponin in the presence of 40 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm) with or without 15 μm diC16-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or diC16-PtdIns(3,4)P2. The F(ab′)2 fragments were added 1 min after monoclonal antibody IV.3. The incubation was stopped after 1 min by addition of chloroform/methanol (v/v), and lipids were extracted and resolved by TLC for PtdOH quantification as described above. Cross-linking of platelet FcγRIIA has been shown to induce a transient association of PI 3-kinase to the ITAM sequences present in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor; however, its consequences on a possible in vivo activation of the enzyme were not emphasized (23Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, using an HPLC technique, we have first measured the time course of D3-phosphoinositide synthesis during FcγRIIA-mediated activation of 32P-labeled platelets. We found that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was rapidly produced, whereas PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulated with a slower time course (Fig. 1 A). In addition, we observed a rapid drop in the substrate of PLC, PtdIns(4,5)P2, followed by its resynthesis (Fig. 1 B). This sharp decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2 was concomitant with the production of PtdOH (Fig. 1 C), an event considered to reflect PLC activation in platelets. In these cells, the main part of diacylglycerol produced by PLC is converted into PtdOH by a diacylglycerol kinase, the contribution of phospholipase D being relatively minor (37Van der Meulen J. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Huang R. Kucera G.L. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1652-1655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this, the production of PtdOH evoked by FcγRIIA cross-linking was abolished by the PLC-specific inhibitor U73122 (data not shown). Finally, the radioactivity of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) did not change significantly over the whole period of platelet stimulation by FcγRIIA cross-linking (Fig. 1 D). To determine whether PI 3-kinase was required for FcγRIIA-mediated physiological responses, wortmannin and LY294002, two unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitors, were used in platelet secretion and aggregation assays. As reported previously (23Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), platelet aggregation induced by FcγRIIA cross-linking was fully inhibited by low doses of wortmannin, whereas, in similar conditions, platelet aggregation induced by TRAP became reversible and thrombin-induced aggregation was not significantly affected (Fig. 2 A). Similar data were obtained with LY294002, which was able to fully inhibit FcγRIIA-mediated aggregation (95 ± 5% inhibition at 25 μm). Interestingly, platelet secretion evoked by FcγRIIA cross-linking was also strongly inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). These results clearly indicated a critical role for PI 3-kinase in the early steps of FcγRIIA-dependent platelet aggregation. Under these conditions (10 nm wortmannin), the synthesis of both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 was totally suppressed, while no change was observed for the other phosphoinositides (data not shown). However, interestingly, PtdOH production was almost abolished in platelets challenged with FcγRIIA cross-linking, whereas thrombin-induced accumulation of PtdOH remained insensitive to wortmannin (Fig. 3,A and B). Inhibition of PtdOH and D3-phosphoinositide production displayed very similar dose-response curves using the two inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, with IC50of 4 nm and 2 μm for wortmannin and LY294002, respectively (Fig. 3 C). These values are comparable to those determined for inhibition of serotonin secretion (6 nm and 5 μm, see Fig. 2 B). Finally, myrecithine, a natural flavonoid with inhibitory activity toward PI 3-kinase (39Agullo G. Gamet-Payrastre L. Manenti S. Viala C. Remesy C. Chap H. Payrastre B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), also blocked PtdOH formation. 2M.-P. Gratacap, B. Payrastre, C. Viala, G. Mauco, M. Plantavid, and H. Chap, unpublished observations. Specific inhibition of PI 3-kinase thus appeared to secondarily block PLC activation evoked by FcγRIIA cross-linking, at a variance with the signaling pathway evoked by thrombin. As a main difference between thrombin and FcγRIIA cross-linking, the former activates PLC-β2 and -β3, which are regulated by heterotrimeric G-proteins and are present in significant amounts in platelets (40Bristol J.A. Rhee S.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 402-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Banno Y. Nakashima S. Ohzawa M. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14989-14994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, PLC-γ2 appears as an essential intermediate in the signaling pathway evoked downstream of FcγRIIA, which involves its tyrosine phosphorylation presumably by Syk (25Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.-L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 42Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibition of Syk by a specific inhibitor, piceatannol, was found to inhibit secretion, aggregation, and PtdOH production induced by FcγRIIA cross-linking, the same effects being reproduced with the specific PLC inhibitor U73122 (data not shown). This led us to explore the effect of wortmannin on the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2. We first investigated the whole pattern of phosphotyrosyl proteins in platelets stimulated by FcγRIIA cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 4 A, this was not affected even at a high concentration of wortmannin (100 nm). In contrast to thrombin, FcγRIIA cross-linking promoted its own transient tyrosine phosphorylation, as reported by others (43Blake R.A. Asselin J. Walker T. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 44Robinson A. Gibbins J. Rodriguez-Linares B. Finan P.M. Wilson L. Kellie S. Findell P. Watson S.P. Blood. 1996; 88: 522-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Again, this was insensitive to wortmannin. PLC-γ2 also displayed a transient tyrosine phosphorylation in response to FcγRIIA cross-linking. This reached a maximum at 1 min and decreased rapidly thereafter (Fig. 4, B, panel a, and C). Surprisingly neither wortmannin (10 nm) nor LY294002 (10 μm) altered the early phase of PLC-γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation, but they abolished the secondary dephosphorylation step (Fig. 4 B, panels b and c, and C). A clearer interpretation of the latter data became possible when we observed the same effects with the tetrapeptide RGDS, which inhibits platelet aggregation by competing for fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIb/β3or in the absence of shaking that also prevented aggregation (Fig. 5 A). It thus appeared that dephosphorylation of PLC-γ2 is a relatively late signaling event occurring downstream of integrin αIIb/β3engagement, which was shown previously to acti"

Insulin secretion is abnormally low in individuals with HNF-1α diabetes, non-diabetic subjects with mutations in HNF-1α demonstrate reduced insulin secretory responses to high glucose, and insulin levels may be reduced even under basal conditions (4Byrne M.M.

We have demonstrated previously that mice lacking both alleles of the HNF-1α gene (HNF-1α (−/−)) have substantially reduced insulin secretory responses to glucose compared with wild type mice (HNF-1α (+/+)) whereas heterozygous HNF-1α (HNF-1α (+/−)) are normal (6Pontoglio M.

In this study, experiments have been performed in wild type mice, and in heterozygous and homozygous HNF-1α-deficient mice (7Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C.

Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), to define the nature of the defects present in β-cell signaling pathways that are responsible for reduced insulin secretory responses to glucose in HNF-1α diabetes.RESULTSWe have previously demonstrated that insulin secretion, in response to an increase in glucose concentration from 2 to 26 mm, in islets from HNF-1α (−/−) animals is substantially (approximately 85%) lower than in islets from both HNF-1α (+/+) or (+/−) animals (6Pontoglio M. Sreenan S. Roe M. Pugh W. Ostrega D. Doyen A. Pick A.J. Baldwin A. Velho G. Froguel P. Levisetti M. Bonner-Weir S. Bell G.I. Yaniv M. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2215-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In order to further define the insulin secretory defect in the HNF-lα (−/−) mouse, isolated pancreatic islets were stimulated with secretagogues that provoke insulin release by distinct mechanisms. Increases in extracellular glucose concentration normally initiate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells by inducing closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) via an increase in the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio (16Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 17Cook D.L. Hales C.N. Nature. 1984; 312: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). This leads to membrane depolarization and influx of Ca2+ through voltage-dependent Ca2+channels. The elevation in [Ca2+]i is a necessary prerequisite for insulin granule exocytosis. Sulfonylurea drugs like tolbutamide stimulate insulin secretion by directly blocking KATP (18Trube G. Rorsman P. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pfluegers Arch. 1985; 407: 493-499Crossref Scopus (526) Google Scholar). As was the case with glucose, tolbutamide produced a significantly smaller secretory response in HNF-1α (−/−) compared with (+/−) islets (0.17 ± 0.05 versus 0.4 ± 0.05 pmol/liter/ng of DNA, p < 0.05, Fig. 1). On the other hand, direct depolarization of islet β-cells using 20 mm KCl induced equivalent responses in (−/−) and (+/−) islets (0.19 ± 0.04versus 0.25 ± 0.03 pmol/liter/ng of DNA,p > 0.05).Stimulation of islets from HNF-1α (−/−) mice with glyceraldehyde, a metabolic intermediate that enters glycolysis distal to glucose 6-phosphate, produced only 30% of the peak secretory response seen in (+/−) islets when applied to the (−/−) islets (0.24 ± 0.06versus 0.73 ± 0.18 pmol/liter/ng of DNA;p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 A). In addition, the area under the curve for [Ca2+]i in (−/−) islets in response to glyceraldehyde was 28% of the (+/−) value (Table I). These data suggest that specific steps in the early signal transduction process stimulated by glucose were impaired in the HNF-1α (−/−) islets. The observation that KCl induced equivalent increases in [Ca2+]i in HNF-1α (−/−) and (+/−) islets (Table I) suggests that later steps responsible for the elevation in [Ca2+]i were unaffected. We have previously shown that 14 mm glucose failed to elevate [Ca2+]i in the (−/−) islets (6Pontoglio M. Sreenan S. Roe M. Pugh W. Ostrega D. Doyen A. Pick A.J. Baldwin A. Velho G. Froguel P.

Open table in a new tab In order to further evaluate alterations in proximal steps in the glucose-stimulated stimulus-secretion coupling pathway, we measured changes in KATP currents (IKATP) in single pancreatic β-cells utilizing standard whole-cell voltage clamp techniques. Exposure of single β-cells to stimulatory concentrations of glucose ordinarily results in a rapid suppression of IKATP. HNF-1α (−/−) β-cells displayed large amplitude IKATPthat were fully activated on break-in or progressively increased during the 5–10 min dialysis period (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, in HNF-1α (+/−) and (+/+) β-cells the amplitude of IKATP initially was small or completely absent, then increased and subsequently decreased rapidly during dialysis (Fig. 2, B and C). On average, the HNF-1α (−/−) cells had about 90-fold larger IKATP than the controls: 175.4 ± 5.8 pA/pF (n = 12) compared with 2.1 ± 0.8 pA/pF (n = 8) (Fig. 3 D).Figure 2Characterization of outward K+currents in pancreatic β-cells from HNF-1α (−/−) and (+/−) mice.

Hales C.N. Nature. 1984; 312: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), and confirmed in the case of ATP in (+/−) β-cells bathed in 2 mm glucose. Furthermore, both HNF-1α (−/−) and (+/−) β-cells were equivalently suppressed by 1 mm tolbutamide (Fig. 3 C) (18Trube G. Rorsman P. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pfluegers Arch. 1985; 407: 493-499Crossref Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the glucose insensitivity of HNF-1α (−/−) β-cells might be related to an inability to produce ATP following the metabolism of glucose. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that β-cells from (+/−) animals bathed in 10 mm glucose, together with the ATP synthesis uncouplers sodium azide (Fig. 3 D) or FCCP (data not shown) (19Misler S. Barnett D.W. Falke L.C. Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 421: 289-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Benz R. McLaughlin S. Biophys.

The methyl ester of pyruvate, a potent insulin secretagogue that generates large amounts of mitochondrial ATP (21Mertz R.J. Worley III, J.F. Spencer B. Johnson J.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4838-4845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Jijakli H. Nadi A.B. Cook L. Best L. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was used to specifically stimulate mitochondrial ATP production. Exposure of the HNF-1α (−/−) β-cells to 20–50 mm methyl pyruvate induced an immediate (<20 s) suppression of IKATP (Fig. 4), which was reversible following addition of sodium azide, demonstrating that the effect is mediated through a stimulation of mitochondrial ATP production. Leucine, another stimulator of mitochondrial ATP synthesis (23Sener A. Leclercq-Meyer V. Giroix M.H. Malaisse W.J. Hellerstrom C. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), elicited similar effects on IKATP in the homozygous mutant β-cells that were reversed by sodium azide (data not shown). These results suggest that the ability of mitochondria to generate ATP from leucine or methyl pyruvate is unaffected by the loss of HNF-1α expression. Consistent with the effectiveness of mitochondrial substrates in suppressing IKATP, methyl pyruvate produced equivalently robust elevation in [Ca2+]i in the mutant and control islets (Table I). Furthermore, the mean insulin secretory responses to methyl pyruvate were not significantly different in HNF-1α (+/−) and (−/−) islets (0.64 ± 0.04 versus 0.44 ± 0.12 pmol/liter/ng of DNA; p > 0.05) (Fig. 1 B). Iodoacetic acid (IAA) inhibits glycolysis at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) preventing NADH and glycolytic ATP generation (24Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1968; 109: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When perifused prior to glucose, 1 mm IAA markedly attenuated the insulin secretory response to glucose in control islets ((+/−) or (+/+)), rendering them as unresponsive to glucose as the HNF-1α (−/−) islets (Fig. 5).Figure 4Stimulators of mitochondrial ATP production suppress IKATP in HNF-1α (−/−) β-cells. A family of KATP currents before (left) and after (right) exposure to methyl pyruvate are shown.Middle panel shows ramps during wash-in of reagent.

To determine if the impairment of ATP production is secondary to failure to reduce NAD+ to NADH, NAD(P)H generation by islets in response to glucose was estimated using fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence intensity at 460 nm increased by 72% and 71% over basal levels in response to 14 mm glucose in the HNF-1α (+/+) (Fig. 6, A and D) and (+/−) islets (data not shown) but only by 23% in the (−/−) islets (p < 0.05; Fig. 6, B and D). IAA also abolished NAD(P)H responses of (+/+) islets to glucose (Fig. 6 C) to levels similar to those seen in (−/−) islets with glucose alone (Fig. 6 B). Methyl pyruvate (24 mm) induced a 2.1-fold increase in NAD(P)H in HNF-1α (−/−) islets, which tended to be greater than the responses in (+/+) islets (1.7-fold increase) (Fig. 7,A, B, and D). That the large increases in NAD(P)H in both (−/−) and (+/+) islets induced by methyl pyruvate occurred by stimulation of Krebs cycle metabolism was supported by the lack of effect of iodoacetate on methyl pyruvate-induced increases in NAD(P)H (Fig. 7, C and D).Figure 6NAD(P)H responses to glucose in HNF-1α (−/−) and in (+/+) islets.

Perifusate contained 2 mm glucose unless indicated. The relative increase in fluorescence induced by glucose (D) was 68% lower in (−/−) islets (hatched bar) than in controls (open bar, p < 0.05) and the response to glucose in (+/+) islets was attenuated by IAA (solid bar on theright, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7NAD(P)H responses to methylpyruvate in HNF-1α (−/−) and (+/+) islets.

The average glycolytic flux in islets from HNF-1α (−/−) islets (12.7 ± 3.6 pmol/islet/2 h) was not different from (+/+) and (+/−) islets (13.7 ± 2.6 and 15.1 ± 3.1, respectively) under basal conditions (2 mmglucose). Glucose utilization in islets incubated at 14 mmglucose was increased by 49.9 ± 10.3 pmol/islet/2 h and 48.6 ± 9.8 pmol/islet/2 h in HNF-1α (+/+) and (+/−) islets, respectively. In contrast, the increase in glycolytic flux in response to stimulation with 14 mm glucose in HNF-1α (−/−) islets was significantly attenuated (26.1 ± 1.3 pmol/islet/2 h,p < 0.05 compared with both control groups) (Fig. 8 A). Since a greater rate of glucose utilization could in theory be due to the larger size of the control islets, the respective mean relative increases in glucose utilization in the different mouse groups at 14 mm glucose over the values measured at 2 mm glucose were compared. Glucose utilization in HNF-1α (+/+) islets was 5.4 ± 0.9-fold greater at 14 than at 2 mm glucose compared with 4.7 ± 0.8-fold in (+/−) islets (p > 0.05 compared with (+/+) islets) and 2.6 ± 0.5-fold in the (−/−) islets (p < 0.05 compared with (+/+) islets; Fig. 8 B).Figure 8Measurements of glucose utilization in HNF-1α (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) islets. Glucose utilization was determined by measuring the formation of3H2O from tritiated glucose in batches of 10 HNF-1α (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) islets incubated in duplicate for 120 min in KRB containing either 2 or 14 mm glucose and a tracer dose of d-[5-3H]glucose. Rates of glycolytic flux were similar at 2 mm glucose (not shown). The absolute increase in glucose utilization (A) as glucose concentration was increased from 2 to 14 mm in HNF-1α (+/+) islets (49.9 ± 10.3 pmol/islet/2 h, open bar) was similar to that in HNF-1α (+/−) islets (48.6 ± 9.8 pmol/islet/2 h, hatched bar), and both were greater than in HNF-1α (−/−) islets (26.1 ± 1.3 pmol/islet/2 h, solid bar; *, p < 0.05 compared with (+/+) and (+/−)). Compared with glycolytic flux at 2 mm glucose, glucose utilization at 14 mm glucose was 5.4 ± 0.9-fold higher (B) in HNF-1α (+/+) islets, 4.7 ± 0.8-fold higher in (+/−) islets (p > 0.05, compared with (+/+) and 2.6 ± 0.5-fold higher in the (−/−) islets; #, p< 0.05 compared with (+/+)).

In order to determine if this occurred, changes in Magnesium Green fluorescence were measured in islets from HNF-1 α (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) mice in response to stimulation by 14 mm glucose and 10 mm KIC (a stimulator of mitochondrial metabolism) in the presence of 2 mm glucose (Fig. 9). The expected small reduction in MgG fluorescence was consistently seen in islets from (+/+) and (+/−) mice. The average maximal decrease in fluorescence intensity in the (+/+) islets in response to a step increase from 2 to 14 mmglucose was 13.5 ± 1.7% and in the (+/−) mice was 10.7 ± 2.6%. Although these differences within each of the groups represented statistically significant differences from base-line, the magnitude of the change in fluorescence was not different between the (+/+) and (+/−) islets. In contrast, glucose did not induce a significant change (2.4 ± 1.0%) in fluorescence intensity in the (−/−) islets. The average change in fluorescence was significantly less than in control islets (p < 0.03 compared with (+/−) and p < 0.005 compared with (+/+) islets; Fig. 9 C). In contrast, there was no difference in the response to 10 mm KIC in the three groups. The average maximal decrease in fluorescence intensity in response to KIC was 13.6 ± 1.8, 15.5 ± 1.6, and 14.5 ± 2.1 in the (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) islets, respectively (p > 0.05; Fig. 9 D).Figure 9Measurement of Magnesium Green fluorescence in HNF-1α (+/+), (+/−), and (−/−) islets.

Perifusate contained 2 mm glucose unless indicated. CCCP (10 μm), an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, which results in reduced ATP levels, was added for the last 5 min of each experiment (solid bar). The average reduction in MgG fluorescence intensity in response to glucose stimulation was 13.5 ± 1.7% in HNF-1 α (+/+) islets (open bar;n = 8 mice), 10.7 ± 2.6% in (+/−) islets (hatched bar; n = 6,p > 0.05 compared with (+/+)) and 2.4 ± 1.0% in (−/−) islets (solid bar; n = 5;p < 0.05 compared with (+/+) and (+/−)) (C).

Although insulin secretion following application of tolbutamide was reduced in islets from homozygous mutant mice, it is likely that this is secondary to a defect in ATP production. This hypothesis accords with the observation that the sensitivity of KATP to sulfonylureas is low in cells with impaired ATP production (25Findlay I. Circ.

Using standard whole-cell voltage clamp configuration recordings, we demonstrated that the ability of glucose to induce closure of KATP channels in the HNF-1α (−/−) mouse β-cells was significantly reduced.

The FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide)–related neuropeptide gene family in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is composed of at least 18 genes that may encode 53 distinct FMRFamide-related peptides. Disruption of one of these genes, flp-1 , causes numerous behavioral defects, including uncoordination, hyperactivity, and insensitivity to high osmolarity. Conversely, overexpression of flp-1 results in the reciprocal phenotypes. On the basis of epistasis analysis, flp-1 gene products appear to signal upstream of a G protein–coupled second messenger system. These results demonstrate that varying the levels of FLP-1 neuropeptides can profoundly affect behavior and that members of this large neuropeptide gene family are not functionally redundant in C. elegans ."

Below the isoelectric point, molecules partitioning into the excitation region increased in number but maintained a random spatial distribution, implying that surface charge can influence the charged protein at distances beyond that of the electrical double-layer thickness. The residence times of the molecules in the interfacial layer also increased below the isoelectric point. However, immobilization on the solid surface for extended periods was not observed. Histograms of residence times exhibit nearly identical asymmetry as the corresponding elution peaks in capillary electrophoresis.

However, this region remains relatively uncharacterized and the signal transduction pathway that mediates the regulation has not been examined. Cells respond to extracellular signals by transmitting intracellular instructions to coordinate fundamental cellular responses. The mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are among the best characterized of these intracellular signaling pathways. These cascades consist of a three-kinase module that includes a MEK kinase (MEKK) which activates a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) which activates a MAPK (15Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

The activated transcription factors, in turn, bind to DNA elements and modulate gene expression (17Gruda M.C. Kovary K. Metz R. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2537-2547PubMed Google Scholar). Our knowledge of these signaling pathways is limited with respect to regulation of specific genes in epidermal keratinocytes. In the present study we use the human involucrin gene as a model to study the regulation of differentiation-dependent keratinocyte gene expression by the MAPK cascades. Our evidence suggests that hINV promoter activity is regulated via a MAPK pathway that includes PKC, Ras, MEKK1, MEK3, p38/RK, and AP1. Alternate pathways may also exist. We also demonstrate that activity in this pathway is directed to a single AP1 site, AP1-1, located within the proximal regulatory region of the hINV promoter.

Transformation of the GST-c-Jun fusion protein expression vector intoEscherichia coli cells, protein induction, and purification were performed according to standard procedures. Normal human foreskin keratinocytes were cultured as described previously (6Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Third passage keratinocytes were transfected in 60-mm diameter dishes when approximately 60% confluent. For transfection experiments, 16 μg of Lipofectin reagent and 4.5 μg of involucrin promoter reporter plasmid were mixed, added to cells in 3 ml of KSFM and incubated for 5 h at 37 C. For co-transfection experiments, 2.5 μg of involucrin promoter reporter plasmid and 0–2 μg of a second plasmid were transfected. The final DNA concentration in all groups was adjusted to 4.5 μg of DNA per 16 μg of Lipofectin/60-mm dish by addition of empty expression vector. At 5 h, 3 ml of KSFM was added and the incubation continued for 19 h. The cells were then given fresh medium, allowed to recover for 24 h, and treated with KSFM in the presence or absence of TPA and/or the indicated inhibitor. After an additional 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in 250 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and harvested by scraping. Luciferase activity was assayed immediately using Promega luciferase assay kit and a Berthold luminometer. All assays were performed in triplicate and each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Luciferase activity was normalized per micrograms of protein as previously decribed (7Banks E.B.

Polyadenylated RNA was prepared, electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel, and transferred to Biodyne A membranes as described previously (30Gilfix B.M. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14026-14029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized with cDNA probes encoding human involucrin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (31Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled by random priming in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Signal intensity was determined by densitometry. The JNK kinase assay was performed as described (32Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocytes were grown for 24 h in 100-mm diameter dishes in KSFM. Cells were then treated with the desired agents, rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested by scraping in the lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml PMSF. JNK was precipitated by addition of excess GST-c-Jun fusion protein linked to GSH-agarose beads. The beads were extensively washed with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After 15 min at 30 °C, the kinase reactions were terminated by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, and dried. The presence of labeled GST-c-Jun was detected by autoradiography. p44/p42 MAP kinase activity was assayed using a New England Biolabs assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Keratinocytes were grown for 24 h in 100-mm diameter dishes in KSFM. The cells were treated with each agent as indicated in the figure legends. Cell extracts were prepared under nondenaturing conditions, and active (phosphorylated) MAPK was selectively immunoprecipitated using a phospho-specific (Thr202/Tyr204) MAPK antibody. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with GST-Elk1 fusion protein in kinase buffer containing radioinert ATP, and the products were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% acrylamide gel. Elk1 phosphorylation was measured by immunoblot using a phospho-Elk1 (phosphorylated Ser383-specific) antibody. We have shown that treatment of keratinocytes with TPA results in an increase in involucrin mRNA levels (6Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1we extend these results and show that this response can be inhibited by simultaneous treatment of cultures with BIS-IM, a specific inhibitor of PKC, or genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Thus, PKC (serine/threonine kinase), and tyrosine kinases (perhaps MEKs, threonine/tyrosine dual specificity kinases), regulate hINV gene expression. To determine how these agents regulate hINV gene expression, we evaluated the effects of each agent on the activity of the full-length promoter construct, pINV-2473 (6Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, both genistein and BIS-IM produce a concentration-dependent inhibition of promoter activity. Identical results were observed with a shorter promoter segment, pINV-241 (not shown); we therefore focused on the −241/−1 segment in subsequent experiments. To locate the responsive DNA element, we tested activity of the hINV promoter truncation series shown in Fig. 3 A. The activity of pINV-241 and pINV-128 are increased approximately 10-fold in TPA-treated cultures (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, although 250 μm genistein, when given alone, did not regulate activity, genistein co-treatment completely inhibited the TPA-dependent increase. Plasmids pINV-110, pINV-97, and pINV-41 were not responsive, suggesting that the relevant TPA-response element is located between nucleotides −128 and −110. Similar results were observed with BIS-IM (Fig. 4 B).Figure 3Human involucrin promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs. The narrow lines represent the hINV sequence and the black box represents the luciferase gene. The arrow indicates the start site and the direction of transcription. The plasmids in panel A are named (pINV-241, pINV-128, etc.) according to the length of the hINV promoter segment measured from the hINV transcription start site (6Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C.

Near confluent keratinocyte cultures were transfected with the indicated hINV promoter construct (pINV-241 is the native construct, pINV-241(AP1-1m) and pINV-241(EBS-2m) have mutated AP1-1 and EBS-2 sites, respectively, see Fig. 3 C), and then treated for 24 h with KSFM or KSFM supplemented with 50 ng/ml TPA and/or the indicated inhibitor (250 μmgenistein or 3 μm BIS-IM). The cells were then harvested, and extracts assayed for luciferase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify specific DNA response elements, we constructed point mutants. The −128/−110 region contains ets (EBS-2) and AP1 (AP1-1)-binding sites (Fig. 3). To evaluate the relative importance of these sites, we mutated each site individually and tested the response in cells treated with 50 ng/ml TPA, 250 μm genistein, or 3 μm BIS-IM. As shown above, TPA increases activity of the native pINV-241 construct, and this activity is inhibited by genistein and BIS-IM (Fig. 4, C and D). Mutation of the EBS-2 site increases the overall activity of the promoter, but does not effect the regulation by TPA or the kinase inhibitors. In contrast, mutation of the AP1-1 site reduces overall activity, and eliminates response to TPA, suggesting that TPA and the inhibitors effect a common pathway that terminates at the AP1-1 site. The above studies show that the TPA-dependent hINV gene regulatory pathway terminates on the hINV AP1-1 site. We next designed experiments to identify individual steps in the signaling cascade. Ras is a downstream target of PKC (33Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 34Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar); we therefore determined whether Ras activity is required for promoter activation. Keratinocytes were co-transfected with pINV-241 and a dominant interfering form of Ras, Ras-N17 (dnRas) (35Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, dnRas inhibits both basal and TPA-dependent activity. Moreover, in the absence of TPA treatment, constitutively active RasG12V increases promoter activity (Fig. 5). Ras activates multiple downstream targets, including Raf-1 (36Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 37Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F.

Raf-1, in turn, activates the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs through MEK1 and MEK2 (40Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1992; 257: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 41Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J.

To evaluate the role of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK cascade, we transfected keratinocytes with pINV-241 and the wild type and dominant negative forms of Raf-1, MEK1, ERK1, and ERK2. Wild type Raf-1 did not change basal promoter activity (Fig. 6 A), and dnRaf-1 did not suppress basal activity or the TPA-dependent increase in activity. Dominant negative MEK1, however, suppressed basal and TPA-dependent promoter activity (Fig. 6 B). Wild type MEKK1 increased promoter activity as efficiently as TPA, and dnMEK1 also inhibited this activation, suggesting that MEK1 may relay the MEKK1-dependent signal. A similar suppression was observed using a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD90859 (43Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 6 C, ERK1 and ERK2 do not appear to be important for regulation. Wild type ERK1 did not regulate basal activity, wild type ERK2 increased basal activity a modest 2-fold. The dominant negative forms of these kinases increased basal activity slightly (dnERK1) or had no effect (dnERK2). Moreover, the dnERK forms did not suppress the TPA-dependent increase. Sustained ERK activation is required for differentiation of several cell types, including neuronal (44Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem.

We therefore examined if TPA treatment of keratinocytes leads to the sustained ERK activation. ERK1/2 activity, as measured by the ability of immunoprecipitated activated ERK1/2 to phosphorylate its substrate protein GST-Elk1 was increased rapidly in response to 5 min of TPA treatment. However, within 30 min, ERK activity had returned to basal level (Fig. 6 D). Thus, TPA stimulation of human keratinocytes results in only transient activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinases. In addition to the Raf-1 cascade, Ras also activates the MEKK1 signaling cascade (38Lange Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L.

Treatment of human uterine cervical fibroblasts with concanavalin A activates pro-MMP-2 on the cell surface by converting it to the 65-kDa form with a minor form of 45 kDa. However, the 65-kDa MMP-2 was inactivated by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 that was bound to the plasma membrane upon concanavalin A treatment. TIMP-2 binds to the plasma membrane through its N-terminal domain by two different modes of interaction as follows: one is sensitive to a hydroxamate (HXM) inhibitor of MMPs and the other is HXM-insensitive. TIMP-2 bound to the membrane in a HXM-insensitive manner, comprising about 40–50% of TIMP-2 on the membrane, is the inhibitor of the cell surface-activated MMP-2. It, however, does not inhibit MMP-3, MMP-9, and the 45-kDa MMP-2 lacking the C-terminal domain. The inhibition of the 65-kDa MMP-2 by TIMP-2 is initiated by the interaction of their C-terminal domains. Subsequently, the MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex is released from the membrane, and the activity of MMP-2 is blocked by TIMP-2. In the presence of collagen types I, II, III, V, or gelatin, the rate of inhibition of the 65-kDa MMP-2 by the membrane-bound TIMP-2 decreased considerably.

The activities of matrixins are regulated by endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and the plasma proteinase inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (α2M). It is postulated that TIMPs regulate MMP activity in the tissue or cell periphery, whereas α2M is most likely the regulator in the fluid phase (1Woessner Jr., J.F.

TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are readily found in the conditioned medium of many cell types, but TIMP-3 is tenaciously bound to the extracellular matrix after synthesis and secretion from the cells (7Apte S.S.

TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 can form a specific complex with the zymogens of MMP-9 (gelatinase B) and MMP-2 (gelatinase A), respectively, through the C-terminal domain of each molecule (6Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Like many other matrixins, MMP-2 is secreted from the cells as an inactive zymogen, pro-MMP-2. Thus, the activation of pro-MMP-2 is one of the critical steps involved in controlling its activity. Although mercurial compounds, such as 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) and HgCl2, readily activate the zymogen to an active 65-kDa MMP-2, most of the proteinases that activate other matrixins lack an ability to activate pro-MMP-2 (12Okada Y.

A physiological activation of pro-MMP-2 is thought to take place on the cell surface as suggested by experiments with the fibroblasts or neoplastic cells that are treated with concanavalin A (Con A) or phorbol ester (13Overall C.M.

However, the exact mechanism of pro-MMP-2 activation and the fate of the TIMP-2 upon activation of pro-MMP-2 are not clearly understood. In this report, we have investigated the activation processes of pro-MMP-2 using human uterine cervical fibroblasts treated with ConA. This treatment induced the activation of pro-MMP-2 and accumulation of TIMP-2 on the cell surface. The TIMP-2 bound to the plasma membrane specifically inhibits MMP-2 upon activation by the same membrane. We also report that there are at least two modes of binding of TIMP-2 to the cell surface, i.e. hydroxamate inhibitor of MMP (HXM)-sensitive and -insensitive binding. The TIMP-2 bound to the plasma membrane in an HXM-insensitive manner specifically inhibits MMP-2 upon activation. Our study suggests that the TIMP-2 bound to the membrane plays an important role in controlling the pericellular activity of MMP-2. ConA (type VI), diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate,trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane (E-64), N-(α-rhamnopyranosyloxy-hydroxyphosphinyl)-Leu-Trp (phosphoramidon), collagen types II (bovine nasal septum), III (human placenta), V (human placenta), gelatin (porcine skin), and trypsin (bovine) were from Sigma.

Waugh at Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ. Human uterine cervical fibroblasts were prepared as described previously (27Ojima Y. Ito A. Nagase H. Mori Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1011: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-2 free from TIMP-2 was purified from the conditioned medium of human uterine cervical fibroblasts by gelatin-Sepharose 4B and, subsequently, by gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 as described previously (28Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TIMP-2 was isolated from the pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex by dissociating the complex with 20 mm EDTA and 8 m urea, and subsequent gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 equilibrated with 8 m urea containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3. The first and second protein peaks contained the denatured pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-2, respectively. The TIMP-2 fractions were pooled, dialyzed against TNC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3) and further purified by gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 equilibrated with TNC buffer. Recombinant pro-MMP-3 was purified from the culture medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human MMP-3 cDNA as described by Benbowet al. (29Benbow U. Butticè G. Nagase H. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10715-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purified pro-MMP-3 was then activated with chymotrypsin, and the 45-kDa MMP-3 was isolated according to Ogataet al. (30Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain active MMP-9, pro-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex was purified from the conditioned medium of HT-1080 cells according to Ogata et al. (31Ogata Y. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18506-18511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The purified complex was activated by a 2 m excess of active MMP-3 at 37 °C for 2 h. The active MMP-9 was then separated by passing the sample through anti-TIMP-1 affinity and anti-MMP-3 affinity columns and by gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-200. The concentration of these active MMPs was determined by titrating with a known amount of purified TIMP-1. Human uterine cervical fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. After confluence, the cells were washed and treated with 50 μg/ml ConA in the serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate for 36 h. The cells were then scraped with a rubber policeman and used for the plasma membrane preparation as described previously (14Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J.

Briefly, the cells were suspended in chilled 250 mm sucrose, 100 mmTris-HCl (pH. 8.0), 0.02% NaN3, 2 mmdiisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, 10 μm E-64, then homogenized on ice, and the whole lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed with TNC buffer and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were then suspended in TNC buffer and kept at −20 °C until used for experiments. The concentration of the membrane was determined by measuring the A 280 of the sample dissolved in 50 mm NaOH taking A1 cm, 280 nm1% value as 10. Zymography was conducted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing gelatin (0.8 mg/ml) (32Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer without reducing agent and were subjected to electrophoretic analysis at room temperature. Enzymic activity was visualized as negative staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Reverse zymography was conducted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing gelatin and pro-MMP-2 (1.2 μg/ml) as described previously (33Rankin C.A. Suzuki K. Itoh Y. Ziemer D.M. Grantham J.J. Calvet J.P. Nagase H. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 835-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer without reducing agent and subjected to electrophoresis at room temperature. After electrophoresis, gels were washed with the buffer containing 2.5% Triton X-100 to renature pro-MMP-2 in the gels by removal of SDS. The activity of TIMPs was visualized as inhibition of gelatin lysis by MMP-2; thus, positive staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 is observed where TIMPs locate. The intensity of positive staining is linear in the range of 0.1–1 ng of TIMP-2 per lane. Purified TIMP-2 (50 μg/ml) was labeled with125I− using IODO-GEN (PIERCE) in TNC buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Free125I− was removed by gel filtration. Human uterine cervical fibroblasts were cultured in 96-well plates until confluent in the DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed with DMEM supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate and antibiotics once and treated with 50 μg/ml ConA in the same medium for 16 h. Cells were washed with HBSS three times, and different concentrations of 125I-labeled TIMP-2 or125I-labeled N-TIMP-2 were incubated in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess unlabeled TIMP-2 or N-TIMP-2, respectively, at 4 °C for 30 min in the DMEM containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were washed three times with chilled HBSS, and the radioactivity associated with the cells was measured by a gamma counter. All enzyme assays were carried out in TNC buffer containing 0.05% Brij 35. MMP-3 activity was measured usingS-3H-carboxymethylated transferrin as described previously (34Nagase H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The activity of MMP-2 activated by the plasma membrane was measured using a fluorogenic peptide, Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (23Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), in the presence of 10 μm phosphoramidon to inhibit phosphoramidon-sensitive peptidases present in the membrane. The activity of MMP-2 in the mixture was calculated by subtracting the fluorescence generated by membrane alone from the fluorescence generated by the sample mixture. Gelatin containing samples were diluted to make a final gelatin concentration of 1 μg/ml in the assay tube; at this concentration gelatin did not affect fluorogenic peptide digestion activity of MMP-2. Incubation of pro-MMP-2 with the plasma membrane from human uterine cervical fibroblasts treated with ConA activated the zymogen and converted it to 65 kDa with a minor component of 45 kDa as reported previously (14Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined whether these species were proteolytically active or not by incubating the activated sample with α2M prior to zymographic analysis (Fig. 1 A). α2M can bind and form a large α2M-proteinase complex only with an active endopeptidase but not with an inactive enzyme (35Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 737-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). α2M·MMP complexes run near the top of the gel after SDS-PAGE (27Ojima Y. Ito A. Nagase H. Mori Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1011: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although a large excess of α2M was introduced, the majority of the 65-kDa species failed to bind to α2M, suggesting that this form of MMP-2 is not proteolytically active. On the other hand, the 45-kDa MMP-2 bound to α2M. These results suggest that the activated 65-kDa MMP-2 is specifically inhibited by endogenous inhibitors that may be present in the plasma membrane. Reverse zymography of the same samples revealed that the membrane preparation contained a readily detectable amount of TIMP-2 but not TIMP-1 (Fig. 1 B). However, TIMP-2 was not found in the membrane of unstimulated control cells (see Fig. 3). The failure of the 65-kDa MMP-2 to bind to α2M suggests that MMP-2, upon activation, was specifically inhibited by TIMP-2 on the membrane.Figure 3Immuno-slot blot analysis of the plasma membrane with anti-TIMP-2 antibodies. Plasma membranes (20 μg) from the untreated control cells (Control Mb) or ConA-treated cells (ConA Mb) were applied to immuno-slot blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies raised against the peptide (Asp30–Glu44) in the N-terminal domain of human TIMP-2 (68–6H4) and the C-terminal tail (Tyr178–Asp193) of TIMP-2 (67–4H11). Purified TIMP-2 (200 ng) and purified pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex (800 ng) were also applied as standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined whether the TIMP-2 in the plasma membrane inhibits APMA-activated MMP-2 and other MMPs. Fig. 2 shows a dose-dependent inhibition of two different preparations of MMP-2 by membranes prepared from ConA-treated cells but not by those from control cells. It is notable, however, that the inhibition of MMP-2 was observed up to about 60–80%, but the rest of 20–40% was resistant to inhibition even with an increased amount of membrane. The TIMP-2-resistant activity was due to the presence of the 45-kDa MMP-2 in the APMA-activated MMP-2 (see below). Thus, two different preparations of active MMP-2 gave a slightly different inhibition curve depending on the amount of the 45-kDa MMP-2 generated. In contrast, TIMP-2 on the membrane failed to inhibit MMP-3 and MMP-9, whereas free TIMP-2 in solution inhibited MMP-3 (Table I). These results suggest that the N-terminal inhibitory domain of TIMP-2 is not readily available to other MMPs when it is bound to the membrane. If so, the reaction of MMP-2 and the membrane-bound TIMP-2 is likely to be triggered by their initial interaction through their unique C-terminal domains. To determine the orientation of TIMP-2 in the membrane, the membrane was dot-blotted on a nitrocellulose filter without denaturation and reacted with monoclonal antibodies raised against the peptide (Asp30–Gln44) in the N-terminal domain (clone 68–6H4) and the C-terminal tail (Tyr178–Asp193) of TIMP-2 (clone 67–4H11) (36Fujimoto N. Zhang J. Iwata K. Shinya T. Okada Y. Hayakawa T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1993; 220: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the ConA-membrane preparation reacted with monoclonal antibody 67–4H11 but not with –6H468. Isolated TIMP-2 reacted with both antibodies, whereas TIMP-2 of the pro-MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex reacted only with 68–6H4. The control membrane did not react with either antibody. These data suggest that TIMP-2 binds to the membrane mainly through its N-terminal domain.Table ILack of inhibition of MMP-3 and MMP-9 by the membrane-bound TIMP-2EnzymeTreatmentEnzymic activity%MMP-3 (7 nm)+ TNC buffer (control)100+ TIMP-2 3.5 nm55+ TIMP-2 7.0 nm11+ TIMP-2 14.0 nm9+ Membrane 0.4 mg/ml (3.5 nm)99+ Membrane 0.8 mg/ml (7.0 nm)97+ Membrane 1.6 mg/ml (14 nm)95+ Membrane 2.4 mg/ml (21 nm)90 Membrane alone 2.4 mg/ml (21 nm)12MMP-9 (3 nm)+ TNC Buffer (control)100+ TIMP-2 3 nm9+ Membrane 2.0 mg/ml (17.5 nm)81The 45-kDa active MMP-3 (7 nm) was reacted with various concentrations of the isolated TIMP-2 or the plasma membrane prepared from human uterine fibroblasts treated with ConA at 37 °C for 24 h.

To investigate further the possible interaction of the N-terminal domain of TIMP-2 to the membrane, the binding experiments of full-length TIMP-2 and the C-terminal truncated recombinant TIMP-2 (N-TIMP-2) to the cell surface were conducted. Scatchard plot analysis (data not shown) indicated that both TIMP-2 and N-TIMP-2 bound to ConA-stimulated cells with a similar affinity withK d values of 1.4 and 1.6 nm, respectively. The numbers of the binding sites of two TIMP-2 species were 1.92 × 104/cell and 1.91 × 104/cell, respectively, almost identical to each other. MMP-2, upon activation on the cell surface, was inhibited by TIMP-2 on the membrane. We then examined whether the MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex remains on the cell surface or is released from the cell. This was investigated by separating the membrane components from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g after incubating the membrane with pro-MMP-2 and analyzing both fractions by zymography and reverse zymography (Fig. 4). Pro-MMP-2 was fully activated by the membrane within 4 h. This treatment also generated the 45-kDa MMP-2. A small portion of the 65-kDa MMP-2 was associated with the membrane at a 1-h time point, but most MMP-2 was released from the membrane after 4 h. The 45-kDa MMP-2 was never found in the membrane fraction. When MMP-2 activity in the supernatant was measured against Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2, the enzyme activity correlated with the formation of the 45-kDa MMP-2 with the highest activity at 4 h. The intensity of the 65-kDa form in the supernatant and in the total mixture did not change even after a 20-h incubation. The amount of TIMP-2 in the supernatant also increased in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that TIMP-2 bound to the membrane specifically reacts with the cell surface-activated MMP-2. Although the activation of pro-MMP-2 by the membrane generates predominantly the 65-kDa form, a small amount of the 45-kDa MMP-2 is also generated, and only the 45-kDa species bound to α2M (see Fig. 1). The 45-kDa MMP-2 lacks the C-terminal domain (37Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may be the reason why the membrane-bound TIMP-2 cannot inhibit the 45-kDa MMP-2. To test this further, MMP-2 containing a large portion of 45-kDa MMP-2 was prepared by activating pro-MMP-2 with APMA in the presence of 5% Me2SO. These conditions slow down the autodegradation of the activated enzyme, and the 45-kDa MMP-2 can be visualized more easily. When this enzyme preparation was reacted with α2M, both 65- and 45-k"

Inhibitory Smad proteins were found to prevent the interaction between the serine/threonine kinase receptors and pathway-restricted Smad proteins. Smad7 was identified as a TGF-β-inducible antagonist of TGF-β signaling, and it may participate in a negative feedback loop to control TGF-β signaling. Here we demonstrate that the mRNA expression of Smad7 is induced by activin A in mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells, which undergo growth arrest and apoptosis upon exposure to activin A. The ectopic expression of mouse Smad7 in HS-72 cells suppressed the activin A-induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase by abolishing the activin A-induced expression of p21CIP1/WAF1 and hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. Furthermore, Smad7 expression suppressed activin A-induced apoptosis in HS-72 cells. Thus, our data indicate that Smad7 is an activin A-inducible antagonist of activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis of B lineage cells.

We have reported that activin A induces the cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and apoptosis in mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells (16Yamato K. Koseki T. Ohguchi M. Kizaki M. Ikeda Y. Nishihara T. Mol.

TGF-β family members elicit their multifunctional effects through heteromeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (18Mathews L.S. Endcr.

Upon activin binding to type II receptor with constitutively active kinase, the type I receptor is recruited and phosphorylated and activated by type II receptor kinase (28Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29Willis S.A. Zimmerman C.M. Li L.I. Mathews L.S. Mol.

Members of the Sma- and Mad-related (Smad) protein family are known to play pivotal roles in intracellular TGF-β family signaling (30Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad5 become phosphorylated by specific activated type I serine/threonine kinase receptors and thus act in a pathway-restricted fashion. Smad4 forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with pathway-restricted Smad proteins, which translocate into the nucleus and activate transcriptional responses. Smad6 and Smad7 function as inhibitors of TGF-β family signaling (31Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P.

Smad7 is most closely related to Smad6, with 36 and 56% sequence identities in the amino-terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminal Mad homology 2 domain, respectively.

Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In this study, the levels of Smad7 mRNA were examined in HS-72 cells stimulated with activin A. In addition, HS-72 cells were transfected with mouse Smad7 expression plasmid to examine the effect of Smad7 on activin A-induced responses. Here we report the functional role of Smad7 in the regulation of growth arrest and apoptosis induced by activin A. Establishment and characterization of mouse hybridoma HS-72 cells were described previously (13Nishihara T. Okahashi N. Ueda N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). HS-72 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Construction of the Smad7 expression plasmid pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad7 was reported previously (31Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). HS-72 cells were transfected with plasmid by electroporation using an Electroporator II (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) at 200 V, 1000 microfarads, and then selected by cultivation with G418 (1 mg/ml). Single-cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution. The cells (2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates) were incubated with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics in the presence of various concentrations of activin A or human bone morphogenic protein (hBMP)-2 for 48 h and then examined for cell viability by a calorimetric assay with MTT (Sigma) (13Nishihara T. Okahashi N. Ueda N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Absorbance was determined at a wavelength of 570 nm with background subtraction at 620 nm. To detect apoptotic nuclei, the cells (2 × 105) were suspended in a hypotonic solution (3.4 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and analyzed by a FACScan (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) (35Perandones C.E. Illera V.A. Peckham D. Stunz L.L. Ashman R.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3521-3529PubMed Google Scholar). In the DNA fragmentation assay, the DNA was extracted from HS-72 cells (5 × 106) according to the method of Moore et al. (36Moore K.J. Matiashewski G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2930-2937PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA was electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (anti-FLAG M2) was purchased from Estman Kodak Co. Anti-retinoblastoma protein (Rb) monoclonal antibody (G3-245) was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-p21CIP1/WAF1 monoclonal antibody (Ab-4) was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. The cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, boiled for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The extracted proteins (60 μg) in supernatants were separated in 7, 10, or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and then electroblotted on polyvinyldine fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immunodetection was performed using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). Blots were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and each lane was confirmed to contain a similar amount of protein. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using an Isogen RNA extraction kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Five or ten micrograms of total RNA were electrophoresed in a formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted on a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse Smad7, mouse p21CIP1/WAF1, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA fragments were isolated from pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad7 (31Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar), pCMW35T3, and pKS321 (37Tokunaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakata K. Fujimori K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization and washing were performed as described previously (38Sugito S. Yamato K. Sameshima Y. Yokota J. Yano S. Miyoshi I. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of Smad7 revealed that Smad7 mRNA was induced in HS-72 cells stimulated with activin A (Fig. 1). The expression of Smad7 mRNA was most vigorously induced after 3 h of activin A stimulation, and decreased time-dependently, indicating thatSmad7 is an activin A-responsive gene. TGF-β1 and activin A were found to induce Smad7 mRNA expression in the mink epithelial cell line Mv1lu (31Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). 2M. Afrakhte, unpublished results. Since the kinase domains of ActR-IB and type I TGF-β receptor (TβR-I) are nearly identical (24Cárcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), activin A and TGF-β may share the same or similar signals for induction of Smad7 mRNA expression. To investigate whether Smad7 controls the growth arrest and apoptosis induced by activin A, HS-72 cells were stably transfected with mouse Smad7 expression plasmid (pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad7) or control plasmid (pcDNA3). Four clones (HS-72SM1, HS-72SM2, HS-72SM3, HS-72SM4) were found to express high levels of mouse FLAG-Smad7 (48 kDa) (Fig. 2 A). Control clones (HS-72C1, HS-72C2, HS-72C3, HS-72C4) showed growth arrest in response to activin A, however, Smad7 overexpressing clones showed no growth arrest in response to activin A in a MTT assay (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, cultivation with activin A for 24 h increased the population of the cells in the G1 phase from 33 to 81% with a reduction of those in the S phase from 61 to 11% in HS-72C4 cells. In contrast, activin A showed no effect on the cell cycle distributions of Smad7 overexpressing clones (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that an overexpression of Smad7 in HS-72 cells abolishes the cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase caused by the activin A treatment. p21CIP1/WAF1 is known to suppress the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-4 (39Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that activin A induces the expression of p21CIP1/WAF1 and blocks the Rb kinase activity of CDK-4, resulting in the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb (pRb) (16Yamato K. Koseki T. Ohguchi M. Kizaki M. Ikeda Y. Nishihara T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). pRb binds to, and negatively regulates, the activities of transcriptional factors of the E2F family, whose function is important for the G1 to S transition (40Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar,41La Thangue N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To obtain more insight into mechanism by which Smad7 suppresses the activin A-induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, we examined the effect of Smad7 on the activin A-induced expression of p21CIP1/WAF1 by immunoblot and Northern blot analyses. Immunoblot analysis showed that the untreated control clone (HS-72C4) contained undetectable levels of p21CIP1/WAF1 (Fig. 3 A). Upon exposure to activin A (50 ng/ml), expression of p21CIP1/WAF1 (21 kDa) was detected as early as 6 h, and its level increased time-dependently in the control clone. However, Smad7 overexpressing clones (HS-72SM1 and HS-72SM2) contained undetectable levels of p21CIP1/WAF1, even when cultured with activin A (50 ng/ml). Northern blot analysis showed that p21CIP1/WAF1mRNA was rapidly induced in the control clone (HS-72C4) after 3 h of activin A stimulation (Fig. 3 B). However, p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA was not detected in the Smad7 overexpressing clone (HS-72SM1 and HS-72SM2), even when cultured with activin A (50 ng/ml). These results suggest that Smad7 abolishes p21CIP1/WAF1 expression by attenuating the activin signal, which induces the p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA expression in HS-72 cells. We examined the effect of Smad7 on the activin A-induced hypophosphorylation of Rb by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 C, activin A (50 ng/ml) decreased the levels of hyperphosphorylated Rb (ppRb) in the control clone (HS-72C4) at 12 and 24 h, resulting in an increase in the levels of pRb time-dependently. On the contrary, activin A showed no effect on the phosphorylation status of Rb in Smad7 expressing clones (HS-72SM1 and HS-72SM2) during the 24-h culture. Taken together, these findings suggest that the decreased level of p21CIP1/WAF1by overexpression of Smad7 in HS-72 cells results in continuous phosphorylation of Rb by activated CDK-4. In addition, we examined the effect of Smad7 on activin A-induced apoptosis, which is usually seen after the cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Gel electrophoresis of cellular DNA showed that fragmented DNA was detected much less in activin A-treated Smad7 overexpressing clones (HS-72SM1, HS-72SM2, HS-72SM3, HS-72SM4) than in HS-72 and control clones (HS-72C2, HS-72C4) (Fig. 4 A). As demonstrated in Fig. 4 B, cultivation of the control clone (HS-72C4) with activin A (50 ng/ml) increased the population of nuclei with reduced DNA content representing apoptotic nuclei to 47%. In contrast, Smad7 overexpressing clones (HS-72SM1 and HS-72SM2) showed no increases in the population of apoptotic nuclei, even when cultured with activin A for 36 h. These results indicate that overexpression of Smad7 suppresses not only activin A-induced growth arrest in the G1 phase but also activin A-induced apoptosis in HS-72 cells. We examined the effect of TGF-β family, such as TGF-β, BMP-2, and inhibin, on the responses of HS-72 cells. Among these factors, hBMP-2 induced the growth arrest in HS-72 cells, and the overexpression of Smad7 in HS-72 cells inhibited the hBMP-induced growth arrest (data not shown). The precise mechanism by which Smad7 suppresses the hBMP-2-induced growth arrest is under the investigation in our laboratory. We have reported that concanamycin A induces apoptotic cell death of HS-72 cells (42Nishihara T. Akifusa S. Koseki T. Kato S. Muro M. Hanada N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Concanamycin A is known as a strong inhibitor of the vacuolar type H+-ATPases in vitro and in vivo (43Akifusa S. Ohguchi M. Koseki T. Nara K. Semba I. Yamato K. Okahashi N. Merino R. Núñez G. Hanada N. Takehara T. Nishihara T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that concanamycin A sensitivities of Smad7 overexpressing clones (HS-72SM1, HS-72SM2) were essentially the same as that of the control clone (HS-72C4) concerning the induction of apoptosis (data not shown). These results suggest that the ability of activin A and concanamycin A to promote apoptosis could be differently regulated in HS-72 cells. In summary, we demonstrated that Smad7 mRNA in HS-72 cells was induced in response to activin A stimulation. Overexpression of mouse Smad7 was found to suppress activin A-induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase by abolishing the activin A-induced expression of p21CIP1/WAF1 and hypophosphorylation of Rb. Furthermore, Smad7 suppressed activin A-induced apoptosis in HS-72 cells. These results indicate that Smad7 may play an important role in regulating the growth arrest and apoptosis induced by activin A stimulation. We thank Y.

https://openalex.org/W2053550829,"Peroxynitrite (ONOO−), formed by the reaction between nitric oxide (·NO) and superoxide, has been implicated in the etiology of numerous disease processes. Low molecular weight antioxidants, including uric acid, may minimize ONOO−--mediated damage to tissues. The tissue-sparing effects of uric acid are typically attributed to oxidant scavenging; however, little attention has been paid to the biology of the reaction products. In this study, a previously unidentified uric acid derivative was detected in ONOO−-treated human plasma. The product of the uric acid/ONOO− reaction resulted in endothelium-independent vasorelaxation of rat thoracic aorta, with an EC50 value in the range of 0.03–0.3 μm. Oxyhemoglobin, a ·NO scavenger, completely attenuated detectable ·NO release and vascular relaxation. Uric acid plus decomposed ONOO− neither released ·NO nor altered vascular reactivity. Electrochemical quantification of ·NO confirmed that the uric acid/ONOO− reaction resulted in spontaneous (thiol-independent) and protracted (t½ ∼ 125 min) release of ·NO. Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated that the product was a nitrated uric acid derivative. The uric acid nitration/nitrosation product may play a pivotal role in human pathophysiology by releasing ·NO, which could decrease vascular tone, increase tissue blood flow, and thereby constitute a role for uric acid not previously described. Peroxynitrite (ONOO−), formed by the reaction between nitric oxide (·NO) and superoxide, has been implicated in the etiology of numerous disease processes. Low molecular weight antioxidants, including uric acid, may minimize ONOO−--mediated damage to tissues. The tissue-sparing effects of uric acid are typically attributed to oxidant scavenging; however, little attention has been paid to the biology of the reaction products. In this study, a previously unidentified uric acid derivative was detected in ONOO−-treated human plasma. The product of the uric acid/ONOO− reaction resulted in endothelium-independent vasorelaxation of rat thoracic aorta, with an EC50 value in the range of 0.03–0.3 μm. Oxyhemoglobin, a ·NO scavenger, completely attenuated detectable ·NO release and vascular relaxation. Uric acid plus decomposed ONOO− neither released ·NO nor altered vascular reactivity. Electrochemical quantification of ·NO confirmed that the uric acid/ONOO− reaction resulted in spontaneous (thiol-independent) and protracted (t½ ∼ 125 min) release of ·NO.

Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are continuously generatedin vivo and play an integral role in numerous physiologic and pathologic processes (1Moncada S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 387: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Gutteridge J.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 91: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To minimize the consequences of oxidant damage to biologic molecules, human plasma is endowed with an integrated antioxidant system of enzymatic and expendable soluble antioxidants. Uric acid is reportedly one of these physiologically important plasma antioxidants (4Becker B.F. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Reactive species can oxidize uric acid to relatively stable products that can serve as quantitative estimates of oxidant stress in vivo (5Grootveld M. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Uric acid is of special relevance to humans because it is the terminal oxidation product of purine metabolism due to the evolutionary loss of urate oxidase, which catabolizes uric acid to allantoin (6Wu X. Lee C.C. Muzny D.M. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9412-9416Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Consequently, human plasma contains uric acid at concentrations approaching 500 μm (7Ames B.N. Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Hochstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6858-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). Endogenous antioxidants constitute the first line of defense against oxidant-induced tissue injury. However, in a variety of pathologic conditions, antioxidant defenses may become overwhelmed, thus allowing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to react with target molecules and to impair essential biochemical processes (8Becker, B. F., Reinholz, D. N., Leipert, B., Raschke, P., Permanetter, B., and Gerlach, E. (1991) Chest 100,(suppl.) 176S–181SGoogle Scholar, 9Wayner D.D.M. Burton G.W. Ingold K.U. Locke S.

When produced in proximity, superoxide (O⨪2) and nitric oxide (·NO) can react at an almost diffusion-limited rate (6.7 × 109m−1 s−1) to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (12Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that under certain conditions, nitric-oxide synthase can simultaneously generate both O⨪2 and ·NO (13Mayer B. Pfeiffer S. Schrammel A. Koesling D. Schmidt K. Brunner F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3264-3270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite is an oxidizing and nitrating agent that reacts with a variety of biomolecules, including lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and deoxyribonucleic acid (14Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J.

Plasma antioxidants also serve as significant biologic targets that can be decreased by ONOO−-, leading to oxidative damage to tissues and compromised function (11van der Vliet A. Smith D.

Nitration and nitrosation reactions are increasingly recognized as important mediators of damage in biologic systems, although the precise mechanism of interaction of the reactive nitrogen species with endogenous biomolecules remains unclear. Peroxynitrite, and possibly other reactive nitrogen species, can react readily with phenolic compounds, such as tyrosine, to form nitrated (3-nitrotyrosine) and dimerized (dityrosine) products (29Ischiropoulos H. al-Mehdi A.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 30van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The stable 3-nitrotyrosine product has been detected in human atherosclerotic lesions (31Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and tissues following acute injury (32Royall J.A. Kooy N.W. Beckman J.S.

Chandler R.T. Parks D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the reaction of ONOO− with proteins, carbohydrates, and thiols can result in the formation of products, which can act as ·NO donors (36Liu S. Beckman J.S. Ku D.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 1114-1121PubMed Google Scholar, 37Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lizasoain I. Su Y. Knowles R.G. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Br. J.

Physiol. 1994; 266: H2108-H2113PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was the purpose of this study to determine if the reaction between uric acid and ONOO− could result in the formation of recognized oxidation products as well as form novel uric acid nitration/nitrosation derivatives that could release ·NO and induce vasorelaxation. All chemicals and reagents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Sigma. Cyanuric acid, oxonic acid, uracil, urazole, and alloxan monohydrate were purchased from Aldrich. Methanol (Optima grade) was ordered from Fisher. Water used in solution preparation was purified by passage through a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore Corp., Milford, MA). Prior to use, the purified water was polished using a Sep-Pak C18 column (Waters) and then filtered with a 0.22-μm membrane filter. Hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid, allantoin, parabanic acid, oxonic acid, oxaluric acid, cyanuric acid, urazole, alloxan monohydrate, and uracil were detected using a modification of a previously described HPLC1-UV diode array detector method (39Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Spectral data were acquired using Turboscan spectral application software (Perkin-Elmer). Absorbance spectra from 195 to 365 nm were collected. Separations were performed isocratically (Whatman, 3 μm, C18, 25.0 × 0.46 cm), with a mobile phase consisting of 5% methanol and 30 mm potassium phosphate (pH 3.0) containing 1.56 mm n-octylamine. Compounds were identified by comparison of retention times and spectral absorbance map characteristics of authentic standards. ONOO− was prepared by mixing NaNO2, NaOH, and acidified H2O2, as described by Beckman et al.(40Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6718) Google Scholar). Any excess H2O2 was removed by passage over a MnO2 column. Typical ONOO− yields were 180–200 mm. Peroxynitrite was quantified spectrophotometrically (ε302 = 1670m−1 cm−1) and stored in 1.2n NaOH. Hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid, allantoin, and parabanic acid (0.1–0.3 mm) were prepared in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) (pH 7.4) and standardized by spectrophotometry. In all experiments, ONOO− was kept on ice and shielded from light. Purine was added to the buffer; ONOO− (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0 mm) was added; and the samples were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 min. To control for nonspecific effects of ONOO−decomposition products, ONOO− was first incubated in the phosphate buffer for 15 min prior to the addition of purine or purine oxidation product (reverse order addition). Incubation with 1.2n NaOH served as the vehicle control. Peroxynitrite reactivity is pH-dependent; therefore, the pH of all samples was determined and maintained at ≤7.8 under our experimental conditions. Peroxynitrite (0, 0.5, or 1.0 mm) was added to fresh plasma, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Ice-cold acetonitrile (3:1, v/v) was added, and the samples were allowed to incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were then centrifuged (15 min, 15,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant was collected and concentrated (at ambient temperature) in a rotary evaporator (SpeedVac, Savant Instruments, Inc., Holbrook, NY). The resulting residue was resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mmDTPA (pH 7.4). To minimize the pH effects of addition of ONOO− to plasma in the reverse order addition experiments, ONOO− was first decomposed by incubation for 15 min in 500 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). An aliquot of the decomposed ONOO− (equivalent to 1.0 or 0.5 mmONOO−) was then added to the plasma. Again, incubation with 1.2 n NaOH served as the vehicle control, and the pH was maintained at ≤7.8 under our experimental conditions. For the vessel reactivity experiments, ONOO− (10 mm) or decomposed ONOO− was added to 2.5 mm uric acid in 100 mm potassium phosphate containing 0.1 mm DTPA (pH 7.4). The mixture was shielded from light and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Serial dilutions of the uric acid stock solution were prepared in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mmKCl, 27.2 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.75 mm CaCl2, 0.03 mmNa2EDTA, and 11.1 mm glucose). The nominal concentration of purine in the tissue bath (range = 0.002–0.74 μm) was significantly less than normal physiologic levels of the purines tested (41Quinlan G.J. Lamb N.J. Tilley R. Evans T.W. Gutteridge J.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 155: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite (2.0 mm) was added to uric acid (0.3 mm) in 100 mm potassium phosphate containing 0.1 mm DTPA (pH 7.4) at 20 °C. Evidence for the formation of a nitrated derivative was obtained by measuring the hypsochromic absorbance spectrum shift of the reaction at an acidic pH (4Becker B.F. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 5Grootveld M. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) relative to the absorbance spectrum at pH 7.4 (42Sokolovsky M. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The pH was adjusted using hydrochloric acid (5.0 n). Absorbance spectra were measured on a Beckman DU7500 UV-visible diode array spectrophotometer. Uric acid and ONOO− mixtures (as described above) were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a 10 cm × 2.1-mm (internal diameter) C8 column, with 5% methanol and 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.5) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The eluate was split 1:1, and 100 μl/min was introduced into the electrospray ionization interface of a PE-Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Positive ion spectra were recorded with the needle and orifice potentials set at 5500 and 70 V, respectively. Human hemoglobin was purified as described previously (43Antonini E. Brunori M. Haemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971: 12-14Google Scholar) and stored as carboxyhemoglobin. Oxyhemoglobin, a ·NO scavenger, was prepared by photolyzing the CO–Fe bond of carboxyhemoglobin while gently blowing oxygen over the solution at 4 °C. Oxyhemoglobin concentrations were calculated using the extinction coefficient ε577 = 14, 600m−1 cm−1 per heme group. Nitric oxide was detected electrochemically using a membrane-coated carbon fiber ·NO microelectrode (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Iso-NO 200) (32Royall J.A. Kooy N.W. Beckman J.S. New Horiz. 1995; 3: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). For the ·NO detection experiments, ONOO− (1.0 mm) or decomposed ONOO− was added to uric acid (0.3 or 3.0 mm) or xanthine (0.3 mm) in 200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) with or without 0.1 mm DTPA. An aliquot of the purine/ONOO−mixture was then added to a temperature-controlled (maintained at 37 °C) reaction chamber containing the microelectrode. The reaction chamber was extensively rinsed with distilled water between addition of aliquots of the purine/ONOO− mixture. The effect of thiols or metals on the reaction mixture was tested in a subset of experiments by adding 0.2 mm cysteine or glutathione followed by Cu2+ (0.025–0.1 mm) to the reaction chamber. The thiol and metal were added to the reaction chamber either prior to or after the addition of the purine/ONOO− mixture. As an additional control, in a subset of experiments, oxyhemoglobin (0.01 mm) was added to the reaction chamber either prior to or following the addition of sample to the chamber. The mean half-life for each condition was calculated by fitting the data to a single exponential decay model (half-life = y 0 +A 1 e −(−0)/1, where y 0 = asymptotic value of the yvariable, x 0 = initial time, x = time of decay, A 1 = y value whenx 0 = 0, and 1/t 1 = decay constant). Isometric tension was measured in isolated rat aortic ring segments. Animals were euthanized by an anesthetic overdose. The aorta was excised, cleansed of fat and adherent tissue, cut into ring segments (2–3 mm), and suspended from a force-displacement transducer in a tissue bath. Segments were bathed in a Krebs-Henseleit solution. A passive load of 2 g was applied and maintained throughout the experiment. Indomethacin (0.05 mm)-treated ring segments were depolarized with KCl (70 mm) to determine maximal vessel contractile capacity. In subsequent experiments, phenylephrine (∼3 × 10−8m) was added to the indomethacin-treated ring segments to obtain a contraction equivalent to ∼40% of the KCl response. When tension development reached a plateau, uric acid or xanthine reaction mixtures (obtained by treatment of purine with ONOO− or decomposed ONOO−) were added to achieve a cumulative dose-response curve, expressed as the nominal concentration of purine to which the tissue was exposed. In some experiments, endothelium was removed by rubbing the luminal surface of the vessel with a serrated forceps. Endothelial denudation was confirmed by the absence of vessel relaxation in response to acetylcholine (0.001 mm), an endothelium-dependent vasodilator. To determine whether vessel relaxation was due to the release of ·NO from the reaction products of ONOO− and purine, oxyhemoglobin (0.001 mm) was added to the tissue bath in a subset of experiments. Data are reported as weighted means representing two or three observations per animal (n = eight animals). Real time data were acquired for all experiments using a computerized data acquisition system. Analyses for effects of ONOO− on purines and purine oxidation products were conducted by ANOVA with post hoc comparison of means by a Student-Newman-Keuls test. Comparison of the response of different purines to ONOO− was conducted by repeated measures ANOVA. Analysis of the effect of xanthine, uric acid, and ONOO− as well as the effects of light on aortic relaxation was conducted by repeated measures ANOVA for the various concentrations of purine. Comparison of two groups was done by repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. For determination of the effects of temperature and light on the stability of ·NO release, the half-life was determined from each experiment and analyzed by ANOVA with a Student-Newman-Keuls post hoctest. All analyses were done using the SAS system for Microsoft Windows (Release 6.12). Both uric acid and xanthine were significantly (p< 0.001) oxidized by 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mmONOO− (Fig. 1). The extent of oxidation of uric acid was markedly greater than that of xanthine at all concentrations of purine and ONOO− studied. Hypoxanthine was significantly (p < 0.05) oxidized only with 1.0 mm ONOO−. Parabanic acid and allantoin were not significantly oxidized at any concentration of ONOO−. Concomitant with uric acid oxidation was the formation of allantoin, parabanic acid, urazole, oxonic acid, and a novel peak not observed following addition of decomposed ONOO−. Spectral characteristics and retention times of authentic oxaluric acid, cyanuric acid, alloxan monohydrate, and uracil excluded these purine oxidation products as this novel peak. Xanthine oxidation also produced allantoin, parabanic acid, and a novel product, but this product exhibited a different retention time and different spectra than the ONOO−-treated nitrated uric acid product. The novel peak was not detected when xanthine was treated with decomposed ONOO−. The hypsochromic shift of the uric acid/ONOO− product (Fig. 2) is consistent with the pH-dependent absorbance changes of nitrated aromatic compounds (42Sokolovsky M. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3582-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and suggests that uric acid may be nitrated (or nitrosated) upon reaction with ONOO−. Addition of decomposed ONOO− to uric acid resulted in an absorbance spectrum indistinguishable from uric acid alone and was pH-insensitive (data not shown). In human plasma samples, the endogenous uric acid concentration was 0.20 ± 0.01 mm (mean ± S.E.) in pooled donor plasma. Upon addition of ONOO−, plasma uric acid decreased concurrently with the appearance of oxidation products (allantoin and parabanic acid) and the nitrated uric acid product, similar to the effect observed in buffer. 9 ± 2% of the plasma uric acid was converted to the nitrated peak, whereas 13 ± 4% was converted following exposure to 1.0 mm ONOO−, again similar to the results with uric acid in buffer (Fig. 3). Treatment with neither decomposed ONOO− nor vehicle resulted in significant oxidation of uric acid or formation of the nitrosation product. Mass spectrophotometric analysis of the ONOO−-treated uric acid revealed that the uric acid concentration (m/z = 169, (uric acid + H)+, retention time = 5.4 min) was reduced 87% by addition of 1.0 mm ONOO− (Fig. 4 A) compared with addition of an equivalent amount of decomposed ONOO− (Fig. 4 B). Concomitant with the reduction in uric acid was the formation of a novel peak at 6.5 min. This product was predicted to have a M r of 146 based upon the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 147 ((nitrated product + H)+ ion) (Fig. 4 C). Addition of decomposed ONOO− (equivalent to 1.0 mm active ONOO−) did not result in a significant reduction in the uric acid concentration (Fig. 4 B) or formation of the novel nitrated product at the retention time of 6.5 min or molecular ion atm/z 147 (Fig. 4 D). The ONOO−-treated uric acid product was scanned by electrospray ionization mass spectrum analysis. Scans acquired at 6.5 min (retention time of nitrated product) demonstrated that fragmentation of the nitrated product contained ions at 130, 104, 87, and 61 (Fig. 5 A). The resulting spectrophotometry also showed molecular ions atm/z 164 ((nitrated product + NH4)+) and 169 ((nitrated product + Na)+). The data presented in Fig. 5 B represent scans acquired at 5.41–5.43 min (retention time of uric acid). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometric analysis confirmed the molecular weight of uric acid at 168 ((uric acid + H)+ ion, m/z 169) as well as the anticipated associated molecular ions in the acetate mobile phase at 186 ((uric acid + NH4)+), 191 ((uric acid + Na)+), 337 (2(uric acid) + H)+), and 505 (3(uric acid) + H)+). Using mass spectrophotometric bombardment fragments as a guide, the nitrated uric acid product (M r 146) has been identified as 2-nitrito-4-amino-5-hydroxyimidazoline (Fig. 6).Figure 6Proposed structure of nitrated uric acid product. Using mass spectrophotometric bombardment fragments as a guide, the nitrated/nitrosated uric acid product (M r 146) has been identified as 2-nitrito-4-amino-5-hydroxyimidazoline.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cumulative administration of the uric acid/ONOO− mixture induced a dose-dependent relaxation of rat aortic ring segments with EC50 = 0.27 ± 0.19 μm(Fig. 7 A). The calculated EC50 represents an underestimate due to the 10-fold dilution of the uric acid/ONOO− mixture in the tissue bath and the inability to directly quantify the nitrated product. The actual EC50 is in the range of 0.03–0.3 μm. The relaxation response was completely reversed by treatment with oxyhemoglobin. In contrast, uric acid alone or uric acid exposed to decomposed ONOO− had little effect on vessel tone, although a modest decrease in tension was observed at the highest cumulative concentration of uric acid treated with decomposed ONOO−. Treatment of xanthine with ONOO− or decomposed ONOO− did not yield reaction products with vasodilatory activity. Ring segments denuded of endothelium displayed similar dose-response characteristics for ONOO−-treated uric acid, as did intact vessels (Fig. 7 B). Direct electrochemical detection of ·NO, utilizing a selective microelectrode, demonstrated that the uric acid/ONOO−mixture spontaneously liberated ·NO (Fig. 8 A). A similar extent of ·NO release was seen when either 0.3 or 3.0 mm uric acid was treated with 1.0 mm ONOO−. Therefore, in subsequent studies, 3.0 mm was used to ensure that excess substrate was present. Addition of oxyhemoglobin to the reaction chamber consumed the ·NO present and completely attenuated any further release of ·NO by subsequent additions of the uric acid/ONOO− mixture. The reaction of 3.0 mm uric acid with 1.0 mmONOO− resulted in the production of 13.7 ± 1.1 μm ·NO. There was no detectable ·NO produced from the reaction of ONOO− alone, uric acid alone, uric acid treated with decomposed ONOO−, or xanthine treated with ONOO−. The release of ·NO from the uric acid/ONOO− mixture was spontaneous and was not enhanced by the addition of thiols (cysteine or glutathione) or metal (Cu2+). Addition of DTPA (0.1 mm), a metal chelator, did not alter ·NO release. Finally, it was demonstrated that both temperature and light significantly (p < 0.01) alter the half-life of this ·NO-donating product. The half-life of ·NO release in the dark at 4 °C was 123 ± 20 min (Fig. 8 B) and was significantly decreased at room temperature (20 ± 3 min) and further decreased in the presence of light (13 ± 1 min). Peroxynitrite is both a nitrating and oxidizing agent that can compromise antioxidant defenses and that simultaneously results in oxidative damage to tissues (11van der Vliet A. Smith D. O'Neill C.A. Kaur H. Darley-Usmar V. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that uric acid is considerably more susceptible to oxidation by ONOO− than other purines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) or purine oxidation products (allantoin and parabanic acid). The interaction of ONOO− with both uric acid and xanthine resulted in the formation of putatively nitrated purine products. However, unlike the nitrated uric acid product, the xanthine product was not formed in our plasma experiments, nor did the reaction of xanthine with ONOO− result in release of ·NO or vascular relaxation. Formation of the putatively nitrated uric acid product was dependent upon the concentration of ONOO− in both plasma and buffer systems. Over 50% of the endogenous uric acid was oxidized in human plasma, which was remarkable in view of the multitude of other potential target molecules present that could react with ONOO−.

Characteristic changes in chromatin organization accompany apoptosis and are routinely used as markers for cell death. We have examined the organization of chromatin in apoptotic PC12 and HeLa cells by indirect immunofluorescence and electron spectroscopic imaging. Our results indicate that de novo chromatin condensation normally seen during mitosis does not occur when cells undergo apoptosis. Instead, the condensed chromatin typically observed results from aggregation of the heterochromatin. We present evidence that, early in apoptosis, there is a rapid degradation of the nuclease-hypersensitive euchromatin that contains hyperacetylated histones. This occurs coincident with the loss of nuclear integrity due to degradation of lamins and reorganization of intranuclear protein matrix. These events lead to collapse of the nucleus and aggregation of heterochromatin to produce the appearance of condensed apoptotic chromatin. This heterochromatin aggregate is then digested by nucleases to produce the oligonucleosomal DNA ladder that is a hallmark of late apoptosis. Unlike mitosis, we have not seen any evidence for the requirement of phosphorylated histones H1 and H3 to maintain the chromatin in the condensed state.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a tightly regulated mechanism that multicellular organisms employ to replace damaged cells and to remove cells no longer needed during normal growth and development (1Ucker D.S.

Biol. 1993; 6: 391-394Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The generation of large condensed chromatin bodies and degradation of DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments are features that are seen in many cells undergoing programmed cell death. Although commonly used as markers of apoptosis, the biochemical mechanism responsible for these features is not known. De novochromosome condensation occurs during mitosis in cycling cells, and this condensation has been extensively studied. Many of the genes involved in regulating mitosis have been identified (5Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 441-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thecdc2 gene, which encodes a histone H1 kinase, was identified as the major regulator of mitosis and has also been implicated in apoptosis. This raises the question of whether the same mechanisms regulating the formation of the mitotic chromosome also apply to apoptotic chromatin condensation. The requirement for histone H1 kinase activity in both processes led to the suggestion that cells could be triggering apoptosis by entering into an unscheduled mitosis and that a major player in this process could be the p34 kinase (1Ucker D.S. New Biol. 1991; 3: 103-109PubMed Google Scholar,4Rubin L.L. Philpott K.L. Brooks S.F. Curr. Biol. 1993; 6: 391-394Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Activation of the p34 kinase was first demonstrated to accompany apoptosis in YAC-1 lymphoma cells (8Shi L. Nishioka W.K. Th'ng J. Bradbury E.M. Litchfield D.W. Greenberg A.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was observed that temperature-induced inactivation of p34 in FT210 cells prevented the induction of apoptosis by treatment with fragmentin and perforin. Since then, the up-regulation of p34 during apoptosis has been reported in other cell lines (8Shi L. Nishioka W.K. Th'ng J. Bradbury E.M. Litchfield D.W. Greenberg A.H.

A. 1994; 91: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), the cell lines used in the present study. However, there are also reports of apoptosis occurring without the activity of p34 protein kinase (17Oberhammer F.A. Hochegger K. Froschl G. Tiefenbacher R. Pavelka M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 18Norbury C. MacFarlane M. Fearnhead H. Cohen G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thus, although p34 is required for apoptosis that is induced by some agents, this requirement is not universal to all apoptotic pathways. In this study, we examined the organization of the condensed chromatin in early apoptotic cells and during mitosis. Our results suggest that the chromatin condensation associated with apoptosis is not an active process. Instead, our results indicate that apoptotic condensation arises as a consequence of the loss of structural integrity of the euchromatin, nuclear matrix, and nuclear lamina. This allows the heterochromatin to aggregate. In vitro DNase I digestion experiments demonstrate that the integrity of the nuclease-sensitive chromatin is essential to maintain the dispersed state of interphase chromatin. These experiments further demonstrate that chromatin has a propensity to aggregate in the absence of post-translational modifications of histones or other nuclear proteins. PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum as described (21Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 22Greene L.A. Aletta J.M. Rukenstein A. Green S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 147: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. For indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, HeLa cells were grown on regular coverslips, whereas PC12 cells were grown on coverslips that were coated with poly-l-lysine. After induction of apoptosis, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde prepared in PBS,1 followed by permeabilization with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, with three washes with PBS between treatments. The cells were then incubated with antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Antibodies to acetylated histones and to histones H1 and H3 were used at 1:200 dilutions. Antibodies to phosphorylated histone H3 as well as lamins A and C were used at 1:1000 dilutions. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:100 to 1:200 dilutions. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for anti-lamin antibodies or with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for anti-histone antibodies. Following this incubation, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted onto microscope slides with 90% glycerol containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine and DAPI. The cells were then imaged with a Zeiss Universal microscope equipped with epifluorescence using a Princeton Instruments 14-bit cooled charge-coupled device. The procedure for preparation and examination of cells by electron spectroscopic imaging was described by Hendzel and Bazett-Jones (23Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1996; 182: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, apoptotic cells were collected by centrifugation and fixed by incubating overnight at 4 °C in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS. The cells were pelleted and dehydrated through a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol, with the final dehydration in 95% ethanol. The final cell pellet was polymerized in Quetol 651, and sectioned into 20–40-nm thick slices. ESI was then performed as described (23Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1996; 182: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with a Zeiss EM902 electron microscope equipped with a prism-mirror-prism electron imaging spectrometer. HeLa cells were incubated overnight in regular growth medium containing increasing concentrations of sodium butyrate. The cells were collected by trypsinization and pelleted. Lysis of cells and extraction of histones were as described by Th'nget al. (24Th'ng J.P.H. Guo X.W. Swank R.A. Crissman H.A. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9568-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extraction buffers contained 2 mmbutyrate to suppress the activities of endogenous deacetylases. About 100 μg of total histones was loaded into each lane of a 30-cm acid-urea gel as described (24Th'ng J.P.H. Guo X.W. Swank R.A. Crissman H.A. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9568-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the gel solution contained 6% Triton X-100. Following electrophoresis, the histones were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Susceptibility of DNA to nuclease digestion in apoptotic cells was measured by release of [3H]thymidine as described by Nishioka and Welsh (26Nishioka W.K. Welsh R.M. Nat. Immun. 1993; 12: 113-127PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were prelabeled overnight with 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine and washed once. They were then dispensed into a 96-well plate at a density of 40,000 cells in 100 μl/well in the presence of 50 μm C6-ceramide and varying concentrations of sodium butyrate, as described above. After incubation for 24 h, 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) was added to each well, and the plates were centrifuged to pellet the nuclei. 100 μl of the lysate was then removed from each of the wells and transferred to scintillation vials for counting. To determine the total amount of label incorporated into the DNA, 100 μl of SDS lysis buffer (0.1m NaOH and 0.2% SDS) was added to the set of untreated cells, and 100 μl was then removed for counting. The amount of labeled DNA released into the cytoplasm after lysis with lysis buffer was then expressed as a percentage of the total amount of labeled DNA in the cells, as determined by lysis with the SDS lysis buffer. The treatments were done in quadruplets and were performed three times for verification. Statistical evaluations and plotting of results were performed with Microsoft Excel. The determination of percentage of cell survival after induction of apoptosis was by the MTT assay as described by Carmichael et al. (25Carmichael J. Degraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were plated onto a 96-well plate, with ∼40,000 cells/well. The cells were then treated with C6-ceramide in the presence of increasing concentrations of sodium butyrate, up to 5 mm. After an overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with phenolphthalein-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml MTT reagent. Following a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and 100 μl of Me2SO was added to the cells. The reading of the MTT reaction was at 460 nm on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). For each treatment, quadruplet samples were taken, and statistical evaluations were performed with Microsoft Excel. For this study, we compared the nuclear organization of cells at early stages of apoptosis with untreated control cells. PC12 cells were induced to differentiate by incubation with nerve growth factor (NGF), followed by withdrawal of NGF and serum for 24 h to induce apoptosis according to the procedure of Greene (21Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and Greenet al. (22Greene L.A. Aletta J.M. Rukenstein A. Green S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 147: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although the PC12 cells were allowed to differentiate for up to 7 days, <1% of the population continued to cycle and entered mitosis. Induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells was accomplished by incubation with 50–100 μmC6-ceramide for 12–24 h (27Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Grant S. Proc. Natl.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoptotic cells appeared smaller than control cells, and the DAPI-stained nuclei exhibited large domains of condensed chromatin (Fig. 1 A). These cells were at the early stages of apoptosis, as determined by the absence of cellular fragmentation and apoptotic bodies and the absence of DNA laddering as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). We investigated the fate of euchromatin during early apoptosis by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies to acetylated histones H3 and H4. Transcriptionally competent regions of chromatin contain hyperacetylated histones H3 and H4 (6Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 30Bartsch J. Truss M.

J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In particular, the acetylated H3 antibody recognizes a diacetyllysine epitope that is found almost exclusively in the highest acetylated species of histone H3 (37Boggs B.A. Connors B. Sobel R.E. Chinault A.C. Allis C.D. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1996; 105: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Vettese-Dadey M. Grant P.A. Hebbes T.R. Crane-Robinson C. Allis C.D. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2508-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These antibodies have been extensively used for immunofluorescence studies of chromatin organization in mammalian cells (36Lin R. Leone J.W. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 37Boggs B.A. Connors B. Sobel R.E. Chinault A.C. Allis C.D. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1996; 105: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and Western blot analyses of whole cell extracts have further demonstrated their specificity for acetylated histones. 2M. J. Hendzel and J. P. H. Th'ng, unpublished data. Identical results were obtained with both antibodies, and for simplicity, only the results obtained with the more widely characterized acetylated H4 antibody are shown. Fig. 1 shows a typical staining pattern with antibodies to acetylated histone H4 (A, left panel) in PC12 cells counterstained with DAPI (A, right panel). In control interphase cells, acetylated histone H4 staining was seen throughout the nucleus, except in the nucleoli (Fig. 1 A). Highly condensed mitotic chromosomes also stained with this antibody (A, inset). In all cases, the specific nuclear staining seen in the cells further illustrates the absence of cross-reaction with cytoplasmic proteins. However, in cells that contain the highly condensed apoptotic chromatin, as visualized by staining with DAPI (A, right panel, arrowheads), very little or no staining with antibody to acetylated histones was observed. This lack of staining was consistently seen in cells that spontaneously undergo apoptosis (Fig. 1 A) and in cells induced to enter apoptosis by serum withdrawal (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, within this population of cells in early apoptosis, there were cells that stained predominantly in the cytoplasmic regions (Fig. 1 B, inset), a staining pattern never seen in normal cells. These results indicate that acetylated chromatin is degraded early during apoptosis and released into the cytoplasm, where the histones continue to be further degraded. Although it is possible that there could be deacetylation in cells undergoing apoptosis, the presence of immunoreactive histone fragments in the cytoplasm indicates that the absence of acetylated histones in the nucleus is most likely due to the nucleolytic release of acetylated chromatin. The percentage of apoptotic cells displaying cytoplasmic staining with antibodies to acetylated histones is usually ∼20% in PC12 cells, indicating that this leakage is a transient event and that degradation of euchromatin occurs early during apoptosis. It is most likely that this immunoreactivity is against fragments of histones that are degraded and trapped in the dense cytoplasm of the apoptotic cell. The observation that this cytoplasmic staining is transient further indicates that the histones continue to be degraded when released from the nuclei. Indeed, attempts to isolate histones from nucleosomal DNA that leaked out into the cytoplasm during apoptosis have been unsuccessful.2 This cell phenotype has been generally observed in HeLa, Indian muntjac, SKN, and normal diploid human fibroblast cells entering apoptosis (data not shown). In all these cases, the cells with apoptotic chromatin bodies failed to stain with this antibody. This lack of staining is not likely due to inaccessibility of condensed chromatin to antibodies since condensed metaphase chromosomes stained well with the antibody to acetylated histone H4 (Fig. 1 A, inset). High resolution ESI studies showed that metaphase chromosomes and apoptotic chromatin have very similar packing densities (see Fig. 5). Very dense apoptotic bodies only appear after the nucleus has entirely disintegrated (data not shown). These results indicate that most of the nuclease-sensitive acetylated chromatin is degraded early during apoptosis, and at earlier time points, acetylated chromatin fragments leach out into the cytoplasm. We therefore evaluated the integrity of the nuclear lamina by indirect immunofluorescence of lamins A and C. Fig. 1 C shows that apoptotic cells containing condensed nuclear material, as indicated by DAPI staining, failed to stain with antibodies to lamins A and C (left panel, arrows). Identical results were obtained for lamin B1 (data not shown). This is consistent with previous reports showing that lamin degradation plays a major role in the reorganization of the nucleus during apoptosis (39Lazebnick Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 40Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 41Weaver V.M. Carson C.E. Walker P.R. Chaly N. Lach B. Raymond Y. Brown D.L. Sikorska M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 45-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of lamin staining in early apoptotic cells coincided with loss of acetylated histone staining, and it is likely that degradation of nuclear lamins facilitated leakage of acetylated chromatin into the cytoplasm. Immunostaining of apoptotic cells with antibodies suggests that the euchromatin is hypersensitive to nuclease degradation during apoptosis due to the pre-existing levels of acetylated histones. To determine if increasing the overall level of histone acetylation will further enhance accessibility of DNA to nucleases, HeLa cells were induced into apoptosis with 50 μm C6-ceramide in the presence of varying concentrations of sodium butyrate. HeLa cells were used for this study because they do not aggregate like PC12 cells and can be plated onto 96-well dishes at a consistent density, allowing for measurements to be made quantitatively. Ceramide has been well documented as an inducer of apoptosis through the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway (27Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Grant S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 28Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 29Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium butyrate inhibits the deacetylation of histones in mammalian cells, leading to the accumulation of hyperacetylated histones and cell cycle arrest without loss of viability (42Kruh J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 42: 65-82PubMed Google Scholar). Increased histone acetylation has been demonstrated to open up chromatin (6Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 43Norton V.G. Imai B.S. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 449-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 44van Holde K.E. Chromatin: Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1989Crossref Google Scholar), allowing for greater accessibility to transcription-associated complexes as well as to nucleases (30Bartsch J. Truss M. Bode J. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10741-10746Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Migration of histone H4 on a Triton-acid-urea gel was used as an indication of the levels of histone acetylation in the cell (Fig. 2 A). In cycling cells, 70% of histone H4 remained in the unacetylated state, and ∼20% was monoacetylated (Fig. 2 B). With increasing concentrations of butyrate, there was a corresponding increase in levels of histone acetylation, as evident by the appearance of bands above unmodified histone H4 (indicated as A0H4). At 0.2 and 0.5 mm butyrate, the unacetylated form of histone H4 declined to ∼10%, with a corresponding increase in acetylated forms, up to 90% of total H4 (Fig. 2 B). Increasing the concentrations of butyrate to 2 mm led to an overall increase in the levels of acetylation, with the tetraacetylated histone H4 (indicated asA4H4) becoming more prominent. The level of unmodified histone H4 declined to <5% of the total. A similar increase in histone acetylation was seen with trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases. However, this agent was found to be cytotoxic to the cells. To assess the influence of histone acetylation on the accessibility of DNA to degradation during apoptosis, HeLa cells that were prelabeled with [3H]thymidine were treated with ceramide in the presence of increasing concentrations of butyrate. In the absence of ceramide, treatment with up to 0.5 mm butyrate at these concentrations released <5% of labeled DNA, and this was increased to only 10% when butyrate was increased to 2 mm. With a 24-h treatment with 50 μm ceramide to induce apoptosis, the amount of labeled DNA released was 35%, and raising the ceramide concentration to 100 μm did not increase the release of labeled DNA (data not shown). In the presence of up to 0.5 mm butyrate, the release of labeled DNA was increased to 50% (Fig. 2 C), and further increases in butyrate concentration did not lead to any increase in DNA released. This plateau in the release of labeled DNA suggests that the threshold of accessibility of the DNA to nucleases was reached. The absence of further release of labeled DNA also indicates that the higher concentrations of butyrate did not induce cells into apoptosis, suggesting that the increased release of labeled DNA is from the increased accessibility. The concentrations of butyrate employed in the experiment had a minimal effect on the viability of these cells (Fig. 2 D), as determined by the MTT method (26Nishioka W.K. Welsh R.M. Nat. Immun. 1993; 12: 113-127PubMed Google Scholar). The observed decline of 20% in the presence of butyrate is from the cytostatic effects of butyrate. Butyrate has been demonstrated to arrest the growth of mammalian cells and to induce cellular differentiation in certain cells. However, its effect on HeLa cells that were induced into apoptosis by ceramide was apparent. In the presence of ceramide alone, ∼65% of the cells remained viable after 24 h. In the presence of increasing concentrations of butyrate, the percentage of viable cells was reduced to between 20 and 30%. These results show that although increased levels of acetylated histones in chromatin do not induce apoptosis by themselves, they do accelerate cell death, most likely by facilitating the cleavage of DNA by nucleases. Cells that were hyperacetylated during the induction of apoptosis often showed some staining with acetylated histone antibodies (data not shown). This was highly variable from cell to cell and was most prominent on the surface and immediately outside of the chromatin bodies stained with DAPI (data not shown). The phosphorylation of histones H1 (6Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and H3 (45Gurley L.R. Walters R.A. Tobey R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3936-3944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is correlated with mitotic chromosome condensation. In particular, histone H3 phosphorylation is correlated both spatially and temporally with mitotic chromosome condensation (46Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P Allis C.D. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of histone H3 initiates in mid to late G2 near centromeric heterochromatin. The bulk of histone H3 is phosphorylated during very late G2 (46Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P Allis C.D. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Thus, if apoptotic chromatin condensation involves mechanisms employed to drive mitotic condensation, hyperphosphorylated histone H1 and phosphorylated histone H3 are expected to be enriched in condensed apoptotic chromatin. This possibility was evaluated using antibodies specific for phosphorylated histone H1 (Fig. 3, left panels, PhosH1) (47Lu M.J. Dadd C.A. Mizzen C.A. Perry C.A. McLachlan D.R. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1994; 103: 111-121PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylated histone H3 (PhosH3) (46Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R.

The top panels of Fig. 3 show a field of NGF-treated PC12 cells stained with the antibody recognizing phosphorylated histone H1. As reported previously, G0/G1 cells stained very weakly with the antibody (top left panel, arrows). However, even with prolonged incubation with NGF, a few PC12 cells continued to cycle, giving rise to a few cy"

A unique feature of the second intracellular (i2) loop was an ordered cluster of residues where diverse substitutions cause constitutive activation.

The residues of each group alternate and are spaced three to four positions apart, suggesting an α-helical structure where these groups form opposing faces of the helix.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are members of a large family of receptors that mediate signal transduction by coupling with G-proteins (1Hulme E.C. Birdsall H.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev.

Most members of this family display significant sequence homology, particularly within regions predicted to form 7-transmembrane domains (TM1–7)1 (6Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. Blundell T.L. Receptors and Channels. 1994; 2: 61-78PubMed Google Scholar). Current models of receptor structure arrange the transmembrane domains in a counterclockwise circle centered around TM3 forming a pocket where ligands could bind (7Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.

Consistent with this proposed structural configuration, mutational data indicate that residues located on TM2, TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 are needed for ligand interactions with muscarinic receptors (10Wess J.

In particular, a central role of Asp105 in TM3 of the m1 muscarinic receptor for interactions with both agonists and antagonists has been demonstrated (14Fraser C.M. Wang C. Robinson D.A. Gocayne J.D. Venter J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 840-847PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kurtenbach E. Curtis C.A.M. Pedder E.K. Aitken A. Harris A.C.M. Hulme E.C. J. Biol.

By preparing chimeras between subtypes from the two functional classes (e.g. chimeric m1/m2 and m3/m2 receptors), the third cytoplasmic loop (i3) has been shown to be the region that defines subtype specificity for distinct G-proteins (17Wess J. Brann M.R. Bonner T.I. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Wess J. Bonner T.I. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kubo T.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4381-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The central portion of the i3 loop can be deleted without impairing coupling to G-proteins, indicating that only the N- and C-terminal regions of the i3 loop (Ni3 and Ci3, adjacent to TM5 and TM6, respectively) are required for function (21Shapiro R.A. Nathanson N.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8946-8950Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Lameh J. Philip M. Sharma Y.K. Moro O. Ramachandran J. Sadee W. J. Biol.

In contrast to results with i3, work on i2 indicates less of a role in governing G-protein coupling specificity and more of a role in governing overall strength of coupling (25Wong S.K.F. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wong S.K.F. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the DRY motif at the junction of TM3 and i2 is one of the most highly conserved regions of G-protein-coupled receptors (6Donnelly D. Findlay J.B.C. Blundell T.L. Receptors and Channels. 1994; 2: 61-78PubMed Google Scholar), thus it is likely that the i2 loop plays a fundamental role in G-protein coupling for all receptors. Contemporary pharmacological theory states that G-protein coupled receptors spontaneously interconvert between active (R*) and inactive (R) states (known as the two-state model or extended ternary complex model, see Refs. 27Lefkowitz R.J.

Consistent with this theory, we have observed that overexpression of compatible G-proteins constitutively activates muscarinic receptors by promoting formation of R* (31Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Bräuner-Osborne H. Brann M.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Burstein E.S. Spalding T.S. Brann M.R. Mol.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This concept also explains numerous observations that receptors are capable of activating G-proteins and eliciting responses in the absence of agonists (29Chidiac P. Hebert T.E. Valiquette M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 490-499PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hilf G. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 225: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Costa T. Herz A.

The observable levels of constitutive activity of wild-type receptors are relatively low indicating that wild-type receptors exist predominantly as R. However many mutationally activated G-protein coupled receptors have been described which have levels of constitutive activity that are significantly higher than the original wild-type receptors (40Spalding T.A.

A. 1997; 94: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In general, activating mutations are thought to alter the equilibrium between R and R* to increase the proportion of receptor that exists as R*. By inference, residues where mutations are activating therefore may play a restraining role, maintaining receptors in an inactive conformation (27Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 42Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conceptually, receptor domains that undergo large conformational changes upon transitioning from R to R* are “switch regions,” and would be expected to contain many such residues which restrain the receptor in R, as well as residues that are required in R*, for example, to couple G-proteins. In a systematic search for residues that affect G-protein coupling, both the i2 and i3 loops of the human m5 muscarinic receptor have been randomly mutated, and tested for their functional properties. Previously we reported that the functionally important residues of Ni3 and Ci3 are distributed with a periodicity of 3 to 4 positions, suggesting these regions form α-helical extensions of their adjacent transmembrane domains (45Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3141-3146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 46Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3058-3065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, in i2 we find the distribution of functionally important residues suggests an α-helical structure extending from TM3. Uniquely, a cluster of constitutively activating residues was identified in i2 which are also distributed in a pattern consistent with an α-helix, and which alternate with residues required for G-protein activation. We propose that the i2 loop has two protein faces, one comprised of residues important for attaining the active state of the receptor, and the other comprised of residues important for maintaining the inactive state of the receptor, and that the i2 loop operates as a conformational switch enabling G-protein coupling. Mutations were randomly introduced into the i2 loop from residues 127 to 151 using oligonucleotides doped at a 15% rate with an equimolar mixture of the four bases as described previously (45Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3141-3146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) except that cassettes containing point mutations were ligated into compatible cohesive ends using an existing uniqueEcoRI site, and an SpeI site created by introducing silent mutations into Leu121 (CTT → CTA) and Leu122 (CTG → CTA) of the coding sequence for the human m5 receptor (pCDE2-m5) rather than blunt-end ligated. A second library containing mutations from 129 to 143 was constructed based upon results with the first library including the observations that positions 144–149 could be freely mutated without affecting the functional properties of the receptor, whereas mutations at residues 127 and 128 severely affect receptor function. The lower mutation rate at residues 150 and 151 was due to inefficient priming of the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide in the polymerase chain reaction (47Hill-Eubanks D. Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Bräuner-Osborne H. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3058-3065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, the oligonucleotide used for the second library contained wild-type sequence at the 3′ end (codons 144 and 145) to eliminate polymerase chain reaction artifacts. Point mutations at each of four residues, Phe130, Arg134, Tyr138, and Arg142 were constructed as described (46Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2882-2885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides doped with an equimolar mixture of the four bases at each individual codon rather than at a 15% rate over multiple codons as described above for random saturation mutagenesis of the i2 loop.Escherichia coli (DH5α) were transformed, and individual transformants were picked, amplified, and plasmid DNA isolated for all subsequent studies. Clones were sequenced after positive identification and characterization in the functional assays so that in essence, functional studies were done blindly. NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC number CRL 1658) and tsA cells (human embryonic kidney cell line tsA 201, Ref. 48Chahine M. Bennet P.B. George A.L. Horn R.

Receptor selection andamplification technology (R-SATTM) assays were performed as described (45Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

For screening, R-SAT assays were performed entirely in 96-well plates, using proportionately less DNA. Clones were screened in the presence of 100 μm carbachol, 2 μmatropine, or no drug. Plates were read at 420 nm on a plate-reader (Bio-Tek EL 310 or Molecular Devices). Data from R-SAT assays were fit to the equation: r = A + B(x/(x + c)), where A = minimum response, B = maximum response minus minimum response, c = EC50, r = response, and × = concentration of ligand. Curves were generated by least-squares fits using the program KaleidaGraph™ (Abelbeck Software). Maximum response values were normalized according to an internal standard based on the fact that NIH 3T3 cells endogenously express prostanoid FP receptors which produce a robust R-SAT response when exposed to the prostanoid agonist cloprostanol (Kayman Chemicals). We assayed each batch of transfected cells with 10 nm cloprostanol (EC50= 1 nm) 2T. Messier and M.

Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and stored at −80 °C. Membranes were prepared in binding buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 5 mm magnesium, and 50 μm Gpp(NH)p immediately before use. The second intracellular loop (i2) is highly conserved, with 13 of 25 amino acids being identical among the muscarinic subfamily (1Hulme E.C. Birdsall H.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). To investigate structure-function relationships of m5 receptor/G protein coupling in the i2 loop we employed random-saturation mutagenesis in combination with a high throughput functional assay (R-SATTM see Refs. 45Burstein E.S.

Randomly doped oligonucleotides were used in a polymerase chain reaction based construction method (see “Materials and Methods”) to generate libraries of mutant m5 muscarinic receptors. The libraries were screened for functional receptors using R-SATTM, and these receptors were sequenced and subjected to concentration-response analysis. Overall, 63 functional receptors were isolated from libraries containing over 900 unique receptors. Three basic phenotypes of receptors were observed (see Fig. 1) including activated receptors (constitutive activity ≥ 15%), wild-type like receptors (EC50 ≤ 10-fold, EC50WT and max response ≥ 70% WT), and compromised receptors (EC50 > 10-fold EC50 WT or max response < 70% WT or both). To facilitate comparison of the molecular differences between activated, wild-type like, and compromised receptors, the associated mutations were tabulated by position and compiled into lists (see Table I).Table ISequences and functional phenotypes of m5 receptors randomly mutated across i2 Open table in a new tab A striking finding was the large number of constitutively activated receptors were identified in the i2 library (Table I and Fig. 1 A). These receptors mediated ligand independent responses which could be reversed by the negative antagonist atropine. In general, the EC50 values of carbachol at the activated receptors were lower than the value for wild-type m5. Although mutations were introduced randomly into i2, mutations associated with constitutive activity were not randomly distributed, but were instead clustered at Phe130, Arg134, Thr137, Tyr138, and Arg142. In contrast, analysis of the i3 loop by random mutagenesis identified very few constitutively activated receptors (45Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3141-3146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 46Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Brann, unpublished data. suggesting that mutations in the i2 loop have a greater propensity to cause constitutive activity. Receptors which were phenotypically similar to wild-type m5 also contained a non-random pattern of mutations (see Table I and Fig. 1 B). While the majority of residues in i2 tolerated multiple radical substitutions, eight residues were either never mutated or were substituted infrequently and only with conservative amino acids. No mutations were observed at Asp127, Arg128, or Phe135 in wild-type like or activated receptors. Since the random mutagenesis procedure certainly produced receptors containing mutations to these residues (46Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Several other residues were also identified where non-conservative mutations may disrupt receptor function. Tyr129 was only mutated to phenylalanine and cysteine which are found at the analogous position in other G-protein coupled receptors and are well tolerated substitutions in the m1 muscarinic receptor (51Lu Z. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Ile132and Thr143 were only conservatively mutated to valine and alanine, respectively. Only bulky hydrophobic substitutions were observed at Leu136, a structural requirement previously predicted for this residue (52Moro O. Lameh J. Hogger P. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22273-22276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arg139 was only mutated to tryptophan which is often seen to occupy analogous positions to arginine in three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins as illustrated by the PAM250 matrix (53Pearson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Overall these data define a consensus of residues which are likely to be crucial for receptor/G-protein coupling and are therefore important for the active state of the receptor. Receptors with compromised phenotypes (EC50 > 10-fold EC50 WT or max response < 70% WT or both) are shown in Table I. These receptors had a more random distribution of mutations than the other groups of receptors, and most of the compromised receptors (14 out of 21) contain mutations at residues which were never mutated in the fully functional receptors (see Table I), providing more evidence for the functional importance of these residues. Functional receptors containing mutations at Arg128 were never observed, consistent with its pivotal role in G-protein coupling (see Ref. 54Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Receptors appear to function by switching between active and inactive conformations (27Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 28Leff P. Trends Pharmacol.

The effect of constitutively activating mutations is to increase the preference of the receptor for the active state and this can be achieved either by disrupting interactions important for maintaining the inactive state, or by strengthening interactions needed for active state. To distinguish between these possibilities, libraries of receptors were constructed which contained point mutations at each of four residues associated with the activated phenotype. The libraries were screened for constitutive active receptors which were then sequenced and subjected to concentration-response analysis with carbachol and atropine. As shown in Table II and Fig. 2, at each position diverse substitutions representing most of the major classes of amino acids were constitutively activating. Given this diversity, it is likely that the primary effect of these mutations is to disrupt interactions needed to maintain the inactive state rather than to strengthen interactions needed in the active state.Table IIConcentration-response parameters from receptors containing point mutations to residues Phe, Arg, Tyr, and ArgSubstitutionConstitutive activity (%)Maximum response (%)Carbachol, EC50 × 10−7mAtropine, EC50 × 10−9m%Wild-type151001.2aF130Q1101550.0317F130C751400.24F130M701000.051F130S601400.13F130E601300.15F130H601350.34F130K601200.26F130R551700.42F130G501700.76F130T301550.610R134D601100.25R134N501200.14R134E501100.19R134T501000.15R134Q451300.15R134A401000.26R134C30850.87R134V251300.5aR134G201101.1aY138A401300.218Y138C451600.83Y138T401500.58Y138S401250.39Y138M351150.39Y138V351200.77Y138G351551.11R142L801150.036R142N751200.14R142H701000.082R142T651300.11R142G551500.32R142Q501500.33R142F451900.62R142S451100.067R142D401900.84R142A351100.15R142C301000.15R142W201600.9aEC50 denotes the concentration of ligand which produces a half-maximal response from the receptor (either to increase or reverse activity) in the absence of other ligands.

Ligand binding studies revealed that receptors having constitutively activated, wild-type, and compromised phenotypes were expressed at similar levels, thus these diverse phenotypes are unlikely to be due to changes in expression levels (Table III). Two compromised receptors (clones 19 and 151, see Table I for functional phenotypes) bound carbachol with similar affinity as wild-type m5, thus the reduced potency of carbachol seen in functional assays is almost certainly because of impaired G-protein coupling. As in the functional assay, carbachol affinity was greater for activated receptors than for wild-type m5 and tended to be greatest at the most constitutively activated receptors, a predicted consequence of constitutive activity (27Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 30Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, antagonist affinities (and potencies, see Table II) were largely unaffected. Since the i2 loop resides in the cytoplasm, it is unlikely that the observed increases in carbachol affinity are due to direct changes in the ligand-binding site but probably result from allosteric effects.Table IIILigand binding parameters of mutant receptorsK 1(NMS)B maxIC50 (Cch)Fold change×10−10mpmol/mg× 10−6mm52.07.41771R142H1.77.5921R142N2.49.31018F130Q1.86.61512Y138T1.83.3316F130K1.43.7375F130M2.77.5633F130C2.06.1593R134E1.54.3722Clone 190.84.7394Clone 1511.05.51461IC50 values for carbachol were determined in the presence of 500 pm N-methylscopolamine.

We have shown that the i2 domain contains a group of residues necessary for holding the receptor in an inactive conformation (the off-state) and another group necessary for G-protein coupling (the on-state). These residues occur with a periodicity of 3 to 4 positions and when mapped on a perfect α-helix, form opposing faces, offset approximately 100° (see Fig. 3). Given the clear division between constitutively activating residues and functionally conserved residues, we speculate that i2 switches conformation to alternatively prevent or promote G-protein coupling through these two groups. The two putative protein faces formed by these groups could engage/disengage G-proteins, other accessory proteins, or other domains of the receptor. G-protein coupling to muscarinic receptors occurs mainly through the i2 and i3 loops (55Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), therefore with this and previous studies (45Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have completed analysis of the major G-protein coupling domains of the m5 muscarinic receptor by random mutagenesis (see Fig. 3). Comparison of these results reveals several patterns. G-protein coupling occurs primarily at the transmembrane/cytoplasmic borders between TM3/i2, TM5/Ni3, and TM6/Ci3, respectively. All of the functionally important residues in i2 and i3 identified by random mutagenesis are restricted to segments adjacent to these transmembrane domains whereas the remaining residues can be freely mutated without affecting function. The functionally critical residues in each domain are predominantly distributed with a periodicity of 3 to 4 positions, consistent with the hypothesis that these regions form α-helical extensions of the adjacent transmembrane domains (also see Refs. 57Liu J.

There is generally conservation of hydrophobic residues within i2 and i3 (45Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

These hydrophobic residues likely fulfill structural roles in forming a G-protein coupling pocket (46Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When TM5 and TM6 are aligned such that residues known to be vital for receptor-ligand interactions face into the core of the receptor (10Wess J. Gdula D. Brann M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Wess J. Nanavati S. Vogel Z. Maggio R. EMBO J. 1993; 10: 331-338Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Blüml K.

Spalding T.S. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model is consistent with the idea that in a soluble protein, hydrophobic residues generally face inward. As TM3 is thought to face TM5 and TM6 (7Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), it is plausible that the conserved hydrophobic residues identified in i2 interact with those identified in Ni3 and Ci3. Finally, there is functional conservation of basic residues in i2 and i3, in agreement with theories that receptors couple G-proteins through interactions with electrostatically negative regions of the heterotrimeric complex (60Wall M.A. Coleman D.E.

The helical domains of Ni3 and Ci3 each terminate in basic residues (45Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now identified four arginine residues in i2 which are critical for receptor function, consistent with the idea that i2 plays a major role in receptor/G-protein coupling, and that basic residues are crucial to this process. Despite the similarities between i2 and i3 described above, it is clear that these domains also perform distinct roles in receptor/G-protein coupling. Previous work identified Tyr217 in Ni3 (46Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2882-2885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Ala441 in Ci3 (45Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Spalding T.S. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although four residues in i2 predict G-protein coupling specificity based on sequence conservation (1Hulme E.C. Birdsall H.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar), none of these residues was identified as being functionally critical. Thus coupling specificity is governed mainly by the i3 loop, in agreement with earlier findings using chimeric m2/m5 receptors (55Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ample structural (7Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol.

Conformational changes occurring due to ligand interactions with TM3 are likely to be propagated into i2 to enable receptor/G-protein activation.

AL1 is a multifunctional protein that binds double-stranded DNA, catalyzes cleavage and ligation of single-stranded DNA, and forms oligomers. Earlier experiments showed that the region of TGMV AL1 necessary for DNA binding maps to the N-terminal 181 amino acids of the protein and overlaps the DNA cleavage (amino acids 1–120) and oligomerization (amino acids 134–181) domains. In this study, we generated a series of site-directed mutations in conserved sequence and structural motifs in the overlapping DNA binding and cleavage domains and analyzed their impact on AL1 function in vivo and in vitro. Only two of the fifteen mutant proteins were capable of supporting viral DNA synthesis in tobacco protoplasts. In vitroexperiments demonstrated that a pair of predicted α-helices with highly conserved charged residues are essential for DNA binding and cleavage. Three sequence motifs conserved among geminivirus AL1 proteins and initiator proteins from other rolling circle systems are also required for both activities. We used truncated AL1 proteins fused to a heterologous dimerization domain to show that the DNA binding domain is located between amino acids 1 and 130 and that binding is dependent on protein dimerization. In contrast, AL1 monomers were sufficient for DNA cleavage and ligation. Together, these results established that the conserved motifs in the AL1 N terminus contribute to DNA binding and cleavage with both activities displaying nearly identical amino acid requirements.

The IR also contains a hairpin with a 9-base pair loop sequence conserved among all geminiviruses that is cleaved during initiation and termination of RCR (5Heyraud F. Matzeit V. Kammann M.

Genetic experiments established that the hairpin structure is essential for TGMV replication (18Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Crossref Google Scholar). TGMV encodes two proteins, AL1 and AL3, that are required for efficient viral replication. AL1 is necessary for replication, whereas AL3 enhances viral DNA accumulation by an unknown mechanism (19Elmer J.S. Brand L. Sunter G. Gardiner W.E. Bisaro D.M. Rogers S.G.

TGMV AL1 binds to double-stranded DNA at the conserved repeated motif in the plus-strand origin (11Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol.

Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Crossref Google Scholar). Analysis of the C1 protein of tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), a TGMV AL1 homologue, revealed that it covalently attaches to the 5′ end of the cleaved DNA by a phosphotyrosyl bond and catalyzes ligation of the cleavage products (27Laufs J. Schumacher S. Geisler N. Jupin I. Gronenborn B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ATPase activity has also been demonstrated for the AL1/C1 proteins from TYLCV and TGMV (28Desbiez C. David C. Mettouchi A. Laufs J. Gronenborn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and interacts with a maize homologue of the animal cell cycle regulatory protein, retinoblastoma (31Ach R.A. Durfee T. Miller A.B. Taranto P. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Zambriski P.C. Gruissem W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The C1 protein from wheat dwarf virus also interacts with retinoblastoma proteins from human and maize (32Xie Q. Suarezlopez P. Gutierrez C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Collin S. Fernandez-Lobato M. Gooding P.S. Mullineaux P.M. Fenoll C.

In an earlier study, we used truncated proteins produced in a baculovirus expression system to map the regions of TGMV AL1 that are responsible for DNA cleavage, DNA binding and oligomerization (29Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that the DNA cleavage domain is located in the first 120 amino acids of AL1 whereas the oligomerization domain maps to the protein center between amino acids 121 and 181. DNA binding requires a larger region that fully overlaps the DNA cleavage and oligomerization domains. Based on these experiments, we proposed that additional amino acids between position 121 and 181 are necessary for AL1/DNA binding and/or that AL1 complex formation is required for DNA binding. In this study, we identified key sequence and structural motifs in the DNA binding and cleavage domains. A series of site-directed mutations in the AL1 N terminus were analyzed for their impact on function in vivo and in vitro. These studies focused on three amino acid motifs, which are conserved among all geminivirus AL1/C1 proteins and many initiator proteins from other RCR systems (35Koonin E.V. Ilyina T.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2763-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36Ilyina T.V. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), and on a predicted helix-loop-helix motif in the N termini of AL1/C1 proteins of dicot-infecting geminiviruses (29Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We also used a heterologous protein interaction domain to assess the importance of oligomerization for AL1/DNA binding and coupled DNA cleavage/ligation. The plasmid pNSB148, which contains the AL1 coding sequence in a pUC118 background, was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis (37Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 482-492Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers and resulting clones are listed in Table I. The sequences of fragments containing the mutations and used for subsequent cloning were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Plant expression cassettes with the mutant AL1 coding sequences were generated by subcloning NdeI/SalI fragments (AL1 amino acids 1–120) from the mutant clones into the same sites in a wild type AL1 plant expression cassette pMON1549 (11Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In pMON1549, AL1 expression is under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter with a duplicated enhancer (38Kay R. Chan A. Daly M. McPherson J. Science. 1987; 236: 1299-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and the 3′ end from the pea E9 rbcS gene (39Coruzzi G. Broglie R. Edwards C. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Baculovirus expression vectors coding for AL1 proteins fused to a glutathione S-transferase tag (GST-AL1) were generated by digesting the mutant plant expression cassettes with NdeI and BamHI and repairing the ends with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow). The fragments, which included complete AL1 coding regions, were inserted into the SmaI site of pNSB314. The pNSB314 vector contains the GST coding sequence, followed by a glycine linker, a thrombin cleavage site, and a multiple cloning site for generating in-frame fusion proteins (18Orozco B.M.

J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Crossref Google Scholar). Purified proteins were visualized by electrophoresis in 16% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. Interactions between authentic AL1 and mutant GST-AL1 proteins were assayed by copurification on glutathione-Sepharose, followed by immunoblot analysis using AL1 polyclonal antisera (29Orozco B.M.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA gel shift assays were performed as described previously (18Orozco B.M. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Virol. 1996; 270: 148-158Crossref Google Scholar). An 83-base pair EcoRI fragment containing the AL1 DNA binding motif (TGMV A positions 28–84) was isolated from pNSB378 and 3′ end-labeled using Klenow and [α-32P]dATP. The radiolabeled DNA was incubated with purified GST-AL1 fusion proteins for 1 h at room temperature at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The bound and free probe were resolved on 1% agarose gels, dried onto DE-81 paper, and analyzed by autoradiography. For DNA cleavage and ligation, oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences in the hairpin of the TGMV (+)-strand origin were 5′ end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The oligonucleotides CR13 (5′-GTTTAATATTACCGGATGGCCGC) and CR33 (5′-GCGGCCATCCGTTTAATATT) were used for assays with full-length mutant and wild type AL1 proteins. For assays with truncated AL1 proteins, only one oligonucleotide, CR13 or CR34 (5′-GCGGCCATCCGTTTAATATTACCGGATGG) was radiolabeled and the cold oligonucleotide was titrated into the reactions as described in the figure legend. Approximately 5000 cpm of each labeled DNA was incubated with ∼100 ng of purified GST-AL1 fusion protein in 10 μl of cleavage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 ng of poly(dI-dC)) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 6 μl of gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and heating to 90 °C for 2 min. The reaction products were resolved on 15% polyacrylamide denaturing gels and analyzed by autoradiography. Protoplasts were isolated fromNicotiana tabacum NT-1 suspension cells, electroporated, and cultured according to published methods (11Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L.

The transfections contained 15 μg each of replicon DNA containing a partial tandem copy of TGMV B (pTG1.4B described in Ref. 14Fontes E.P.B. Gladfelter H.J. Schaffer R.L. Petty I.T.D.

Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), wild type or mutant AL1 expression cassette, and an AL3 plant expression cassette (pNSB46 described in Ref. 11Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total DNA was extracted 3 days after transfection and analyzed for double-stranded viral DNA accumulation by DNA gel blot hybridization (11Fontes E.P.B. Eagle P.A. Sipe P.A. Luckow V.A. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two key steps in initiation of RCR are origin recognition and generation of a free 3′-OH for priming plus-strand DNA synthesis. TGMV AL1 mediates both of these processes by binding double-stranded DNA in a sequence-specific manner and by cleaving at a unique site in the origin. Earlier studies established that the AL1 N terminus is necessary for both activities (29Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This region of AL1 contains several conserved sequence and structural motifs (Fig. 1), including a highly predicted pair of α-helices between amino acids 25 and 52 (29Orozco B.M. Miller A.B. Settlage S.B. Hanley-Bowdoin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The sequences of both helices are strongly conserved among dicot-infecting geminiviruses, and the second helix is amphipathic in character. This conservation suggested that the predicted α-helices may be necessary for AL1 function. To test this hypothesis, we generated four site-directed mutants of TGMV AL1 that are modified in either helix 1 or helix 2 (Fig. 1 B) and compared their activities to the wild type protein in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 1 B). The helix mutants were first tested for the ability to direct replication of TGMV B DNA in tobacco protoplasts with wild type TGMV AL3 also supplied in trans. Helix 1-mutant 2 (H1–2), which contains a S25V change and resembles the AL1 protein of the closely related geminivirus BGMV, supported wild type levels of TGMV B replication (Fig. 2 A, cf. lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, H1–1, which has alanine substitutions at three conserved charged residues in helix 1, failed to support viral DNA replication (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). The mutations in helix 2 either converted three conserved charged residues to alanine (H2–1), included a I45G change (H2–2), or altered the helix to resemble BGMV AL1 (H2–3). All helix 2 mutations abolished transient replication (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–5). The mutant phenotypes established that, in general, the amino acid sequences of the predicted helices are essential for AL1 activity in vivo. The negative effect of the I45G replacement in H2–2, which should disrupt helix 2, suggested that the structure is also required for AL1 function. The AL1 helix mutants defective in replication assays were expressed as GST-AL1 fusion proteins in insect cells, purified by glutathione affinity chromatography, and examined for various AL1 activitiesin vitro. H1–2 was not included in these experiments because of its wild type replication phenotype. The mutant proteins were tested for DNA binding activity in gel shift assays using a radiolabeled double-stranded DNA probe that includes the TGMV AL1 DNA binding site. None of the helix mutants bound DNA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–6), even though wild type AL1 efficiently shifted the probe in a parallel reaction (lane 2). The mutant AL1 proteins were also tested for DNA cleavage activity using a radiolabeled, single-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the loop and right side of the hairpin in the plus-strand origin. Wild type GST-AL1 cleaved the 23-nt substrate to give a 10-nt radiolabeled product (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). Mutants H1–1 (Fig. 2 C, lane 3) and H2–3 (lane 6) displayed severely attenuated DNA cleavage activity, whereas H2–1 (lane 4) and H2–2 (lane 5) had no detectable activity. These results demonstrated that the predicted helices 1 and 2 are required both for DNA binding and cleavage by TGMV AL1. Helices 1 and 2 are outside of the AL1 interaction domain, and their mutation should have no effect on oligomerization if the proteins are properly expressed and folded. To verify that the failure of the AL1 helix mutants to bind and cleave DNA was not due to global misfolding, the proteins were assayed for their abilities to form oligomers with authentic AL1. Wild type GST-AL1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) and GST fusions of H1–1 (lane 2), H2–1 (lane 3), H2–2 (lane 4), and H2–3 (lane 5) were coexpressed with authentic AL1 in insect cells, as determined by immunoblotting of total protein extracts. Like wild type GST-AL1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 6), all of the mutant proteins copurified with authentic AL1 on glutathione-Sepharose (lanes 7–10), indicating that the helix mutations did not impair AL1/AL1 interactions and, instead, specifically affected the DNA binding and cleavage activities of AL1. The N terminus of AL1 also includes three conserved sequence motifs that are found in many RCR initiator proteins (Fig. 1; Refs. 35Koonin E.V. Ilyina T.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2763-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and 36Ilyina T.V. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Laufset al. (27Laufs J. Schumacher S. Geisler N. Jupin I. Gronenborn B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) showed that motif 3 corresponds to the endonucleolytic active site, but the roles of motifs 1 and 2 in RCR have not been investigated. We specifically modified these motifs in TGMV AL1 and analyzed the impact of the mutations on protein function (Fig. 1 B). In M1–1, all four motif I residues (F16LTY19) were replaced with alanine. In M1–2 and M1–3, individual aromatic residues were altered to give F16A and Y19A, respectively. The motif 2 mutant contained alanine substitutions for the core HLH sequence. Transient replication assays revealed that none of the motif 1 or 2 mutants (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–5) supported TGMV B amplification in tobacco protoplasts, establishing that both motifs are essential for AL1 activity in vivo. To gain insight into the biochemical basis of the mutant replication phenotypes, we purified GST-AL1 fusion proteins corresponding to the motif 1 and 2 mutants from insect cells and tested them for DNA binding and cleavage in vitro. All of the mutant proteins failed to bind double-stranded DNA (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2–5). Similarly, none of the mutants had detectable single-stranded DNA cleavage activity (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–5). In parallel assays, wild type GST-AL1 (lane 1) efficiently bound (Fig. 4 B) and cleaved (Fig. 4 C) the respective DNA probes. Protein interaction experiments (Fig. 3 B) established that M1–1 (lanes 3 and 8) and M2–1 (lanes 4 and 9) can form oligomers with wild type AL1 and, thus, are not globally misfolded. Together, these results showed that motifs 1 and 2 of TGMV AL1 are required for both DNA binding and cleavage during initiation of RCR. Motif 3 includes several conserved amino acids that may contribute to AL1 function. We generated six TGMV AL1 mutants that modified one or more residues in motif 3 and analyzed their activities in vivo and in vitro. In M3–1, alanines were substituted for the catalytic Tyr-103 and conserved Asp-107 residues. As expected, M3–1 did not support TGMV B replication in tobacco protoplasts (Fig. 5 A, lane 2) and was defective for DNA cleavage (Fig. 5 C, lane 2). Gel shift assays with M3–1 revealed that double-stranded DNA binding was also attenuated over a range of protein concentrations (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5–7), even though wild type GST-AL1 readily formed protein/DNA complexes at the same concentrations (lanes 2–4). In some experiments, low levels of DNA binding were observed with the M3–1 protein (data not shown). Protein interaction experiments showing that M3–1 can oligomerize with wild type AL1 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 10) indicated that the motif 3 mutant is not globally misfolded. The DNA binding defect of M3–1 was unexpected because of the direct involvement of motif 3 in catalysis of DNA cleavage. To better characterize the role of motif 3 and specifically Tyr-103 in DNA binding, we generated two different mutations at this position. In M3–2, Tyr-103 was changed to alanine, while M3–5 contained a phenylalanine substitution. Like M3–1, neither M3–2 or M3–5 supported viral DNA replication (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 6) or cleaved DNA (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3 and 6), confirming that Tyr-103 is necessary for these processes. However, only M3–2 was impaired for DNA binding over a range of protein concentrations (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5–7), whereas M3–5 displayed wild type DNA binding properties (lanes 17–19). These results demonstrated that Tyr-103 contributes to both the DNA bind"
https://openalex.org/W2039556840,"The outer membrane of mitochondria contains channels called VDAC (mitochondrial porin), which are formed by a single 30-kDa protein. Cysteine residues introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at sites throughout Neurospora crassa VDAC (naturally devoid of cysteine) were specifically biotinylated prior to reconstitution into planar phospholipid membranes. From previous studies, binding of streptavidin to single biotinylated sites results in one of two effects: reduced single-channel conductance without blockage of voltage gating (type 1) or locking of the channels in a closed conformation (type 2). All sites react with streptavidin only from one side of the membrane. Here, we extend this approach to VDAC molecules containing two cysteines and determine the location of each biotinylated residue with respect to the other within the membrane. When a combination of a type 1 and a type 2 site was used, each site could be observed to react with streptavidin. Two sets of sites located on opposite surfaces of the membrane were identified, thereby establishing the transmembrane topology of VDAC. A revised folding pattern for VDAC, consisting of 1 alpha helix and 13 beta strands, is proposed by combining these results with previously obtained information on which sites are lining the aqueous pore."

Although endogenous (host-derived) mCD14 ligands are not so well understood, it is known that soluble CD14 (sCD14), the anchorless form of CD14, can function as a lipid transfer protein, moving both LPS and phospholipids to lipoproteins and other acceptors (7Yu B. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A plasma protein, LPS-binding protein (LBP), greatly facilitates ligand binding to both soluble and membrane CD14 (8Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C.

Although its phospholipid-binding properties have not been detailed, mCD14 has been implicated in macrophage recognition of apoptotic cells (11Devitt A. Moffatt O.D. Raykundalia C. Capra J.D. Simmons D.L. Gregory C.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and an ability to bind anionic phospholipids on these cells has been inferred (11Devitt A.

Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), an anionic glycerophospholipid, is a precursor for several prominent intracellular signaling molecules. It is present in low (50–100 μm) concentrations in plasma (13Cunnane S.C. Ho S.-Y. Dore-Duffy P. Ells K.R. Horrobin D.F Am. J. Industrial Med. 1989; 50: 801-806Google Scholar, 14Bagdade J.D.

The ability of macrophages to take up phospholipid-rich liposomes has been appreciated for many years (18Schwendener R.A. Lagocki P.A. Rahman Y.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Certain lymphocyte subsets are also known to bind both PtdIns- and PS-containing liposomes with high affinity (22Wadee A.A. Rabson A.R. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2271-2276PubMed Google Scholar), and there is evidence that extracellular PtdIns can modulate macrophage functions such as phagocytosis (23Wassef N.M. Roerdink F. Richardson E.C.

We report here that PtdIns binds to mCD14 with specificity and saturability, that LBP is necessary for this interaction, and that PtdIns can both prevent LPS-mCD14 binding and inhibit LPS-induced cellular responses. The results suggest that PtdIns and LPS bind to the same or nearby sites on mCD14 and raise the possibility that PtdIns modulates mCD14-dependent responses to LPS and other mCD14 ligands in vivo. Nonradioactive lipids and related compounds were purchased from Serdary Laboratories (London, Ontario) (egg phosphatidylcholine), Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) (liver phosphatidylinositol, egg phosphatidylglycerol, brain phosphatidylserine), or Sigma (nonradiolabeled inositides, bovine brain PtdIns(4)P).

Lipids were dried under argon and resuspended by sonication in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, or SEBDAF (see below) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Murine TNF-α was from Life Technologies, Inc. Human monocytic THP-1 cells were carried in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), and where indicated, the cells were differentiated to express mCD14 by treatment with calcitriol (50 μm) for 3 days (24Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 1760: 485-494Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated mCD14-expressing cells were produced by transfection (pRc/RSV-CD14-GPI) and selected for G418 resistance and CD14 expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACStarPLUS, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry, San Jose, CA). Control cells were transfected with the empty vector (pRc/RSV) and selected for G418 resistance (25Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease.in: Morrison D.C. Brade H. Opal S.

To minimize ligand internalization during binding studies, cells were incubated in SEBDAF buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH = 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 300 μg/ml BSA, 10 mmNaN3, 5 mm deoxyglucose) for 30 min at 37 °C (26Kitchens R.L.

Incubation was then continued for 15 min before the cells were chilled, washed twice with PBS by centrifugation at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. The radioactivity in aliquots of the suspended cells was counted using a Minaxi Tricarb 4000 scintillation counter with external quench standards (Packard Instrument Co.), and the cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized (15 units/ml) blood by centrifugation onto Histopaque 1077 (Sigma), washed twice with RPMI, and resuspended in RPMI for use in experiments. Tritiated Escherichia coli LCD25 LPS (15003H disintegrations/ng) was produced as described (28Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C. Aliquots were suspended in HNEB (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 300 μg/ml BSA) (29Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar) and briefly sonicated prior to use. Binding of LPS to cells was performed as described previously (29Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-CD14 mAbs: 60bca and 26ic were provided by Douglas Golenbock (Boston University); 1H3–2C11, 2G7–6B2–03, and 2G9–1G1 were provided by Richard Darveau (Bristol Myers Squibb); and MY4 was purchased from Coulter (Miami, FL). Murine anti-human LBP mAb was a gift from Peter Tobias (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Sera from LBP +/− and −/− mice were also provided by Dr. Golenbock (30Wurfel M.M. Monks B.G. Ingalls R.R. Dedrick R.L. Delude R. Zhou D. Lamping N. Schumann R.R. Thieringer R. Fenton M.J. Wright S.D. Golenbock D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Recombinant human LBP and control medium were prepared from serum-free medium overlying transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells as described previously (29Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar). The LBP concentration, measured with an ELISA assay using antibodies also provided by Dr. Tobias, was 0.7 μg/ml. IL-8 was measured by ELISA (DuoSet ELISA Development System, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). NF-κB translocation was measured as described (24Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 1760: 485-494Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, each experiment was performed three or more times in duplicate or triplicate and data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences in group means were analyzed using analysis of variance (Kwikstat, Texasoft, Dallas, TX). We first used sonicated suspensions of several radiolabeled lipids to study mCD14-phospholipid binding. Radiolabeled lipids (1 μm) were added to metabolically inhibited THP-1 cells that expressed either recombinant mCD14 or no recombinant protein (vector-only control). LBP-containing medium or control medium was also added. As shown in Fig. 1, approximately 5-fold more PtdIns bound to the cells when both mCD14 and LBP were present (5.6 ± 1.8-fold increase above control, n = 12). LBP did not increase PtdIns binding to cells that lacked mCD14. Of the other phospholipids tested, only PS was bound by the cells in a mCD14- and LBP-dependent fashion (2.3 ± 0.5-fold increase above control, n = 4). PC and PE that had different acyl chain compositions (dipalmitoyl versus 1-palmitoyl, 2-arachidonyl) gave virtually identical results (not shown). Since the greatest mCD14-dependent augmentation in phospholipid binding was found using PtdIns, we chose to study this interaction in detail. To estimate the apparent affinity with which mCD14 binds PtdIns, mCD14-expressing THP-1 cells were again incubated in SEBDAF buffer to inhibit ligand internalization. Increasing concentrations of [14C]PtdIns were added for 10 min in the presence or absence of LBP (0.07 μg/ml or ∼1 μm). As shown in Fig. 2 A, LBP-dependent PtdIns binding was saturable. Half-maximal binding occurred at approximately 0.5–1.0 μmPtdIns. To probe the basis for PtdIns-mCD14 binding in more detail, we tested the ability of a series of nonradioactive structures to inhibit this interaction. In 10-fold molar excess, liver-derived PtdIns inhibited [14C]PtdIns-mCD14 binding by ≥90%, whereas egg PC and brain PS were not inhibitory (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). When we then studied the inhibitory potency of several soluble headgroup analogs, we found that [14C]PtdIns-mCD14 binding could be blocked (≥80%) by a 100-fold excess ofl-2-glycerophospho-d-myo-inositol-4-monophosphate, but not by dl-myo-inositol,dl-myo-inositol-1-monophosphate,dl-myo-inositol-1,4-bisphosphate,l-2-glycerophospho-d-myoinositol, or glycerophosphoinositol-4,5-phosphate (<40% inhibition, data not shown). Since glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate inhibited while inositol-1,4-phosphate did not, these results implicate the glycerol moiety as one determinant of binding specificity. To test the role of headgroup structure in the context of uniform acylation of the glycerol backbone, we then compared a series of dipalmitoylated, synthetic PtdIns derivatives as inhibitors (Fig. 2 B). We found that PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were potent inhibitors of [14C]PtdIns-mCD14 binding (>90% inhibition by a 10-fold molar excess of inhibitor), whereas PtdIns, PtdIns(5)P, and PtdIns(3,5)P were less inhibitory. Taken together, these results suggest that binding specificity is conferred by the glycerophosphoinositol headgroup and that phosphorylation at 3-OH or 4-OH favors binding. The acylated structures were more potent inhibitors than the nonacylated ones, in keeping with a role for hydrophobic interactions in either presentation of the headgroup or in binding to mCD14. Monocytes and neutrophils, the principal mCD14-expressing cells, normally are found in blood. Normal human serum contains approximately 50–100 μmPtdIns (13Cunnane S.C. Ho S.-Y. Dore-Duffy P. Ells K.R. Horrobin D.F Am. J. Industrial Med. 1989; 50: 801-806Google Scholar, 14Bagdade J.D. Buchanan W.F. Pollare T. Lithell H. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 117: 209-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Watala C. Jozwiak Z. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 188: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and LBP (∼7 μg/ml (31Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Hatlen L. Schumann R. Einhorn G. Mathison J. Ulevitch R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 16C (abstr.): 151Google Scholar, 32Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar)). Accordingly, we asked whether PtdIns can bind to mCD14 in the presence of serum. As shown in Fig. 3 A, when [14C]PtdIns was added to cells in the presence of 10% human serum, it bound rapidly to CD14-expressing cells but not to control cells; after incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, mCD14-expressing cells bound 5.3 ± 1.6-fold (n = 3 experiments) more PtdIns than control cells. We next allowed trace amounts (approximately 4 pmol) of [3H]PtdIns to equilibrate with normal human serum for 4 h at 37 °C, then added aliquots of the serum (10% of the final volume) to calcitriol-differentiated THP-1 cells. The serum-incubated [3H]PtdIns retained its expected mobility when analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (not shown), indicating that the molecules were not altered by prolonged incubation in serum. As shown in Fig. 3 B, PtdIns binding to the CD14-expressing cells was inhibited by a murine monoclonal antibody to CD14 but not by isotype-matched mouse IgG. Although only 0.2% of the tracer became cell-associated in a CD14-dependent manner, if the tracer [3H]PtdIns reached equilibrium with the endogenous serum PtdIns (50–100 μm), one may estimate that approximately 1–2 pmol of PtdIns bound to mCD14 on one million cells. To evaluate the role of serum LBP in PtdIns-mCD14 binding, we tested serum from LBP-deficient (−/−) and LBP-sufficient (+/−) mice (30Wurfel M.M. Monks B.G. Ingalls R.R. Dedrick R.L. Delude R. Zhou D. Lamping N. Schumann R.R. Thieringer R. Fenton M.J. Wright S.D. Golenbock D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). [14C]PtdIns-mCD14 binding was significantly greater in serum from LBP +/− mice than in serum from LBP −/− mice (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, a monoclonal antibody to human LBP greatly inhibited PtdIns-mCD14 binding when 10% human serum was the source of the transfer protein (Fig. 4 B). These findings strongly suggest that LBP is the major transfer protein in serum that facilitates PtdIns-mCD14 binding. We next asked whether PtdIns could prevent LPS from binding to mCD14. [3H]LPS (5 ng/ml) was added to CD14-expressing THP-1 cells in the presence of a constant amount of LBP (0.07 μg/ml) and graded concentrations of nonradioactive PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, or PC. As shown in Fig. 5 A, PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P inhibited [3H]LPS uptake during incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. (Inhibition was incomplete since there was substantial CD14-independent uptake of LPS and phosphatidylinositides by live cells during the 2 h period). In the same experiment, we tested the ability of PtdIns to block LPS-induced IL-8 production. Fig. 5 B shows that PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P inhibited IL-8 release, whereas PC did not. Similar experiments were also performed using freshly prepared human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P blocked [3H]LPS cell binding (not shown) and a 5 μm concentration of either inhibitor reduced LPS-induced cell responses by 10–100-fold (shift in dose-response curve, Fig. 5 C), whereas PC had no effect. In keeping with the above findings, PtdIns also inhibited LPS-induced translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (Fig. 6). The inhibitory effect of PtdIns was specific for LPS, since PtdIns did not inhibit TNF-α-induced IL-8 production or NF-κB translocation in THP-1 cells or IL-8 release from human mononuclear cells (Fig. 6 and data not shown). At least as measured in these assays, neither PtdIns nor PtdIns(4)P was stimulatory.Figure 6PtdIns inhibits LPS-induced NF-κB translocation. Calcitriol-differentiated THP-1 cells (2.4 × 106) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in RPMI that contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, LBP (0.07 μg/ml) and the indicated concentrations of liver PtdIns or egg PC (μm), then LPS (2 ng/ml) or TNF-α (2 ng/ml) was added, and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. NF-κB was measured in nuclear extracts by a gel-shift assay as described previously (24Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 1760: 485-494Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The location of NF-κB–bound oligonucleotide is indicated by thearrows. This experiment was repeated with closely similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the possibility that LPS was sequestered by interacting with PtdIns in the medium, we incubated THP-1 cells with LBP (0.07 μg/ml) and PtdIns, or PC (100 μm) LBP for 15 min, washed to remove unbound lipid, and added [3H]LPS (4 ng/ml) with fresh LBP for 5 min at 37 °C. Preincubation with PtdIns decreased LBP-dependent LPS binding by ≥25%, whereas preincubation with PC was ineffective. This result indicates that coincubation of PtdIns and LPS was not necessary for PtdIns to inhibit LPS-mCD14 binding. Nonetheless, since LPS can evidently insert into liposomes that contain PtdIns (9Wurfel M.M. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3925-3934PubMed Google Scholar), this process may influence the outcome of longer term experiments such as those shown in Fig. 5. We next asked whether mAbs known to inhibit (or not to inhibit) LPS-mCD14 binding would also inhibit PtdIns-mCD14 binding. As shown in Fig. 7, inhibition of LPS-mCD14 binding by a panel of anti-CD14 mAbs closely paralleled inhibition of PtdIns-mCD14 binding. These data suggest that PtdIns and LPS bind to the same or nearby regions of mCD14. As noted above, binding of mCD14 by LPS, PS, and phosphatidylinositides, like most other ligands, is greatly facilitated by LBP. To what extent is the specificity of phospholipid-mCD14 binding actually conferred by LBP? We took several approaches to this question. Doubling the LBP concentration in the reaction mixtures did not raise the saturating concentration of PtdIns (see Fig. 2; data not shown), and a 100-fold excess of phospholipids previously shown to interact with LBP (PC, PE) (7Yu B. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) did not block [14C]PtdIns-mCD14 binding. We also found that inhibition of [14C]PtdIns-mCD14 binding occurred when the cells were incubated with LBP and 100 μm liver PtdIns or brain PtdIns(4)P, washed to remove unbound phosphatidylinositide, and reincubated with [14C]PtdIns and a fresh supply of LBP (25% inhibition of [14C]PtdIns-mCD14 binding by PtdIns, 60% inhibition by PtdIns(4)P, no inhibition by PC; two independent experiments, data not shown). PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and [14C]PtdIns thus compete for binding a cell-surface receptor, most likely mCD14. Although LBP may also contribute to the pattern of ligand-mCD14 binding observed, these observations suggest that the binding specificity observed is determined principally by mCD14. Our experiments focused on phosphatidylinositide-mCD14 interactions, yet we also found that PS can bind to mCD14 in an LBP-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Although in our assay system mCD14 binds PS with lower apparent affinity than it binds PtdIns (a 10-fold excess of PS did not inhibit PtdIns-mCD14 binding), its ability to bind PS may account for its role in recognizing apoptotic cells (11Devitt A. Moffatt O.D. Raykundalia C. Capra J.D. Simmons D.L. Gregory C.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar,33Pradhan D. Krahling S. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 8: 767-778Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that LBP should enhance this interaction and raise the possibility that mCD14 may also bind PtdIns exposed on apoptotic cells or on membrane microvesicles such as those released in response to various inflammatory stimuli (34Satta N.

We thus suggest that phosphatidylinositides and PS are more likely than the other phospholipids tested to be natural mCD14 ligands. Its ability to compete with LPS for binding mCD14 further suggests that PtdIns, the most abundant anionic phospholipid in serum, could modulate cellular responses to low concentrations of LPS (and possibly other exogenous agonists that bind mCD14) in vivo. A great excess of PtdIns is required to inhibit LPS binding to mCD14, however, and very little is known about the movement of PtdIns between cells, lipoproteins, and other carrier molecules in blood. mCD14-bound phosphatidylinositides might also be translocated into the cell to participate in signaling reactions, to provide a source of intracellular arachidonate (35Zoeller R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2082414787,"Subdecadal changes in Earth's rotation rate, and hence in the length of day (LOD), are largely controlled by variations in atmospheric angular momentum. Results from two oceanic general circulation models (OGCMs), forced by observed wind stress and heat flux for the years 1992 through 1994, show that ocean current and mass distribution changes also induce detectable LOD variations. The close similarity of axial oceanic angular momentum (OAM) results from two independent OGCMs, and their coherence with LOD, demonstrate that global ocean models can successfully capture the large-scale circulation changes that drive OAM variability on seasonal and shorter time scales."
https://openalex.org/W2083771550,"Many cells express receptors for plasminogen (Pg), although the responsible molecules in most cases are poorly defined. In contrast, the group A streptococcal surface protein PAM contains a domain with two 13-amino acid residue long repeated sequences (a1 and a2) responsible for Pg binding. Here we identify the region in Pg that interacts with PAM. A radiolabeled proteolytic plasminogen fragment containing the first three kringles (K1–K3) interacted with streptococci expressing PAM or a chimeric surface protein harboring the a1a2 sequence. In contrast, plasminogen fragments containing kringle 4 or kringle 5 and the activable serine proteinase domain failed to bind to PAM-expressing group A streptococci. A synthetic and a recombinant polypeptide containing the a1a2 sequence both bound to immobilized recombinant K2 (rK2) but not to rK1 or rK3. The interaction between the a repeat region and rK2 was reversible, and rK2 completely blocked the binding of Pg to the a1a2 region. The binding of the a repeat containing polypeptide to K2 occurred with an equilibrium association constant of 4.5 × 107m−1, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, a value close to that (1.6 × 107m−1) calculated for the a1a2-Pg interaction. Inhibition experiments suggested involvement of the lysine-binding site of K2 in the interaction. These data demonstrate that K2 contains the major Pg-binding site for PAM, providing the first well defined example of an interaction between an internal Pg-binding region in a protein and a single kringle domain.

The origin and properties of the PAM-expressing group A streptococcal strain AP53 (21Berge A. Sjöbring U. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5693-5701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. JRS145(Arp) contains the shuttle plasmid pJRS264 (25Husmann L.K. Scott J.R. Lindahl G. Stenberg L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 345-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that encodes the IgA-binding group A streptococcal surface protein Arp4 (IgA-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein), whereas JRS145(Arp/a1a2) carries a derivative of pJRS264 in which the IgA binding encoding region of the arp4 gene (26Johnsson E. Andersson G. Lindahl G. Hedén L.-O. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3557-3564PubMed Google Scholar) has been replaced by the a repeat-encoding sequence of the pam gene (21Berge A. Sjöbring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Streptococci were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth at 37 °C for 16 h. Transformed Escherichia coli LE392 were grown in LB medium containing 100 mg L−1 of ampicillin. Pg was purified from human or rhesus plasma on lysine-agarose. Proteins bound to the agarose were eluted with 0.2 m 6-AHA. Fractions containing only Pg, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, were pooled and dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl, 0.03 mphosphate, pH 7.2 (PBS). The proteolytic fragments K1–K3, K4, and mini-plasminogen (m-Pg), which encompasses K5 and the serine proteinase domain, were obtained by partial cleavage of human Pg by elastase and purified as described (27Sottrup-Jensen L.

Construction, expression, and purification of rK1(SE[K1]D) has been previously described (12Menhart N. Sehl L.C. Kelley R. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1948-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as has the cloning and expression of rK2(E161TE163SEE[K2/C169G]T and rK3(TYQ[K3/C297S]DS) (13Marti D. Schaller J. Ochensberger B. Rickli E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). rK2 and rK3 were expressed with a NH2-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag to facilitate purification. The tag is followed by a recognition sequence for factor Xa allowing its removal after purification. For construction of the a1a2-protein L fusion protein (VEK32B1), a DNA fragment encoding a PAM sequence with six amino acids residues from the region preceding a1 and the combined a1a2 repeat sequence was generated by polymerase chain reaction using chromosomal DNA from AP53 streptococci as template and the synthetic oligonucleotides P1 (5′-GTTGAGAAGCTTACCGCTGATGCTGAGTTGCAACGACTTAAAAAC-3′) and P2 (5′-ATGATCATGTCTCTCGCTTTTTCTCTCGCTTTTAAGTCG-3′) as primers. Recognition sites for HpaII and NcoI were introduced by the primers for directional cloning. The resulting fragment was digested with HpaII and NcoI and ligated with the NarI- and NcoI-digested expression vector pHDB1. The inserted fragment was expressed as a periplasmic hybrid protein with the Ig-binding domain (B1) of peptostreptococcal protein L (28Kastern W. Sjöbring U. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a COOH-terminal fusion partner. Construction of the chimeric arp/a1a2 gene has been described (22Ringdahl U. Svensson M.

Synthesis of a 30-mer PAM peptide (VEK30, VEKLTADAELQRLKNERHEEAELERLKSEY) encompassing six amino acid residues from the region preceding a1, the 13-amino acid-long a1 region, ten residues from the a2 region, and an unrelated COOH-terminal tyrosine included for labeling purposes was performed as described previously (23Wistedt A.C. Ringdahl U. Müller-Esterl W. Sjöbring U. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Proteins and polypeptides were labeled to a specific activity of 1–5 mCi mg−1 with 125I using the Chloramine-T method. The function of radiolabeled K1–K3 and K4 was assessed by the capacity to bind to lysine-Sepharose, whereas the function of radiolabeled m-Pg was analyzed by its ability to bind to the group G streptococcal strain DG23 (29Ullberg M. Karlsson I. Wiman B. Kronvall G. APMIS. 1992; 100: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Binding of125I-labeled proteins to bacteria was measured in a total volume of 250 μl of PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Following incubation for 60 min at 20 °C, 2 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 was added, and the bacteria were centrifuged at 4000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the radioactivity associated with the pellet was measured in a γ counter. Proteins were applied to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a manifold. The membranes were blocked in PBS containing 0.25% gelatin and 0.25% Tween 20 (blocking buffer). Following incubation for 3 h at 20 °C with125I-labeled protein diluted in blocking buffer, the membranes were again washed with blocking buffer. The membranes were air-dried and autoradiographed for 48 h. For binding analysis in microtiter plates, wells were coated with 100 μl of the proteins, resuspended in PBS at various concentrations, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, 100 μl of blocking buffer was added, and the plates were again incubated overnight at 4 °C. On day 3 the plates were washed with blocking buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The ligand, for some experiments mixed with competitors at different concentrations, was added in a total volume of 150 μl in blocking buffer with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation at 20 °C for 4 h, the plates were washed four times in blocking buffer. Binding of rK2-His6to immobilized VEK, was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using alkaline phosphatase-labeled nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as a secondary probe, whereas for other binding experiments radiolabeled ligands were used, measuring the association of the radiolabeled proteins to the microtiter wells in a γ counter. Association and dissociation rate constants for the binding of VEK32B1 to Pg or Pg fragments were determined by surface plasmon resonance, using Biacore-X equipment (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) following the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Pg fragments were resuspended in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.0, and coupled to CM-5 sensor chips using amine coupling chemistry. The chips were regenerated using 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. Association and dissociation rates were measured at 25 °C with a continuous flow rate of 20 μl/min using PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 as buffer and with VEK32B1 at concentrations varying from 0.3 to 33 μm. Calculations of the association and dissociation rate constants were done using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software. To map the region in Pg (Fig. 1 A) mediating the interaction with PAM (Fig. 1 B), we first measured the ability of radiolabeled elastase-generated human Pg fragments to bind to three group A streptocccal strains expressing different M proteins: the PAM-expressing strain AP53, the strain JRS145(Arp) that expresses the IgA-binding protein Arp4, and the strain JRS145(Arp/a1a2) that expresses a chimeric surface protein in which a 36-amino acid-long sequence overlapping the IgA-binding site of Arp4 has been replaced with the combined a1a2 repeats of PAM. A fragment encompassing K1–K3 bound to the PAM-expressing group A streptococcal strain AP53, whereas fragments containing K4 alone or K5 and the proteinase domain (m-Pg) showed almost no binding to this strain (Fig. 2, A–C). Furthermore, radiolabeled K1–K3, but not K4 or m-Pg, bound to JRS145(Arp/a1a2) streptococci. In contrast, no binding of any of the fragments occurred to JRS145(Arp) bacteria. Next, a 30-mer synthetic polypeptide, VEK30, containing the a repeat region of PAM, was radiolabeled and used to probe the proteolytic Pg fragments immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Significant binding occurred to the immobilized K1–K3 fragment, whereas only very weak reactivity occurred with K4 (Fig. 2 D). No detectable interaction occurred with m-Pg. Similar results were obtained when probing the Pg fragments with the radiolabeled recombinant VEK32B1 hybrid protein that also contains the a repeat sequence (data not shown). Together, these data show that K1–K3 comprises the major PAM-reactive region of Pg. To further localize the domain in Pg interacting with the a repeats of PAM, recombinant fragments spanning the K1–K3 region were used. The fragments were immobilized in microtiter plates and were probed with125I-labeled VEK30 or 125I-labeled VEK32B1. Binding of both these PAM-derived polypeptides occurred to rK2, but not to rK1 or rK3 (Fig. 3, A and B). The interaction with rK2 was reversible, as judged by experiments in which different concentrations of unlabeled VEK30 were allowed to compete with 125I-labeled VEK30 for the binding to immobilized rK2 (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, binding of soluble rK2-His6 to immobilized VEK30 could be detected in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments (Fig. 3 C). A role for K2 in the binding of Pg to PAM was further established by the demonstration that rK2 completely blocked the binding of 125I-labeled Pg to immobilized VEK30 (Fig. 4 B). In fact, parallel inhibition curves were obtained when using various concentrations of unlabeled rK2 or of the entire Pg molecule as competitors. Moreover, equimolar concentrations of Pg and K2 were required to block the binding to VEK30, suggesting a similar affinity for the ligand.Figure 4Inhibition experiments. In Aand C, the binding of 125I-labeled VEK30 to rK2 (■) and for C also to K1–K3 (○) was measured in the presence of different concentrations of unlabeled VEK30 (A) or 6-AHA (C). In B, binding of125I-labeled Pg to immobilized VEK30 was measured in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled Pg, rK2, or human serum albumin. The data are representative of three experiments with duplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To compare the strength of the interactions, the binding of VEK32B1 to the recombinant kringles or to Pg was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. Expectedly, VEK32B1 interacted with K2 but showed no affinity for rK1 or rK3. The equilibrium constant for the VEK32B1-rK2 interaction was determined to be 4.5 × 107m−1. This value compares reasonably well with the affinity constant calculated for the VEK32B1-Pg interaction (1.6 × 107m−1) using surface plasmon resonance (Table I) and is also consistent with the value (4.0 × 107m−1) calculated from Scatchard analysis of competitive binding experiments in which 125I-labeled VEK30 and unlabeled VEK30 were allowed to compete for the binding to immobilized Pg (data not shown).Table IQuantitative analysis of the interactions between VEK32B1 and immobilized plasminogen or plasminogen fragmentsAssociation rate constantDissociation rate constantEquilibrium association constantEquilibrium dissociation constantmssmmrK1No bindingrK29.74 × 1042.17 × 10−34.5 × 1072.2 × 10−7rK3No bindingPlasminogen4.34 × 1042.66 × 10−31.6 × 1076.1 × 10−8Association and dissociation rate constants were obtained by surface plasmon resonance analysis with the analyte (VEK32B1) at different concentrations (0.3–33 μm).

Nevertheless, involvement of the lysine-binding site of K2 in the interaction with the a1a2 repeat region was suggested by the demonstration that 6-AHA completely inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled VEK30 to rK2 (Fig. 4 C). Results from experiments with rhesus Pg support this suggestion. Thus, K2 in rhesus Pg differs from its human counterpart only in two positions (Fig. 5 D and Refs. 30Forsgren M. Råden B. Israelsson M. Larsson K. Hedén L.-O. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar and 31Tomlinson J.E. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5957-5965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are immediately adjacent to conserved negatively charged amino acid residues involved in the 6-AHA contacts with K1 and K4 (9Motta A Laursen R.A.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1948-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As opposed to human Pg, plasminogen from rhesus showed little binding to group A streptococci expressing PAM or the Arp/a1a2 chimeric protein (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, 125I-labeled VEK30 failed to bind purified rhesus Pg (Fig. 5 B) and also failed to inhibit the interaction between 125I-labeled human Pg and VEK30 (Fig. 5 C). Because human K2 obviously plays an crucial role for the Pg interaction with PAM, it appears that amino acid differences in the immediate vicinity of the negatively charged center of the lysine binding site has a significant effect upon this interaction. The present investigation clearly shows that K2 mediates high affinity binding of Pg to the streptococcal surface protein PAM. In fact, K2 and Pg interact equally well with the major Pg-binding site of PAM as judged both by inhibition experiments and by direct binding experiments. The lower values obtained for the interactions between VEK30/VEK32B1 and rK2 or Pg as compared with the values previously reported for the interactions between Pg and recombinant PAM (8 × 108m−1; Ref. 21Berge A. Sjöbring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the purified Arp/a1a2 chimeric molecule (6 × 108m−1; Ref. 22Ringdahl U. Svensson M. Wistedt A.C.

Thus, several of the binding functions of streptococcal M proteins, including their IgG and fibrinogen binding capacity is highly dependent upon maintenance of the α-helical coiled-coil structure normally adopted by these proteins (32Cedervall T. Johansson M.U. Åkerström B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4987-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Nilson B.H.K. Frick I.-M. Åkesson P. Forsén S. Björck L. Åkerström B. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13688-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that this is also true for the plasminogen binding property of PAM. 2T. Cedervall, personal communication. To our knowledge the Pg-PAM interaction is the first example of an interaction between a kringle domain and an internal protein sequence to be characterized. Further analysis of the system by biophysical methods, such as NMR or crystallography, should therefore provide information on the structural requirements for interactions between kringles and pseudolysine-containing target sequences in ligands lacking carboxyl-terminal lysines such as plasminogen itself (34Mangel W.F. Lin B.H. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 1990; 248: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), basement-membrane (type IV) collagen (35Stack M.S. Moser T.L. Pizzo S., V. Biochem.

In addition, the observations could suggest a role for K2 in interactions with receptors on other cell types. Thus, because Pg binding by PAM is mediated by an internal sequence, the possibility that such sequences also contribute to Pg binding by human cells should be considered. The existence of internal Pg-reactive sequences in human cell surface proteins is supported by the finding that treatment of such cells with carboxypeptidase B, thereby removing COOH-terminal lysines, only partially reduced Pg binding (38Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Kata K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because K2 only binds weakly to lysine itself, interactions with unphysiologically exposed lysines during culturing or preparation of cells should be minimal, facilitating the evaluation of results obtained in binding studies."
https://openalex.org/W2011184185,"Microcystin-affinity chromatography was used to purify 15 protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-binding proteins from the myofibrillar fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle. To reduce the time and amount of material required to identify these proteins, proteome analysis by mixed peptide sequencing was developed. Proteins are resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and stained. Bands are sliced from the membrane, cleaved briefly with CnBr, and applied without further purification to an automated Edman sequencer. The mixed peptide sequences generated are sorted and matched against the GenBank using two new programs, FASTF and TFASTF. This technology offers a simple alternative to mass spectrometry for the subpicomolar identification of proteins in polyacrylamide gels. Using this technology, all 15 proteins recovered in PP-1C affinity chromatography were sequenced. One of the proteins, PP-1bp55, was homologous to human myosin phosphatase, MYPT2. A second, PP-1bp80, identified in the EST data bases, contained a putative PP-1C binding site and a nucleotide binding motif. Further affinity purification over ATP-Sepharose isolated PP-1bp80 in a quaternary complex with PP-1C and two other proteins, PP-1bp29 and human p20. Recombinant PP-1bp80 also bound PP-1C and suppressed its activity toward a variety of substrates, suggesting that the protein is a novel regulatory subunit of PP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2006888214,"Abstract The role of β-arrestin 1 (β-arr1) in regulation of responsiveness of κ, δ, and μ opioid receptors has been investigated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells cotransfected with opioid receptor and β-arr1. Expression of human β-arr1 attenuated κ and δ opioid receptor subtype-mediated inhibition of cAMP production and resulted in a 100-fold increase of EC50 values for κ-agonist U69593 and δ-agonist [d-Pen2,d-Pen5]enkephalin and 30–40% reduction of their maximal responses. In contrast, coexpression of β-arr1 with μ opioid receptor did not affect the concentration-effect relationship of μ-agonist [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin. In parallel, κ and δ receptor-mediated G protein activation was also remarkably attenuated by overexpression of β-arr1, while the μ-agonist-stimulated response remained intact. These results indicate that β-arr1 interferes receptor/G protein coupling and differentially regulates the responsiveness of opioid receptors. Truncation of κ and δ opioid receptors at carboxyl termini abolished inhibition of β-arr1 on the responsiveness of both receptors. Furthermore, μ opioid receptor became sensitive to β-arr1 regulation following replacement of its carboxyl terminus with the corresponding portion of the δ receptor. Removal of potential phosphorylation sites on the carboxyl terminus of κ opioid receptor led to reduced effect of β-arr1 on the receptor-mediated response. These results suggest that receptor carboxyl terminus and its phosphorylation play an important role in the interaction of β-arr1 and opioid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2062426253,"We have previously shown that the rat follitropin receptor (rFSHR) expressed in transfected cells becomes phosphorylated upon stimulation of the cells with agonist or a phorbol ester. Peptide mapping and mutagenesis studies have also shown that the agonist- or phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of the rFSHR maps to Ser/Thr residues present in the first and third intracellular loops. The experiments presented herein were initially designed to test for the presence of additional phosphorylation sites on the second intracellular loop of the rFSHR. Analysis of two new mutants in which the two threonines in the second intracellular loop (rFSHR-2L) or the two threonines in the second intracellular loop and the seven Ser/Thr residues in the third intracellular loop (rFSHR-2L + 3L) were mutated showed that one or more of the two threonines in the second intracellular loop are phosphorylated in response to phorbol ester, but not in response to agonist stimulation. Since rFSHR-2L and rFSHR-2L + 3L displayed a reduction in agonist-induced signaling, two additional mutants (rFSHR-D389N and rFSHR-Y530F) were constructed in an attempt to better understand the relationship between the agonist-induced activation, phosphorylation, and internalization of the rFSHR. These point mutations impaired agonist-stimulated signal transduction and abolished agonist-induced phosphorylation. Co-transfection studies revealed that the phosphorylation of these mutants can be rescued by overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, but this increased phosphorylation only rescues the internalization of rFSHR-D389N. The internalization of both mutants could be rescued by overexpression of arrestin-3, however. Taken together, these results argue that the agonist-induced activation and phosphorylation of the rFSHR are not essential for internalization. while the interaction of the rFSHR with a nonvisual arrestin is essential for internalization."

Small GTPases of the Ras family are involved in the growth control of various cell types. They switch from a GDP-loaded, inactive state to a GTP-bound, active state. This switch is controlled by the action of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 and GTPase-activating proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Constitutively active Ras is a very potent oncogene, and Ras is frequently found to be mutated in many human cancers. The closely related GTPase Rap1 was originally discovered as a transformation suppressor of Ki-Ras (Krev-1 (2Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar)). It shares about 50% homology to Ras and has a similar effector domain. Rap1 can bind Ras effectors but does not activate them, leading to the model that Rap1 is antagonizing Ras function by trapping Ras effectors in an inactive state (1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA activates Rap1 by phosphorylation on Ser-179 (3Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N. Ostrowski M.C.

Based on the knowledge about GTPase effector molecules, activation-specific probes for Ras and Rap have recently been developed (12Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol.

This allows determination of the activity of endogenous Ras and Rap1 without radioactive in vivo labeling. Bombesin belongs to a group of mitogenic neuropeptides (16Rozengurt E. Cancer Surv. 1995; 24: 81-96PubMed Google Scholar). It has been described as an autocrine growth factor in human small cell lung cancer (Ref. 17Cuttitta F. Carney D.N. Mulshine J. Moody T.W. Fedorko J. Fischler A. Minna J.D. Nature. 1985; 316: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 18Sethi, T., Langdon, S., Smyth, J., and Rozengurt, E. (1992)Cancer Res. 52, (suppl.) 2737–2742Google Scholar). Bombesin is a tetradecapeptide and binds to Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors. In 3T3 cells, which were often used as a model system, it induces DNA synthesis and proliferation (16Rozengurt E. Cancer Surv. 1995; 24: 81-96PubMed Google Scholar). Different signal transduction pathways have been suggested to mediate bombesin effects (18Sethi, T., Langdon, S., Smyth, J., and Rozengurt, E. (1992)Cancer Res. 52, (suppl.) 2737–2742Google Scholar, 19Seufferlein T. Withers D.J. Mann D. Rozengurt E. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the role of small GTPases is unclear (21Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mitchell F.M. Heasley L.E. Qian N.X. Zamarripa J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8623-8628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to analyze whether bombesin can promote GTP loading of Ras and Rap1. Following treatment of NIH3T3 cells with bombesin, TPA, or the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate, activation of endogenous Rap1 was detected, whereas Ras activity was not significantly increased. We did not observe an activation of c-Raf-1 or B-Raf by bombesin. A variety of other stimuli, as well as cell adhesion after replating, were also found to activate Rap1. Conversely, the basal Rap1 activity was down-regulated when cells were grown at high density, possibly implicating Rap1 in contact inhibition and quiescence. Materials were obtained from Sigma except for PDGF-BB (Life Technologies, Inc.), poly-d-lysine (Boehringer Mannheim), and TPA (Calbiochem). NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS, seeded at 7 × 106/15-cm plate and starved for 20–24 h with 0.5% FCS prior to stimulation. Adhesion experiments were performed as described by Vuori et al. (24Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were starved, trypsinized, and treated with trypsin inhibitor. After washing with Dulbecco‘s modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, cells were held in suspension for 40 min and then allowed to adhere for 45 min after replating on tissue culture dishes (Sarstedt) coated as indicated or further kept in suspension for 20 min. Activation assays for Rap1 and Ras were performed as recently described in detail (13Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 15Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with chilled HEPES-buffered saline (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and lysed in Mg2+-containing lysis buffer (MLB; 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). After lysis for 15 min and clarification at 16,000 × g for 20 min, the protein concentrations of the lysates were determined. Approximately 400 μg of total cell lysate was immediately subjected to precipitation. GTP-loaded Rap1 and Ras were affinity-precipitated for 1 h using 20 μg of recombinant GST-RalGDS-RBD (15Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) or GST-c-Raf-1 RBD (1–149) (13Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) fusion proteins, respectively, which had been freshly coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The precipitates were washed three times with MLB, separated by 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies against Rap1 or pan-Ras (both from Transduction Laboratories). Following the indicated stimuli, cells were lysed in MLB, and lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose beads (Boehringer Mannheim). 4 and 2 mg of total protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with isoform-specific B-Raf and c-Raf-1 antisera for 2 h, respectively (8Wixler V. Smola U. Schuler M. Rapp U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, coupled kinase assays with recombinant His-MEK, GST-Erk, and myelin basic protein as the final substrate were performed as described previously (8Wixler V. Smola U. Schuler M. Rapp U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Erk activation was determined with a phospho-specific Erk antibody (New England Biolabs) and compared with the Erk 1/2 immunoreactive bands (Santa Cruz Inc.). Using recently developed nonradioactive GTPase activation assays (12Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 13Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr.

Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), we tested whether the neuropeptide growth factor bombesin can activate endogenous Rap1 or Ras in NIH3T3 cells. Rap1 was rapidly activated, peaking at 3 min but maintained for more than 90 min (Fig. 1 A). A concentration of 6 nm was found to be sufficient for Rap1 activation. In contrast, Ras is not significantly activated above basal levels by bombesin (Fig. 1 B). This is in agreement with previous findings on endogenous Ras by Mitchell and co-workers (22Mitchell F.M. Heasley L.E. Qian N.X. Zamarripa J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8623-8628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), although others have reported reduced bombesin-mediated DNA synthesis following microinjection of neutralizing anti-Ras antibodies (21Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because many pathways induced by growth-promoting agents seem to converge at small GTPases (1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), other stimuli were also tested. Treatment with the tyrosine-phosphatase inhibitor vanadate as well as the protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester TPA led to activation of Rap1. No significant Ras activation was observed in NIH3T3 cells following these stimuli, although vanadate resulted in a mobility shift of the Ras signal (Fig. 2 A), probably due to hyperphosphorylation. In contrast, COS-7 cells showed a strong TPA-induced Ras activation but no Rap1 activation (Ref. 23Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar and data not shown). Therefore the mechanisms of Ras and Rap1 activation can vary greatly in different cell types. Another putative activator of Rap1, the nonhydrolyzable 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP) in combination with the phosphodiesterase-inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine activated Rap1 in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 B), similar to the recent findings in PC12 cells (9Vossler M.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, Rap1 was also stimulated by PDGF, FCS, and LPA (Fig. 2 B). Disruption of the cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D did not inhibit the bombesin-mediated Rap1 activation, indicating that an intact F-actin network is not always a prerequisite for bombesin-signaling (20Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several pathways appear to lead from receptors to Rap1 activation, and detailed analysis of these pathways remains to be done. Induction of proliferation by bombesin is accompanied by increased MAPK activity (19Seufferlein T. Withers D.J. Mann D. Rozengurt E. Mol. Biol.

To analyze possible links between Rap1 activation and the MAPK pathway, the activity of endogenous Raf kinases was determined. In contrast to recent findings in PC12 cells (10York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), we did not observe increased B-Raf activity after treatment with bombesin or LPA (Fig. 3 A), whereas an approximately 3-fold activation of both c- and B-Raf after FCS/TPA treatment was found. Bombesin and LPA also failed to increase c-Raf-1 kinase activity, supporting earlier studies (22Mitchell F.M. Heasley L.E. Qian N.X. Zamarripa J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8623-8628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, using an anti-phospho-Erk antibody, Erk activation (Fig. 3 B) and induction of cell growth and proliferation were observed after bombesin treatment (data not shown). Thus, in NIH3T3 cells stimulated with bombesin, effectors other than c- and B-Raf mediate Erk activation, as previously proposed (5Reuter C.W. Catling A.D. Jelinek T. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7644-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At present, the only known GEF acting on Rap1 is C3G (Crk SH3-binding GEF) (1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because C3G is recruited to signal transduction complexes when cells adhere after replating on certain substrates (24Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether Rap1 is activated during adhesion. With NIH3T3 cells kept in suspension, a low basal Rap1 activity was seen. Rap1 was considerably activated when cells were replated on fibronectin-coated, poly-d-lysine-coated or uncoated tissue culture plates (Fig. 4). Additionally, the basal Ras activity decreased when cells were allowed to adhere. These results suggest that the Rap1 activation can be independent of engagement of β1-integrins (i.e. the fibronectin-receptors). Other cell adhesion phenomena probably result also in the observed Rap1 activation and Ras inactivation. Moreover, this opposite behavior fits into the previous hypothesis of an Ras/Rap antagonism (2Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 3Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N. Ostrowski M.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which is further supported by the absence of Rap1 activity in the stably transfected Ha-Ras V12 cells (Fig. 2 A). The modulation of GTPase activity during adhesion was not dependent on cell spreading, because treatment with cytochalasin D, which inhibits spreading after replating, did not influence the activation of the small GTPases tested (data not shown). In the course of the experiments, a striking influence of cell density on the basal Rap1 activity was noticed. Analysis of identical amounts of protein from NIH3T3 cells seeded at increasing density indeed showed a strong effect of cell number on Rap1 inactivation (Fig. 5 A). This effect was also observed with COS-7 cells (data not shown). Importantly, the cells seeded with 4 × 106 had reached confluency when harvested, raising the possibility that Rap1 inactivation is involved in mediating contact inhibition and induction of quiescence. These are typical features of 3T3 cell lines and are lost in transformed cells and tumor tissue. A slight decrease of the basal Erk activity was also observable when cell density increased (Fig. 5 B). In summary, we have shown that endogenous Rap1 is activated by various mitogens and mediates signals from receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and so far unidentified receptors sensing adhesion or cell density. Depending on the stimuli, a differential activation of Rap1 and Ras could be observed, suggesting that in some cases, for instance after bombesin stimulation, Rap1 rather than Ras may promote growth. Indeed, it was described previously that Rap1, as well as its activator PKA, can act as an inducer of proliferation in certain 3T3 cell lines (4Faure M. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Yoshida Y. Kawata M. Miura Y. Musha T. Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Mol. Cell.

In agreement with our results, other groups also found a Rap1 activation after endothelin stimulation, another neuropeptide growth factor that signals through Gq-coupled receptors. 2F. Zwartkruis and J. L. Bos, personal communication. There is growing evidence for a signaling pathway from PKA (11Yao H. York R.D. Misra-Press A. Carr D.W. Stork P.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) through Rap1 to B-Raf, resulting in sustained Erk activation and finally differentiation of PC12 cells (6Erhardt P. Troppmair J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). It was therefore tempting to speculate that B-Raf is an important activator of the MAPK pathway in bombesin-stimulated NIH3T3 cells. Although we could show that NIH3T3 cells contain at least some p94B-Raf, both B-Raf and c-Raf-1 were not activated following treatment with bombesin or LPA (Fig. 3).2 This demonstrates that the activation of B-Raf is not a general response to GTP loading of endogenous Rap1. There may be other Rap1 effectors and Erk activators that are critical in NIH3T3 cells (1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Reuter C.W.

During transduction of the visual signal in vertebrate photoreceptor rod and cone cells, the activated G protein (transducin) α subunit stimulates PDE catalytic activity by relieving the inhibitory constraint imposed by two identical inhibitory Pγ subunits. A recently adopted classification of cyclic nucleotide PDEs recognizes seven different families based on primary sequence and regulation (4Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). PDEs within each of the families have 60% or more homology while similarities between different families are 40% or less. According to this nomenclature, photoreceptor rod and cone PDEs comprise the PDE6 family (4Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Rod photoreceptor PDE is composed of two large homologous catalytic α and β subunits of nearly identical size (molecular masses of 99.2 and 98.3 kDa) and two copies of an inhibitory γ subunit (molecular mass 9.7 kDa) (5Baehr W.

An inhibitory cone Pγ subunit that is highly homologous to rod Pγ and specific for a subset of cone photoreceptors has been identified (12Hamilton S.E. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

The photoreceptor PDEs contain two noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites located N-terminally to the conserved PDE catalytic domain (11Lipkin V.M. Khramtsov N.V. Vasilevskaya I.A. Atabekova N.V.

Originally identified in frog rod PDE (14Yamazaki A. Sen I. Bitensky M.W. Casnellie J. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites were later shown for bovine rod and cone PDEs (9Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

Despite a similar binding stoichiometry (∼0.9 mol of cGMP/mol of subunit), the affinities for cGMP binding by bovine cone and rod PDEs are different. Cone PDE binds cGMP with K d = 10 nm, and rod PDE binds cGMP with even higher affinity (9Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

Noncatalytic cGMP binding by photoreceptor PDEs may play an important role in phototransduction and light adaptation. Yamazaki et al. (18Yamazaki A. Bartucca F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown that activated PDE in frog rods has reduced affinity for cGMP at the noncatalytic sites, and addition of Pγ stimulates cGMP binding. Conversely, occupation of the cGMP-binding sites may affect the Pγ affinity for PDE catalytic subunits (19Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An in depth investigation of the structure and function of photoreceptor PDEs in general, and the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites in particular, requires the development of an effective system for functional expression of PDE6. Functional expression of rod PDE6α and PDE6β was reported in human kidney cells (20Piriev N.I. Yamashita C. Samuel G. Farber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the yields and activity of recombinant PDE6 in both expression systems were very low, perhaps explaining the lack of subsequent systematic studies on recombinant PDE6. A recent study has demonstrated high yield functional expression of PDE5 in the baculovirus system (22Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

In this study, we report the efficient functional expression of PDE6α′/PDE5 chimeric enzyme and mutational analysis of PDE6α′ noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites. cGMP was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. [H3]cGMP (8.5 Ci/mmol) was a product of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. 3-(Bromoacetyl)-7-diethylaminocoumarin (BC) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Worthington. Zaprinast and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Bovine rod outer segment (ROS) membranes were prepared by the method of Papermaster and Dreyer (23Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J.

Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical yield of purified PDE6α′ from 400 bovine retinas was ∼100 μg. Purified PDE6α′ was kept in 40% glycerol at −20 °C. Trypsin-treated PDE6α′ (tPDE6α′) was prepared similarly as described for rod PDE6αβ (6Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol.

The Pγ mutant Pγ-1–83Cys (Cys68 → Ser, and the last 4 C-terminal residues, Tyr-Gly-Ile-Ile, replaced with a single cysteine) was obtained as described in Artemyev et al.(25Artemyev N.O. Natochin M.

A vector containing bovine PDE6α′ cDNA (pBlueScriptPDE6α′) was provided by Dr. M. Applebury (Harvard University) (10Li T. Volpp K. Applebury M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Originally, vectors for PDE6α′ and four PDE6α′/PDE5 chimeric PDEs were constructed for expression using the BacPAK baculovirus expression system (CLONTECH): Chi1, PDE5–1-509/PDE6α′441–855; Chi2, PDE5–1-566/PDE6α′522–855; Chi3, PDE6α′1–522/PDE5–567-863; and Chi4, PDE6α′1–440/PDE5–510-863. The pBacPAK9-PDE6α′ construct was obtained with ligation of the SmaI/XhoI fragment of pBlueScript PDE6α′ into similarly digested pBacPak9 (CLONTECH) and used as a template for polymerase chain reaction amplification. Appropriate polymerase chain reaction fragments were amplified using primers containing chosen restriction sites. After digestion with restriction enzymes (Chi1, BalI,PacI; Chi2, BspEI, PacI; Chi3,BamHI, BspEI; and Chi4, BamHI,BalI) the fragments were ligated into the pBacPak9PDE5 (22Turko I.V. Haik T.L.

However, due to persistent irregularities in shipments of the BacPAK6 viral DNA (Bsu36I digest) required for production of a recombinant virus, PDE6α′, PDE5 and the chimeric PDEs were subcloned into the pFastBacHTb vector for expression as His6-tagged proteins using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA coding for PDE6α′ was isolated after digestion of pBlueScriptPDE6α′ with SalI and partial digestion with NcoI, and then ligated into theSalI/NcoI-digested vector pFastBacHTb (Life Technologies, Inc.) to produce the pFastBacHTbPDE6α′ vector for expression of PDE6α′.

To obtain pFastBacHTbChi1 and pFastBacHTbChi2, the pBacPak9Chi1 and pBacPak9Chi2 were cut with NaeI and SalI and ligated into pFastBacHTb digested withStuI and XhoI. As a result of this subcloning, Chi1 and Chi2 lacked 3 N-terminal amino acid residues from the PDE5 sequence. The NcoI (partial)/ScaI digested pBacPak9Chi3 and pBacPak9Chi4 were ligated into pFastBacHTb cut withNcoI and StuI to yield pFastBacHTbChi3 and pFastBacHTbChi4, respectively. The sequences of all chimeric proteins were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA core facility. Viral amplifications were carried out using Sf21 cells. The High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were used for protein expression. Generation of the recombinant bacmids, transfection of Sf21 and High Five cells, viral amplifications and infections of insect cells for protein expression were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc.). Site-directed mutagenesis of Chi4 was performed using QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene). Pairs of complementary oligonucleotides coding for substitutions of PDE6α′ Asn193 → Ala and PDE6α′ Asn402 → Ala were synthesized. The pFastHTbChi4 plasmid was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase. The polymerase chain reaction products were treated with DpnI specific for methylated and hemymethylated DNA and then transformed into E. coli DH5α. The sequences of mutants were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. High Five cells were harvested at 60 h after infection, washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 50 mm NaCl, and then resuspended in the same buffer containing 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 30-s pulse sonication for a total time of 3 min using a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) the supernatant (100,000 × g, 45 min) was loaded onto Ni2+resin (Novagen) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm imidazole. The resin was washed with the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted with the buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to the eluate. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 40% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The cGMP binding assay was performed in a total volume of 100 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 pmol of PDE, [H3]cGMP (50,000 cpm), and varying concentrations of unlabeled cGMP. The binding reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then applied onto 0.45-μm MultiScreen HATF filters (Millipore). The filters were washed with 250 μl of 10 mm K2HPO4 (pH 6.8) containing 1 mm EDTA, dried, and punched into the scintillation vials using Multiple Punch assembly (Millipore). No cGMP hydrolysis was detected under the conditions of the cGMP binding assay. The SspI fragment of pGEX-KG (27Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) containing a glutathioneS-transferase protein and polylinker was ligated into pET-11a (Novagen) digested with BamHI and NdeI (treated with mung bean nuclease). The resulting vector was used for subcloning of the NcoI (partial)-XhoI fragment of pBlueScriptPDE6α′, containing the coding region for PDE6α′ to produce pET-11a-glutathione S-transferase-PDE6α′. The PDE6α′ polypeptide was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in E. coli similarly as described in Natochin and Artemyev (28Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase-PDE6α′ was found mainly in inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 m urea. The fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin after removal of urea (28Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The band corresponding to PDE6α′ was cut from the SDS-gels, and the gel slices were used to immunize sheep to obtain a specific polyclonal antiserum against PDE6α′. Immunizations were carried out by Elmira Biologicals (Iowa City). PDE activity was measured using [3H]cGMP as described previously (29Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Less than 15% of cGMP was hydrolyzed during these reactions. Fluorescent assays were performed on an F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi) as described previously (28Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to Pγ residues 24–45 and 63–87 were synthesized and purified as described in Natochin and Artemyev (28Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using IgG as a standard or using calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in 10–12% acrylamide gels. For Western immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.1 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) and analyzed using a sheep anti-PDE6α′ antiserum with a 1:3000 dilution and a rabbit anti-PDE5 antiserum with a 1:2000 dilution (26McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30671-30679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using anti-goat/sheep or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fitting of the experimental data was performed with nonlinear least squares criteria using GraphPad Prizm Software (30Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The K i, K d, and IC50 values are expressed as mean ± S.E. for three independent measurements. The native PDE6α′ is known to form a catalytic homodimer, so it was thought that the baculovirus-expressed protein might be more stable and active than would the rod PDE6α and β co-expressed in the same system (21Qin N. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical total yield for recombinant PDE6α′ was ∼3 mg/100 ml of culture, but only 10–15% of this was soluble. Soluble PDE6α′ purified using affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin showed no cGMP hydrolytic activity, as well as no detectable binding of cGMP to the noncatalytic sites (not shown). PDE5 is similar to PDE6α′ with respect to formation of a homodimer, and the PDE5 has been successfully expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system (22Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22240-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In an attempt to achieve functional expression, four chimeric PDEs between PDE6α′ and PDE5 have been constructed (Fig. 1 A). Total yields for the chimeric PDEs and PDE5 were comparable, 3–5 mg/100 ml of culture. The solubility of chimeras (20–40%) was notably better than the solubility of recombinant PDE6α′, but somewhat lower than that of PDE5 (∼50%). Western blot analysis showed that polyclonal anti-PDE6α′ and anti-PDE5 antisera did not cross-react with PDE5 and PDE6α′, respectively. Both antisera, however, recognized all of the chimeric PDEs (Fig. 1 B). All recombinant PDEs were tested for PDE activity and noncatalytic cGMP binding. Chi1, Chi2, and Chi3 were catalytically inactive. PDE5 and Chi4 were fully functional. PDE5 and Chi4 had a specific activity of 9–10 mol of cGMP·mol PDE−1·s−1, which was similar to that of native purified PDE5 reported earlier (34Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chi4 hydrolyzed cGMP with aK m value of 1.5 μm, which is comparable to the K m value of 3.0 μmfor recombinant PDE5 (Fig. 2 A) and a K m value of 5.6 μm for purified native PDE5 (34Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zaprinast, a specific competitive inhibitor of PDE5 and PDE6, inhibited cGMP hydrolysis by Chi4 with an IC50value of 0.65 μm. A similar IC50 value (0.75 μm) was seen for inhibition of recombinant PDE5 by zaprinast (Fig. 2 B) and has been obtained previously for native PDE5 (0.3–0.8 μm) (22Turko I.V. Haik T.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both PDE5 and Chi4 migrated on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column as catalytic dimers with apparent molecular mass ∼180 kDa (not shown). Overall, the catalytic properties of Chi4 were practically indistinguishable from those of recombinant or native PDE5. A recent study has suggested that PDE5 may have a protein modulator(s) with homology to the polycationic region of Pγ, Pγ-24–45 (35Lochhead A. Nekrasova E. Arshavsky V.Y. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18397-18403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have tested the possibility that Pγ interacts with PDE5 or Chi4. First, we determined whether recombinant PDE5 or Chi4 preparations might contain bound Pγ-like proteins using limited proteolysis with trypsin. Limited proteolysis of native PDE6 with trypsin removes Pγ and activates the enzyme (6Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that limited trypsinization of PDE5 or Chi4 does not alter their electrophoretic mobility or catalytic properties. In addition, results of cGMP binding experiments and fluorescence binding assays using Pγ83BC were not affected as well (not shown), suggesting that there is no Pγ-like protein modulator bound to PDE5 or Chi4 expressed in High Five cells. Pγ efficiently inhibited PDE6α′(K i 0.17 nm). However, it had no effect on the catalytic activity of Chi4 (Fig. 3 A) and PDE5 (not shown) even at an inhibitor concentration as high as 5 μm. The peptide, Pγ-24–45, did not affect the activity of any of the tested enzymes, PDE6α′, PDE5, or Chi4 (not shown). Recently, we have developed a novel assay that uses a fluorescent signal to report binding of the Pγ C terminus to rod PDE6αβ (30Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The assay utilizes a Pγ mutant, Pγ83Cys labeled with the fluorescent probe BC at the cysteine residue (Pγ83BC). HoloPDE6α′ was trypsinized (tPDE6α′) to remove intrinsic inhibitory Pγ subunits. Using this fluorescence assay, addition of tPDE6α′ to Pγ83BC resulted in an ∼8-fold maximal fluorescence increase of Pγ83BC fluorescence with a K d value of 40 nm (Fig. 3 B), which was readily reversible by subsequent addition of excess Pγ (not shown). On the contrary, PDE5 and Chi4 at concentrations up to 100 nm failed to change Pγ83BC fluorescence (not shown). These results support lack of Pγ binding to these PDEs. Analysis of noncatalytic cGMP binding by chimeric PDEs revealed that, under the conditions of the assay, Chi1 and Chi2 did not bind cGMP (not shown). Even though a detectable noncatalytic cGMP binding was observed for Chi3 (not shown), the stoichiometry was very low (<0.1 mol of cGMP/subunit). Chi3 was not analyzed further considering the low stoichiometry of cGMP binding and a lack of the catalytic activity. Chi4 was fully competent to bind cGMP at the noncatalytic binding sites. The cGMP-binding curve exhibited a single class of binding sites with a K d value of 0.45 μm and a binding stoichiometry of 0.9 mol of cGMP/subunit (Fig. 4 A). Because Chi4 contains noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites from the bovine PDE6α′, we have compared noncatalytic cGMP binding by Chi4 to that of PDE6α′ purified from bovine retinas. Preparation of tPDE6α′ bound approximately 0.3 mol of cGMP/subunit with a K d of 2.1 μm. Addition of Pγ to the assay led to a substantial increase in the affinity (K d 0.38 μm) and the stoichiometry (0.9 mol/subunit) of cGMP binding (Fig. 4 B). The latter increase is likely a result of an incomplete saturation of cGMP binding in the absence of Pγ rather than of an emergence of additional cGMP-binding sites. Affinity of noncatalytic cGMP binding by Chi4 was greater than that for tPDE6α′ but lower than that for tPDE6α′ reconstituted with Pγ. Predictably, Pγ had no effect on cGMP binding of Chi4 (Fig. 4 A). We further examined effects of Pγ on cGMP binding of PDE6α′ by utilizing two synthetic peptides, Pγ-24–45 and Pγ-63–87, corresponding to the major Pγ sites of interaction with PDE6 catalytic subunits (36Lipkin B.M. Dumler I.L. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Etingof R.N. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 38Brown R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5918-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Takemoto D.J. Hurt D. Oppert B. Cunnick J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Pγ-24–45 potently stimulated cGMP binding by tPDE6α′(K d 0.96 μm), whereas the Pγ C-terminal peptide, Pγ-63–87 critical for inhibition of PDE activity was ineffective (Fig. 4 B). Together, peptides Pγ-24–45 and Pγ-63–87 elicited a weak synergistic effect on the noncatalytic cGMP binding (K d 0.71 μm) (Fig. 4 B). In addition, the noncatalytic cGMP binding to PDE6α′ might be affected by the enzyme association with ROS membranes. Chi4 contains the PDE5 C-terminal domain and lacks a consensus sequence for isoprenylation required for attachment of PDE6 to membranes (3Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Qin N. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have not analyzed effects of ROS membranes on noncatalytic cGMP binding in this study. Functional analysis of Chi4 suggested that this enzyme represents an appropriate target for the mutational analysis of the PDE6α′ noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites. The conserved Asn residues Asn193 and Asn402 from the two putative noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites were replaced by Ala residues. Both Chi4 mutants were expressed as soluble proteins in High Five cells, although their yields were lower (∼1–2 mg/100 ml of culture) than those for Chi4. The Chi4 Asn193 → Ala and Chi4 Asn402 → Ala mutants hydrolyzed cGMP withK m values of 1.5 and 13 μm and V max values of 9.6 and 9.2 mol cGMP·mol PDE−1·s−1, respectively (Fig. 5 A). Zaprinast competitively inhibited catalytic activity of Chi4 Asn193 → Ala and Chi4 Asn402 → Ala with IC50 values of 0.5 and 1.7 μm, respectively (Fig. 5 B). Surprisingly, both Chi4 mutants exhibited no noncatalytic cGMP binding (not shown). Rod and cone cGMP-phosphodiesterases (PDE6) serve as key effector enzymes in the visual transduction cascade of vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Progress in understanding the structure and function of PDE6 has been hindered by difficulties in developing an efficient functional expression system for PDE6 that allows mutational analysis of the enzyme (20Piriev N.I. Yamashita C. Samuel G. Farber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9340-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Qin N. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PDE6 enzymes share several important characteristics with PDE5, including a common general domain organization, a high homology (45–48% identity) between their catalytic domains, a strong specificity for cGMP relative to cAMP, and sensitivity to the PDE inhibitors zaprinast and dipyridamole (17McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 773-781PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of fully functional PDE5 has been recently reported using the baculovirus system (22Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22240-22244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our strategy to develop a system for PDE6 expression has been to construct chimeric PDE6α′/PDE5 enzymes with a maximal structural and functional resemblance to native PDE6. This study demonstrates an efficient functional expression of chimeric PDE, Chi4, that contains a catalytic domain from PDE5 and noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites from cone PDE6α′. Thus far, all tested PDE6α′/PDE5 chimeras containing the PDE6α′ catalytic domain have been catalytically inactive. Chi4 had catalytic properties such as K m and V max for cGMP hydrolysis as well as IC50 for inhibition by zaprinast very similar to those of PDE5. Our recent results have demonstrated that the Pγ C terminus binds to the PDE6 catalytic domain and blocks the access of cGMP to the catalytic site (30Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Pγ C terminus binding was also competitive with zaprinast (30Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that catalytic domain residues that participate in the binding and hydrolysis of cGMP, and those that bind the Pγ C terminus are in very close proximity in the three-dimensional structure of PDE or may even overlap. This coupled with shared sensitivity of PDE6 and PDE5 to zaprinast have opened up an intriguing possibility that Pγ may inhibit PDE5 or Chi4. However, our data suggest that Pγ has no effect on the activities of PDE5 or Chi4. The PDE6α′ sequence that binds the Pγ C terminus corresponds to PDE6α′-749–761 and is adjacent to the putative NKXD motif for binding cGMP (25Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19964-19969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We speculate that the absence of the segment homologous to PDE6α′-749–761 in the PDE5 sequence accounts for the inability of Pγ to inhibit PDE5. This conclusion does not necessarily contradict the existence of putative protein modulators of PDE5 that may have a domain homologous to the polycationic region of Pγ (35Lochhead A. Nekrasova E. Arshavsky V.Y. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18397-18403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analysis of the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites on Chi4 has indicated that their affinity for cGMP (K d of 0.45 μm) is comparable to the affinity of cGMP binding at the noncatalytic sites of native PDE6α′ assessed in this study. Earlier estimates have resulted in a lower K d value for the noncatalytic cGMP binding to bovine PDE6α′ (9Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The comparative analysis is complicated by the fact that the affinity of noncatalytic cGMP binding to PDE6α′ depends on whether PDE6α′ subunits are complexed with inhibitory Pγ subunits or not. This study is the first to document that the interaction of PDE6α′ with Pγ significantly (∼6-fold) enhances the affinity of cGMP binding to the PDE6α′ noncatalytic sites. Similar effects of Pγ have been previously shown for frog rod PDE6 (18Yamazaki A. Bartucca F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the K dvalues for cGMP binding to tPDE6α′ alone (2.1 μm) and in the presence of Pγ (0.38 μm) correlate with the low affinity (>1 μm) and high affinity (60 nm) states for nonactivated and transducin-activated frog PDE6, respectively (19Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It appears that reciprocal relationships exist between Pγ-binding sites and noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites, whereby occupancy of the one class of sites modulates the interaction at the other sites (18Yamazaki A. Bartucca F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed such that, when cGMP levels drop upon light activation of frog rod PDE, cGMP dissociates from the noncatalytic sites leading to a physical removal of Pγ by transducin from PDE6. Inactivation of PDE then occurs faster due to acceleration of GTPase activity in the transducin α-Pγ complex (19Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Two regions of Pγ participate in the interaction with PDE6, the central polycationic region Pγ-24–45 and the C terminus of Pγ (36Lipkin B.M. Dumler I.L. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Etingof R.N. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 38Brown R.L.

The Pγ C terminus is most important for PDE inhibition. The results presented herein suggest that the polycationic region of Pγ is primarily responsible for the effects of Pγ on noncatalytic cGMP binding by PDE6. Hence, these effects are not coupled to the inhibitory action of Pγ on PDE6 catalytic activity, which is consistent with findings of Yamazaki et al. (41Yamazaki A. Bondarenko V.A. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Usukura J. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32495-32498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Each catalytic subunit of PDE6 as well as PDE5 has two internally homologous repeats (a and b) containing structural elements for cGMP binding (11Lipkin V.M. Khramtsov N.V. Vasilevskaya I.A. Atabekova N.V. Muradov K.G. Gubanov V.V. Li T. Johnston J.P. Volpp K.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12955-12959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17McAllister-Lucas L.M.

However, direct binding studies have shown that only 2 molecules of cGMP are bound to dimeric PDE5 and PDE6 molecules, even though each has four cGMP binding segments (15Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A.

Perhaps each cGMP-binding site is formed by two motifs from both PDE subunits (26McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D.

The critical structural element for noncatalytic cGMP binding to PDE5 appears to be a N(K/R)X nD motif (22Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). To determine whether one or both a and b repeats participate in binding of cGMP in PDE6, we mutated Asn residues from the two NKXD-like motifs of Chi4,193NKVD196 and402NRKD405, within the a and b repeats, respectively. Surprisingly, each of the two mutations abolished noncatalytic cGMP binding as measured by the filter binding assay. It is possible that these mutants retain some affinity for cGMP at the noncatalytic sites, but it is too weak to be detected under conditions of the assay. A similar point mutant in the PDE5 a repeat, N276A, had a dramatically reduced but still detectable affinity for cGMP (K d 60 μm) (22Turko I.V. Haik T.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Burns F. Francis S.H.

Perhaps, the Asn residues in PDE6α′ make a greater contribution to the overall affinity of the noncatalytic cGMP binding. Our data suggest that both a and brepeats are important for the noncatalytic cGMP binding by PDE6α′. Furthermore, elimination of one noncatalytic cGMP-binding site leads to loss of cGMP binding at the second site. Alternatively, if repeatsa and b, rather than two a or twob repeats, form a single noncatalytic cGMP-binding site, this would explain the loss of cGMP binding by the mutants. Chi4 may have retained the conformational link between the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites and the catalytic domain which apparently exists in PDE6α′. An increase in the K m value exhibited by the Chi4 Asn402 → Ala mutant indicates that occupancy of the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites in PDE6 may not only affect the affinity of PDE6 for Pγ subunits but the catalytic properties of PDE6 as well. This would be consistent with earlier observations that noncatalytic cGMP binding controls catalytic activity of another cGMP-binding PDE, PDE2 (43Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although mutations of noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites did not change the enzyme catalytic properties, it is possible that the enzymatic activity of the catalytic domain within the native PDE5 structure is affected by the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites. Alternatively, noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites may have different functions in different PDE families."

The initiation of reverse transcription requires specific interactions between HIV-1 RNA, primer tRNA3Lys, and RT. We have previously shown that extension of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide, a situation that mimicks elongation, is unspecific and differs from initiation by the polymerization rate and dissociation rate of RT from the primer-template complex. Here, we used replication intermediates to analyze the transition from the initiation to the elongation phases. We found that the 2′-hydroxyl group at the 3′ end of tRNA had limited effects on the polymerization and dissociation rate constants. Instead, the polymerization rate increased 3400-fold between addition of the sixth and seventh nucleotide to tRNA3Lys. The same increase in the polymerization rate was observed when an oligoribonucleotide, but not an oligodeoxyribonucleotide, was used as a primer. In parallel, the dissociation rate of RT from the primer-template complex decreased 30-fold between addition of the 17th and 19th nucleotide to tRNA3Lys. The polymerization and dissociation rates are most likely governed by interactions of the primer strand with helix αH in the p66 thumb subdomain and the RNase H domain of RT, respectively.

Extension of tRNA3Lys, which corresponds to the initiation phase, requires the homologous primer, template, and RT for efficient polymerization, whereas extension of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide, which mimicks the elongation phase, is unspecific (22Isel C.

Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast to the processive elongation phase, DNA synthesis is distributive during initiation (22Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The origin of this difference is 2-fold. First, RT dissociates much faster from the initiation complex than from the elongation complex. Second, the polymerization rate is approximately 50-fold faster in the elongation phase compared with initiation of reverse transcription (26Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Whether these differences are due to the presence of the 2′-hydroxyl group at the 3′ end of tRNA3Lys at the DNA polymerase catalytic site during the initiation phase or to other differences between the HIV-1 RNA-tRNA3Lys·RT and HIV-1 RNA-DNA·RT complexes is presently unknown. Similarly, it is not known whether the transition from initiation to elongation is accompanied by a smooth continuous or a sharp discontinuous variation of the polymerization and dissociation rates. Here, we used replication intermediates corresponding to the addition of 1 to 25 deoxyribonucleotides to tRNA3Lys to monitor these parameters during addition of the next correct nucleotide by HIV-1 RT. Our results show that the 2′ hydroxyl group at the 3′ end of tRNA3Lys has limited effects on the polymerization and dissociation rate constants. Instead, the polymerization rate is primarily determined by the nature (RNAversus DNA) of the primer strand contacting the thumb subdomain of RT, whereas dissociation from primer-template is governed by the nature of the primer strand interacting with its RNase H domain.DISCUSSIONWe previously showed that the initiation and elongation phases of HIV-1 reverse transcription markedly differ in processivity (22Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here, to obtain a detailed view of the transition between these two phases, we have constructed a complete set of replication intermediates consisting of natural tRNA3Lys with an increasing number of deoxynucleotides attached to its 3′ end. In a first set of experiments, we showed that the transition between the initiation and elongation phases of HIV-1 reverse transcription, which is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the processivity of DNA synthesis, takes place between the addition of the sixth and the ninth nucleotide to tRNA3Lys. In the next experiments, we determined the kinetic parameters of addition of the first 26 nucleotides to tRNA3Lys and of dissociation of RT from the corresponding primer-template complexes.Rate of Nucleotide AdditionThe k poland kpolfast values for the addition of the second, third, fifth, and sixth nucleotide to tRNA3Lys are in the range of 0.20 to 0.50 s−1, close to the polymerization rate of the first nucleotide that we previously determined (0.22 s−1) (26Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, our previous and present work shows that the 2′-hydroxyl group at the 3′ end of tRNA3Lys, which is present in the catalytic site of HIV-1 RT during addition of the first deoxyribonucleotide but absent in that site during the subsequent nucleotide additions, is not the cause of the slow extension rate of tRNA3Lys.The extremely low kpolfast value for the addition of the fourth nucleotide could be accounted for by the secondary and tertiary structures of the tRNA3Lys-HIV-1 RNA complex. As determined from chemical and enzymatic probing experiments, the first 3 nucleotides immediately upstream of the PBS are single-stranded, whereas the 4th to 17th nucleotides are base-paired (Fig. 1) (13Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Due to strong structural constraints in the tRNA3Lys-HIV-1 RNA complex (14Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 16Isel C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the viral RNA makes a sharp turn between the third and fourth nucleotides upstream of the PBS. 3C. Isel, E. Westhof, S. Le Grice, B. Ehresmann, C. Ehresmann, and R. Marquet, manuscript in preparation. This distortion of the template probably causes the slow extension of tRNA3Lys + 3. In turn, this low kpolfast value explains the strong pausing observed three nucleotides upstream of the PBS during synthesis of (−) strand strong stop DNA (21Arts E.J. Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Ehresmann B. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9054-9061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The structure of the tRNA3Lys-HIV-1 RNA complex also explains variations of the amplitude of the fast phase during the addition of the first six nucleotides to tRNA3Lys. When the incoming nucleotide is complementary to a single-stranded template nucleotide (i.e. addition of the first three nucleotides), the fast phase is predominant. On the contrary, when the incoming nucleotide is complementary to a template nucleotide that is base-paired in the primer-template complex, kpolfast is not affected, but the amplitude of this phase is significantly decreased. A similar phenomenon was recently observed during elongation of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide primer by HIV-1 RT through a stable stem-loop structure formed by an RNA template (36Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).A dramatic increase of the polymerization rate was observed between the addition of the sixth and seventh nucleotides. Unexpectedly, extension of some tRNA3Lys + n chimeras follows biphasic kinetics. The most likely explanation for this observation is that some tRNA3Lys-HIV-1 RNA complexes might bind in two slightly different modes to the primer-template binding cleft of RT. Biphasic kinetics have not been observed by others during extension of DNA primers (31Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8743-8751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hsieh J.C. Zinnen S.

However, the number of experimental points collected during the pre-steady state in some of these studies might not be sufficient to detect the superposition of two first order processes, which we distinguished here by collecting up to 30 data points for a single kinetic experiment. Thus, one cannot exclude that biphasic DNA extension is rather common.As revealed by the comparison of the kinetics of addition of the sixth and seventh nucleotides to tRNA3Lys, ORN, and ODN, the extended interactions between tRNA3Lys and the viral RNA (13Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol.

Virology. 1996; 226: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) do not contribute toward the dramatic increase of the polymerization rate between addition of these nucleotides. Indeed, this sharp transition is observed when the 18 nucleotides complementary to the PBS are ribonucleotides (i.e. with tRNA3Lys and ORN as primers) but not with the ODN primer. Our previous data suggested that the extended interactions favored extension of the pausing products at positions +3 and +5 during synthesis of (−) strand strong stop DNA (22Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, these interactions favor formation of the tRNA3Lys + n-HIV-1 RNA·RT complexes rather than affecting the polymerization rate by the preformed ternary complexes (22Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This effect was not detected in the present study because of the large excess of RT over primer-template complexes.Dissociation of HIV-1 RT from the tRNA3Lys + n-HIV-1 RNA ComplexesAs also observed for extension of some tRNA3Lys + n chimeras, dissociation of HIV-1 RT from most of the tRNA3Lys + n-HIV-1 RNA complexes was biphasic. The biphasic nature of polymerization (forn ≥ 6) as well as that of the dissociation of RT from the primer-template most probably reflects different binding conformations. However, no correlation exists between the relative amplitudes of the fast and slow phases of primer extension and RT dissociation. Thus, our results suggest the existence of several slightly different binding modes of RT to the tRNA3Lys + n-HIV-1 RNA complexes. Moreover, they indicate that the rates of primer extension and RT dissociation are not governed by the same RT/nucleic acid contacts.RT dissociates 200-fold faster from the initiation complex than from the elongation complex (26Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here, we observed that HIV-1 RT dissociates slightly faster from the tRNA3Lys + 1-HIV-1 RNA complex than from the tRNA3Lys-HIV-1 RNA complex. Thus, fast dissociation of RT from the initiation complex is not due to the presence in the catalytic site of the 2′-OH group of the 3′-terminal adenosine of tRNA3Lys, since this group is displaced from the catalytic site during subsequent nucleotide additions. Regarding the kinetic stability of the tRNA3Lys + n-HIV-1 RNA·HIV-1 RT complexes, the only feature that can be related to the transition from the initiation to the elongation phases of reverse transcription is a decreased dissociation rate as nincreased from 16 to 18. This transition was the only feature common to the fast and slow dissociation phases of RT.Correlation with RT StructureWe observed a sharpk pol transition between the addition of the sixth and seventh nucleotides when using tRNA3Lys and ORN, but not ODN, as primers. Thus, the highly ordered tRNA3Lys-HIV-1 RNA complex (14Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 16Isel C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) is not required for this transition to occur. Rather, a crucial feature of this transition is an RNA-DNA junction on the primer strand. The structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with an 18-mer DNA primer-19-mer DNA template has been solved by x-ray crystallography (42Ding J. Hughes S.H. Arnold E.

In this structure, the five base pairs of the primer-template proximal to the polymerase active site adopt A-form geometry, whereas the remaining base pairs adopt B helical form (42Ding J.

Interestingly, this structure reveals that the fifth nucleotide and phosphate upstream of the active site on the primer strand are in close contact with the central part of helix αH located in the thumb subdomain of the p66 subunit (Fig. 5).

Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and the RT-DNA co-crystal structures (43Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J.P. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D. Lu X.D. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G.

Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L.P. Prasad R. Luxon B.A. Gorenstein D.G. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These structures indicate that, when the tRNA3Lys + 5-HIV-1 RNA duplex occupies the nucleic acid binding cleft, the 3′-terminal adenosine of tRNA3Lys and the phosphate at the tRNA-DNA junction are in the immediate vicinity of the central portion of helix αH, whereas the first deoxyribonucleotide attached to tRNA3Lysoccupies this position during addition of the seventh deoxyribonucleotide. The crucial role of this helix in binding DNA primer-template complexes has been clearly demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis (45Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L.P. Prasad R.

Therefore, the sharpk pol transition is likely dictated by the position of RNA-DNA junction on the primer strand relative to helix αH.In the crystal structure, the A and B helical regions of the DNA primer-DNA template complex are separated by a 41° bend (42Ding J. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 43Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J.P. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D. Lu X.D. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G.

During (−) strand DNA synthesis, the primer-template complex cannot adopt B-form geometry because of the RNA template. The hybrid formed by the PBS and the 3′ terminus of tRNA3Lysprobably adopts classical A-form geometry, whereas the RNA template upstream of the PBS and the complementary deoxyribonucleotides linked to tRNA3Lys assumes H-form conformation, in which the template strand has essentially A-form conformation and the primer strand has an intermediate geometry between A- and B-form (48Horton N.C. Finzel B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 49Fedoroff O.Y. Salazar M. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, different interactions of helix αH in the thumb of the p66 subunit of HIV-1 RT with A- and H-form geometry primer-templates probably lead to slightly different locations of the primer 3′-hydroxyl group in the DNA polymerase catalytic site, which in turn is responsible for the large variation of the polymerization rate.In parallel with the k pol transition, we observed a decreased dissociation rate of RT from the tRNA3Lys + n-HIV-1 RNA complexes when n increased from 16 to 18. In the crystal structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with an 18-mer DNA primer-19-mer DNA template, the phosphate groups 15 to 17 nucleotides upstream from the 3′ end of the primer contact the RNase H domain of the p66 subunit (Fig. 5) (39Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Ding J. Hughes S.H. Arnold E.

Contacts between the primer and the RNase H domain of RT are known to be crucial for the stability of the primer-template·RT complex. For instance, the equilibrium dissociation constant of HIV-1 RT from poly(rA)-(dT)n decreased by 2 orders of magnitude when n increased from 10–14 to 16–20 (50Reardon J.E. Furfine E.S. Cheng N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14128-14134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our results, together with the x-ray structure (42Ding J. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,43Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J.P. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D. Lu X.D. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A.

A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), suggest the lifetime of the RT·tRNA3Lys + n-HIV-1 RNA complexes increases when the region of the primer strand close to the RNase H domain of RT is DNA. Alternatively, the interaction of a DNA-RNA primer-template instead of an RNA-RNA duplex with the RNase H domain might favor contacts between helix αE′- and the β5′- αE′- connecting loop and the template strand around position −20 relative to the polymerase active site (51Hermann T. Meier T. Gotte M. Heumann H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 52Wöhrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Concluding RemarksThe sharp transition between initiation and elongation of HIV-1 reverse transcription is mainly characterized by a 3400-fold increase of the polymerization rate between the addition of the sixth and seventh nucleotides. The processivity of the elongation phase is further increased by a reduction in the dissociation rate of RT between the addition of the 17th and 19th nucleotides. The increase in k pol and decrease in k off are both dictated by different contacts of the primer strand of RNA-RNA and DNA-RNA primer-template complexes in the binding cleft of HIV-1 RT.

This protein forms a ternary complex with vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) and syntaxin, which is thought to regulate the fusion of plasma and vesicle membranes during exocytosis. We report the identification of SNAP-25 expressed in sea urchin sperm. Sea urchin SNAP-25 shares greater identity with mammalian SNAP-25 than with mammalian SNAP-23, a ubiquitously expressed homologue believed to regulate membrane fusion in non-neuronal tissues. Sea urchin sperm contain a single exocytotic vesicle, the acrosomal vesicle, whose contents are exposed during the acrosome reaction. Fusion of the plasma membrane with the acrosomal vesicle membrane at multiple points (vesiculation) results in the release of SNAP-25 with the shed acrosome reaction vesicles. A complex containing SNAP-25, syntaxin, and VAMP is present in sperm, as detected by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation. Although this complex is present prior to the acrosome reaction, the amount of complex increases over 4-fold following acrosomal exocytosis. These findings support the involvement of SNAP-25 in the invertebrate sperm acrosome reaction, possibly through increased association with VAMP and syntaxin driving the fusion of plasma and acrosomal membranes.

During fertilization in many animals, including sea urchins and mammals, outer investments of the egg trigger the exocytosis of a single exocytotic vesicle in sperm, the acrosomal vesicle (1Garbers D.L.

Exocytosis of the acrosomal vesicle during the acrosome reaction is unique in that the plasma and acrosomal membranes fuse at multiple points resulting in formation of acrosome reaction vesicles (ARVs),1 which are subsequently shed from sperm (4Yanagimachi R.

Sperm SNAP-25 is found in a complex with syntaxin and VAMP and is also shed with the ARVs. The amount of complex of these three proteins increases following the acrosome reaction. This increase may represent the post-exocytotic state of these proteins in the absence of an endocytic membrane retrieval cycle common to most cells.DISCUSSIONSNAP-25 is an axonally transported protein in mammalian neurons where it localizes to nerve terminals (26Hess D.T.

This is the first report of SNAP-25 being expressed in the sperm of any animal. Phylogenetic analysis of SNAP-25 protein sequences suggests that the mammalian SNAP-25 homologue, SNAP-23 (23Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 32Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), arose by a gene duplication in the vertebrate lineage to function in non-neuronal cell types. In agreement with this idea, only a single isoform of SNAP-25 was amplified from a sea urchin testis cDNA library despite the use of degenerate primers designed to amplify both SNAP-25 and -23. This suggests that the sea urchin testis does not express a SNAP-23 homologue. The identification of SNAP-23 in mouse testis (32Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) raises the possibility that SNAP-23 has evolved to function in non-neuronal cell types in vertebrates, in agreement with the phylogenetic sequence analysis presented in Fig. 2.Sea urchin sperm SNAP-25 shares many properties with syntaxin and VAMP. All three proteins are shed from sperm with the ARVs during the acrosome reaction. These proteins can be isolated as a complex by immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography prior to the acrosome reaction. Following acrosomal exocytosis, there is greater than a 4-fold increase in the amount of ternary complex present, as demonstrated by the changes in the sedimentation patterns of syntaxin, VAMP, and SNAP-25 and by the immunoprecipitation of gradient fractions. Interestingly, only a portion of SNAP-25 sediments into denser fractions following the acrosome reaction. The 6.9-fold molar excess of SNAP-25 over syntaxin in sperm extracts and ARVs suggests that SNAP-25 is not limiting for ternary complex formation. However, all the syntaxin present in ARVs completely shifts to denser fractions after the acrosome reaction. The estimated sedimentation coefficient for the syntaxin peak fractions following the acrosome reaction is 6.2 S (7Schulz J.R. Wessel G.M. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which correlates with the size of the ternary complex based on the sedimentation of molecular weight standards.The presence of the ternary complex in ARVs may represent the post-exocytotic state of these proteins in the same lipid bilayer, and the increase in complex formation following the acrosome reaction may be an exocytotic intermediate formed in the absence a subsequent endocytic cycle.As the amount of ternary complex increases following acrosomal exocytosis, it will be of interest to determine what regulates complex formation prior to the acrosome reaction and how this correlates with the influx of Ca2+, which triggers acrosomal exocytosis. During fertilization in many animals, including sea urchins and mammals, outer investments of the egg trigger the exocytosis of a single exocytotic vesicle in sperm, the acrosomal vesicle (1Garbers D.L.

All three proteins are shed from sperm with the ARVs during the acrosome reaction. These proteins can be isolated as a complex by immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography prior to the acrosome reaction. Following acrosomal exocytosis, there is greater than a 4-fold increase in the amount of ternary complex present, as demonstrated by the changes in the sedimentation patterns of syntaxin, VAMP, and SNAP-25 and by the immunoprecipitation of gradient fractions. Interestingly, only a portion of SNAP-25 sediments into denser fractions following the acrosome reaction. The 6.9-fold molar excess of SNAP-25 over syntaxin in sperm extracts and ARVs suggests that SNAP-25 is not limiting for ternary complex formation. However, all the syntaxin present in ARVs completely shifts to denser fractions after the acrosome reaction. The estimated sedimentation coefficient for the syntaxin peak fractions following the acrosome reaction is 6.2 S (7Schulz J.R. Wessel G.M. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which correlates with the size of the ternary complex based on the sedimentation of molecular weight standards.The presence of the ternary complex in ARVs may represent the post-exocytotic state of these proteins in the same lipid bilayer, and the increase in complex formation following the acrosome reaction may be an exocytotic intermediate formed in the absence a subsequent endocytic cycle.As the amount of ternary complex increases following acrosomal exocytosis, it will be of interest to determine what regulates complex formation prior to the acrosome reaction and how this correlates with the influx of Ca2+, which triggers acrosomal exocytosis. SNAP-25 is an axonally transported protein in mammalian neurons where it localizes to nerve terminals (26Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J.

This is the first report of SNAP-25 being expressed in the sperm of any animal. Phylogenetic analysis of SNAP-25 protein sequences suggests that the mammalian SNAP-25 homologue, SNAP-23 (23Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), arose by a gene duplication in the vertebrate lineage to function in non-neuronal cell types. In agreement with this idea, only a single isoform of SNAP-25 was amplified from a sea urchin testis cDNA library despite the use of degenerate primers designed to amplify both SNAP-25 and -23. This suggests that the sea urchin testis does not express a SNAP-23 homologue. The identification of SNAP-23 in mouse testis (32Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J.

https://openalex.org/W2090389412,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor was shown to be involved in the activation pathway of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) cascade not only by EGF, but also by UV radiation or osmotic stress. This paper describes a specific interaction between the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 and the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of MEKK1 in ER22 cells overexpressing the EGF receptor. This interaction results in the formation of a constitutive complex between Grb2 and MEKK1 in both proliferating and resting cells. EGF stimulation causes this complex to be rapidly and transiently recruited by Shc proteins. The subsequent release of the Grb2-MEKK1 complex from Shc proteins correlates with JNK activation. Transfection of the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of MEKK1 specifically inhibits EGF-dependent JNK activation indicating that Grb2 is involved in MEKK1 activation. Thus, adaptor proteins have a new role in the regulation of the SAPK/JNK cascade after EGF stimulation.

Several mammalian mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinases have been identified, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) (1Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S.

Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The activation of MAP kinases appears to be a key event in many cell responses to external stimuli. The JNK cascade is activated in response to a variety of cell stresses, including UV irradiation, γ-rays, pro-inflammatory cytokines, ceramides, vasoactive peptides, protein synthesis inhibitors, heat shock, osmotic shock, and also in response to mitogens such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor. The JNK cascade leads to the activation by phosphorylation of a series of transcription factors including c-Jun, Elk-1, and ATF-2 (7Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of the JNKs (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) is associated with proliferation and differentiation but also with the arrest of cell growth and apoptosis. It was recently reported that stimulation of the JNKs mediates Ras transformation (8Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The involvement of small GTP-binding proteins, such as Ras proteins and the members of the Rho subfamily, in the activation of the JNK cascade is well documented in cell responses to stress or growth factors. EGF activates the JNK pathway (9Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was recently reported to be a link between JNK signaling mediated by the Rho family and the Ras pathway upon EGF stimulation (10Logan S.K. Falasca M. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Exposure to UV radiation or to osmotic shock was also found to induce clustering and internalization of EGF receptors and their activation by tyrosine autophosphorylation, with subsequent activation of the JNK cascade through Ras activation (11Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The JNKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues by the JNK kinases (MKK4/SEK1), which are, in turn, activated by upstream kinases referred to as MEK kinases (MEKKs) (9Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar,12Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). MEKKs are an expanding family of kinases (13Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Mammalian MEKK1 cDNA encodes a 78-kDa protein, but several forms of MEKK1 have been found in various cell lines (50, 78, or 98 kDa) (14Lange-Carter C. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Thereafter, a rat MEKK1 full-length cDNA was cloned, encoding a 195-kDa protein (15Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The 98-kDa protein corresponds to the 625 COOH-terminal amino acids of the full-length MEKK1 and might be produced by specific cleavage (16Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Few data describe the mechanism of transient activation of MEKK1 in response to growth factors. We have therefore studied the activation of MEKK1 in response to EGF in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (ER22 cells), in which the main immunoreactive form of MEKK1 is a 98-kDa protein. We found a constitutive Grb2-MEKK1 complex in the ER22 cells. In response to EGF stimulation, this complex is recruited by Shc proteins. The JNK activation occurs when the complex is released from Shc proteins. ER22 cells, derived from CCL39 cells by stable expression of the EGF receptor (17Sardet C. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19166-19171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE, and cells were harvested 48 h later. The mutant Grb2 Y7V cDNA was obtained from the Grb2 cDNA by PCR mutagenesis with the following primers: sense (5′-ATGGAAGCCATCGCCAAAGTCGACTTCAAA-3′) and antisense (5′-AGATCTCACTATTAGGTGCAGCTC-3′). The Grb2ΔSH3C cDNA was obtained from the Grb2 cDNA by deletion of the region encoding the COOH-terminal domain from amino acid Q157. HA-tagged MEKK1COOH(301–672) and VSV-tagged MEKK1(1–672) were a generous gift from Dr. J. Pouysségur (UMR134, CNRS Nice, France). MEKK1(1–410)was constructed from the MEKK1(1–672) cDNA by PCR and subsequent sequencing. The Myc-tagged Grb2, Grb2, and Grb3-3 expression vectors have been described (18Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocqué B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). GST-Crk and GST-Nck were a gift from Dr. S. Fischer (INSERM U363, Paris, France). GST-cJun(1–223) was kindly provided by Dr. B. Wasylyk (IGBMC, Strasbourg, France). GST fusion proteins were produced using the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia). The recombinant His-MEKK1(1–301) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). ER22 cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid Gal4-CAT, the activator plasmid encoding Gal4-cJun(1–223), and pSV2 plasmid without a cDNA insert or with MEKK1(1–410) or MEKK1(301–672) cDNAs. Cells were incubated for 24 h after transfection, deprived of FCS for an additional 24 h, and treated with or without 100 ng/ml EGF. CAT activity was measured using an InstantImager (Packard Instrument Corp.). Cells were lysed with buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 1% Triton X-100 and the lysates centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (19Parker F. Maurier F. Delumeau I. Duchesne M. Faucher D. Debussche L. Dugué A. Schweighoffer F. Tocqué B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham) or by the alkaline phosphatase 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). Proteins were detected by far-Western blot analysis with anti-GST antibodies (0.25 μg/ml) and revealed with the alkaline phosphatase 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium system (Sigma). GST fusion proteins (Grb2, Grb2Y7V, Grb2ΔSH3C, Grb3-3, Nck, Crk) were adsorbed onto glutathione-agarose beads equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated with the cell lysates for 3 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. JNK activities were assayed using anin vitro c-Jun kinase assay (20Westwick J.K. Brenner D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 342-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (21Pomérance M. Thang M.N. Toqué B. Pierre M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and incubated with GST-cJun(1–223) bound to GSH-agarose. Proteins were incubated (20 min at 30 °C) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm ATP, and 10 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (3 Ci/mmol, Amersham). 32P incorporation in GST-cJun(1–223) was monitored by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The MEKK1(1–672) sequence (14Lange-Carter C. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) contains several proline-rich stretches in the NH2-terminal region that could interact with protein SH3 domains. We examined the interaction of MEKK1 with various GST-adaptor proteins (containing mainly SH2 and SH3 domains). Lysates from FCS-cultured ER22 cells were subjected to affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose coupled to GST-Grb2, GST-Nck, or GST-Crk fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A). Immobilized GST-Grb2 specifically retained the 98-kDa MEKK1, as revealed by Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against the COOH-terminal sequence of MEKK1. This molecular weight has already been reported for the MEKK1 in NIH or Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (22Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, the anti-MEKK1 antibodies detected no immunoreactive protein in eluates from GST-Nck and GST-Crk affinity chromatography columns. We also found a 78-kDa protein associated with Grb2 in primary cultures of rat astrocytes (results not shown). This corresponds to the molecular weight of MEKK1 in PC12 cells (14Lange-Carter C. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). No immunoreactive protein was detected with antibodies against other MAP kinase kinase kinases, such as c-Raf1 or B-Raf, or with antibodies against the MAP kinase kinase (MEK1), which contains many proline-rich stretches (results not shown). In contrast, the Ras exchange factor, Sos1, was found associated with Grb2 and Crk (results not shown). These data suggest that MEKK1 interacts specifically with Grb2 in vitro. We then examined the Grb2-MEKK1 interaction in vivo (Fig. 1 B). Extracts of proliferating ER22 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-MEKK1 antibodies (lane 1). Two major polypeptides were detected, a 98-kDa protein corresponding to the molecular mass of the wild type MEKK1 and a 195-kDa protein having the same size as the large form of MEKK1 (15Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-MEKK1 antibodies, and the 25-kDa Grb2 protein was detected using anti-Grb2 antibodies (lane 3). These data indicate that endogenous Grb2 and MEKK1 associate in vivo. To confirm this interaction, ER22 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids carrying VSV-tagged MEKK1 (lane 2). Grb2 was associated with VSV-tagged MEKK1 after immunoprecipitation of Grb2 followed by Western blot analysis with anti-VSV tag antibodies. ER22 cells were also transfected with plasmids carrying Myc-tagged Grb2. Anti-MEKK1 immunoprecipitates of cell extracts, blotted with anti-Grb2 antibodies, detected two proteins, one corresponding to endogenous Grb2 and the other to Myc-Grb2 (lane 4), the latter was also detected by anti-Myc antibodies (results not shown). This confirms that MEKK1 interacts with Grb2 in ER22 cells. The functional domains of Grb2 that interact with MEKK1 were identified by affinity chromatography using mutants or variants of Grb2 (Fig. 2 A). Grb3-3 is a natural splicing isoform of Grb2 with a crippled SH2 domain that cannot interact with the phosphorylated EGF receptor (18Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocqué B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It interacted with MEKK1 as well as did unspliced Grb2, indicating that the SH2 domain of Grb2 is not implicated in the binding with MEKK1. Grb2Y7V is an NH2-terminal SH3 mutant that has lost the ability to bind dynamin. 2M. Pomérance, M.-C. Multon, F. Parker, C. Venot, J.-P. Blondeau, B. Tocqué, and F. Schweighoffer, unpublished results. It still bound to MEKK1, although less strongly than Grb2, indicating that MEKK1 does not bind to the same site as dynamin. Grb2ΔSH3C is deleted from its COOH-terminal SH3 domain and did not interact any more with MEKK1 (Fig. 2 A), although it did interact with Sos1 (result not shown). The Grb2 G203R mutant did not bind to Sos1 under our experimental conditions2 and is known to block DNA synthesis induced by activation of the Ras pathway (23Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). This mutant still interacted with MEKK1 (result not shown). Therefore the Grb2-MEKK1 interaction appears to be different from canonical Grb2-Sos binding. Taken together, our experiments indicate that the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 is needed to bind to MEKK1, whereas the NH2-terminal SH3 domain may act as a putative modulator. We identified the domain of MEKK1 that interacted with Grb2 by transfecting ER22 cells with plasmids encoding VSV-tagged MEKK1(1–672) or HA-tagged MEKK1(301–672)(Fig. 2 B). Tagged MEKKs were immunoprecipitated using anti-tag antibodies and blotted with anti-Grb2 antibodies. We found that Grb2 interacted in vivo with MEKK1(1–672)but not with its COOH-terminal catalytic domain. The identity of the MEKK1 interaction domain was confirmed by far-Western blot analysis. Recombinant polyhistidine-tagged MEKK1(1–301) was probed with GST or GST-Grb2 (Fig. 2 C). As expected, GST-Grb2 bound to a single polypeptide corresponding to the tagged MEKK1(1–301), whereas GST gave no detectable signal. The NH2-terminal domain of MEKK1(1–301) contains three proline-rich regions according to the FingerPRINTS program. One of these proline-rich stretches matches a class I binding site for a putative SH3 domain (sequence RPKPSRP) as described by Cohen et al. (24Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). We checked to determine whether MEKK1 associated with Grb2 in quiescent cells or in response to EGF. Fig. 3 A shows that similar amounts of the complex were immunoprecipitated from quiescent, EGF-treated, and FCS-cultured cells. Therefore, we conclude that the Grb2-MEKK1 association is not modulated by EGF or serum and that the complex is constitutive, as is the Grb2-Sos complex (25Chardin P. Camonis J.H.

Shc proteins were immunoprecipitated from ER22 cells and were found to be associated with Grb2 upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 3 B), as described previously (29Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G.

This association was transient, reaching a peak after 5–10 min of EGF treatment. Concomitantly, MEKK1 was detected in the Shc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 C). This association was confirmed using ER22 cells transfected with plasmids carrying VSV-tagged MEKK1. Immunoprecipitation with anti-VSV antibodies followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Shc antibodies revealed p66, p52, and p46 Shc proteins (results not shown). The JNK activities in ER22 cells were stimulated by EGF and reached a peak 20 min after adding EGF (Fig. 3 D), following the release of MEKK1 from Shc proteins. Dissociation of the Grb2-MEKK1 complex from Shc, 10 min after EGF stimulation, may allow this complex to be recycled to the cytoplasm, in a way similar to the Grb2-Sos complex. Our results suggest that the activation of JNK by EGF requires a transient association of a Grb2-MEKK1 complex with Shc proteins and perhaps with the EGF receptor. This may result in a transient translocation of MEKK1 to the plasma membrane. Other protein kinases involved in JNK activation such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PAKs, and HPK1 require recruitment at the membrane for their activation (31Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J.

Indeed, JNK activation has been found to depend on Ras (22Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and on members of the Rho superfamily (34Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11757-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). MEKK1 could also interact with partners at the membrane, such as 14-3-3 proteins, allowing caspase-mediated cleavage (36Fanger G.R. Widmann C. Porter A.C. Sather S. Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. J.

We evaluated the role of the Grb2-MEKK1 interaction in response to EGF by examining the effect of MEKK1(1–410) transfection on JNK activity in EGF-treated ER22 cells (Fig. 4). Cells were cotransfected with the Gal4-CAT plasmid and the Gal4-cJun(1–223) plasmid with or without MEKK1 expression vectors. 48 h after transfection, starved cells were treated with EGF, and JNK activity was measured by CAT assay. As described previously (9Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), EGF stimulated JNK activity (∼15-fold). The catalytic domain of MEKK1(301–672) increased JNK activity but the NH2-terminal domain of MEKK1 reduced EGF-stimulated JNK activity by 40%. This effect is specific to the JNK pathway, because transfection of the NH2-terminal domain of MEKK1(1–410) did not interfere with ERK activation (results not shown). Our results therefore indicate that there is a constitutive Grb2-MEKK1 complex in both resting and growing cells. This complex involves the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 and the NH2-terminal region of MEKK1. EGF stimulation causes this complex to be recruited by Shc proteins. Our data emphasize the role of adaptors like Grb2 and Shc in the activation of MEKK1 and suggest that Grb2 is involved in several signaling pathways. The recruitment of MEKK1 at the cell membrane may promote its activation by locating it close to a suitable kinase. This mechanism is an integral part of the signal generated by the EGF receptor to activate JNKs. We thank Dr. J. Pouysségur (UMR134 CNRS Nice, France), Dr. S.

We have addressed this issue and generated overlapping internal deletion mutants hMRΔ59–162, hMRΔ59–247, hMRΔ59–328, hMRΔ162–247, hMRΔ247–328,hMRΔ247–382, and hMRΔ328–382 with intact DNA-binding and hormone-binding domains. A second set of mutant receptors with unique BglII sites was generated to facilitate the isolations of fragments. Immunodetection with anti-hMR peptide antibodies and hormone-binding assays showed that the mutations did not affect the expression of the receptors or ability to bind aldosterone. Distribution of aldosterone binding activity of wild type and deletion mutants expressed in HeLa cells was predominantly nuclear. Furthermore, deletion of sequences between 59 and 390 did not affect DNA binding activity. Transfection studies with HeLa cells revealed a region around residue 247 that was crucial for normal receptor function. Deletion of amino acids 59–162 did not affect the transcriptional activity of the hMR. However, deletion of sequences 247–382 and 328–382 markedly decreased the transcription activation function. The induction of the reporter gene by the chimera hGRΔ71–262/hMR328–382 was 2-fold higher than with the wild type hGR, but 200-fold when compared with hGRΔ71–262, indicating that the AF-1 domain is located between positions 328 and 382 in the hMR.

In humans, the biologically active mineralocorticoid aldosterone maintains the homeostasis of ion balance principally in the kidney, but also in the gut, salivary, and sweat glands. The evolution of the modular structure of nuclear receptors into distinct domains is largely the consequence of complex requirements that arose during cellular growth and development. The structures of the human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR)1 and the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) are very similar. The N-terminal region in this family of nuclear receptors is of variable length and contains a transactivation function, the AF-1 (1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Hausman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). In the absence of a hormone-binding domain (HBD), this region is constitutively active. The N-terminal regions of hGR and hMR have only 15% homology, and it is this domain that is responsible for differences in target gene specificity. In the hGR, the N-terminal activation domain is 185 amino acids long and a 58-amino acid peptide that is almost as active as the intact region has been identified (2Dahlman-Wright K. Almlof T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.-A. Wright A.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The experiments with hGR were, however, performed with constructs containing segments of the hGR expressed in yeast and not in mammalian cells, and the cooperative function of the hGR HBD was not taken into consideration in these analyses. Such regions in the hMR remain to be defined. Our experiments were performed in animal cells in culture, and the intact DNA-binding domain (DBD) and HBD of the hMR or hGR were used in transfection studies. Although 94% of the 68 amino acids in the centrally located DBD of hMR and hGR are identical, the HBD has only 57% homology. The hMR contains an additional 24 amino acids including a sequence of 4 glutamines and 8 prolines encoded by repetitive nucleotide elements (1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Hausman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the HBD also contains a hormone-dependent transcription activation function (AF-2). In this paper, we have identified hMR sequences crucial for the transactivation function by first generating receptor mutants with unique BglII sites. In order to identify the hMR sequences capable of conferring activity upon a hGR that lacks transcriptional activity, we have constructed a series of hGR·hMR chimeras. To map the exact domain responsible for transactivation function of hMR, the chimeras were introduced into receptor-deficient CV-1 cells and sequences in the hMR (amino acids 328–382) were identified. Cloning was performed by standard procedure (3Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). MMTV-CAT and the eukaryotic expression plasmids for various steroid receptors were constructed as described previously (4Govindan M.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Govindan M.V. Leclerc S. Roy R. Rathanaswamy P. Xie B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1991; 39: 91-103Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The hMRΔ59–328 was created after digesting the cDNA withScaI-ScaI. Subsequent religation generated an uninterrupted 715-amino acid sequence in an open reading frame. Similarly, digestion of hMR cDNA with BalI (amino acids 148/149 and 390/391) and religation generated a 742-amino acid hMR in an open reading frame. The wild type and mutant receptor cDNAs were cloned at the HindIII- EcoRV sites of pcDNA1. The plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. Unique restriction sites were introduced at the AF-1 domain of the hMR by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The 5′ region from position 1 to 351 and the 3′ region from position 352 to 984 extended to the 3′ noncoding region of the cDNA, were cloned in M13mp18 and M13mp19. Templates for single-stranded mutagenesis were prepared as described previously (6Warriar N.W., Yu, C. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29010-29015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yu C. Warriar N. Govindan M.V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14163-14173Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The newly introduced restriction site is AGATCT (codons for Arg-Ser). To introduce BglII sites, the following oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.: a, 5′-CAACAGATCTCAAGG-3′ (hMR S59R/T60S, BglII site between residues 59/60); b, 5′-CCCTTGAGATCTTTTATG-3′ (BglII site between residues 162/163); c, 5′-GGCTCCAGATCTCACAG-3′ (BglII site between residues 247/248); and d, 5′-GGCCAGATCTGTGGG-3′ (hMR S328R/T329S, BglII site between residues 328/329). Restriction sites in two cDNAs, hMR 162 and hMR 247, were generated by substituting a single base without changing the codon. Double mutations were introduced by the substitution S382R/A383S using the oligonucleotide 5′-GTGGAGAGATCTATCTCA-3′. After verifying the sequence of the mutant receptors, fragments containing altered regions of the cDNAs were joined with the appropriate wild type hMR segments to generate full-length hMR 59 BglII,hMR 162 BglII, hMR 247 BglII, hMR 328BglII, and hMR 382 BglII. Subsequently, mutant receptor cDNAs containing double BglII sites were generated by joining the 5′ end cDNA fragments containing theBglII sites at positions 59, 162, 247, and 328 to the hMR segment S382R/A383S by similar procedures. Deletion of the cDNA segments between two internal BglII sites and religation of the BglII ends produced new hMR cDNAs: hMRΔ59–382, Δ162/382, Δ247/382 and Δ328/382, Δ59–162, Δ59/247, Δ59/328, Δ162/247, Δ162/328, and Δ247/328. The AF-1 function in hGR was characterized previously (8Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). To insert the BglII hMR segments generated by restriction site mutagenesis, we introduced new BglII sites in the N-terminal region of hGR cDNA by the substitutions hGR S71R/N72S (5′-GGCTCCAGATCTGCGCGA-3′) and hGR G261R/D262S. The hGR AF-1 function, hGRΔ71–262, was deleted by digestion withBglII. The hMR sequences were fused to the hGRΔ71–262 cDNA. Similar constructs were generated by insertion of the hMR segments in an AF-1-defective hMR cDNA clone. Mineralocorticoid receptor-deficient HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum stripped with dextran-coated charcoal (DCC-FBS). The cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 250-ml culture flasks and transfected with 960 μl of the calcium phosphate coprecipitate as described (9Warriar N., Yu, C. Pagé N. Govindan M.V. J. Biol.

Cells were subjected to glycerol shock (15% in Hepes buffered-saline solution) and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described. The cells were dislocated with trypsin, resuspended in minimal essential medium supplemented with DCC-FBS, distributed in 18 wells (25 mm, 500 × 103 cells/well), and treated overnight with hormones as indicated from a 1000-fold stock in ethanol. We conducted the transfection studies in CV-1 and HeLa cells in culture that express no endogenous functional hMR. We confirmed this by hormone binding, Western analyses, PCR amplification, and Northern analyses with specific probes. 2M. V. Govindan, unpublished data. For hormone-binding assays, cells were plated in 250-ml flasks and transfected with 15 μg of hMR expression plasmid (5Govindan M.V. Leclerc S. Roy R. Rathanaswamy P. Xie B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1991; 39: 91-103Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and 5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pCH 110 in 960 μl of precipitate. After glycerol shock and washing as described, 8 ml of fresh medium with 10% DCC-FBS were added and the cells grown to confluence. For transactivation assays, cells were harvested after 24 h, and extracts were prepared in 100 μl of 250 mm Tris containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.8. Lysis of the cells was conducted by three cycles of freeze-thaw. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in 10 μl of cell extract to normalize for transfection efficiency. Extracts containing 10 units of β-galactosidase were used to determine the CAT activity. For receptor binding assays, cells were collected by scraping with a rubber policeman, washed with PBS, and lysed by homogenization in buffer (50 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 150,000 ×g at 4 °C for 1 h to obtain cytosol. Receptor hormone binding was determined with 50 μl of cytosol aliquots (protein concentration adjusted to 2.5 mg/ml) using increasing concentrations of [1,2,6,7-3H]aldosterone (specific activity, 2.6–3.9 TBq/mmol) in the absence (total binding) and in the presence of 200-fold molar excess of radioinert aldosterone (nonspecific binding) overnight at 4 °C. Incubation was terminated by adding an equal volume of dextran-coated charcoal (0.5% Norit A charcoal, 0.05% Dextran T-70) in the homogenization buffer. Samples were treated for 10 min with occasional mixing, and the free steroid was removed by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 5 min. Bound radioactivity in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. Specific binding was between 23,600 and 27,800 cpm in 50 μl of cytosol with a 62.3% counting efficiency in a Wallac LKB 1411 scintillation counter. Specific binding (total minus nonspecific binding) was plotted by Scatchard analysis, and the equilibrium dissociation constant was calculated by linear regression. Transfected HeLa cells were incubated overnight with [35S]methionine in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS, harvested, resuspended in 250 μl of homogenization buffer containing 400 mm KCl, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g to yield soluble cellular extracts. Protein contents were determined by calorimetric method (Bio-Rad), and β-galactosidase activity was determined in an aliquot of 10 μl. The hMR was precipitated as described previously (5, 6,) with polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against the synthetic polypeptide of hMR( H2N-Phe452-Met-Asp-Gly-Ser-Tyr-Phe-Ser459-COOH) coupled to keyhole or rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against purified glutathioneS-transferase-hMR247–382 fusion protein. Fifty μl of antibodies at 1:1000 dilution recognized 17 pg of the receptor polypeptide and precipitated 84% [3H]aldosterone-bound hMR present in 100 μl of cytosol. The immune complexes were precipitated using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described before (5Govindan M.V. Leclerc S. Roy R. Rathanaswamy P. Xie B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1991; 39: 91-103Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a minigel apparatus (Bio-Rad). The track containing the marker standards was stained with Coomassie Blue. Control experiments were performed with labeled extracts with pre-immune serum as indicated. The gels were treated with EN3HANCE (DuPont), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Cells transfected with hMR expression vectors were collected by scraping with a rubber policeman and washed twice with PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of extraction buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with or without 1 μmaldosterone for 45 min on ice and then vortexed for 10 s. The samples were centrifuged for 10 s, and the supernatants were discarded. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer B (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fractions containing the DNA-binding proteins were stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The yield was 300–350 μg of protein/5 × 106cells. Extracts containing 1 unit of β-galactosidase (∼5 μg of total protein) were incubated with poly(dI·dC) on ice for 15 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture of 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 80 mm KCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA (DNA-binding buffer), and 10% glycerol. Radiolabeled synthetic double-stranded MRE (5,000 cpm) was added and incubated at room temperature. The hMR-DNA complexes and free probe were then separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel, run for 100 min at room temperature, dried, and autoradiographed using intensifying screens. Cells were concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in complete medium. After incubation with or without the addition of steroids for 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in cold 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4 at 20 °C) containing 250 mm sucrose and 1 mm EDTA. Lysis was performed by two cycles of freeze-thaw in the above buffer with the addition of 1.5 mm MgCl2 and CaCl2. Centrifugation at 5,000 × g separated the crude nuclear and cytosolic fractions. The cytosol was cleared by centrifugation at 105,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 Ultracentrifuge using TLA-100L rotor. The nuclear fraction was washed three times with the above buffer and then extracted with buffer containing 300 mm KCl for 30 min at 20 °C with occasional shaking. Following centrifugation, the protein concentrations and hormone binding activities were determined in an aliquot of the clear supernatant."
https://openalex.org/W2048048466,"A Chinese hamster cell line with a mutation in the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDPG:PP) gene leading to UDP-glucose deficiency as well as a revertant cell were previously isolated. We now show that the mutant cell is 10<sup>5</sup> times more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>phospholipase C (PLC) than the revertant cell. To clarify whether there is a connection between the UDP-glucose deficiency and the hypersensitivity to <i>C. perfringens</i> PLC, stable transfectant cells were prepared using a wild type UDPG:PP cDNA. Clones of the mutant transfected with a construct having the insert in the sense orientation had increased their UDP-glucose level, whereas those of the revertant transfected with a UDPG:PP antisense had reduced their level of UDP-glucose compared with control clones transfected with the vector. Exposure of these two types of transfectant clones to <i>C. perfringens</i> PLC demonstrated that a cellular UDP-glucose deficiency causes hypersensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of this phospholipase. Further experiments with genetically engineered <i>C. perfringens</i> PLC variants showed that the sphingomyelinase activity and the C-domain are required for its cytotoxic effect in UDP-glucose-deficient cells."
https://openalex.org/W1988756997,"The nucleotide binding to uncoupling protein (UCP-1) of brown adipose tissue is regulated by pH. The binding pocket of the nucleotide phosphate moiety has been proposed to be controlled by the protonization of a carboxyl group (pK ≈4.5) for both nucleoside diphosphates (NDP) and nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) (identified as Glu-190) and of a histidine (pK ≈7.2) for NTP only. Here we identify His-214 as a pH sensor specific for NTP binding only. In reconstituted UCP-1 from hamster, DEPC diminishes binding of NTP but not of NDP. It also prevents inhibition of H+ transport by NTP but not by NDP. Hamster UCP-1 expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was mutated to H214N resulting in only moderate change of the binding affinity for NTP (GTP) but a 10-fold affinity decrease with the bulkier substituent in H214W, whereas the affinity for NDP (ADP) was largely unchanged. The steep decrease with pH of the binding affinity for NTP in wild type (from pH 6.0 to 7.5) was much flatter in the mutants. Also, the pH dependence of binding and dissociation rates was diminished in these mutants. The transport of H+ and Cl− was not affected. Thus, His-214 is only involved in nucleotide binding, whereas, as previously shown, His-145 and His-147 are involved only in H+ transport. The results validate the earlier proposal of a histidine regulating the NTP binding in addition to a carboxyl group controlling both NTP and NDP binding. It is proposed that His-214 protrudes into the binding pocket for the γ-phosphate thus inhibiting NTP binding and that His214H+ is retracted by a background –CO2− group to give way for the γ-phosphate.

Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This affinity decrease with pH is stronger with nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP) than with the diphosphates. From the detailed analysis of the pK D/pH relation, a model was derived in which two H+ dissociating groups in the binding pocket of UCP are controlling the nucleotide binding (4Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1988; 21: 2950-2956Google Scholar, 5Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the protonation of an acidic residue (Glu or Asp) is prerequisite for binding both NDP and NTP and in addition the protonation of a His residue for NTP only. The dual pH control of NTP binding was regarded to be critical for relieving nucleotide binding within a narrow pH increase and thus to activate H+transport. Recently, we have been able to verify the existence of a –CO2H group as a pH sensor for nucleotide binding by using Woodward reagent K. This group was identified as Glu-190, which is located in the fourth transmembrane helix of UCP (6Winkler E. Wachter E. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using an expression system for UCP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrated that by mutagenic substitution of Glu-190 the affinity of nucleotide binding increased and became largely pH-independent (7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus the role of Glu-190 as a pH sensor for nucleotide binding in UCP was established. This encouraged the search for a His residue as a second pH sensor. Here we report the identification by mutagenesis of His-214 as a critical group participating in the pH control of NTP binding. The results provide evidence that sterical factors play a major role in the pH-dependent differentiation between nucleoside triphosphate versus diphosphate binding. In the neutral form His-214, suggested to be located in the binding pocket of the γ-phosphate, is concluded to protrude into the binding pocket, whereas in the charged state it is retracted by a background negative charge thus making space for the γ-phosphate. This pH-controlled movement of the His-214 is superimposed by the pH control of Glu-190 to produce the strong pH dependence of the nucleoside triphosphate binding, which should be of great importance for the regulation of the uncoupling activity of UCP. n-Decylpentaoxyethylene (C10E5), diethylpyrocarbonate, and Dowex 1-X8 (200–400 mesh) were obtained from Fluka. [14C]GTP, [14C]ADP, and [3H]GDP were from Amersham Corp. 2′-O-Dansyl-GTP was synthesized as described by Huang and Klingenberg (5Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The fluorescence dyes MQAE and pyranine (8-hydroxpyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid, trisodium salt) were purchased from Molecular Probes. The gene coding for UCP-1 from hamster was cloned in pEMBLyE4 vector (8Cesareni G. Murry J.A.H. Seltow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. 9. Plenum Publishing Corporation, New York1987: 135-154Crossref Google Scholar) under the control of the gal10/cyc1 promoter as described previously (7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Bienengraeber M. Echtay K.S. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The histidine mutant was generated by using an oligonucleotide-directed system (USE Mutagenesis Kit, Pharmacia). The CAT codon for His-214 was changed to the AAC and TGG codon for aspargine and tryptophan to construct H214N and H214W, respectively. The sequence of the mutant was verified by DNA sequencing, also checking for the absence of any other mutation in the UCP-coding frame. The S. cerevisiae strain W303 was transformed with a plasmid containing the mutation. Yeast transformants were grown in selective lactate medium, and expression was induced by adding 0.4% galactose. Mitochondria were isolated from yeast by differential centrifugation following a procedure previously described (7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were suspended in a solution containing 0.6 mmannitol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mmPMSF. Quantification of UCP incorporated in yeast mitochondria was performed by dansyl-GTP fluorescence titration. To remove endogenous residual bound nucleotide, mitochondria were treated with Dowex as mentioned previously (7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). UCP was isolated from yeast mitochondria using Triton X-100 as detergent according to the protocol described for hamster brown adipose tissue mitochondria (10Lin C.S. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) with modification as reported previously (7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified UCP was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles following a protocol previously described (7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, UCP was suspended with egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (phospholipid:protein = 500:1 by mass), a medium of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, for H+ transport or 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, for Cl− transport measurement in addition to 0.2 mm EDTA and 1 mm PMSF, and C10E5 (detergent:phospholipid = 1.4 by mass). Vesicle formation was accomplished by slow removal of the detergent with Bio-Beads SM-2 at 4 °C. The external solute was removed by passing the vesicle over a G-75 column. Vesicles for Cl− transport measurement were loaded with MQAE through diffusion for 17 h in the dark at 4 °C. UCP was isolated from mitochondria of brown fat adipose tissue and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles as described previously (11Klingenberg M. Winkler E. Huang S.-G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For H+uptake measurements, vesicles were loaded with 100 mmpotassium phosphate and 0.4 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Vesicles with a phospholipid concentration of 19 and 0.124 mg/ml protein were treated with increasing concentrations of DEPC (0 to 2.2 mm) resulting in DEPC:His ratio of 0–150 mol/residue. After modification by shaking for 1 h at 8 °C, the external solutes were removed from the proteoliposomes by Sephadex G-75 column, and the H+ transport measurements were performed as described (11Klingenberg M. Winkler E. Huang S.-G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using a low impedance combination pH electrode. For UCP expressed in yeast, H+ uptake activity was measured on an MPF-44A fluorescence spectrophotometer using pyranine fluorescence at λex = 467 nm and λem = 510 nm in a standard medium containing 280 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm Hepes, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 μm pyranine, pH 6.9, and 125 μm lauric acid. Valinomycin (2.5 μm) was added to initiate the K+ gradient-driven H+uptake. Cl− transport was measured by fluorescence of MQAE-loaded proteoliposome at λex = 355 nm and λem = 460 nm in a medium containing 4 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 155 mm KCl. Cl−influx was initiated by the addition of valinomycin (2 μm), and the rate (J CL) was determined using a two-point calibration method as described by Verkmanet al. (12Verkman A.S. Takla R. Sefton B. Basbaum C. Widdicombe J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4240-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1.JCL=[(Fi−Fs)(KCl+1/[Cl]s)]−1[dF(0)/dt](Eq. 1) The applied methods for transport measurements resembled those described previously (7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Binding titration with [14C]GTP and [14C]ADP followed in principle the published procedure using Dowex for removal of free radiolabeled nucleotide (4Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1988; 21: 2950-2956Google Scholar, 7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The binding rate of [14C]GTP was measured with an automated rapid mixing and separating sampling machine developed in our laboratory as described previously (7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nucleotide fluorescence derivative (dansyl-GTP) was applied for GTP dissociation rate determination. The dissociation was followed by the fluorescence decrease on addition of large excess ATP after fluorescence equilibrium of dansyl-GTP binding to UCP at λex = 350 nm and λem = 525 nm. The buffer used was 20 mm Hepes or Mes at 15 °C. For elucidating the proposed role of histidine in nucleotide binding, we applied the amino acid reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), which is reported to react primarily with histidine (13Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In experiments with hamster BAT mitochondria, the reagent inhibited nucleotide binding only at very high concentrations where also reactions with primarily amino groups and —SH groups occur. With isolated UCP, DEPC at a critical concentration of 80 mol/mol His present in UCP decreases the binding of GTP to 60% and of GDP to 85% (Fig. 1). However, at higher concentration no difference on the effect of DEPC can be seen between di- and triphosphate. The inhibition of nucleotide binding by DEPC increased strongly with the pH, indicating that the neutral form of His reacts with DEPC, in agreement with reports with other enzymes (14Brandsch M. Brandsch C. Ganapathy M.E. Chew C.S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Lim J. Turner A.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Bragg P.D. Hou C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the reconstituted system the effect of DEPC could be measured both on H+ transport and its inhibition by nucleotides as well as on the nucleotide binding. The results in Fig. 1 show that DEPC only minimally affects the H+ translocation activity of UCP at up to 150 mol of DEPC/mol of His present in UCP. The inhibition of H+transport by GDP or by GTP is differently influenced by DEPC. Whereas the inhibition by GDP is decreased by DEPC only from 86 to 78%, DEPC decreases dramatically the ability of GTP to inhibit to only 10%. Thus the interference of DEPC with the nucleotide interaction is highly selective for GTP as compared with GDP. In parallel binding measurements, GTP binding is found to be lowered with DEPC by 60%, whereas GDP binding is only marginally affected. These results indicate that histidine is involved specifically with the binding of GTP in accordance with the predictions. The use of dansyl-GTP titration allows quantification of H214N and H214W UCP incorporation into mitochondria which is estimated to about 2.5% of the total protein content similar to that of wt. Fig. 2 shows the SDS gel and immunoblot of isolated UCP and mitochondria, respectively. The isolated proteins from wt and His-214 mutant UCP are largely freed from two main contaminants, namely porin and ADP/ATP carrier. The yield of isolated wt and H214W UCP is 1.2–1.5% of total mitochondrial protein, but only 0.5–0.7% for H214N UCP which is half the amount obtained as compared with wt. The purity of the isolated wt and H214W protein is estimated to about 70% based on maximum binding of [14C]GTP in comparison to maximum binding of highly purified UCP from hamster. Since the binding capacity of the isolated H214N UCP is 40% less (as shown below), the purity of the isolated protein is estimated the same as the wt based on SDS gel comparison. H+uptake in proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified UCP requires a K+ diffusion potential negative inside, generated by the valinomycin-catalyzed efflux of K+ and high buffering capacity inside. Cl− uptake is induced by a K+diffusion potential positive inside, generated by the valinomycin-induced influx of K+. The rates of H+ and Cl− uptake are summarized in Fig. 3. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with H214W transport H+ and Cl− at the same rate as wt, but with H214N only to about 60% of wt. Treatment of the proteoliposomes with 100 μm GTP or GDP leads to 85% inhibition of transport activities for both wt and His-214 mutant UCP. The residual activity may be ascribed to inversely inserted UCP molecules, whose binding sites cannot be accessed by the nucleotides. The 40% lower transport activity of H214N mutant UCP is in line with the same percentage decrease in nucleotide binding capacity. Thus, the turnover of H214N in H+ and Cl− transport is the same as wt UCP. We can conclude that His-214 is not involved in the transport activities of UCP. To study the binding to isolated UCP of nucleoside tri- and diphosphate and its pH dependence, titration with [14C]GTP and [14C]ADP using the Dowex method (see “Experimental Procedures”) was performed at different pH values. GDP had to be replaced by ADP, as a purine nucleoside diphosphate, since no [14C]GDP available. The mass action plot evaluated from the concentration dependence with [14C]GTP (Fig. 4) gives aB max = 12 μmol/g of protein of GTP bound for wt, 15 μmol/g of protein for H214W, and 8 μmol/g of protein for H214N UCP. Thus the binding capacity is increased by 25% in H214W and reduced by 40% in H214N as compared with wt on isolation of UCP, whereas the binding determined for mitochondria is the same in the mutants and wt. A similar percentage variation is obtained with [14C]ADP. Table I lists theK D values of several binding experiments and titrations at pH 6.0, 6.8, and 7.5 for both [14C]GTP and [14C]ADP. The K D for [14C]GTP of wt increases 8-fold from 1.05 μm at pH 6.8 to 7.9 μm at pH 7.5, whereas in His-214 mutants a slight change in the affinity is observed with only 1.5-fold increase of K D in H214N and almost no variation in H214W from pH 6.8 to 7.5. In contrast to the low pH sensitivity shown with nucleoside triphosphate (GTP), the affinity of His-214 mutant to nucleoside diphosphate (ADP) is highly pH-sensitive. As shown in Table I and Fig. 4, the K D value for [14C]ADP increases by shifting the pH from 6.0 to 7.5 in H214W by the same factor, i.e, ≈12 times as in wt and ≈18 times in H214N.Table IDissociation constant (KD) of wild-type, H214N, and H214W UCP-1 by [C]GTP and [C]ADP at different pHUCPpH[14C]GTPK D[14C]ADPK DμmμmWild type6.00.391.056.81.053.167.57.9013.0H214N6.00.740.796.83.003.17.54.7014.6H214W6.05.80.976.89.42.467.59.512.5The K D values were evaluated from [14C]GTP titration of 200 μg/ml UCP on ice.The K D values were evaluated from [14C]ADP titration of 200 μg/ml UCP on ice. Open table in a new tab The K D values were evaluated from [14C]GTP titration of 200 μg/ml UCP on ice. The K D values were evaluated from [14C]ADP titration of 200 μg/ml UCP on ice. In order to elucidate further the involvement of His-214 on the pH regulation of nucleoside triphosphate binding, a kinetic study of [14C]GTP binding was performed. Binding and dissociation rate determinations supplement the equilibrium measurements and can reflect changes in affinity under conditions, e.g. low or very high affinity, where directK D determinations are difficult. Table II summarizes the rate constants (k on) evaluated from the initial slope according to the second-order reaction at different pH values. Thek on for the wt UCP decreases about 7-fold, from pH 6.5 to 7.5. For the two His-214 mutants, on the other hand, the time progress curves (Fig. 5) of binding clearly illustrate the slower binding at low pH and the faster binding rate at high pH as compared with wt. The k on of H214N and H214W changes slightly (1.4-fold) from pH 6.5 to 7.5 as compared with a 7-fold decrease in the case of wt.Table IIRates of [C]GTP binding and dansyl-GTP dissociation of wild-type, H214N, and H214W UCP-1 at different pH and 15 °CUCPpHk on × 10−3k off, × 10−3mssWild type6.00.254.96.50.2012.77.50.0356.0H214N6.00.167.16.50.0914.57.50.0722.3H214W6.00.112.76.50.078.87.50.0511.1k on were evaluated from time study of [14C]GTP binding to UCP at 15 °C.k off were evaluated from the fluorescence decrease on addition of large excess of ATP after binding of dansyl-GTP to isolated UCP protein at 15 °C. Open table in a new tab k on were evaluated from time study of [14C]GTP binding to UCP at 15 °C. k off were evaluated from the fluorescence decrease on addition of large excess of ATP after binding of dansyl-GTP to isolated UCP protein at 15 °C. For measuring the dissociation rates, the fluorescent nucleotide derivative (dansyl-GTP) was used and evaluated from the fluorescence decrease upon removal of dansyl-GTP on addition of large excess ATP. Table II lists the dissociation rates (k off) for wt, H214N, and H214W UCP at different pH values. Thek off with wt UCP increases about 5-fold from pH 6.5 to 7.5, whereas with H214N and H214W thek off changes just about 1.4-fold. Remarkably, the dissociation rate with H214W is lower than with wt and H214N at low pH. The pH dependence of the binding and dissociation rate constants are plotted in Fig. 6. As measured with [14C]GTP, the binding rate for wt UCP decreases with pH according to Δpk on/ΔpH ≈1, and the dissociation rate of dansyl-GTP increases with pH according to Δpk off/ΔpH ≈ −1. For H214N and H214W UCP, the k on and k offchange less between pH 6.5 and 7.5, resulting in almost zero slope of Δpk on/ΔpH and Δpk off/ΔpH. The regulation of the uncoupling activity of UCP is an important factor in the control of thermogenesis. The major players are fatty acids as activators and purine nucleotides as inhibitors of H+ transport by UCP. In addition, the variation of pH influences the nucleotide effect. In BAT cells even in the activated state the concentration of the inhibiting free ATP4− at pH 7.0 may still largely exceed the low K I and K D for this nucleotide. Only by increasing the pH above 7.0, the affinity for nucleotides may be sufficiently decreased for generating unliganded UCP (4Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1988; 21: 2950-2956Google Scholar). A model of the intracellular regulation will be suggested below. Interestingly, this affinity decrease expressed as ΔpK D/ΔpH is much steeper (−2) with nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP) than (−1) with diphosphates (GDP and ADP) so that with increasing pH, UCP may be rapidly relieved from the most abundant inhibitor ATP4−. This pH control was visualized to be due to two H+-dissociating groups at the nucleotide binding center of UCP, one –CO2H group common for both NDP and NTP and an additional group with a pK ≈7.2, e.g. His for NTP only. It was proposed that only the additional positive charge provided by HisH+ is necessary for binding of NTP4− but not for NDP3−. The –CO2H group pH sensor was previously identified as Glu-190 (6Winkler E. Wachter E. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It should be noted that out of the four His occurring in UCP, His-214 as well as His-145 and His-147 are conserved among UCP from all sources known so far. His-145 and His-147 have been found by mutagenesis to be involved in H+ translocation, but their replacement did not affect nucleotide binding and its pH dependence (9Bienengraeber M. Echtay K.S. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus only His-214 is left as a candidate for pH sensor of NTP binding. Indeed, here by mutagenesis the involvement of His-214 in nucleotide binding and its pH regulation are shown, although in a somewhat different version than predicted. Both identifications vindicate the original model derived from the pH dependence of nucleotide binding. These results contradict the nondocumented claims by Mordriansky et al. (17Mordriansky M. Murdza-Inglis D.L. Patel H.V. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24759-24762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that no histidine and specifically no His-214 is involved in nucleotide binding. The finding reported here that the His reagent DEPC inhibits binding of GTP but not of GDP and concomitantly that DEPC desensitizes H+ transport against the inhibition by GTP but not by GDP provides evidence for the involvement of a histidine residue in nucleoside triphosphate binding only. The fact that H+transport is unaffected by DEPC although both His-145 and His-147 have been previously shown to be involved specifically in H+transport points to a preferred sensitivity of His-214 toward DEPC. This suggests, in line with our model, that His-214 is located in the hydrophilic binding pocket for the γ-phosphate, where the hydrophilic DEPC can easily enter and due to a high resident time reacts preferably with His-214. In contrast, His-145 and His-147 are either not accessible or are on the surface where DEPC cannot reach a critical concentration. According to the original model, replacement of His by a neutral group should drastically lower the binding affinity for the nucleoside triphosphates. However, the binding affinity of GTP is found to persist in H214N but is much weaker in H214W. With increasing pH, the affinity decreases much less in H214N and H214W than in wt UCP. The mutations, however, do not change the binding affinity for ADP (which is used here to replace unavailable [14C]GDP) showing the same pH dependence as in wt UCP. Similarly, the rates of binding and dissociation as measured with [14C]GTP and fluorescent dansyl-GTP lose their strong pH dependence in the His-214 mutants. As a result of the low pH dependence, the affinity for GTP is somewhat lower at pH 6.8 in His-214 mutants and especially in H214W than in wt but is distinctly higher at pH 7.5. This crossover is also clearly seen in the pH dependence of the binding and dissociation rates. The slower dissociation rate of fluorescent (dansyl-GTP) nucleotide observed in H214W versus H214N seems to contradict the lower affinity of His-214 as measured with [14C]GTP. Possibly the dansyl derivative of GTP has an additional interaction with the introduced Trp side chain. The substitution of His-214 by aspargine lowers the stability of UCP upon isolation from mitochondria, and thus the content of intact UCP is about 40% of wt as determined by GTP binding, whereas on substitution by tryptophan, the protein retains its stability. Correspondingly, the capacity for transporting H+ and Cl− is decreased by about 40% in the H214N and is retained completely in H214W mutant. In relation to the GTP-binding capacity as a measure of intact UCP, the transport activities in H214N are unchanged as compared with wt. Thus, the results with both mutants show that His-214 is not involved in H+ and Cl− transport. This agrees with the broad evidence that the nucleotide-binding site is not in the translocation channel (18Klingenberg M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Rial E. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Kopecky J. Jezek P. Drahota Z. Houstek J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). His-214, located at the c side of the 5th transmembrane helix, seems to be close to the previously established pH sensor Glu-190, located at the c side of the 4th helix. Thus His-214 as well as Glu-190 could be located in the binding pocket for the phosphate moiety of the nucleotide. According to the original model, a His (now His-214) should be primarily in contact with the γ-phosphate, whereas a –CO2H (now Glu-190) should be at the gate for accessing both nucleoside di- and triphosphate (Fig. 7). Furthermore, HisH+ was assumed to form an ion bond with γ-phosphate. The marked decrease of the pH dependence of nucleoside triphosphate but not diphosphate binding is in line with the role of His-214 as a pH sensor. However, the retention of NTP binding in His-214 mutants requires a change of our model. At low pH, in H214N, the affinity is only slightly lower than in wt UCP, indicating that HisH+ does not contribute to NTP binding. It now seems that His-214 in the neutral form, abundant at pH > 7 repulses NTP, since the replacement of His by Asn increases affinity at high pH. Our new model, as illustrated in Fig. 7, retained the assumption that His is located at the end of the binding pocket. It shows that the imidazole of the neutral His protrudes into the pocket, thus sterically restraining the binding of triphosphate. On protonization, the HisH+ group is retracted by a background –CO2− group, thus leaving space for the γ-phosphate. In H214N the smaller Asn side chain does not restrain γ-phosphate binding, and the pH control is largely lost. In H214W the bulkier side chain may at least partially protrude into the binding pocket as judged from the 9-fold lower binding affinity. In agreement with this model, the His-DEPC derivative, which is unable to accept a H+ and has its hydrophilic extension, would protrude into the binding pocket at any pH and thus block NTP but not NDP binding. In conclusion, out of the four His only His-214 essentially fulfills the criteria of an additional pH controller specific for NTP binding. Together with the previously identified pH sensor Glu-190, it provides an additional pH regulation of the H+ transport activity of UCP. Both work by changes of electrostatic interaction on H+ binding. Glu-190 as a gatekeeper at the entrance to the phosphate binding pocket, common to NDP and NTP, opens the pocket on protonation, and His-214 makes space for the γ-phosphate of NTP when being retracted as HisH+ by a negative background charge. How can the strong pH dependence of NTP binding be incorporated into a consistent picture of the regulation of uncoupling in BAT cells? The major binding nucleotide to UCP can be assumed to be ATP. In the resting state, at high Mg2+ and at pH ≈7, the free ATP4−:ADP3− ratio is still high despite the lower affinity of ADP3− for Mg2+. Thus, UCP may be well saturated by ATP4−, and evidence for this has been presented by showing that UCP in mitochondria isolated from short term warm-adapted BAT is masked to a large extent by ATP (22Huang S.-G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). LaNoueet al. (23LaNoue K.F. Koch C.D. Meditz R.B. J. Biol.

They estimated that due to the small volume of cytosol in BAT, a small load on ATP would drastically lower the cytosolic ATP concentration. The norepinephrine-induced FA release and ensuing FA activation would generate this ATP load. In addition, lowering the Δψ on redistribution of ATP into mitochondria contributes to the decrease of cytosolic ATP. The results also suggest that FA somehow modulates the ATP effect on UCP (24LaNoue K.F. Strzelecki T. Strzelecka D. Koch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 298-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown by us (25Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that there is no competition of FA with nucleotide binding. Therefore we argue that the putative FA effect on ATP inhibition has to be identified with a pH increase to >7.2. After norepinephrine stimulation, mitochondria are flooded with free FA. Their uptake into the matrix can cause a cytosolic pH increase which is becoming more important since the ratio of the cytosol to mitochondrial volume is small. In fact, a 0.8 unit increase of the cytosolic pH relative to mitochondria has been determined on strong load with FA in rat liver perfused with octanoate (26Soboll S. Gründel S. Schwabe U. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to lowering the affinity to UCP, the pH increase lowers the ATP4− concentration in favor of ATP-Mg2+formation. Furthermore, as shown by Huang et al. (27Huang S.-G. Lin Q.-S. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 859-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the increase of pH strongly facilitates the otherwise strikingly low dissociation of ATP from UCP. At this point we cannot exclude other mechanisms of pH increase, such as signaling by FA of pH regulation units, e.g. the Na+/H+ exchanger, either directly by FA or by AMP which is drastically increased in the cytosol. This mechanism of the uncoupling regulation in BAT is at variance with that proposed by Nicholls and co-workers (28Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 29Rial E. Poustie A. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) who assume that nucleotide binding and dissociation do not play a role in the acute regulation but that in vivo only FA regulates the conductivity of UCP to H+. Nucleotides are assumed to be permanently bound and to shift the conductivity/voltage relation to a nonlinear dependence. Uncoupling occurs with a break potential of 150–170 mV. However, the measurements on isolated BAT indicate that with norepinephrine Δψ decreases to about 60 mV (24LaNoue K.F. Strzelecki T. Strzelecka D. Koch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 298-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that is into a range where conductivity of UCP with bound nucleotide would be very low. It is noteworthy that in the new UCP members, UCP-2 and UCP-3, both Glu-190 and His-214 are conserved, although the homology to UCP-1 is only 59% in UCP-2 and 57% in UCP-3 (30Fleury C. Neverova M.

Based on the present results, this indicates that in UCP-2 and UCP-3, nucleotide binding and its pH control follow similar principles as found here for UCP-1. In contrast, His-145 and His-147, previously identified to participate in the H+ transport of UCP-1, are not conserved in UCP-2 and UCP-3, indicating a variant mechanism of fatty acid-dependent H+ transport.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs contain widely prescribed agents, including aspirin and salicylic acid. It is well documented that aspirin exerts its anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX),1 which is a key enzyme in catalyzing the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (1Vane J.R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7306) Google Scholar, 2Roth G.J. Standford N. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Aspirin has weak and nonselective anti-COX action, whereas salicylate is inactive against COX-2, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory action of aspirin and salicylate may be mediated by a mechanism other than inhibition of COX activity. We postulate that salicylate may suppress certain inducible genes that are important in inflammation and tumor cell proliferation. To identify and isolate new inducible genes whose expression is suppressed by salicylate, we performed mRNA differential display utilizing human fibroblasts that were untreated, treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or treated with PMA and salicylate. A series of genes were identified. In this report we describe the isolation of a full-length cDNA that has sequence homology with genes in the cullin/Cdc53 (CUL) family (7Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Searching the GenBankTM DNA data base reveals that our cDNA sequence matches the reported partial sequence of human CUL-3 (7Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Our results show that Hs-CUL-3 is widely distributed in human tissues. Its expression in human fibroblasts is increased by PMA, and this increase is suppressed by salicylate. Furthermore, its expression is increased in cultured COLO205 colon cancer cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a 1:100 dilution of an antibiotic-antimycotic solution. When reaching near-confluence, the cells were cultured in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 22–24 h and then treated with 100 nm PMA for 3 h before harvest. Sodium salicylate, which was dissolved in culture medium at 1 m concentration, was added to the medium at the final concentration of 1 or 10 mm 30 min before PMA treatment. Human colon CCD-33Co cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 10% FBS, and antibiotic-antimycotic solution. Human colon adenocarcinoma COLO205 cells were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotic-antimycotic solution. All the tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. mRNA differential display was done as described by Liang and Pardee (8Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar) using an RNAmap kit (GenHunter). Briefly, total RNA pretreated with DNase I using a MessageClean kit (GenHunter) was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and an anchored oligo-d(T) primer, followed by the PCR reaction with the same oligo-d(T) primer and a second arbitrary primer. PCR was performed under the following conditions: 94 °C, 30 s; 40 °C, 2 min; 72 °C, 30 s for 40 cycles followed by 72 °C for 5 min, in the presence of [33P]dATP. An equal amount of PCR products from each reaction was electrophoresed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried on 3M paper and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film overnight. Bands of interest were excised and eluted from the gel, reamplified with the same primer set, and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). To obtain full-length cDNA sequence of Hs-CUL-3, the 5′-RACE approach was used. First, cDNA was synthesized from mRNA isolated from PMA-treated fibroblasts. Adaptor ligation and PCR were performed by using a marathon cDNA amplification kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (CLONTECH). Plasmids containing CUL-3 cDNA sequences were sequenced by chain-termination DNA sequencing method with T7 Sequenase version 2.0 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GenBankTM data base was used for sequence search and Lasergene (DNAstar, Inc.) for sequence analysis and alignment. The procedure was described previously (9Zembowicz A. Tang A.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17006-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA (5 or 10 μg) was applied to and run on 1% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred onto positively charged nylon membrane. Filters were hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled full-length Hs-CUL-3cDNA and, after stripping, rehybridized with [32P]dUTP-labeled GAPDH RNA probe as control. Premade human multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased fromCLONTECH (number 7760-1). According to the manufacturer's information, each lane was loaded with ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from whole heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas tissues. The premade blot was hybridized with full-length Hs-CUL-3 cDNA probe and, after stripping, rehybridized with human β-actin cDNA probe as control. Of a number of cDNA fragments identified from the differential display sequencing gels, one was of particular interest because a search of the GenBankTM revealed that the sequence of this 408-bp fragment was homologous to the recently identified CUL multigene family, especially CUL-3 (7Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Although the 3013-bp Caenorhabditis elegans CUL-3 (Ce-CUL-3) appears to be a full-length cDNA encoding a 780-amino acid polypeptide, the human CUL-3 cDNA (Hs-CUL-3) sequence in the expressed sequence tag data base is only 2092 bp in length, which lacks the 5′-coding sequence (7Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We used 5′-RACE with a Hs-CUL-3-specific oligonucleotide primer and amplified a 757-bp fragment at the 5′-region. Sequencing results showed that this fragment overlapped with the reported 2092-bp sequence of Hs-CUL-3 cDNA and contained an additional 5′-coding region, extending the sequence from 2092 to 2653 bp. A search of the expressed sequence tag data base with the extended 5′-end sequence identified a 484-bp 5′-end cDNA sequence, further adding 83 bp to the 5′-end of the Hs-CUL-3cDNA sequence. The overall cDNA sequence of Hs-CUL-3is 2746 bp (Fig. 1). It contains a single open reading frame that encodes a putative protein of 768 amino acid residues. The sequence (ACCATGT) containing the putative translation initiation site complies with Kozak's rule (10Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 11Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting that the Hs-CUL-3 cDNA we cloned contained a complete coding region. Similar consensus sequences were also found in other members of CUL family. Hs-CUL-3 is a basic protein with a predicted molecular weight of 88,939 kDa. The amino acid sequence homology between Hs-CUL-3 and Ce-CUL-3 is 46%, whereas the similarity of Hs-CUL-3 to other CUL proteins is 17–27%. The C-terminal region of all CUL proteins is highly conserved (Fig. 2).Figure 2Amino acid sequence comparison of Hs-CUL-3 with Ce-CUL-3, Hs-CUL-1, Hs-CUL-2, and S. cerevisiaeCDC53.

It is notable that two CUL-3 transcripts were detected in all of these Northern blots with a major band of about 2.8 kb and a minor band of about 4.3 kb. This induction was inhibited by salicylate at 1–10 mm (Fig. 3 C). These results corroborated theHs-CUL-3 expression pattern in mRNA differential display. As shown in Fig. 3 D, only PMA caused an increase in CUL-3 mRNA expression. Interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, or lipopolysaccharide had no effect. The Hs-CUL-3 mRNA level was increased in COLO205 colon cancer cells when compared with normal colon cells (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that CUL-3 may be involved in cell proliferation. Both the major 2.8-kb and the minor 4.3-kb bands of CUL-3 transcripts were detected in parallel in human tissues examined with different intensities (Fig. 4 B). The highest expression level was observed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues. A relatively high expression level was also found in placenta. In liver and lung,Hs-CUL-3 transcripts were scarcely detected. The β-actin mRNA level was also highest in heart and skeletal muscle tissues as reported previously.Figure 4Analysis of the expression of human CUL-3 mRNA in COLO205 colon cancer cells and in different tissues by Northern hybridization. A, 10 μg of total RNA from normal colon cells (lane 1) or COLO205 colon cancer cells (lane 2) was loaded. Membranes were probed forHs-CUL-3 and reprobed for GAPDH. The hybridization signals were quantitated using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Values for the 2.8-kb Hs-CUL-3 transcript were normalized to GAPDH transcript levels and expressed relative to control.

Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In this study, we report for the first time isolation of the full-lengthHs-CUL-3 cDNA, which shares with other members of human CUL proteins only between 20 and 35% of the overall amino acid sequence identity. The function of CUL proteins remains to be ascertained. In C. elegans, mutation of CUL-1 causes hyperplasia of all tissues, leading to the suggestion that it is a required element for developmentally programmed cell cycle exit from G1 to G0 (7Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In yeast, Cdc53 was reported to target phosphorylated G1 cyclins for degradation by the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway (12Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N.

Byers B. Goebl M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6634-6643Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cdc53 forms a ubiquitin ligase complex named SCFCdc4 with Skp1 and Cdc4 to catalyze ubiquitin-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of Sic1, an S-phase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (14Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar,15Feldman R.M.R. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The inactivation of Sic1 is required for G1 to S phase transition (16Schwob E. Boehm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Selective recognition of phosphorylated Sic1 is controlled by Cdc4, and the interaction between Cdc4 and Sic1 is enhanced by Skp1. Cdc53 is thought to function as an adapter linking Skp1/Cdc4 to Cdc34. A similar model has been proposed for a human protein complex consisting of CUL-1, p19Skp1, and p45Skp2, a protein required for S phase in human (17Lisztwan J. Marti A. Sutterluty H. Gstaiger M. Wirbelauer C. Krek W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Despite a low degree of overall sequence identity with other members of CUL family, Hs-CUL-3 shares with them a high level of homology at several regions, especially at the C-terminal region, suggesting a closely related structure. It is likely that Hs-CUL-3, like CUL-1 and Cdc53, may be involved in regulating cell cycle progression. Given that each component of the proposed yeast ubiquitin ligase complex SCFCdc4, i.e. Cdc4, Cdc53, and Skp1, belongs to a distinct protein family, the proposed SCFCdc4model may represent a prototype for a variety of ubiquitin ligase complex E3s. This is supported by a recent report that degradation of G1 cyclin Cln2 in yeast appears to require a ubiquitin ligase complex consisting of Cdc53, Skp1, and Grr1, instead of Cdc4 (12Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Kobayashi R. Wittenberg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18Barral Y. Jentsch S. Mann C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Both Cdc4 and Grr1 contain a conserved sequence, F-box, through which they bind to Skp1 (19Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In human, CUL-1 forms a stable protein complex with F-box-containing protein p45Skp2 and p19Skp1, a human homologue of yeast Skp1 (17Lisztwan J. Marti A. Sutterluty H. Gstaiger M. Wirbelauer C. Krek W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Hs-CUL-2 is also shown to be associated with elongin C and the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (20Pause A. Lee S. Worrell R.A. Chen D.Y.T. Burgess W.H. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2156-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 21Lonergan K.M. Iliopoulos O.

Elongin C appears to be a homologue of Skp1, whereas elongin A and elongin B, two proteins associated with elongin C, contain F-box and ubiquitin-like sequences (19Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an anaphase-promoting complex (APC) subunit, APC2, is found in yeast and human that contains a conserved CUL domain (22Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Andrews P.D. Ciosk R. Galova M. Stark M.J.R. Mann M. Nasmyth K. Science. 1998; 279: 1216-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 23Yu H. Peters J.-M. King R.W. Page A.M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W.

Galova M. Stark M.J.R. Mann M. Nasmyth K. Science. 1998; 279: 1216-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate a possible role for the CUL proteins in cell cycle protein ubiquitination and cell cycle control. Based on sequence homology, we speculate that Hs-CUL-3 also participates in cell cycle protein ubiquitination. Phosphorylation and degradation by the ubiquitin proteolytic pathways are considered to be a common mechanism for controlling many regulatory proteins. Diverse SCF-like ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathways may be present in eukaryotic cells (14Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), which may play a broad role in regulating biological processes such as cell proliferation (15Feldman R.M.R. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In this study we found that Hs-CUL-3 mRNA levels are stimulated by PMA in human fibroblasts and are increased in COLO205 colon cancer cells. These results suggest that CUL-3 is involved in cell proliferation through its participation in SCF complex formation. It is interesting to note that salicylate suppresses CUL-3 mRNA accumulation by PMA. Sodium salicylate and aspirin have been shown to suppress gene expressions via inhibition of IκB phosphorylation and degradation and consequently blocking NF-κB activation (24Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 25Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J.

For this reason it is believed that part of the function of the Gcn5·Ada complex is chromatin remodeling effected by histone acetylation. The roles of the other subunits of this complex are not yet known. We have generated mutated Gcn5 proteins with severely attenuated in vitro HAT activities. Despite their apparent loss in HAT activity, these GCN5 derivatives complemented all the defects of a gcn5 strain. We have shown that when these mutated proteins were produced in yeast cells in the absence of another component of the complex, Ada2, their activity was still compromised. By contrast, when produced in the wild type context, they were partially capable of acetylating free histones and were even more active when nucleosomal arrays were used as substrates. Kinetic enzymatic analyses showed that the rate of catalysis by Gcn5 was enhanced when the mutated proteins were produced in yeast in the presence of Ada2. Because Ada2 is required for the assembly of Gcn5, we conclude that one role for components of the Gcn5·Ada complex is the potentiation of its HAT activity.

By contrast, when produced in the wild type context, they were partially capable of acetylating free histones and were even more active when nucleosomal arrays were used as substrates. Kinetic enzymatic analyses showed that the rate of catalysis by Gcn5 was enhanced when the mutated proteins were produced in yeast in the presence of Ada2. Because Ada2 is required for the assembly of Gcn5, we conclude that one role for components of the Gcn5·Ada complex is the potentiation of its HAT activity. histone acetyltransferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis His-145 → Ala (HA) Cys-252 → Ala HA,CA double mutant. A multitude of cellular operations is accomplished through the coordinated function of multisubunit protein complexes. Individual subunits within such complexes satisfy at least one of three general requirements: an enzymatic activity, a targeting function that ensures action in the proper cellular location with the appropriate molecular contacts, and a regulatory function that controls the manifestation of these activities. It follows that a prerequisite for the mechanistic and biological elucidation of the function of a multisubunit complex is the understanding of the role that each subunit serves. Transcription of genes by the eucaryotic RNA polymerase II is one example of an operation that depends on the concerted action of a number of multisubunit complexes. Although elegant genetic and biochemical experiments have led to the molecular identification of these complexes and to the comprehension of the general aspects of their requirement, for only a small number of subunits the function is known. Polymerase II transcription involves promoter recognition effected by TFIID, TFIIB, and TFIIA, recruitment of polymerase II-mediated by TFIIF, and transcription initiation catalyzed by TFIIE and TFIIH (reviewed in Refs. 1Orphanides G.

A. 1997; 94: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). An additional complex, the mediator, is required to convey activating signals from transcriptional activators to the basic transcriptional machinery and is part of the polymerase II holoenzyme (3Kim Y.

Finally, the function of a third group of complexes is required to alleviate the repressing effect that the nucleosomal organization of DNA imposes on all the above interactions.

Subunits of the yeast Gcn5·Ada complex were first identified by genetic screens aiming in the isolation of transcriptional co-activators (15Berger S. Pina B. Silverman N. Marcus G. Agapite J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4145-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have further indicated that Gcn5, Ada2, and Ada3 physically interact and that it is this complex that mediates transcriptional activation by a number of acidic activators (17Marcus G. Silverman N. Berger S. Horiuchi J. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Georgakopoulos T. Gounalaki N. Thireos G. Mol. Gen.

It is believed that this complex is brought to the promoters through physical interactions between the Ada2 component and the activation domains (21Silverman N. Agapite J. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11665-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Barlev N. Candau R. Wang L. Darpino P. Silverman N. Berger S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19337-19344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The finding that the Gcn5 component is a histone acetyltransferase (13Brownell J. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D. Roth S. Allis D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar) promoted the hypothesis that at least part of the function of the complex was the acetylation of the N termini of nucleosomal histones. This modification has been proposed to effect a conformational change in chromatin structure, thereby facilitating the process of transcription (23Lee D. Hayes J. Pruss D. Wolffe A. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 24Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This notion was in agreement with numerous previous observations that correlated active transcription with acetylated chromatin (reviewed in Ref. 25Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was recently shown that the in vivoHAT1 activity of Gcn5 is essential for the function of the complex in transcriptional activation (26Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis D.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 27Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and that this activity correlates with the acetylation state of the chromatin within the promoter region of genes (26Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis D.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical analyses offered support for a second function of this complex. Gcn5, Ada2, and Ada3 have been found to co-purify in at least three biochemically distinct multisubunit complexes, 0.2, 0.8, and 2.0 MDa in size (14Grant P. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S. Brownell J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), all possessing Gcn5-dependent HAT activity. In addition, the largest complex was found to contain a number of proteins, among them members of the Spt family of proteins (14Grant P. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S. Brownell J. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis D. Winston F. Berger S. Workman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). It was known from genetic and biochemical studies that this Spt group of proteins have broader roles in transcriptional activation compared with the Gcn5·Ada proteins, and some of them interact directly with TATA-binding protein (30Eisenmann D. Arndt K. Ricupero S. Rooney J. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). All this evidence suggested that this large complex functionally links acidic activation domains (through Ada2) with the TATA-binding protein (through the Spts), whereas the HAT activity of the complex modifies nucleosomes, further stabilizing the binding of activators and TATA-binding protein on chromosomal DNA templates. Apart from the Gcn5 HAT activity and the molecular interactions that have been defined for some components of the complex (17Marcus G. Silverman N. Berger S. Horiuchi J. Guarente L.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3206-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), no role has yet been assigned for any other subunits of the Gcn5·Ada complex. Gcn5 can acetylate nucleosomal histones H3, H2B, and H4 in vitro only when located within its native complexes (14Grant P. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S. Brownell J. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis D. Winston F. Berger S. Workman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 34Yang X. Ogryzko V. Nishikawa J. Howard B. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). By contrast, both a bacterially produced Gcn5 and a Gcn5·Ada2/Ada3 reconstituted trimmer were unable to modify nucleosomal substrates but were efficient in acetylating free core histones (14Grant P. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S. Brownell J. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis D. Winston F. Berger S. Workman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that other subunits within the complex regulate the Gcn5 HAT activity. In this study we demonstrate that indeed the assembly of Gcn5 within its native complex enhances the catalytic properties of its HAT activity. The gcn5 and gcn5ada2 strains were obtained by appropriate gene disruptions of a GAL2 S288C parental strain with the genotypeMATa trp1–1 leu2–3 ura3–52, as described in Ref. 18Georgakopoulos T. Gounalaki N. Thireos G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. Complete medium (yeast/peptone/glucose) and minimal medium supplemented with the required amino acids were used for yeast growth and transformations (35Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed using the lithium chloride method (36Ito H. Fucuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheGCN5 coding region, generated by polymerase chain reaction, was cloned in the pALTER-Ex1 vector (Promega), and site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutagenic oligonucleotides were: for the His-145 → Ala mutation (HA) 5′-CAGCCATGGAAAGTGCACTTCGATCATAGAC-3′ and for the Cys-252 → Ala mutation (CA) 5′-GGTAACATAGAAGCTTGCATCAGCGTACC-3′, whereas the double mutant was generated using the CA mutagenic oligonucleotide on the HA-GCN5 template. Verification of the mutagenesis was accomplished by sequence analysis. For bacterial protein expression, wild type GCN5 and each one of the mutant genes were subcloned into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) and produced in Escherichia coli cells (XL1-Blue) as fusion proteins with 6-His residues at the N′ terminus. Crude extracts from isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside-induced cultures were prepared by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100), and recombinant proteins were purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography according to the technical manual (Qiagen). Constructions of the LexA-GCN5 fusion derivatives were done as in Ref. 18Georgakopoulos T. Gounalaki N. Thireos G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. Native (untagged) Gcn5 protein derivatives were produced through the pYX142 yeast expression vector (Novagen). TheLexA-ADA2 containing plasmid is described in Ref. 18Georgakopoulos T. Gounalaki N. Thireos G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. Liquid HAT assays were performed using either bacterially expressed Gcn5 proteins or immunoprecipitated complexes from yeast extracts (see below). Typical 20-μl reactions contained 10 μg of core histones (free or nucleosomal), 0.25 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (5Ci/mmol), and HAT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of SDS-sample buffer, and the mixture was loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue and fluorography. Under these conditions the incorporation of radioactivity was linear for the first 10 min, and both the amount of histones as well as the concentration of [3H]acetyl-CoA (2.5 μm) were saturating. Kinetic experiments were performed using histone H3. Reactions were initiated by the addition of [3H]acetyl-CoA and stopped by spotting on Whatman P81 cellulose membranes. Membranes were first washed with 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.2, then briefly with acetone, and dried, and the radioactivity was counted in scintillation fluid. In-gel HAT activity assays were performed as described in Ref. 37Brownell J. Allis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar. Crude yeast extracts were prepared from 50 ml of exponentially grown cultures by vortexing pelleted cells with glass beads in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation (13000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously reacted with LexA-antibody. Sepharose beads with bound immunocomplexes were washed three times with extraction buffer and three times with HAT buffer before use in liquid acetylation assays. In vitroreconstitution of mono- or oligonucleosomes was carried out using a 200-base pair (generated by polymerase chain reaction) or a 1100-base pair BglI DNA fragment derived from pUC19. The DNA template was mixed with purified core histones (Boehringer Mannheim) at an equimolar histone/DNA ratio in 2 m NaCl. Gradient salt dialysis reconstitution was performed by decreasing the salt concentration from 2 to 0.25 m NaCl (38Workman J. Kingston E. Science. 1992; 258: 1780-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were fractionated by centrifugation (35,000 rpm for 19 h at 4 °C on a Beckman SW41 rotor) through a 5–30% linear sucrose gradients in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. 1-ml fractions were collected, and those containing reconstituted nucleosomes were concentrated using NanoSpin-Plus centrifugal filters (Gelman Sciences) and used either as substrate in liquid acetylation assays or for micrococcal nuclease digestions. The latter were performed in a buffer containing 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol using 0.015–0.03 units/μl of micrococcal nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 min at 25 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding 2 mm EDTA and 0.5% SDS, were phenol/chloroform-extracted, and the DNA was resolved in 1.5% native agarose gel. After DNA transfer onto nylon membranes, the digestion pattern was detected by hybridization using the 1.1-kilobaseBglI fragment of pUC 19. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-6-His or anti-LexA primary antibodies (Santa Cruz), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega), and the BCIP/NBT detection system (Promega). To investigate the role of the gcn5HAT activity for the function of the Gcn5·Ada complex, we designed and generated mutations that affected this activity. We have targeted the mutations on two amino acids, His-145 and Cys-252, which were previously suggested to be important for HAT activity (13Brownell J. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D. Roth S. Allis D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Both of these amino acids are within the HAT domain of Gcn5 (Fig. 1 A). Three mutants were generated: His-145 → Ala (HA), Cys-252 → Ala (CA), and the double mutant (HACA). The mutated proteins were produced in E. colias fusions with the 6-His tag and purified using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography, and their HAT activity was assayed in vitro using saturating amounts of free histones as substrate. As shown in Fig. 1 B, under these assay conditions the wild type Gcn5 protein preferentially acetylated histone H3 and to a lesser extent histone H2B (Fig. 1 B, middle panel). For equal amounts of proteins, as judged by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 B, upper panel), the HA and CA derivatives exhibited considerably diminished activity, whereas the HACA derivative had completely lost the ability to acetylate free histones. We have noticed that the in vitroactivity of recombinant Gcn5 varied depending on the relative impurities of the nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography procedure. To control for this we used the in-gel HAT activity assay through which the activity of electrophoretically resolved HATs can be monitored. As shown in Fig. 1 C, this method confirmed the attenuated character of the Gcn5 mutant derivatives. To investigate the in vivo properties of the mutated Gcn5 proteins, the three mutant GCN5 genes were expressed in agcn5 yeast strain either as LexA fusions (driven by the ADH1 promoter) or as native genes (driven by theTPI promoter). The LexA-Gcn5 fusion protein is functional in yeast (18Georgakopoulos T. Gounalaki N. Thireos G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All three mutant genes, despite the apparent compromised HAT activity of the corresponding proteins in vitro, complemented the known gcn5 phenotypes to their full extent. Thus, these GCN5 derivatives complemented the slow growth rates observed in gcn5 strains grown under all nutritional conditions (Fig. 2 A), and the inability of gcn5 strains to grow under histidine starvation conditions (Fig. 2 B). These observations were further quantified by testing the ability of the Gcn4 transcriptional activator to fully induce the expression of appropriate genes. For both natural (through Northern blot analysis of the HIS3 mRNA) and artificial genes (through β-galactosidase assays), we observed that the Gcn5 mutant derivatives fully supported the function of Gcn4 (data not shown). The above results suggested that the HAT activity of Gcn5 might not be essential for its in vivo function. To investigate this possibility, we monitored the HAT activity of the Gcn5 derivatives produced in yeast cells. This was accomplished by immunoprecipitating LexA fusion derivatives from yeast extracts using a LexA antiserum and protein-A-Sepharose as immunoadsorbent. Subsequent assays were performed in the Sepharose beads using a mixture of all four core histones as substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Based on the fact that LexA fusion derivatives of either Ada2 or Gcn5 are functional in yeast, we anticipated that such immunocomplexes should contain Gcn5·Ada complexes. To test this, we produced immunoprecipitates from ada2 or ada2gcn5strains transformed with the LexA-ADA2 gene. Although the method produced a background acetylation on histones H2B and H4, even in the presence of just the LexA protein, a Gcn5-dependent acetylation of histones H3 and H2B was clearly evident (Fig. 3 A), demonstrating that the endogenous Gcn5 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with the LexA-Ada2 protein. By contrast, when acetylation of histones was effected by LexA-Gcn5 produced in the absence of Ada2, mainly histone H3 was modified. Next, we tested the activity of immunoprecipitated complexes from agcn5 or a gcn5ada2 strain expressing the variousLexA-GCN5 derivatives. As shown in Fig. 3 B(upper panel), the immunoprecipitates containing the wild type fusion protein produced in either the gcn5 or thegcn5ada2 strain efficiently acetylated histone H3. By contrast immunoprecipitates containing the HACA derivative were weakly active for H3 acetylation only when produced in the presence of theADA2 gene. Similarly, the ability of the HA and CA derivatives to acetylate histone H3 was notably enhanced when those were produced in the presence of ADA2, with the CA mutant exhibiting an appreciable activity even when produced in its absence. To control for the amount of fusion protein present in each immunoprecipitate used in these assays, we performed immunoblot analysis on the upper half of the same gel used to resolve the acetylated histones. As shown in Fig. 3 B (lower panel), the amount of the fusion protein present in each pair of strains demonstrated that the above acetylation activities were not due to major quantitative differences but reflected the specific activities of the Gcn5 derivatives. Due to the persisting background acetylation, differences observed in these experiments concerning the acetylation of H2B could not easily be assessed. To resolve this, immunoprecipitates were also tested for HAT activity histone solely using H2B as a substrate. The resulting acetylation pattern confirmed that the HACA fusion protein was inactive when produced in the absence of Ada2 but gained part of its HAT activity toward H2B when produced in the wild type context (Fig. 3 C). Analogous results were obtained using the other mutated derivatives (not shown). We concluded that the HAT activity of the mutated Gcn5 proteins was enhanced when produced in wild type strains in an Ada2-dependent manner. To assess what enzymatic property of Gcn5 was improved when produced in the presence of ADA2, we performed kinetic enzymatic analyses using immunoprecipitates from gcn5 and gcn5ada2 strains producing the LexA-HA derivative. This derivative was chosen because it was measurably active when produced in the absence of Ada2. The kinetic experiments were performed using saturating amounts of [3H]acetyl-CoA and equivalent amounts of enzyme from the two strains as indicated by immunoblot analysis (not shown). Using histone H3, we first determined that for both enzymes this substrate was saturating at the same concentration (20 μm). At this substrate concentration, the rate of catalysis was estimated through a time course analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 A, this rate was lower (almost half) when the HA derivative was produced in the absence of theADA2 gene. In addition, for both enzymes we measured the rate of radioactivity incorporation effected by different substrate concentrations. A double reciprocal plot of these measurements (Fig. 4 B) showed that although the apparentV max for both enzymes differed significantly, their apparent K<itinf;m> values were equivalent (∼10 μm). These results strongly suggested that when this Gcn5 derivative was produced in the presence of Ada2, the rate of HAT catalysis was enhanced, but the substrate recognition was unaffected. The results obtained so far suggested that the observed partial HAT activity of the HACA-Gcn5 protein could be sufficient for the complete function of the Gcn5·Ada2 complex. Since the presumed natural substrates of Gcn5 are nucleosomal histones, we tested the HAT activity of the complexes using these substrates. Nucleosomes were assembled in vitrothrough gradient salt dialysis of free histones onto either a 200-base pair or a 1100-base pair DNA fragment. The formation of oligonucleosomes was confirmed by analyzing the partial micrococcal nuclease digestion patterns of the resulting DNA-protein complexes. As shown in Fig. 5 A, such digestions produced a ladder of DNA fragments that corresponded to the sizes protected by mono- to tetranucleosomes (the latter was not adequately resolved from the input DNA). Thus, this analysis showed that onto the large DNA fragment, up to five nucleosomes were assembled. These assembled oligonucleosomes were used as substrates in acetylation assays using immunoprecipitates from cells producing either the wild type Gcn5 or the HACA LexA fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 5 B, both of these immunoprecipitates acetylated nucleosomal histone H3 and to a much lesser extent histone H2B, but only when produced in the presence of Ada2. This specificity for nucleosomal substrates was identical to the one previously observed for the biochemically purified native Gcn5·Ada complexes (14Grant P. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S. Brownell J. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis D. Winston F. Berger S. Workman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). More importantly, these results showed that the observed differences in the acetylation efficiencies between the two derivatives on free histones were minimized with the use of these nucleosomal substrates. Reconstituted mononucleosomes were not suitable substrates for both these immunoprecipitates (not shown). We concluded that the severely attenuated in vitro HAT activity of the double-mutated Gcn5 derivative was further enhanced when assayed on nucleosomal substrates. We have initiated an investigation on the in vivo role and the regulation of the Gcn5 HAT activity. Toward this goal we have generated loss-of-function Gcn5 derivatives by site-directed mutagenesis. Three mutants were obtained, in two of which the HAT activity of the recombinant protein was attenuated, whereas in the third one, this activity was completely compromised. Despite thesein vitro defects, all three proteins provided wild type Gcn5 function in yeast cells. This was confirmed by examining growth rates and transcriptional competence, which are both affected in gcn5 strains. All three mutated Gcn5 derivatives were able to support normal growth rates and proper Gcn4-dependent transcriptional activation through natural as well as artificial promoters. In addition, the function of both Gal4 and VP16 transcriptional activation domains (which is compromised in gcn5 strains (18Georgakopoulos T. Gounalaki N. Thireos G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) was normal in strains harboring theGCN5 mutant genes (data not shown). These results were in contradiction with the notion that the Gcn5 HAT activity is important for the function of the Gcn5·Ada complex. This issue was resolved by measuring the HAT activities of the mutated molecules produced in yeast cells in the presence or absence of Ada2 and by using nucleosomal substrates. We propose that all mutants were functional in vivo due to the potentiation of their enzymatic activity when assembled into native complexes. This in turn reveals a regulatory role for components of the Gcn5·Ada complex on its HAT activity. In this study Gcn5·Ada complexes were isolated through immunoprecipitations from yeast extracts containing LexA-tagged functional Ada2 or Gcn5 proteins. This immunoprecipitation approach produced native Gcn5·Ada complexes with HAT activities comparable with complexes characterized by others biochemically (14Grant P. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S. Brownell J. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis D. Winston F. Berger S. Workman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 28Pollard K. Peterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6212-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This was supported by the following observations. (i) When immunoprecipitates were challenged with nucleosomal substrates, the resulting profile of acetylated histones was identical to that of two Gcn5-containing native complexes that were biochemically isolated by Grant et al. (14Grant P. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S. Brownell J. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis D. Winston F. Berger S. Workman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). These complexes also predominantly acetylated histone H3 and to a lesser extent, H2B, in a Gcn5-dependent manner. By contrast it is unlikely that the immunoprecipitates contained the 200-kDa Gcn5·Ada complex reported by Pollard and Peterson (28Pollard K. Peterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6212-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), since this complex predominantly acetylated nucleosomal or free histone H4. (ii) When immunoprecipitates were produced through the LexA-Ada2 protein, they exhibited a Gcn5-dependent HAT activity with specificity for free histones H3 and H2B, which was quantitatively and qualitatively different from the activity of immunoprecipitates produced through LexA-Gcn5 in the absence of Ada2 (see Fig. 3 A). This was evident despite the persisting background HAT activity that was notably absent when nucleosomal substrates were employed. This latter observation suggested that this contaminating acetylation activity might involve either cytoplasmic HATs or acetyltransferases with other substrate specificities. Using this immunoprecipitation assay we observed differences in the HAT activity of the various Gcn5 derivatives, which was dependent on whether they were produced in the presence or absence of Ada2. When produced in the absence of this protein, the wild type Gcn5 preferentially acetylated histone H3. This specificity was also observed for both CA and HA derivatives, with the latter exhibiting a severe reduction in its HAT activity. By contrast, the HACA derivative showed no activity when produced in gcn5ada2 strains. These profiles of acetylated free histones were drastically altered when theGCN5 derivatives were expressed in the presence of theADA2 gene. The ability of HA and to a lesser extent, of CA proteins, to acetylate histone H3 was clearly augmented, whereas acetyltransferase activity was even observed for the HACA protein directed toward histones H3 and H2B. A slight enhancement of the HAT activity was also observed when the wild type Gcn5 protein was produced in the presence of Ada2. These results demonstrated a regulatory role for the Ada2 on the Gcn5 HAT activity, which was clearly evident when the attenuated Gcn5 derivatives were used. We argue that the observed increase in HAT activity when Gcn5 derivatives were produced in the presence of Ada2 was the result of the assembly of Gcn5 molecules into native complexes. It is known that the Ada2 protein directly interacts with Gcn5 (20Candau R. Berger S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5237-5245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and that mutations on the Ada2 interaction domain of Gcn5 result in loss of Gcn5 function (39Candau R. Zhou J. Allis D. Berger S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As no other direct interactions have been reported for Gcn5, it is reasonable to assume that this protein assembles into the complex via the Ada2 interaction. Therefore, we postulate that immunoprecipitates obtained from strains lacking Ada2 represented uncomplexed Gcn5 molecules. This was supported by the fact that these immunoprecipitates acetylated free histones with specific activities analogous to those observed in assays utilizing the corresponding bacterially produced protein derivatives. We conclude that the assembly of Gcn5 is what potentiates its HAT activity. Further genetic and biochemical analyses will be required to determine which component(s) of the complex directly effect this potentiation. There are two ways through which the Gcn5 HAT activity could be enhanced by components of the complex: either through an increase in its enzymatic activity or through an improvement in substrate recognition. To address this question we analyzed the enzymatic properties of uncomplexed versus complexed forms of Gcn5. The kinetic analysis performed using the HA derivative showed that assembled Gcn5 exhibited an increased rate of catalysis but had an almost identical K m with the uncomplexed form. The latter indicated that the two forms of enzyme recognize free histone substrates with equal efficiencies. Similar results were obtained using the CA derivative, and increased HAT activity was also reproducibly observed for the wild type assembled Gcn5 (not shown). Finally, although assembly into the complex clearly increased the activity of the Gcn5 derivatives, restoration to wild type levels was never observed, and the mutant character of each derivative as recombinant molecule was retained. We conclude that the observed complex-dependent potentiation of the Gcn5 HAT activity does not simply reflect a neutralization of the attenuated character of the mutated forms but rather reflects a conformational change that the assembly effects on Gcn5, which results in increased catalytic rates. All our conclusions thus far have been based on the use of free histones as substrate. This was reasonable since unassembled Gcn5 can recognize only free histones. The use of nucleosomal arrays as substrates revealed that the HAT activity of the HACA derivative was further enhanced when compared with the corresponding activity of the wild type Gcn5. Assuming that such arrays are the physiological substrates for the Gcn5·Ada complex, this observation was consistent with the fact that this mutant was fully functional in vivo, and it further demonstrated the positive action of components of the complex on its HAT activity. By contrast and in agreement with previous observations concerning the Tetrahymena HAT B (37Brownell J. Allis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), mononucleosomes were not suitable substrates for acetylation by the Gcn5·Ada complex. We postulate that either the observed Gcn5 potentiation is best elaborated on polynucleosomal substrates due to better recognition or that docking of the complex on such arrays and interaction with nucleosomes further enhances HAT activity. Modulation of enzymatic activities within native complexes have been reported in a number of instances from the well studied regulation of CDK kinases by cyclins (40Morgan D. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar) to the recently described example of enhancement of the MSH2-MSH3-mediated DNA mismatch recognition by the MLH1-PMS1 complex in yeast (41Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 790-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cases relevant to transcriptional regulation include the increased Swi2/Snf2 ATPase activity when measured within the Swi·Snf complex (6Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J. Peterson C. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 42Cairns B. Kim Y. Sayes M. Laurent B. Kornberg R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and the regulation of kinase and ATPase activities of TFIIH by TFIIE (1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Finally, the activity of the major cytoplasmic HAT in yeast, Hat1, is also enhanced when associated with the Hat2 subunit, which is involved in substrate recognition (43Parthun M. Widom J. Gottschling D. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The observed positive effect of components of the Gcn5·Ada complex on its HAT activity could simply represent a structural feature of the Gcn5 holoenzyme. Alternatively it could indicate means of a biologically relevant modulation of the HAT activity in response to physiological signals. The attenuated forms of Gcn5 could serve as valuable tools to address these questions.

To date, however, the more successful achievements have relied exclusively on the availability of three-dimensional protein structure maps to direct the redesign strategies.

A more empirical approach, based on cross-referencing substrate structure comparisons with protein alignment data, was used to redesign choline acetyltransferase to accommodate l-carnitine as an acceptor of the acetyl group. A mutant choline acetyltransferase that incorporates four amino acid substitutions from wild type, shows a substantial increase in catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) towardl-carnitine (1,620-fold) and shifts the catalytic discrimination between choline and l-carnitine by >390,000 in favor of the latter substrate. These dramatic alterations in catalytic function demonstrate that significant success in protein redesign can be achieved in the absence of three-dimensional protein structure data.

Carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT)1 (EC 2.3.1.7) catalyzes the reversible transfer of an acetyl group between acetyl-CoA andl-carnitine (hereafter carnitine). Based partly on the crystal structures of the carnitine and acetylcarnitine zwitterions, Gandour et al. (1Gandour R.D. Colucci W.J. Fronczek F.R. Bioorg. Chem. 1985; 13: 197-208Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have proposed a chemical and topographic mechanism for CAT catalysis in which acyl group transfer proceeds through an addition-elimination reaction via a tetrahedral intermediate. In this scheme, the negatively charged carboxylate and positively charged trimethylammonium groups of carnitine serve to anchor the substrate to the enzyme. These proposals have been elaborated (2Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to suggest that a charge-relay system involving an Asp-His couple on the enzyme serves to extract a proton from the C3 hydroxyl group of carnitine that allows for nucleophilic attack of the resulting oxyanion on the carbonyl of the acyl-CoA thioester. This model of CAT catalysis is supported by kinetic (3Chase J.F.A. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1966; 99: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis experiments (4Cronin C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238 (; Correction: (1997) 247, 803–804): 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that tend to exclude a modified enzyme intermediate from the reaction pathway and by additional site-directed mutagenesis experiments that demonstrate essential catalytic roles for histidine and aspartate residues (2Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a role for an arginine residue (5Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in the formation of a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of carnitine. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes a similar reaction to CAT, with the exception that the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA is transferred to choline rather than carnitine. Carnitine differs from choline by having a carboxymethyl group replace a hydrogen at C1 of the latter compound. Relative to the trimethylammonium group of the substrate, acyl group esterification occurs at the same hydroxyl moiety in both enzyme reactions, on C1 in choline and C3 in carnitine. Like CAT (3Chase J.F.A. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1966; 99: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), ChAT also follows a random-order ternary complex mechanism (6Hersh L.B. Peet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4796-4802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also has an essential histidine residue that is believed to act as the general acid/base catalyst (8Carbini L.A. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that both enzymes follow similar chemical reaction mechanisms. Because the carboxymethyl group of carnitine may be involved strictly in binding (1Gandour R.D. Colucci W.J. Fronczek F.R. Bioorg. Chem. 1985; 13: 197-208Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it is expected that CAT possesses a suitably constructed, positively charged pocket with which to accommodate and neutralize this group, and that this structure is absent in ChAT. Thus, the engineering of such a structure into ChAT might allow this enzyme to catalyze the acylation of both carnitine and choline. Although the cDNA and deduced protein sequences of 13 carnitine acyltransferases and 5 ChATs have been reported (see Fig. 1 for references), a three-dimensional structure has not yet been described for any of these enzymes. It is a generally held belief that such structures are an essential requirement for any meaningful attempts at protein redesign (e.g. see Ref. 9Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In the present study, however, this is shown not to be the case. By combining the information from substrate structure comparisons and protein alignment data, four amino acid residues in the primary sequence of ChAT were targeted for replacement. A modified ChAT enzyme, ChAT-R/TET, that contains these four substitutions shows a greater than three orders of magnitude increase in catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for the acetylation of carnitine yet retains substantial choline acetyltransferase activity. l-Carnitine·HCl and choline·Cl were obtained from Sigma. CM-Sepharose CL-6B was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon. The complete rat brain ChAT cDNA of 2337 bp (supplied on vector pSPT18-rChAT-1; Ref. 10Brice A. Berrard S. Raynaud B. Ansieau S. Coppola T. Weber M.J. Mallet J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Drs. L. Houhou and J. Mallet (CNRS, Paris, France). With the exception of the initial transformation into Escherichia coli BMH 71-18mutS (CLONTECH) during the site-directed mutagenesis protocol, all molecular biology experiments reported in this paper utilized E. coli DH5αF′IQ (Life Technologies, Inc.) as host. A restriction site forNdeI encompassing the translational start codon and aHindIII site downstream of the termination codon were introduced into the cDNA encoding rat ChAT by using the polymerase chain reaction with plasmid pSPT18-rChAT-1 (10Brice A. Berrard S. Raynaud B. Ansieau S. Coppola T. Weber M.J. Mallet J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) as template and oligonucleotides oChAT5 (5′-TGG·AGC·GAG·GCG·GCC·GCA·TAT·GCC·CAT·CCT·GGA·AAA·GGC·TCC-3′) and oChAT3 (5′-CTG·ACT·CTC·GAG·GAT·CCA·AGC·TTC·AGT·GGC·TGG·AGT·CAA·GAT·TGC-3′) as amplification primers (the underlined bases are those that differ from the target template). The amplified fragment was digested with NotI/XhoI (sites present in the primers only) and cloned between the NotI/XhoI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) to generate the intermediate vector pKS-rChAT. The sequences of the flanking regions of the amplified ChAT structural gene, i.e. lying upstream of the SphI site and downstream of the NcoI site, were sequenced to assess the integrity of the polymerase chain reaction process. An erroneous base within a subpopulation of the oChAT5 primer required replacement of the NotI/SphI fragment in pKS-rChAT with that obtained from a second polymerase chain reaction that proved to contain the correct sequence. The central 1,542-bpSphI/NcoI fragment within pKS-rChAT was then replaced with the SphI/NcoI fragment from the ChAT cDNA (obtained from pSPT18-rChAT-1) to generate pKS-rChAT*. The rat ChAT structural gene was then assembled between theNdeI/HindIII sites of the E. coliprotein expression vector pLENTY 2pLENTY allows for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of native protein sequences in any strain of E. coli (C. N. Cronin, manuscript in preparation). by simultaneous ligation with the 737-bp NdeI/AatII and 1,200-bpAatII/HindIII fragments from pKS-rChAT* to generate pLENTY-rChAT (this procedure was adopted because of the additional internal NdeI site within the ChAT sequence).E. coli DH5αF′IQ (Life Technologies, Inc.) transformed with pLENTY-rChAT was used for the production of recombinant ChAT. DNA sequence determinations and computer analysis of DNA sequence data were carried out as described previously (5Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The replacement of the VDN tripeptide at residues 459–461 of rat ChAT with the tripeptide TET (VDN → TET) and of asparagine at residue 514 with arginine (N514R) was carried out by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis according to the procedures of Deng and Nickoloff (11Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) by using the commercially available Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH). The template for this procedure was pUC18 containing a blunt-ended (Klenow-treated) 610-bpNdeI/NcoI fragment from the central region of the rat ChAT coding sequence cloned into the SmaI site of the vector (NdeI end toward the HindIII site of the polylinker). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using either oChAT-VDN → TET (5′-CGC·CGC·TTC·CAG·GAA·GGT·CGT·ACG·GAG·ACC·ATC·AGA·TCA·GCC·ACT·CC-3′) or oChAT-N514R (5′-ACC·GGC·ATG·GCC·ATC·GAT·AGG·CAT·CTT·CTG·GCA·CTG-3′) as mutagenic primer (the underlined bases are those that differ from the target template), and Trans Oligo NdeI/NcoI (5′-GAG·TGC·ACC·ATG·GGC·GGT·GTG·AAA·T-3′) as selection primer (the latter provided as part of the control components in the Transformer kit). The mutagenesis protocol followed that outlined by the manufacturers but with the single modification as described previously (5Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutants were identified by the presence of silent restriction sites for the enzymes BsiWI (VDN → TET mutagenesis) orClaI (N514R mutagenesis) that had been introduced by the mutagenic primers. The inserts of selected clones were sequenced in their entirety to confirm the intended arrangements. TheAgeI/SacI fragments from within the mutated inserts were used to replace the native AgeI/SacI sequence in pLENTY-rChAT. The ChAT-R/TET mutant was constructed by utilizing the unique NgoMI site that lies between the separate mutations to combine the two prior to transfer to pLENTY-rChAT. Mutant ChATs were produced in E. coliDH5αF′IQ and purified as described for the wild type enzyme. An inoculum of 0.25 ml of E. coli DH5αF′IQ harboring pLENTY-rChAT that had been grown overnight at 37 °C and 300 rpm in 3 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was added to 20 ml of Luria-Bertani medium/ampicillin and grown overnight at 30 °C and 300 rpm. 10 ml of this culture was used to inoculate each of two 1-liter Luria-Bertani solutions without ampicillin, and growth continued at 30 °C and 300 rpm. When the A 550 of the cultures reached 0.5–0.7, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and growth continued overnight (12–18 h). Unless indicated otherwise, all subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cultures were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the whole cell pellet (about 8 g wet weight) was resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA (free acid) and 1 mmdithiothreitol (TED buffer) by using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The cells were centrifuged as before, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of TED buffer. The cell suspension was sonicated on ice by using a microtip connected to a Sonifer Cell Disruptor W185 (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics) at setting 6 for 10 s on/10 s off and for a total time of 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved and placed on ice. The pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of TED buffer, and the suspension was sonicated and centrifuged as before. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was dialyzed against 4 liters of 10 mmKH2PO4-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA (free acid) (PE buffer) and 0.2 mmdithiothreitol for 4 h. The dialyzed material was passed through a column (3.2 cm diameter × 18 cm) of CM-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with PE buffer at 1 ml/min, and the column was washed overnight with about 700 ml of PE buffer. ChAT was eluted by applying a linear gradient of 0–0.75 m KCl (300 ml total volume) in PE buffer. A conservative pool of the peak fractions of ChAT activity was concentrated to approximately 5 ml by using an Amicon PM-10 membrane and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 20 mmKH2PO4-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA (free acid), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. The enzyme was stored at − 20 °C and was dialyzed against 20 mm KH2PO4-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, prior to the determination of kinetic parameters. Recombinant soluble ChAT was produced at 2–3 mg·liter−1of bacterial culture and was purified with a yield of approximately 50%. The concentration of purified ChAT was determined by using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 6.83 × 104m−1 cm−1 that was calculated based on its tryptophan and tyrosine content (12Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar) (equivalent to A2801% = 9.43). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (5Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). During the purification, ChAT activity was determined routinely at 30 °C in 20 mmKH2PO4-KOH buffer, pH 7.4, and in the presence of 50 μm acetyl-CoA and 1 mm choline in a total volume of 1 ml. The net decrease in the absorbance at 232 nm, due to the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA, was used to determine ChAT activity by using an extinction coefficient of 4,440 m−1cm−1 (13Bergmeyer H.U. Graβl M. Walters H.-E. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Graβl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. II. VCH Publishers, New York1988: 295-296Google Scholar). The activity of ChAT in crude extracts of E. coli was corrected for the presence of an acyl-CoA hydrolase activity by measuring the rate of acetyl-CoA hydrolysis in the absence of choline. The mutant ChAT enzymes were assayed in a similar manner but with 10 mm choline. Kinetic measurements were carried out by using a Uvikon 810 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments). The steady-state kinetic parameters for the various purified derivatives of ChAT listed in Table I were determined under conditions similar to those described above, but with the exceptions that the assay mixtures also contained 0.2 m KCl and the concentrations of both acetyl-CoA and the acceptor substrate, either choline or carnitine, were each varied as required.

ChAT follows a random-order sequential reaction mechanism (6Hersh L.B. Peet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4796-4802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, each experimental data set was fitted to the equation:v =k cat[E][A][B]/(K dA K mB + KmA[B] + KmB[A] + [A][B]) by nonlinear regression using the computer program NONLIN (Philip H. Sherrod, Nashville, TN) and where v is the measured rate and E, A, and B represent, respectively, enzyme, acetyl-CoA, and choline or carnitine, as appropriate, KmA and KmB are the Michaelis constants and KdA is the dissociation constant for acetyl-CoA. The dissociation constant for choline or carnitine (KdB) was calculated from the relationship: KdAKmB= KmAKdB(14Dixon M. Webb E.C. Thorne C.J.R. Tipton K.F. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1979: 88-89Google Scholar). The K m values toward carnitine displayed by the wild type, ChAT-R, and ChAT-TET enzymes exceeded the practical concentration range of this substrate (100 mm). Therefore, thek cat/K m values of these enzymes toward carnitine were determined in the presence of 100 μm acetyl-CoA, which should be sufficient to saturate the enzymes with regard to this latter substrate. Thek cat/K m values were calculated by linear least-squares regression of the data using the computer program Enzfitter (Biosoft). The apparentK m and k cat/K m values of these enzymes toward acetyl-CoA were determined in the presence of 25 mm carnitine and were calculated by fitting the data to rectangular hyperbolas using Enzfitter. The relatively highK m values of these three enzyme forms toward carnitine necessitated adding greater amounts of the enzymes to the assay mixtures. In these instances, the measured activities were corrected for an observed carnitine-independent hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA. It was not determined whether this latter reaction was catalyzed by ChAT (such a reaction has been reported for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Ref. 15Kleanthous C. Shaw W.V. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or by contamination of the enzymes with a small amount of the acyl-CoA hydrolase activity that is present in E. coli. As described in the introduction to the text, the engineering of ChAT to utilize carnitine, in addition to its natural substrate choline, as an effective acceptor of the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA might be achieved by introducing a positively charged pocket into the enzyme with which to accommodate the additional negatively charged carboxymethyl group. Because it is expected that the amino acid residues that contribute to the formation of such a structure are already present in the carnitine acyltransferases, it was considered that these residues might be identified from protein alignment data as conserved substitutions between the choline and carnitine acyltransferase families. Specifically, such substitutions were expected to include an additional basic residue in the carnitine acyltransferases, coupled with a reduction of about 60 Å3in the side chain volume of one or more amino acid residues. An alignment of the various choline and carnitine acyltransferase sequences showed that 30 amino acid residues are conserved identically among all proteins (data not shown). When the conservation of residues within each group was compared with the other, a number of distinct differences were identified, as illustrated in Fig. 1. First, Asn-514 in rat ChAT, conserved in four out of five ChAT sequences, is replaced exclusively in the carnitine acyltransferases by Arg. A recent site-directed mutagenesis experiment conducted in this laboratory with carnitine octanoyltransferase (5Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) showed that this Arg has a profound effect on the binding of carnitine. Thus, the introduction of an Arg at position 514 in rat ChAT was predicted to provide the ionic charge required to interact with, and neutralize, the carboxyl group of carnitine. Second, Val-459 and Asn-461 in rat ChAT, the former conserved in all ChAT sequences and the latter in four out of five ChAT sequences, are each replaced exclusively in the carnitine acyltransferases by Thr. In addition to providing an alternative spatial arrangement of hydrogen bonding donors/acceptors, these substitutions create a side-chain volume decrease of approximately 33 Å3 (16Chotia C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 537-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) in the carnitine acyltransferases. An Asp residue is found to occur between these two amino acids in all ChAT sequences, but is replaced conservatively by Glu in the majority of carnitine acyltransferases, although some CAT sequences retain Asp. Secondary structure prediction analyses (17Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of these enzymes (data not shown) suggests that each of these tripeptide sequences occurs within a loop and not in areas of fixed secondary structure, whereas the Asn to Arg replacement occurs within a helical structure. Thus, while the latter residue may be spatially restricted, the tripeptide sequences may be afforded a degree of flexibility that is convivial to the accommodation and/or turnover of substrate. However, it does not necessarily follow that these tripeptide sequences actually interact with their respective substrates, since recent protein engineering experiments (18Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 19Hedstrom L. Farr-Jones S. Kettner C.A. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8764-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that critical contributions to enzyme specificity and catalytic efficiency may be provided by loop structures that do not directly contact the substrate. Additional conserved differences between the two enzyme families that might contribute to their observed substrate preferences were not readily apparent, and it was felt that the substitutions described above may be sufficient to allow a modified ChAT to acetylate carnitine. Thus, with the intention of producing a dual-specific choline/carnitine acetyltransferase or a ChAT that is selective for carnitine, a variety of engineered derivatives of ChAT were produced. These included ChAT-R (Asn-514 replaced with Arg), ChAT-TET (the VDN tripeptide at residues 459–461 replaced with TET), and ChAT-R/TET (containing each of the above mutations). Although CAT may contain either Asp or Glu at the position equivalent to residue 460 in rat ChAT (see Fig. 1), the majority of the carnitine acyltransferases contain Glu, and so the conservative replacement of this residue was included in the VDN → TET mutation. Native wild type ChAT and its engineered derivatives were produced in recombinant soluble form in E. coli. Advantage was taken of the relatively high isoelectric point of ChAT (7.97) to isolate the enzymes in near-homogeneous form, as shown in Fig. 2, by a single chromatographic step through CM-Sepharose CL-6B (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The kinetic parameters determined for the purified wild type enzyme and for each of the three mutant ChATs with the substrate pairs of choline/acetyl-CoA and carnitine/acetyl-CoA are shown in Table I. In comparison to wild type, all three mutant ChATs show an improved catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) when carnitine is the acceptor of the acetyl group, with the greatest increase (1,620-fold) occurring with the ChAT-R/TET quadruple mutant. The data show that the separate mutations are approximately additive, with the greater improvement coming from the VDN → TET replacement. In the cases of the ChAT-R and ChAT-TET enzymes it was not possible to determine from these kinetic data whether the improvements in catalytic efficiency were derived from an increase in k cator a lowering of the K m value toward carnitine, or a combination of both, since the K m values (>100 mm) toward carnitine exceeded the practical concentration range of this substrate, as it did also for the wild type enzyme. However, the results obtained for the ChAT-R/TET enzyme indicate that, in this case, the K m value has been substantially reduced (≥21-fold) in comparison with the wild type enzyme (and the other enzyme derivatives). The increases in the catalytic efficiencies of the ChAT-R and ChAT-R/TET enzymes toward carnitine that results from the N514R mutation lends credence to the earlier proposal (5Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the Arg at the equivalent location in the carnitine acyltransferases forms a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of carnitine. In contrast to the results obtained with carnitine, the mutations lead, in all cases, to an impairment in the catalytic efficiency toward choline that is maximal in the ChAT-R/TET quadruple mutant with a reduction of 245-fold from wild type. Although the VDN → TET replacement elevates k cat by some 3- to 4-fold for choline turnover, the reduction in the catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzymes toward this substrate may be accounted for primarily by an increase in the K m value. In each mutant, the increase in the K m value toward choline is mirrored by a similar increase in its dissociation constant (K d), indicating that the loss in catalytic efficiency primarily reflects an impairment in substrate affinity. In each enzyme derivative, the dissociation constant for acetyl-CoA is similar to that determined for the wild type enzyme, indicating that the mutations do not affect the affinity for the acyl group donor. Thus the modifications appear to have specific, and profound, effects on the binding and/or turnover of the acceptor of the acetyl group. In the case of the ChAT-R/TET enzyme, the net effect of these changes is a shift in the catalytic discrimination between choline and carnitine by a factor of >390,000 in favor of the latter compound, with the result that this enzyme acetylates both substrates with rather similar catalytic efficiencies (2.5-fold preference for choline; Table I). Although the amino acid replacements introduced into the ChAT-R/TET enzyme lead to the acquisition of substantial carnitine acetyltransferase activity (k cat/K m = 4.69 × 102m−1 s−1), the enzyme remains quite inferior to native CAT (for example, the data reported for human liver CAT in Ref. 20Bloisi W. Colombo I. Garavaglia B. Giardini R. Finocchiaro G. DiDonato S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar suggest an approximatek cat/K m ratio of 8.8 × 105m−1 s−1 for carnitine turnover). Thus, while the residues targeted for replacement in the present study contribute substantially to the different substrate preferences displayed by the choline and carnitine acyltransferase families, it is clear that additional more subtle differences must exist between the two families that account for the remaining differences in the catalytic efficiencies displayed toward their respective natural substrates. Nevertheless, unlike the carnitine acyltransferases that have little ability to acetylate choline (carnitine octanoyltransferase acetylates choline with ak cat/K m ratio of 0.212m−1 s−1; Ref. 5Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the Chat-R/TET enzyme retains substantial choline acetyltransferase activity (k cat/K m = 1.18 × 103m−1 s−1). Thus, the ChAT-R/TET enzyme represents a novel bifunctional carnitine/choline acetyltransferase. The improvements engineered into the ChAT-R/TET enzyme for carnitine turnover compare very favorably with the more successful improvements in catalytic efficiency reported in previous redesigns of multisubstrate enzymes, some of which are listed in Table II, in which high resolution three-dimensional protein structure maps were utilized as “blueprints” for the redesign strategies. In the case of multisubstrate enzymes, it has been pointed out (21Feeney R. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that realistic measures of protein-engineered improvements in catalytic efficiency should take into account the properties of the redesigned enzyme with regard to the overall catalytic reaction, i.e. whenk cat and the values of K m for each substrate are considered as a whole. For the ChAT-R/TET enzyme this “overall catalytic efficiency” (21Feeney R. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) is defined ask cat/(Kmacetyl-CoA· Kmcarnitine) and equals 1.65 × 108m−2s−1. When compared with the value for wild type, 1.44 × 105m−2 s−1(k cat/K m for carnitine divided by the apparent K m for acetyl-CoA), the overall gain in catalytic efficiency for acetylation of carnitine is 1,150-fold (this gain may, in fact, be significantly greater since, by comparison with the data obtained for those reactions in which the trueK m value for acetyl-CoA was determined, the trueK m value for acetyl-CoA during turnover of carnitine by the wild type enzyme may well be higher). In Table II, only one of the previous studies with multisubstrate enzymes reported the effects of the redesign on each substrate in the reaction, and thus, the “overall catalytic efficiency” cannot be determined for the majority of studies. Therefore, the relative success of the present redesign may be more profound.Table IIA selection of reported improvements in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) elicited by protein redesign of multisubstrate enzymesEnzymeSubstrate pair[k cat/K m]wild type[k cat/K m]mutantΔk cat/K mRef.m · sm · sCholine acetyltransferaseCarnitine0.289 ± 0.006(4.69 ± 0.56) × 1021,620This studyAcetyl-CoA(3.50 ± 0.29) × 103(7.92 ± 1.55) × 105226Aspartate aminotransferasePhenylalanine 2.5 × 102 3.7 × 1051,48025Onuffer J.J.

RNase P enzymes are composed of both RNA and protein (15Darr S.C. Brown J.W. Pace N.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 178-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In vitro, RNA subunits of bacterial enzymes are catalytically active in the absence of protein (16Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner T. Marsh K. Pace N. Altman S.

Catalytic activity of RNA subunits, in the absence of protein subunits, has not been demonstrated so far for archaea and eukaryotes RNase P. However, the catalytic center of these RNase P enzymes most likely is associated with the RNA subunits. Eukaryotic RNase P activity has been detected in nuclei, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (15Darr S.C. Brown J.W. Pace N.R. Trends Biochem.

Recently, the partial purification and characterization of RNase P from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum has been reported (18Drainas D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 22: 135-138Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar,19Stathopoulos C. Kalpaxis D.L. Drainas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In the present study we have examined the effect of natural and synthetic retinoids on RNase P using a cell free system from the slime mold D. discoideum as an in vitro model. D. discoideum RNase P is a nuclear enzyme that has low buoyant density in Cs2SO4 gradients possibly due to the occurrence of an unidentified component such as a fatty acid or lipid (19Stathopoulos C. Kalpaxis D.L. Drainas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the existence of hydrophobic site(s) on D. discoideum RNase P and perhaps justifies the role of retinoids as potential inhibitors, being hydrophobic molecules acting in the nucleus.RESULTSThe present data show that all retinoids investigated here (Fig. 1) are capable of inhibiting the RNase P activity of D. discoideum. The substrate for RNase P assays was an in vitro labeled transcript of the S. pombe tRNASer gene supSI (20Drainas D. Zimmerly S. Willis I. Söll D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The concentration of all-trans retinoic acid (IC50) at which the product formation is reduced by 50% is equal to 80 μm (Fig. 2,A and B). Although not as effective as all-trans retinoic acid, retinol also inhibited RNase P activity; the IC50 was equal to 500 μm (Fig. 2, C and D). The dose response curves for the synthetic retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin were similar to those observed with the natural retinoids (Fig. 3). The IC50 values were 60 μm (Fig. 3, A and B) and 40 μm (Fig. 3, C and D), respectively. It is obvious from these results that acitretin is the strongest inhibitor among the retinoids tested. It is important to note that RNase P purified through the second DE 52 column was inhibited by retinoids to the same extent as RNase P purified through the S-300 column.Figure 3Dose response effect of isotretinoin (Aand B) and acitretin (C and D).

Because the yields of RNase P after gel filtration chromatography are low, for the kinetic analysis we used RNase P fractions obtained from DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Due to the high hydrophobicity of retinoids, all assays were carried out in the presence of 10% Me2SO. At this concentration, Me2SO marginally affects (K i = 4m) the catalytic parameters of D. discoideumRNase P. The initial velocity in the presence or absence of retinoids was determined from the initial slopes of time plots (not shown). Fig. 4 shows double reciprocal plots with increasing concentrations of acitretin. The lowest line in Fig. 4represents the data obtained in the absence of inhibitor and Me2SO (control). The calculated apparentK m (K m,app) and the apparent V max (V max,app) values from this plot are 240 nm and 3 pmol/min, respectively. These values are in agreement with previous values reported from our laboratory (19Stathopoulos C. Kalpaxis D.L. Drainas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10% Me2SO the K m,app and theV max,app values are 250 nm and 3 pmol/min, respectively (Fig. 4). The slopes of the lines in Fig. 4 were replotted against the concentration of acitretin, and the results are shown in the top panel of Fig. 4. The linearity of this replot is indicative of simple competitive inhibition and leads to the graphical determination of K i = 8.0 μm from the negative intercept of the line with the I-axis. Further evidence for simple competitive kinetics comes from the Dixon plot, which is shown in Fig. 5. When the slopes of the lines of Fig. 4 are replotted against 1/[pre-tRNA] (Fig. 5, top panel) they give a straight line passing through the origin. This is further evidence of simple competitive inhibition (21Segel I.H. Enzyme kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 110Google Scholar). Hill plots were obtained by calculating the log[v′/(v 0-v′)] values at each concentration of pre-tRNA and plotting them as a function of logarithmic retinoid concentration. The molecular interaction coefficient (n) for retinoids was given by the slope of these plots. Fig. 6 shows the Hill plot for acitretin obtained at 100 nm pre-tRNA. Then value calculated from this plot is about equal to 1. These results support the notion that the inhibition of D. discoideum RNase P activity by retinoids involves only one retinoid molecule.Figure 4Double reciprocal plot (1/v versus 1/[pre-tRNA]) for RNase P reaction in the presence of acitretin.

Publ. 1996; 139: 47-59PubMed Google Scholar).Retinoids act through binding to nuclear receptors that belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily. It has been proposed that target genes are regulated by these receptors that act as transcription factors activated by retinoids (3DeLuca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 4van der Saag P.T. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 50: 24-28PubMed Google Scholar, 5Botling J. Castro D.S. Oberg F. Nilsson K.

Trends Biochem Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence indicating that retinoid action can be mediated through mechanisms not involving the retinoid nuclear receptors (22Chao W.R. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Zhang X.K. Zheng Y. Wu Q. Shroot B. Dawson M.I. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Hsu C.A. Rishi A.K. Su-Li X. Gerald T.M. Dawson M.I. Schiffer C. Reichert V. Shroot B. Poirer G.C. Fontana J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study it is demonstrated that the important ribozyme RNase P isolated fromD. discoideum is competitively inhibited by natural and synthetic retinoids.All retinoids tested revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of RNase P activity, indicating that these compounds may have a direct effect on tRNA biogenesis. Detailed kinetic analysis showed that the type of inhibition of retinol, all-trans retinoic acid, isotretinoin, and acitretin is simply competitive. According to this finding we could assign the potency of inhibitors solely on the basis of the K i value. Thus, acitretin is 184, 2.5, and 1.9 times more potent than retinol, isotretinoin, and all-trans retinoic acid, respectively.An interesting observation is that substitution of the CH3O group for hydrogen in the P position of the aromatic ring of the parent compound (all-trans retinoic acid) (Fig. 1) enhances the inhibitory potency of the retinoid. Because the CH3O group increases the hydrophobicity of acitretin, it is possible that this compound may fit better into hydrophobic site(s) of the RNase P. It has been suggested that the low buoyant density of RNase P in Cs2SO4 gradients (19Stathopoulos C. Kalpaxis D.L. Drainas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) can be attributed to the occurrence of an unidentified component such as a fatty acid or lipid. This hypothesis is consistent with the existence of hydrophobic site(s) on RNase P. On the other hand, retinol, which is a very weak inhibitor (K i = 1475 μm), has a hydroxyl group in place of the carboxyl one (Fig. 1), indicating that the absence of the latter affects the binding of the analog with the enzyme. It is also interesting that among the stereoisomers (Fig. 1) all-trans retinoic acid (K i = 15 μm) is stronger inhibitor than isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid) (K i = 20 μm), suggesting that the stereochemical properties play an important role in the inhibitory behavior of these molecules.A significant point of interest emerged from the Hill plot analysis (Fig. 6). Only one binding site (n ≅ 1) for retinoids seems to be necessary for the inhibition of RNase P reaction. Because of the kinetic nature of this observation, we cannot exclude the existence of additional retinoid-binding sites on RNase P holoenzyme, which are not involved in the kinetic model of inhibition.Because the retinoids examined in the present study reveal no structural similarity to the substrate (pre-tRNA) of RNase P, the competitive character of the inhibition suggests that these compounds may bind to allosteric inhibition sites of the enzyme. Finally, it is possible that the inhibition of D. discoideum RNase P could have been caused by a retinoid-specific receptor complex; the receptor could have been co-eluted with RNase P activity during the purification procedure. However, this hypothesis can be ruled out, because RNase P activity during the purification through the Sephacryl S-300 column elutes with the void volume of the column, with the enzyme behaving as a protein with very high molecular mass (see “Materials and Methods”), whereas retinoic acid receptors, if present in the extract, will elute in later fractions well apart from the RNase P activity, because of their low molecular mass (<50 kDa) (3DeLuca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it could be speculated that the inhibition of RNase P activity results from retinoids titrating out a co-activator component from RNase P, for example a bivalent cation like Mg2+; nevertheless, this possibility is definitely ruled out because in this case the inhibition pattern is of partial noncompetitive type. 1A. Tekos, C. Stathopoulos, and D. Drainas, unpublished results. Moreover, other types of RNase P co-activators have not been reported so far. Retinoids, a group of natural and synthetic analogs of vitamin A, play an essential role in vision, growth, and reproduction as well as exhibiting striking effects on cell proliferation, differentiation, and pattern formation during development (1Tsambaos D. Zimmerman B. Roenigk H.H. Maibach H.I. Effects of Synthetic Retinoids on Cellular Systems in Psoriasis. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1991: 659-707Google Scholar, 2Ross A.C. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The discovery that members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily are nuclear retinoic acid-binding proteins tremendously improves our understanding of the mechanisms that mediate the regulatory action of retinoids on gene expression (3DeLuca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 4van der Saag P.T. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 50: 24-28PubMed Google Scholar, 5Botling J. Castro D.S. Oberg F. Nilsson K.

Trends Biochem Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The retinoid receptors are ligand-activated, DNA-binding, trans-acting, transcription factors (7Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar, 8Minucci S.

Due to their ability to regulate cell differentiation and suppress or reverse the malignant phenotype, retinoids have a potential use as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents in cancers of skin and other organs (9Lippman, S. M., Heyman, R. A., Kurie, J. M., Benner, S. E., and Hong, W. K. (1995) J. Cell. Biochem.22, (Suppl.) 1–10Google Scholar, 10Muindi J.R. Cancer Treat.

Moreover, oral synthetic retinoids are presently successfully applied in the management of severe and recalcitrant dermatoses, which were previously regarded as frustrating therapeutic problems (12Wieder J.M. Lowe N.J. Dermatol. Clin. 1995; 13: 891-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lacour M. Mehta-Nikhar B. Atherton D.J. Harper J.I. Br. J.

Hautarzt. 1997; 48: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RNase P is a key enzyme in tRNA biogenesis, which cleaves all tRNA precursors endonucleolytically to produce the mature 5′ end. RNase P enzymes are composed of both RNA and protein (15Darr S.C. Brown J.W. Pace N.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 178-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In vitro, RNA subunits of bacterial enzymes are catalytically active in the absence of protein (16Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner T. Marsh K. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) and are the only known RNA catalysts naturally devoted to act in trans (17Symons R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 322-330Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Catalytic activity of RNA subunits, in the absence of protein subunits, has not been demonstrated so far for archaea and eukaryotes RNase P. However, the catalytic center of these RNase P enzymes most likely is associated with the RNA subunits. Eukaryotic RNase P activity has been detected in nuclei, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (15Darr S.C. Brown J.W. Pace N.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 178-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Drainas D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 22: 135-138Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recently, the partial purification and characterization of RNase P from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum has been reported (18Drainas D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 22: 135-138Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar,19Stathopoulos C. Kalpaxis D.L. Drainas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined the effect of natural and synthetic retinoids on RNase P using a cell free system from the slime mold D. discoideum as an in vitro model. D. discoideum RNase P is a nuclear enzyme that has low buoyant density in Cs2SO4 gradients possibly due to the occurrence of an unidentified component such as a fatty acid or lipid (19Stathopoulos C. Kalpaxis D.L. Drainas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the existence of hydrophobic site(s) on D. discoideum RNase P and perhaps justifies the role of retinoids as potential inhibitors, being hydrophobic molecules acting in the nucleus. RESULTSThe present data show that all retinoids investigated here (Fig. 1) are capable of inhibiting the RNase P activity of D. discoideum. The substrate for RNase P assays was an in vitro labeled transcript of the S. pombe tRNASer gene supSI (20Drainas D. Zimmerly S. Willis I. Söll D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The concentration of all-trans retinoic acid (IC50) at which the product formation is reduced by 50% is equal to 80 μm (Fig. 2,A and B). Although not as effective as all-trans retinoic acid, retinol also inhibited RNase P activity; the IC50 was equal to 500 μm (Fig. 2, C and D). The dose response curves for the synthetic retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin were similar to those observed with the natural retinoids (Fig. 3). The IC50 values were 60 μm (Fig. 3, A and B) and 40 μm (Fig. 3, C and D), respectively. It is obvious from these results that acitretin is the strongest inhibitor among the retinoids tested. It is important to note that RNase P purified through the second DE 52 column was inhibited by retinoids to the same extent as RNase P purified through the S-300 column.The type of inhibition of D. discoideum RNase P activity by the natural and synthetic retinoids was further elucidated by detailed kinetic analysis. Because the yields of RNase P after gel filtration chromatography are low, for the kinetic analysis we used RNase P fractions obtained from DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Due to the high hydrophobicity of retinoids, all assays were carried out in the presence of 10% Me2SO. At this concentration, Me2SO marginally affects (K i = 4m) the catalytic parameters of D. discoideumRNase P. The initial velocity in the presence or absence of retinoids was determined from the initial slopes of time plots (not shown). Fig. 4 shows double reciprocal plots with increasing concentrations of acitretin. The lowest line in Fig. 4represents the data obtained in the absence of inhibitor and Me2SO (control). The calculated apparentK m (K m,app) and the apparent V max (V max,app) values from this plot are 240 nm and 3 pmol/min, respectively. These values are in agreement with previous values reported from our laboratory (19Stathopoulos C. Kalpaxis D.L. Drainas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10% Me2SO the K m,app and theV max,app values are 250 nm and 3 pmol/min, respectively (Fig. 4). The slopes of the lines in Fig. 4 were replotted against the concentration of acitretin, and the results are shown in the top panel of Fig. 4. The linearity of this replot is indicative of simple competitive inhibition and leads to the graphical determination of K i = 8.0 μm from the negative intercept of the line with the I-axis. Further evidence for simple competitive kinetics comes from the Dixon plot, which is shown in Fig. 5. When the slopes of the lines of Fig. 4 are replotted against 1/[pre-tRNA] (Fig. 5, top panel) they give a straight line passing through the origin. This is further evidence of simple competitive inhibition (21Segel I.H. Enzyme kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 110Google Scholar). Hill plots were obtained by calculating the log[v′/(v 0-v′)] values at each concentration of pre-tRNA and plotting them as a function of logarithmic retinoid concentration. The molecular interaction coefficient (n) for retinoids was given by the slope of these plots. Fig. 6 shows the Hill plot for acitretin obtained at 100 nm pre-tRNA. Then value calculated from this plot is about equal to 1. These results support the notion that the inhibition of D. discoideum RNase P activity by retinoids involves only one retinoid molecule.Figure 4Double reciprocal plot (1/v versus 1/[pre-tRNA]) for RNase P reaction in the presence of acitretin.

It has been proposed that target genes are regulated by these receptors that act as transcription factors activated by retinoids (3DeLuca L.M.

However, there is also evidence indicating that retinoid action can be mediated through mechanisms not involving the retinoid nuclear receptors (22Chao W.R. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Zhang X.K. Zheng Y. Wu Q. Shroot B. Dawson M.I. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Hsu C.A. Rishi A.K. Su-Li X. Gerald T.M. Dawson M.I. Schiffer C. Reichert V. Shroot B. Poirer G.C.

In the present study it is demonstrated that the important ribozyme RNase P isolated fromD. discoideum is competitively inhibited by natural and synthetic retinoids.All retinoids tested revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of RNase P activity, indicating that these compounds may have a direct effect on tRNA biogenesis. Detailed kinetic analysis showed that the type of inhibition of retinol, all-trans retinoic acid, isotretinoin, and acitretin is simply competitive. According to this finding we could assign the potency of inhibitors solely on the basis of the K i value. Thus, acitretin is 184, 2.5, and 1.9 times more potent than retinol, isotretinoin, and all-trans retinoic acid, respectively.An interesting observation is that substitution of the CH3O group for hydrogen in the P position of the aromatic ring of the parent compound (all-trans retinoic acid) (Fig. 1) enhances the inhibitory potency of the retinoid. Because the CH3O group increases the hydrophobicity of acitretin, it is possible that this compound may fit better into hydrophobic site(s) of the RNase P. It has been suggested that the low buoyant density of RNase P in Cs2SO4 gradients (19Stathopoulos C. Kalpaxis D.L. Drainas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) can be attributed to the occurrence of an unidentified component such as a fatty acid or lipid. This hypothesis is consistent with the existence of hydrophobic site(s) on RNase P. On the other hand, retinol, which is a very weak inhibitor (K i = 1475 μm), has a hydroxyl group in place of the carboxyl one (Fig. 1), indicating that the absence of the latter affects the binding of the analog with the enzyme. It is also interesting that among the stereoisomers (Fig. 1) all-trans retinoic acid (K i = 15 μm) is stronger inhibitor than isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid) (K i = 20 μm), suggesting that the stereochemical properties play an important role in the inhibitory behavior of these molecules.A significant point of interest emerged from the Hill plot analysis (Fig. 6). Only one binding site (n ≅ 1) for retinoids seems to be necessary for the inhibition of RNase P reaction. Because of the kinetic nature of this observation, we cannot exclude the existence of additional retinoid-binding sites on RNase P holoenzyme, which are not involved in the kinetic model of inhibition.Because the retinoids examined in the present study reveal no structural similarity to the substrate (pre-tRNA) of RNase P, the competitive character of the inhibition suggests that these compounds may bind to allosteric inhibition sites of the enzyme. Finally, it is possible that the inhibition of D. discoideum RNase P could have been caused by a retinoid-specific receptor complex; the receptor could have been co-eluted with RNase P activity during the purification procedure. However, this hypothesis can be ruled out, because RNase P activity during the purification through the Sephacryl S-300 column elutes with the void volume of the column, with the enzyme behaving as a protein with very high molecular mass (see “Materials and Methods”), whereas retinoic acid receptors, if present in the extract, will elute in later fractions well apart from the RNase P activity, because of their low molecular mass (<50 kDa) (3DeLuca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it could be speculated that the inhibition of RNase P activity results from retinoids titrating out a co-activator component from RNase P, for example a bivalent cation like Mg2+; nevertheless, this possibility is definitely ruled out because in this case the inhibition pattern is of partial noncompetitive type. 1A. Tekos, C. Stathopoulos, and D. Drainas, unpublished results. Moreover, other types of RNase P co-activators have not been reported so far. The study of the action of retinoids is of essential importance because these compounds are involved in gene expression, cell growth, and differentiation (1Tsambaos D. Zimmerman B. Roenigk H.H.

The rate constants for the fluorescence change increased nearly linearly with increasing ATP concentrations. The substitution of AcP for ATP decreased the FITC fluorescence rather monophasically, 8.5/s, which was followed by the half-site phosphorylation with same amount of components with different rate constant, 7.2 and 4.6/s, followed by a much slower increase in the two components of AP2PL fluorescence, 1.4 and 0.2/s. The addition of Na+ with increasing concentrations of ATP to the K+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzymes induced accelerations in the decrease and an increase in the AP2PL fluorescence intensity with two different increases in the FITC fluorescence intensity, showing that the same concentration of ATP is capable of inducing four different fluorescence changes.

Recently, the half-site stoichiometry for phosphorylation by ATP for the case of Na+,K+-ATPase, which is independent of specific activities, while retaining nearly full-site ATP binding capacity in the presence of CDTA1 (18Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) has been unequivocally demonstrated (19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The data also showed that enzyme preparations that contained ∼0.5 mol of pyridoxal 5′-diphospho-5′-adenosine (AP2PL) probe at Lys-480 of the α-chain reduced the phosphorylation stoichiometry to ∼0.25. When the AP2PL enzymes were further treated with a fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC), the resulting AP2PL-FITC enzymes contained ∼0.9 mol of the FITC probe at Lys-501, which reduced the value to ∼0.03. The FITC treatment had a negligible effect on the rate and the extent of individual ATP- and AcP-dependent fluorescence changes due to the AP2PL chromophore and the amount of AcP-dependent half-site phosphorylation in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+ (18Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol.

These data are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylation is not required for ATP-induced AP2PL fluorescence change of the AP2PL and AP2PL-FITC enzymes and that four ATP binding sites are present in Na+,K+-ATPase. In this paper, ATP- or AcP-induced conformational events were followed by measuring fluorescence changes of the AP2PL probe at Lys-480 and the FITC probe at Lys-501 using the AP2PL-FITC enzymes. Since the N-(p-(2-benzimidazolyl)phenyl) maleimide (BIPM) treatment had little effect on both Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the phosphorylation capacity (7Nagai M. Taniguchi K. Kangawa K. Matsuo S. Nakamura S. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13197-13202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ATP-induced BIPM fluorescence changes at Cys-964 of the α-chain, which is near the transmembrane domain M9 of the enzyme (20Lutsenko S. Daoud S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), were also followed whether or not ATP induced multiple conformational changes in the BIPM enzyme. The data indicate the occurrence of four ATP binding induced out of phase fluorescence changes not only near the ATP binding domain, but also in the membrane domain. Experimental methods were exactly as described in previous papers unless otherwise indicated (18Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem.

Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using a Shimadzu RF-503 difference spectrofluorophotometer at 25 °C (8Taniguchi K. Suzuki K. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10659-10667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a sample of 3.2 ml (50 μg of protein/ml) under the same reaction conditions as for the Na+-ATPase measurements as described in Fig. 1 legend, except in some experiments, ATP was replaced with AcP. The fluorescence excitation was at 320 (AP2PL) and 470 (FITC) nm, and the emission was detected at 390 (AP2PL) and 520 (FITC) nm, respectively. Transient fluorescence measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics DX 17MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter at 25 °C (11Taniguchi K. Mårdh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15588-15594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were started by mixing equal volumes (25 μl) of solutions as described for the Na+-ATPase measurements except that in some experiments, 16 mm NaCl was replaced with 1.6 mm KCl. In addition, one volume contained 60 μg/ml enzyme protein and the other contained various concentrations of ATP or AcP without or with 5 or 160 mm NaCl or corresponding concentrations of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) or choline chloride as a control. The sample was excited at 305 (BIPM), 320 (AP2PL), and 470 (FITC) nm and the emission was detected at 360 (BIPM), 390 (AP2PL), and 520 (FITC) nm after passage through Nippon Shinku Kogaku interference filters as described previously (19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The experiments were repeated at least 10 times. The ratios of accumulated data in the presence of substrates to those obtained for the controls were fitted to a single or a double exponential curve in order to estimate the apparent rate constants and the extent of fluorescence changes using a non-linear least squares fit analysis. The experiments were performed using several different enzyme preparations, and the data shown are typical examples. The starting positions of all the curves for transient fluorescence changes (Figs. 2 A, 3 A, 3 B, 5, 6, and 7 A) were offset in order to see the shape of each curve more clearly. Thus, the change in fluorescence intensity after addition of ligand(s) in each curve is the change from the corresponding starting position of the curve.Figure 3Stopped-flow measurements of ATP- and Na+-induced AP2PL and FITC fluorescence change of Mg2+-K+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzyme.

The time course of ATP-induced BIPM fluorescence change was measured after the addition of various concentrations of ATP under the same conditions as described in Fig. 4 except the BIPM enzyme was used. A, each ratio of fluorescence change accumulated after the addition of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 5, and 30 μmATP, relative to that of the corresponding concentration of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) is shown. The numbers shown in figure are units (in μm). The smooth lines were obtained by fitting to single (0.01 and 0.03 μm) or double exponential curves (0.1, 0.3, 1, 5, and 30 μm). The rate constants (1/s) and the corresponding extent of fluorescence changes (%) are shown in parentheses. B, the rate constants for the slow increase (closed circles) and rapid increase (open circles) and the extent of the fluorescence changes (inset, closed and open circles) obtained as described above are plotted against initial added ATP concentrations. The data shown are means and standard deviations of the results of three independent experiments. Each data set of closed circles for the slow BIPM fluorescence increase and open circles for the rapid increase was fitted to two intersecting straight lines in the presence of low and high ATP concentrations, respectively. This represents Y = 3.9 × 106 × [ATP] + 2.7 and Y = 0.69 × 106 × [ATP] + 5.2, where Y is the apparent first order rate constant, (1/s), for the slow increase in BIPM fluorescence in the presence of ATP. For the rapid increase,Y = 18 × 106 × [ATP] + 9.4 and Y = 4.2 × 106 × [ATP] + 77, where Y is the apparent first order rate constant, (1/s), for the rapid fluorescence increase in the presence of ATP. [ATP] is the initial ATP concentration added (in m).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The time-dependent phosphorylation was followed using a Bio-Logic Quench-Flow Module (QFM-5) at 25 °C. The experiments were started by mixing equal volumes (60 μl) of the solutions used for the Na+-ATPase measurement except the [32P]ATP was replaced with [32P]AcP. After mixing, the reaction was quenched by adding 1 m HCl, 10 mmH3PO4, and 1 mm AcP or ATP (11Taniguchi K. Mårdh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15588-15594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous stopped flow experiments showed that the addition of ATP and AcP to the Mg2+-Na+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzymes containing ∼0.5 mol of AP2PL probe at Lys-480 and ∼0.9 mol of FITC probe at Lys-501/α-chain, respectively, induced a similar extent of increase in the AP2PL fluorescence intensity without and with phosphorylation (18Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate this point further, steady state fluorescence measurements were performed. The addition of 10 μm ATP to the Mg2+-Na+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzymes increased the AP2PL fluorescence with no observable FITC fluorescence change (Fig. 1 A, top and bottom). The AP2PL fluorescence decreased to the initial level over a period of time and the readdition of ATP caused a reversible increase in the fluorescence (Fig. 1 A, top). However, no significant FITC fluorescence change was observed, even after the addition of 100 μm ATP, which kept the increased level of AP2PL fluorescence up to 1 h (data not shown). The increase in AP2PL fluorescence by ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+ (Fig. 1 A, top) without significant phosphorylation is indicative of an enzyme state just after ATP hydrolysis (see Ref. 18Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and Table I of Ref.19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The reason for time-dependent decrease in AP2PL fluorescence was shown to be mainly due to the decrease of ATP concentration by Na+-ATPase activity of the AP2PL-FITC enzyme preparation, which still contained ∼6% of Na+-dependent phosphorylation capacity from ATP as shown (19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The addition of 1 mm AcP to the Mg2+-Na+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzymes increased AP2PL fluorescence and decreased FITC fluorescence (Fig. 1 B, top and bottom). In addition the phosphoenzyme fully accumulated to a level of ∼0.5 mol/mol of α-chain as is shown in the accompanying article (19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The addition of ouabain further increased AP2PL fluorescence to accumulate ouabain-bound phosphoenzyme but had little effect on FITC fluorescence (Fig. 1 B, top and bottom). Further addition of ATP to ouabain-bound phosphoenzyme had a negligible effect on AP2PL fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1 B, top). The AP2PL fluorescence intensity at Lys-480, which accompanied the accumulation of ouabain-bound phosphoenzyme was higher than that of K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme from AcP (Fig. 1 B, top). Such a conformational difference detected by fluorescence change has not been detected with the BIPM probe at Cys-964 (8Taniguchi K. Suzuki K. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10659-10667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the FITC probe at Lys-501 (14Yamazaki A. Kaya S. Tsuda T. Araki Y. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to date. The FITC fluorescence change induced by AcP in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+ is known to be reversible (17Taniguchi K. Kai D. Inoue S. Shinoguchi E. Sasaki T. Nakamura Y. Adachi Y. Kaya S. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control and Its Role in Disease. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag GmbH & Co. KG, Darmstadt, Germany1994: 581-592Crossref Google Scholar), as in the case for AP2PL fluorescence change by ATP described above. To follow the initial ATP-induced phase of the AP2PL fluorescence change of the Mg2+-Na+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzymes, various concentrations of ATP were added to the AP2PL-FITC enzyme (Fig. 2 A). The addition of 1 and 3 μm ATP induced a biphasic AP2PL fluorescence change similar to that observed for the AP2PL enzyme (19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), namely a rapid decrease, followed by a slow increase. The rapid decrease apparently disappeared because of an acceleration in the slow increase in the presence of up to 10 μm ATP. However, the extent of the fluorescence increase was near saturation at around 10 μm ATP (Fig. 2 B, inset). The rate constants for the rapid decrease and the slow increase increased in a nearly linear fashion with increasing concentrations of ATP (Fig. 2 B), suggesting the participation of at least two different ATP bindings. The slopes of the two straight lines (Fig. 2 B) permitted a semiquantitative estimation of the apparent second order rate constants (k +1) to be 1.8 × 106 and 0.1 × 106m−1 s−1, respectively, for ATP for the formation of the two different conformational states with negative and positive AP2PL fluorescence intensity, compared with the Na+-bound enzyme. The dissociation rate constant (k −1) and the dissociation constant (K d =k −1/k +1) for the latter were estimated from the intercept, 0.82 s−1, and the ratio, 7.5 μm. These data suggest that at least two different ATP bindings with a ∼20-fold difference in k +1 value induced quite different AP2PL fluorescence changes in the Mg2+-Na+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzymes without significant phosphorylation (18Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ATP appears to be a better substrate than AcP in terms of increasing AP2PL fluorescence, as evidenced by the fact that eachk 1 and K d was at least 100-fold and 1/40 of that for AcP (19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When the concentration of added ATP was reduced to 0.3 μmATP, the concentration of which was ∼3 fold larger than the concentration of the α-chain present (Fig. 2 A, inset), the rate constant for the decrease and the increase in AP2PL fluorescence were determined to be, respectively, 1.3/s and 0.06/s. This very slow increase seemed to be due to the slow turn over of the AP2PL-FITC enzyme just after hydrolysis of ATP (18Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as it reached the original fluorescence level rather than to the second ATP binding-induced increase in the fluorescence, the extent of which would be higher than the initial fluorescence level as observed in the presence of up to 3 μm ATP (Fig. 2,A and B, inset, open circles). High concentrations of ATP are known to accelerate the transition of K+-bound enzyme to Na+-bound enzyme (21Karlish S.J.D. Yates D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The ATP binding capacity of the AP2PL-FITC enzyme was already shown to be at least 50% of that of the control enzyme (18Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ATP accelerated the transition of K+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzyme to the Na+-bound enzyme, both AP2PL and FITC fluorescence changes were followed immediately after the addition of ATP and/or Na+. The addition of 5 mm ATP induced fluorescence changes in neither AP2PL (Fig. 3 A, second trace) nor FITC (Fig. 3 B, third trace). The addition of 160 mm Na+ induced a decrease in the AP2PL fluorescence (Fig. 3 A, third trace), 3.6/s, and a biphasic increase in FITC fluorescence (Fig. 3 B, second trace), 4.4 and 0.8/s. The addition of 160 mm Na+ with 0.5 mm ATP induced a biphasic AP2PL change (Fig. 3 A, bottom), a rapid decrease (21/s), followed by a slow increase (0.7/s) with only slight effect of ATP to increase in both the extent and the rate of the FITC fluorescence (trace not shown). The extent of the initial rapid decrease in AP2PL fluorescence with increasing the concentrations of ATP could not be detected accurately due to the subsequent increase (Fig. 4 B, closed circles). The addition of 160 mm sodium with 5 mm ATP induced a monophasic increase in AP2PL fluorescence (Fig. 3 A, top), 6.4/s, with a biphasic increase in FITC fluorescence (Fig. 3 B, top), 7.0 and 1.2/s, with slight increase in the extent. Although the addition of 5 mm Na+ induced slight increases in FITC fluorescence (Fig. 3 B, bottom), the simultaneous addition of both 5 mm Na+ and 5 mmATP induced larger biphasic increases in FITC fluorescence (Fig. 3 B, fourth trace), 5.8 and 1.8/s, which showed more clearly the effects of ATP on the extent of FITC fluorescence change. Fig. 4 (A and B, respectively) shows the dependence of ATP concentration on the rate constants and the corresponding extent of both fluorescence changes in the presence of 160 mm Na+. Each rate constant for the decrease and the increase of AP2PL fluorescence increased with increasing concentrations of ATP accompanied by some deviation from linearity (Fig. 4 A, closed and open circles). The concentration dependence of ATP on FITC fluorescence changes that accompanied the transition from the K+ form to the Na+ form also suggest two different extents of ATP-induced FITC fluorescence increases with only a small increase in the rate constants (Fig. 4, A and B, open and closed triangles). These data showed that level of ATP up to submillimolar levels exerted two different actions on each of the AP2PL and FITC fluorescence changes for the K+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzymes, namely that the same concentrations of ATP resulted in four different fluorescence changes with different rate constant and/or extents. However, approximately micromolar ATP resulted in two actions on the AP2PL fluorescence change of the Na+-bound AP2PL-FITC enzymes (Fig. 2 B) with little FITC fluorescence change. To investigate the relationship between the AcP-dependent phosphorylation and fluorescence changes, 1 mm AcP was added, the concentration of which is sufficient to saturate phosphorylation (19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This caused a decrease in the FITC fluorescence with rate constants of 8.5 and 1.2/s, and a decrease of 5.5 and 0.8% respectively (Fig. 5,second trace). The data could be also fitted to a single exponential curve with 7.1/s and 5.7%. Phosphorylation occurred with a rapid (7.2/s) and slow (4.6/s) phase, and showed nearly the same amount of components, namely 24 and 26%, to give half-site phosphorylation (Fig. 6, open circles), followed by two different AP2PL fluorescence increases with rate constants of 1.4 and 0.2/s and an extent of 2.4 and 0.7%, respectively (Fig. 6, top trace). Such double exponential AP2PL fluorescence changes cannot be obtained for the case of AcP-induced AP2PL fluorescence of AP2PL enzyme (19Tsuda T,. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The addition of 10 μm ATP induced neither FITC fluorescence change (Fig. 5, top) nor significant phosphorylation (18Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem.

In this paper, the phosphorylation capacity of the α-chain of Na+,K+-ATPase was determined in order to compare the stoichiometry of fluorescence probes bound to the α-chain of the enzyme ∼0.5 mol of AP2PL-probe/α-chain at Lys-480 and ∼0.9 mol of FITC probe/α-chain at Lys-501 (20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, Mg2+-, Na+-, and ATP-dependent AP2PL fluorescence changes of the probe-modified enzymes were also studied. The data are consistent with the presence of quarter-, half-, and full-site reactivities of the enzyme. Methods for the purification of Na+,K+-ATPase from pig kidney by sodium deoxycholate followed by treatment with NaI or from dog kidney by SDS treatment have been reported previously (7Nagai M. Taniguchi K. Kangawa K. Matsuo S. Nakamura S. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13197-13202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hayashi Y. Mimura K. Matsui H. Takagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 983: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the former and the latter were ∼700–1300 and ∼2500 μmol/mg of protein/h and the Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme from ATP constituted ∼1–1.7 and ∼3.5 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. The protein concentration, Na+,K+-ATPase activity, and the amount of phosphoenzyme formed from [γ-32P]ATP or [32P]AcP were estimated as described previously (7Nagai M. Taniguchi K. Kangawa K. Matsuo S. Nakamura S. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13197-13202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kaya S. Tsuda T. Hagiwara K. Fukui T. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7419-7422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Na+-ATPase activity was measured in a solution containing 25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mmMgCl2, 25 mm sucrose, 16 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA-Tris (pH 7.4) with ∼0.5–10 μm [γ-32P]ATP with or without 100 μm ouabain for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 1 mm H3PO4, followed by determination of the released32Pi (33Blostein R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation reaction (1 mg of protein/ml) was carried out under the same conditions as were used for the Na-ATPase activity measurement except, in some experiments, the 16 mm NaCl was replaced with 2 m NaCl containing 5 μg/ml oligomycin and the incubation time was for 5 s at 0 °C using 10–2700 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was quenched with four volumes of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 1 mm H3PO4by a manual method. The time course for phosphoenzyme formation was followed using a Bio-Logic Quench-Flow Module (QFM-5) at 25 °C. The experiments were started by mixing equal volumes (60 μl) of the solution for the Na+-ATPase measurement. In addition, one volume contained 0.5 mg/ml enzyme protein and the other volume contained 2 mm [32P]AcP or 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP. After mixing, the reaction was quenched by 1 m HCl, 10 mmH3PO4, and 1 mm AcP or ATP. The denatured phosphoenzyme was washed on a glass fiber filter, and the amount of phosphoenzyme was determined (11Taniguchi K. Mårdh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15588-15594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate the content of phosphorylated α-chain, the denatured enzyme was precipitated by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C (Optima, TLA 100.3, Beckman) and the pellet suspended in ice-cold distilled water and centrifuged a second time. The addition of 4% (LDS) containing 50 mm CH3COOLi (pH 4.2) and 100 mm Li2SO4 (34Barrabin H. Scofano H.M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) solubilized up to 90% of the radioactivity. The supernatant was applied to a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with elution buffer 50 mmCH3COOLi (pH 4.2) containing 100 mmLi2SO4, 1 mmH3PO4, and 1% LDS. The radioactivity and absorbance at 280 nm were measured in each 0.75-ml fraction collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 4 °C. The content of phosphorylated α-chain was calculated by the ratio of the amount of phosphorylated α-chain, estimated from the specific activity of 32P bound to the α-chain, to the total amount of α-chain, which was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 109.765 m−1cm1 (35Takagi T. Maezawa S. Hayashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Methods for the modification of pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase preparation (1 mg/ml) with 50 μm AP2PL in 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.8) for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by reductive fixation of reagents to the enzyme, have been reported previously (17Kaya S. Tsuda T. Hagiwara K. Fukui T. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7419-7422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting AP2PL enzyme (1 mg/ml) was further treated with 15 μm FITC in a mixture containing 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.2) for 30 min at 25 °C (20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The resulting doubly modified enzyme was used as the AP2PL-FITC enzyme. The amount of AP2PL or FITC probe bound to the α-chain was determined as described previously (20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Transient fluorescence measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics DX 17MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter at 25 °C (11Taniguchi K. Mårdh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15588-15594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were started by mixing equal volumes (25 μl) of a solution as described for the Na+-ATPase measurements. In addition, one volume contained 60 μg/ml enzyme protein and the other volume contained various concentrations of ATP or AcP or corresponding concentrations of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) as a control. The sample was excited at 320 (AP2PL) nm, and the emission was detected at 390 (AP2PL) nm after passage through Nippon Shinku Kogaku interference filters, which allowed maximum transmittance at 390 nm. The reactions were repeated at least 10 times. The ratios of accumulated data in the presence of substrates to those obtained for the controls were fitted as a single or a double exponential curve to estimate the apparent rate constants and the extent of fluorescence changes using non-linear least squares fit analysis. The experiments were performed with several different enzyme preparations, and the data shown are typical examples. The enzymatic synthesis of [32P]AcP from [32P]phosphoric acid and the preparation of pyridoxal 5′-diphospho-5′-adenosine (AP2PL) was performed as described earlier (17Kaya S. Tsuda T. Hagiwara K. Fukui T. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7419-7422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FITC (Type I) was purchased from Dojin Chemical Institute, Kumamoto, Japan. AcP was purchased from Sigma and converted to the Tris form. The [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]phosphoric acid were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals used were of the highest grade commercially available. Chemical modifications of Na+,K+-ATPase with AP2PL and FITC (20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) suggested a half-site reactivity for Lys-480 with respect to AP2PL and all site reactivity for Lys-501 with respect to FITC in the catalytic subunits of the enzyme. To determine the stoichiometry of the amount of bound probes and phosphorylation capacity/α-chain, phosphorylated α-chains were isolated using a Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column in order to measure the amount directly. These values were compared with the amount of phosphoenzyme/mg protein evaluated by the membrane filtration method (7Nagai M. Taniguchi K. Kangawa K. Matsuo S. Nakamura S. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13197-13202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To fully phosphorylate pig kidney enzymes under steady state conditions, phosphorylation reactions were carried out for 5 s at 0 °C with increasing concentrations of ATP in the presence of 4 mm Mg2+, 2m Na+, and 5 μg/ml oligomycin in order to block completely the transition of E1P to E2P (36Taniguchi K. Suzuki K. Sasaki T. Shimokobe H. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3272-3281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane filtration method showed that 10 μmATP gave nearly the saturation level (1.2 nmol/mg of protein) for phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). Dog kidney enzymes, which showed 3.5 nmol of phosphoenzyme/mg of protein by the membrane filtration method, were phosphorylated and the phosphoenzymes precipitated and solubilized with LDS, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to column separation. A major single peak with both radioactivity and UV absorption appeared showing a maximum value at fraction 73 (Fig. 1 B). The ratio of the amount of phosphorylated α-chain to that of total α-chain was calculated from each fraction (Fig. 1 B, triangles, 64–83). This ratio increased with increasing the fraction numbers, reaching a maximum constant value ∼0.51 ± 0.02 mol/mol α-chain (fractions 69–78) and then decreasing. The fractions giving a ratio of ∼0.5 contained only α-chains, as determined by SDS gel electrophoresis (not shown). The data indicated the fractions contained equal amount of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated α-chains. Neither significant radioactive peaks for either ATP or Piwere detected in fractions containing cold ATP and Pi (not shown). Four different enzyme preparations from kidneys of pigs and dogs, which maximally accumulated 1∼3.6 nmol of phosphoenzyme/mg of membrane protein, gave a value of 0.49 ± 0.03 mol/mol of α-chain. When the phosphoenzymes were formed in the presence of 4 mmMg2+ and 16 mm Na+, in the absence of oligomycin (Fig. 1 A, open circle), the amount of phosphoenzyme decreased to 75% of the maximum. The amount of isolated phosphorylated α-chain from the peak fractions was ∼0.37 mol/mol of α-chain, also suggesting that the maximum phosphorylation capacity is ∼0.5 (= ∼0.37/0.75) mol/mol of α-chain after correction for a phosphorylation level of 75%. The overall recovery of the radioactivity from the phosphoenzymes obtained by the membrane filtration method to the radioactivity of the α-chain fraction were consistently near 80%. These data suggest that only 50% of the α-chain could be phosphorylated under conditions of maximum phosphorylation from the ATP independent of the specific activity of the enzyme preparations investigated. It has been reported previously (20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that the AP2PL modified enzymes contained ∼0.5 mol of AP2PL probe at Lys-480/mol of α-chain and retained ∼50% of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and that the AP2PL-FITC modified enzyme contained ∼0.9 mol of FITC probe at Lys-501/mol of α-chain and retained only ∼5% of Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Steady state phosphorylation levels and the rate and extent of AP2PL fluorescence changes of the AP2PL enzymes and AP2PL-FITC enzymes were measured after the addition of 10 μm ATP or 1 mm AcP (Table I). The data showed that AP2PL modification and the AP2PL-FITC modification reduced the amount of phosphoenzymes from ATP to 50 and 6%, respectively, indicating that ∼0.5 mol of AP2PL probe binding at Lys-480 and ∼0.9 mol of FITC probe binding/α-chain reduced the value (in moles of ATP-dependent phosphorylation/mol of α-chain) from 0.5 to 0.25 and 0.03 (Fig. 1 B), with little influence on the half-site phosphorylation by AcP (Table I) and full-site ouabain binding in the presence of Mg2+ and Pi as reported previously (27Yamazaki A. Kaya S. Tsuda T. Araki Y. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem.

The phosphorylation reaction at 0 °C and the transient fluorescence measurement at 25 °C was, respectively, performed by a manual method and stopped-flow method. The final reaction mixture for phosphorylation and fluorescence measurements, respectively, contained 250 and 30 μg of protein/ml with 25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm sucrose, 16 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA-Tris (pH 7.4) with 10 μm ATP or 1 mm AcP. The amount of Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme from 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 5 s or 1 mm [32P]AcP for 30 s was measured. Individual amounts of phosphoenzyme of the control enzyme from ATP (1.3 ± 0.1 nmol/mg protein) and AcP (1.1 ± 0.1 nmol/mg protein) were used as 100% values. The Na+-ATPase activity of the control, AP2PL-, and AP2PL-FITC enzyme was, respectively, 1.7, 0.90, and 0.13 μmol/mg/h, and the amount of Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme of corresponding sample was 1.3, 0.65, and 0.08 nmol/mg protein. The individual apparent turnover number of Na+-ATPase was estimated from the ratio of the Na+-ATPase activity to the amount of Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme for each preparation. The final extent and the rate constant of AP2PL fluorescence increase induced by 10 μm ATP or 1 mm AcP were estimated from single exponential curve fitting. Numbers shown are means and standard deviations of the results of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab A Na+, K+-ATPase preparation from pig kidney was treated with 50 μm AP2PL or further treated with 15 μm FITC as described previously (20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation reaction at 0 °C and the transient fluorescence measurement at 25 °C was, respectively, performed by a manual method and stopped-flow method. The final reaction mixture for phosphorylation and fluorescence measurements, respectively, contained 250 and 30 μg of protein/ml with 25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm sucrose, 16 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA-Tris (pH 7.4) with 10 μm ATP or 1 mm AcP. The amount of Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme from 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 5 s or 1 mm [32P]AcP for 30 s was measured. Individual amounts of phosphoenzyme of the control enzyme from ATP (1.3 ± 0.1 nmol/mg protein) and AcP (1.1 ± 0.1 nmol/mg protein) were used as 100% values. The Na+-ATPase activity of the control, AP2PL-, and AP2PL-FITC enzyme was, respectively, 1.7, 0.90, and 0.13 μmol/mg/h, and the amount of Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme of corresponding sample was 1.3, 0.65, and 0.08 nmol/mg protein. The individual apparent turnover number of Na+-ATPase was estimated from the ratio of the Na+-ATPase activity to the amount of Na+-dependent phosphoenzyme for each preparation. The final extent and the rate constant of AP2PL fluorescence increase induced by 10 μm ATP or 1 mm AcP were estimated from single exponential curve fitting. Numbers shown are means and standard deviations of the results of three independent experiments. Stopped-flow measurements showed that the addition of 10 μm ATP to the AP2PL enzyme and AP2PL-FITC enzyme preparations, respectively, in the presence of 4 mm Mg2+ and 16 mmNa+ increased the AP2PL fluorescence intensity to ∼3% despite 50 and 94% reduction in phosphorylation by ATP (Table I). The addition of 1 mm AcP to these preparations also increased the fluorescence to nearly the same level with little change in the maximum phosphorylation capacity (Table I). The concentration dependence of ATP on Na+-ATPase activity of the AP2PL enzyme and AP2PL-FITC enzyme showed that the modification reduced the V maxfrom 1.7 to 0.9 and 0.13 μmol of ATP/mg of protein/h with little change in the K m of ∼0.7 μm. The apparent turnover number of Na+-ATPase, the ratio of the ATPase activity to the amount of phosphoenzyme from ATP, was 0.35, 0.39, and 0.48/s for the control, the AP2PL enzyme and the AP2PL-FITC enzyme, respectively. Concentration dependence of ATP, Na+, and K+ on Na+,K+-ATPase activity of the AP2PL enzyme also showed K 0.5 values similar to those of controls: ∼0.8, ∼8, and ∼1.3 mm, respectively. The data suggested that AP2PL modification of Na+,K+-ATPase has no effect on any substrate affinity. However, further experiments in the presence of lower concentrations of ATP are needed, because the rate of ATP-dependent phosphorylation seemed to reduce slightly after AP2PL treatment as shown later (Fig. 2, inset). To further investigate the ATP-induced conformation change, 1, 3, and 10 μm ATP were added to the AP2PL enzyme, respectively, which induced a slow monophasic decrease, a rapid decrease followed by an increase, and then a very rapid decrease, followed by a large monophasic increase (Fig. 2, third, second, and top trace). The data show that low and high concentrations of ATP induced quite different fluorescence changes. Such changes require the simultaneous presence of ATP and Na+ with Mg2+ or Ca2+ (not shown). ATP could not be replaced with AMP-PNP or ADP (Fig. 2,fourth and fifth trace). To investigate the relationship between fluorescence change and the extent of ATP induced phosphorylation remaining, rapid-quenching experiments were performed. The addition of 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP induced a rapid phosphorylation (47/s) to give 0.8 mol of phosphoenzyme/mg of protein (Fig. 2, inset, open circles), followed by a decrease (29/s) and slower increase (1.1/s) in the AP2PL fluorescence (Fig. 2, top trace). As a control phosphorylation experiment, 10 μm ATP was added to the enzyme preparation not treated with AP2PL, which resulted in a more rapid phosphorylation (60/s) to give 1.5 nmol of phosphoenzyme/mg of protein (Fig. 2,inset, closed circles). To investigate the relationship between AcP-induced phosphorylation and fluorescence change (Table I), various concentrations of AcP were added to the AP2PL enzyme. Each addition of 0.1, 1, and 3 mm induced a monophasic increase in AP2PL fluorescence, 0.5, 1.2, and 3.2/s to an extent of 1.6, 3.9, and 4.2%, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The addition of 1 mm [32P]AcP induced a more rapid phosphorylation (3/s) than a fluorescence change to give 1.3 nmol of phosphoenzyme/mg of protein as has been reported previously (32Tsuda T. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Taniguchi K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Neither a biphasic AP2PL fluorescence change, such as that observed by the addition of ATP (Fig. 2, top and second trace) nor a biphasic increase was observed by the addition of various concentrations of AcP (Fig. 3, A and B). The concentration dependence of AcP on both the extent of phosphorylation and fluorescence change appeared to be nearly the same (K 0.5 = ∼0.1 mm) as shown (Fig. 3 B, open circles and triangles). However the rate constant for the monophasic fluorescence changes increased linearly with an increase in the concentration of AcP (Fig. 3 B, closed triangles). The apparent second order rate constant (k +1) for the AcP of the enzyme form with a high AP2PL fluorescence, as estimated from the slope, was found to be 1.2 × 103m−1 s−1. The dissociation rate constant (k −1) and the dissociation constant (K d =k −1/k +1) estimated from the intercept and the ratio was 0.4 s−1 and 0.3 mm, respectively. The present experiments show directly that the maximum amount of steady state phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase is approximately 0.5 mol/mol of α-chain. The maximum amount of ATP or its analogues binding to the enzyme was shown to be the same, ∼1 mol/mol of α-chain (37Matsui H. Hayashi Y. Homareda H. Taguchi M. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1983; 19: 141-148Google Scholar) or nearly the same (Ref. 20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; see also Table I of Ref. 27Yamazaki A. Kaya S. Tsuda T. Araki Y. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to that of ouabain-enzyme complex. Present data are consistent with our previous data, which showed that the ratio of the maximum amount of ouabain-enzyme complex to that of phosphoenzyme was ∼2 and was independent of the specific activity of the enzyme preparations from dog kidney purified with SDS (2000–2750 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h) or from pig kidney purified with sodium deoxycholate-NaI (500–1200 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h) (27Yamazaki A. Kaya S. Tsuda T. Araki Y. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been reported that pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase preparations contained ∼10% heterogeneity (38Jensen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1110: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This value is too small to explain half of the site reactivities described below. The Lys-480 is conserved in various Na+,K+-ATPase α-chains (39Xu K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5764-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence analysis of the α-chains of pig kidney enzymes showed that nearly all the sequence started with Gly-1, which also excluded proteolytic breakdown of the α-chain to produce 50% heterogeneity (not shown). The present data showed half-site phosphorylation by ATP and AcP, respectively, and half-site reactivity to AP2PL (a quarter-site phosphorylation by ATP after the half-site modification by AP2PL), while they showed full-site ouabain binding capacity from Pi with Mg2+ (27Yamazaki A. Kaya S. Tsuda T. Araki Y. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), ATP-sensitive full-site reactivity toward FITC and nearly full-site ATP binding capacity, respectively (20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). From these data it can be concluded that Mg2+- and Na+-dependent phosphorylation from ATP or AcP under steady state conditions occurred on only half of the Asp-369 residues in the α-chains of the membrane-bound Na+,K+-ATPase. It is possible, but not likely, that these preparations used were 50% denatured or contained nonfunctional enzymes with respect to the phosphorylation. This possibility can be rejected based on the following data. For similar pig kidney enzyme preparations, the ratio of the maximum amount of phosphoenzyme formed from paranitrophenylphosphate and from ATP under a steady state condition was ∼2 (27Yamazaki A. Kaya S. Tsuda T. Araki Y. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A large transient increase in the amount of phosphoenzyme compared with that under a steady state level occurred after the addition of high concentrations of ATP (40Peluffo R.D. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1051-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chymotryptic digestion increased in the amount of phosphoenzymes (41Liu G. Xie Z. Modyyanof N.N. Askari A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data can be explained, based on full-site phosphorylation, which occurred under those conditions as the result of a decrease or disruption of subunit-interactions (23Askari A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Hayashi Y. Kameyama K. Kobayashi T. Hagiwara E. Shinji N. Takagi T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 41Liu G. Xie Z. Modyyanof N.N. Askari A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Na+-bound AP2PL and AP2PL-FITC enzyme showed a 2 order of magnitude reduced affinity for ATP in the presence of CDTA (20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but the addition of ∼μm ATP in the presence of 4 mmMg2+ to the Na+-bound enzymes clearly induced dynamic AP2PL fluorescence changes that were independent of FITC treatment (Fig. 2 and Table I). The issue of the meaning of the ATP-induced AP2PL fluorescence change of AP2PL and AP2PL-FITC enzymes (Fig. 2 A and Table I) is an interesting one. The presence of ATP, Mg2+, and Na+ is a prerequisite for dynamic reversible AP2PL fluorescence change as reported previously (17Kaya S. Tsuda T. Hagiwara K. Fukui T. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7419-7422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP could not be replaced with either a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, or ADP (Fig. 2). The increase of apparent turnover of Na+-ATPase after AP2PL or AP2PL-FITC treatment suggests ATP hydrolysis without phosphorylation (Table I). No significant binding of ATP, ADP, or Pi to the AP2PL-FITC enzyme was detected in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, Na+, and pyruvate kinase (20Tsuda T. Kaya S. Funatsu H. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the AP2PL fluorescence change reflects a conformational state of the enzyme immediately after ATP hydrolysis rather than that of the ATP-bound enzyme containing Mg2+ and Na+ or an enzyme-phosphate complex. For both AP2PL and AP2PL-FITC enzymes, it would be useful to follow not only ATP, but also AcP-induced conformational events near the ATP binding or phosphorylation domain of the enzyme. The half- and full-site reactivities described above appear to be consistent with a diprotomer model of the enzyme (Fig. 4 A). However the AP2PL enzyme showed a quarter-site phosphorylation/α-chain from ATP followed by slower AP2PL fluorescence change (Table I, Figs. 1 B and 2). The enzyme also showed half-site phosphorylation by AcP followed by slower AP2PL fluorescence change (Table I and Fig. 3). These data are consistent with a tetrameric model (Fig. 4 B). Previous data also supported a quarter-site reactivity to show that only half of the phosphoenzyme formed, which was equal to 0.25 mol/α-chain, was split rapidly by acetate (10Taniguchi K. Tosa H. Suzuki K. Kamo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12943-12947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and only half of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme was split by p-nitrophenol to synthesizep-nitrophenylphosphate (27Yamazaki A. Kaya S. Tsuda T. Araki Y. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Affinity modification with an ATP analog is reported to occur to the extent of 1 mol/4 protomers (21Dzhandzhugazyan K. Modyanov N. Glynn I. Ellory C. Sodium Pump. Company of Biologists Ltd, Cambridge, United Kingdom1985: 129-134Google Scholar). It has been also suggested that if only half of the protomers are phosphorylated, the ligand-induced cooperativities of the equilibrium binding data indicated that the functional unit is a tetramer of αβ-protomers (23Askari A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Model B explains the fact (Fig. 2) that 10 μm ATP induced a quarter-site phosphorylation of the AP2PL enzyme (47/s) at one of two nonmodified α-chains and that ATP then induced a rapid decrease (29/s) in one AP2PL-modified α-chain and a slow increase (1.1/s) in another AP2PL-modified α-chain. One may ask that subunit interactions are not prerequisite for Na+,K+-ATPase activity, since the AP2PL enzyme still retained ∼50% of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in spite of a 50% reduction in phosphorylation capacity from ATP (Table I). Although further experiments are required, one explanation is that ATP induced the AP2PL fluorescence change in the AP2PL-modified α-chain and the resulting conformational state might be sufficient to allow subunit interaction, and in turn, to permit ATP hydrolysis in non-modified α-chains. Recently, the dimeric interaction of αβ-protomers was detected by a cross-linking reagent (23Askari A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol.

The present data extend these with respect to showing that the maximum phosphorylation/mol of α-chain for ATP or AcP was ∼0.5 and that Mg2+-Na+-bound AP2PL enzyme accepted ATP, inducing a quarter-site phosphorylation followed by two different AP2PL fluorescence changes. Quarter-, half-, and full-site reactivities support the hypothesis that the functional unit of membrane-bound Na+,K+-ATPase is a tetraprotomer, composed of αβ protomers. ATP-induced conformational events in each subunit of AP2PL-FITC enzymes and BIPM enzymes retaining full Na+,K+-ATPase activity will be described in the following paper (46Tsuda T. Kaya S. Yokoyama T.

Yoshikawa H.-F. Zumstein E. Yoshikawa H. Danchin A. Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar). In E. coli, rpsB and tsf form a single transcriptional unit, and an attenuation mechanism was proposed to explain the 1 to 3 ratio of Ef-Ts to S2 (3An G. Bendiak D.S. Mamelak L.A. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4163-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In B. subtilisa potential terminator is found between rpsB and tsf. In S. citri, the absence of a rho-independent termination signal in the spacer region betweenrpsB and tsf, and between tsf and x, indicates that rpsB, tsf, and X might represent a single transcriptional unit. Transcriptional analyses of rpsB, tsf, and x genes of S. citri have recently revealed two different transcripts (70Le Dantec, L., Bové, J. M., and Saillard C. (1998)Curr. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar), one corresponding to therpsB/tsf/x operon and the second torpsB alone. These results suggested that a regulatory mechanism may act at the transcriptional level at the spacer region between rpsB and tsf. The only “regulatory” like sequence found in the rpsB-tsf region is an inverted repeat sequence at the 3′ end of rpsB (Fig. 1). This inverted repeat sequence is 20 bp long and represents two turns of helical DNA. It could be a binding site for a regulatory DNA-binding protein (8Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 293-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 9Harrison S.C. Aggarwal A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 933-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In the study reported here, we have purified, by a combination of affinity and gel filtration chromatographies, a 46-kDa protein (P46) that displays preferential binding to a 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the inverted repeat sequence. The gene coding for P46 has been cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis has revealed significant similarities between the N-terminal part of P46 and the L29 eubacterial ribosomal protein family. Surprisingly, theS. citri protein is much larger than its eubacterial homologs, and the C-terminal domain of P46 shows significant similarities with the DNA-binding histone H1-like proteins found in some bacterial species. These results suggest a bifunctional role for P46. The protein could act as a ribosomal protein but also as a DNA-binding protein with a potential regulatory function. Crude extracts were prepared from S. citri strain R8A2 (ATCC 27556) cultivated in 5 to 10 liters of SP4 medium (10Tully J.G. Whitcomb R.F. Clark H.F. Williamson D.L. Science. 1977; 195: 892-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) at 32 °C. Cells from exponential growth phase were harvested by centrifugation at 17,000 × gfor 40 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 70 g/liter sorbitol, and frozen at −20 °C overnight. Cells were then thawed on ice, resuspended in 10 to 30 ml of binding buffer BB (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5% glycerol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication (5/10-s pulses, 50 watts, 0 °C, 1 min sonication, and 1 min on ice alternatively, 8 to 10 times with a Vibracell sonicator). Mixture was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 20 min; the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was directly loaded onto heparin chromatography column or frozen at −70 °C for storage. The protein concentration of the supernatant, assayed by the Bradford procedure (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard, was in the range of 1–10 mg/ml. The method used for Southwestern analysis is a modification of previously described “protein blotting” method (12Bowen B. Steinberg J. Laemmli U.K. Weintraub H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Crude or purified proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gel using standard procedures (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted (14Towbin H. Stahelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) to nitrocellulose membranes (C extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 45 min at 8 watts in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris base, 190 mm glycine, and 15% methanol) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Fastblot Biometra). Membranes were dried 15 min at 37 °C and blocked for 60 min at 26 °C in buffer S (BB buffer containing 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and 0.02% bovine serum albumin). Membranes were incubated in 10 ml of S buffer containing 106 cpm/ml end-labeled specific IRS probe. This probe is the synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GGATTTGCTTTACCAAAAGCAAAAAAGCTG-3′ and 3′-CCTAAACGAAATGGTTTTCGTTTTTTCGAC-5′) containing the inverted repeat sequence (Fig. 1). It was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biochemicals) using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified using a Sephadex G-25 column (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Incubations were at 26 °C for 60 min in screw-capped glass tubes with gentle rotation in rotating hybridization oven (Robbins Scientific), followed by three washes of 15 min in S buffer. The blots were then exposed 1–12 h for autoradiography. Preferential affinity of P46 for the IRS sequence was examined by competition experiments; 15 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled IRS, blots were incubated with a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled IRS (specific competitor) or with a 200-fold molar excess of an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide that does not contain the inverted repeat sequence (5′-GGTTATTAAGTTATCGATTT-3′ and 3′-CCAATAATTCAATAGCTAAA-5′) (nonspecific competitor). After addition of the radiolabeled IRS to these hybridization mixtures containing the competitors, the incubation was for 1 h as described above. Column operations were carried out by using a Bio-Pilot Scale FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). About 70 mg of total proteins were loaded onto HiTrap heparin column (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with ice-cold BB buffer. The column was washed with ice-cold BB buffer until the 280-nm absorbance reading returned to the base line, and proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 50 mm to 1 m KCl in BB buffer. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected, and 10–50-μl aliquots from each fraction were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels by Coomassie Blue staining and tested for the presence of IRS-binding proteins by Southwestern blot analyses. Fractions containing IRS-binding proteins were loaded on a gel filtration chromatography column without freezing. Remaining fractions were stored frozen at −70 °C. Fractions (200 μl) collected from the affinity chromatography containing IRS-binding proteins were loaded onto an FPLC Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with running buffer (BB buffer containing 200 mm KCl) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column was eluted at 0.2 ml/min with running buffer; and 0.2-ml fractions were collected, and 10–100-μl aliquots of each fraction were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels by Coomassie Blue staining and tested for the presence of IRS-binding proteins by Southwestern analysis. Column calibration was performed using blue dextran 2000 (for void volume), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). P46 containing fraction, recovered from gel filtration chromatography, was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. P46 protein was visualized by an overnight amido black staining (16Wilson C. Anal.

P46 microsequencing was made by the “Laboratoire de Microsequencage des Proteines” (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). After proteolytic digestion with endopeptidase Lys-C, three peptides, designated P1, P2, and P3, were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Standard procedures in molecular biology were used for preparation of plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA ligation, and transformation of E. coli (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To amplify S. citri genomic DNA, two pairs of degenerated primers were synthesized based on amino acid sequences of two peptides (P1 and P2) derived from purified P46. The codon usage of S. citri,based on previously sequenced genes (17Bové J.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1993; 17: 10-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was used to reduce degeneration of the primers. PCR amplification was performed for 40 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer), using 40 cycles, each of 1 min at 92 °C, 1 min at 37 °C, 1 min at 72 °C. The primer pair, P46-2, 5′-GAAAA(C/T)AC(A/T)GC(A/T)AT(A/T)AA(C/T)GT(A/T)AA-3′ (a sense oligonucleotide corresponding to the C-terminal end of internal peptide sequence P2, KNSGENTAINVK), and P46-1c, 5′-TT(C/T)CA(A/G)TT(A/T)GT(A/C/T)CC(A/G)TA-3′ (an antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the N-terminal end of internal peptide sequence P1, KEYTYGTNWK), was found to drive the amplification of a 0.7-kbp DNA fragment. This fragment was cloned into the pTAG vector (R & D Systems) that has complementary T overhangs, suitable for ligation of PCR fragments. This fragment was sequenced using T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) together with pTAG SEQ 5′ and pTAG SEQ 3′ primers (R & D Systems). The insert was excised from the vector, separated on agarose gel, purified by the GeneClean Kit (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA), random primer-labeled with [α-32P]ATP (ICN Biochemicals), purified on a Sephadex G-50 column (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and used as a probe in Southern blot experiments (18Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar) with S. citrirestricted genomic DNA. A 3.5-kbp EcoRI DNA fragment was detected. The probe was then used to screen an S. citrigenomic library, constructed in E. coli XL1 Blue by cloningEcoRI-restricted DNA fragments into plasmid pBS+ (Stratagene Cloning Systems). One positive clone containing the 3.5-kbpEcoRI insert was selected. Insert was sequenced using the T7 sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or the Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequences were analyzed using the Wisconsin Package (version 9.0) of software programs from Genetics Computer Group (GCG, Madison, WI) (19Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Potential ORFs were examined by codon bias analysis (20Staden R. McLachlan A.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar). Enriched ribosomal fraction was obtained using a modification of previously described methods (25Tissières A. Watson J.D. Schlessinger D. Hollingworth B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1959; 1: 221-233Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar,26Matthaei J.H. Nirenberg M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1580-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). S. citri cells were ground with alumina and suspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 60 mm NH4Cl, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing DNase I at 2 μg/ml. The extract was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris and then at 33,000 × g for 30 min to obtain the S-30 fraction. The S-30 fraction was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 2 h to sediment the ribosomes. The supernatant solution (S-105) was aspirated, and the ribosomes were suspended in buffer A and were washed by centrifuging again at 105,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant fluid was decanted and discarded, and the ribosomes were suspended in buffer A. Enriched ribosomal fraction was aliquoted an stored at −70 °C or used directly in Southwestern experiments. Final protein concentration was 0.7 mg/ml in the ribosome fraction and 1.5 mg/ml in the S-105 fraction. 50-μl aliquots of ribosome fraction and S-105 fraction were tested for the presence of IRS-binding proteins by Southwestern analysis (see above). We describe here the purification, preliminary characterization, and identification of an S. citri protein that displays preferential binding affinity for a 30-bp oligonucleotide containing the 20-bp inverted repeat sequence present at the 3′-OH end of rpsB and preceding tsf (Fig. 1). The 30-bp sequence will be designated IRS. Crude extract of S. citri cells obtained by sonication in binding buffer BB, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was applied onto a heparin-agarose affinity column. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradiant of 0.05–1 m KCl. Protein concentration was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm (Fig. 2 A). Aliquots of the eluted fractions were first analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2 B). Detection of IRS-binding proteins was carried out by Southwestern blots (12Bowen B. Steinberg J. Laemmli U.K. Weintraub H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 27Miskimins W.K. Roberts M.P. McClelland A. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6741-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 28Michael N. Spector D. Mavromara-Nazos P. Kristie T.M. Roizman B. Science. 1988; 239: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In short, proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred on a nitrocellulose sheet, and incubated with radiolabeled IRS. After washing, IRS-binding proteins were detected by autoradiography. Southwestern analysis of eluted fractions detected a predominant IRS-binding protein of 46 kDa (P46) (Fig. 2 C) eluted at approximately 0.37–0.42 mKCl as indicated in Fig. 2 A. Two other minor IRS-binding protein species of approximately 25 and 38 kDa were detected in fractions 31–32 and 36, respectively. Part of the binding activity was lost after freezing/thawing cycles; therefore active fractions were used for further experiments immediately after preparation. To determine if the P46 protein displays some preferential affinity for the IRS sequence, we have used Southwestern competition assay. Aliquots of fraction F29 containing P46 protein eluted from the heparin column (Fig. 2) were resolved on three separate tracks (Fig. 3) by 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Southwestern analysis. Membranes were incubated with radiolabeled IRS (Fig. 3 lane A) or with radiolabeled IRS in the presence of cold competitors (Fig. 3, lanes B and C). Binding of radiolabeled IRS to P46 was not significantly reduced by a 200-fold molar excess of a non-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (Fig. 3,lane B), which does not contain the inverted repeat sequence, as compared with the IRS binding in the absence of competitor (Fig. 3, lane A). Competition by a 200-fold molar excess of non-labeled IRS reduced dramatically, or made undetectable, the binding of radiolabeled IRS (Fig. 3, lane C). These results strongly suggested that P46 exhibits preferential binding affinity for IRS. In a second step toward P46 purification, 200-μl aliquot of fraction F29 containing P46 protein retrieved from the heparin-agarose affinity column (Fig. 2) was loaded onto an FPLC Superose 12 column. Proteins were eluted at 0.2 ml/min with running buffer. Protein concentration was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm (Fig. 4 A). Aliquots of eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 4 B). IRS binding proteins were analyzed by Southwestern blots (Fig. 4 C). Almost all of the P46 IRS binding activity was present in fractions 26–28, and, as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, P46 was practically the only protein seen in these fractions. Comparison of the elution time of P46 from the Superose column with that of molecular mass markers including catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) indicated that P46 eluted at a position consistent with a molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa. This suggest that the native form of P46 is a homomultimer. To characterize further P46 we cloned its gene. First, P46 was partially sequenced. To that purpose an aliquot of fraction F27 containing P46 from the gel filtration purification step (Fig. 4) was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained with amido black (16Wilson C. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The P46 band was excised from the gel and submitted to endoproteolysis with Endo Lys-C. The proteolytic products were separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and three peptides (P1, P2, and P3) were sequenced. None of these sequences exhibited homology to any known protein sequence available in the data bases. Amino acid sequences of peptides P1 (KEYTYGTNWK) and P2 (KNSGENTAINVK) were used to design two pairs of degenerated primers in order to amplify by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) part of the gene of the P46 protein. An amplified DNA fragment of 700 bp was generated using the P462/P461c primer pair (see “Experimental Procedures”), cloned into pTAG vector, and sequenced. Sequence analysis of the cloned DNA fragment revealed that the amino acid sequence predicted from the amplified product contained the N-terminal sequence of the P1 peptide and the entire sequence of the P3 peptide (KIDLELK), confirming that this amplified product was generated from the P46 gene. Cloning of the full-length P46 gene was undertaken to gain further sequence information. A 3.5-kbp EcoRI S. citriDNA fragment was detected by Southern blot analysis of restricted genomic DNA using the 700-bp DNA fragment as a probe. Screening of anEcoRI S. citri genomic library with this probe yielded a clone containing a 3.5-kbp insert which was sequenced. Sequence analysis (details are described under “Experimental Procedures”) of the 3.5-kbp insert gave the following results. Authenticity of the insert was confirmed by perfect matches with the sequence of the three peptides (P1, P2, and P3) derived from purified P46 (Fig. 5). The molecular mass deduced from the ORF of the cloned P46 gene was 37 kDa, whereas its apparent molecular mass in SDS-PAGE was 46 kDa. Sequence similarities between deduced amino acid sequences of the insert and protein data bases (see Table I) showed that the gene coding for the P46 protein was located within a ribosomal protein operon corresponding to the S10 and spc operons of E. coli (29Post L.E.

Contrary to transpeptidation kinetics of other proteases, which depend upon an acyl-enzyme intermediate, the time course for pepsin-catalyzed transpeptidation displays a distinct lag before reaching a steady-state reaction velocity. Moreover, this lag is coupled to burst kinetics for the formation of proteolytic products, Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe and Nle-Ala-Leu-OMe. The lag requires that free Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe accumulate in the reaction medium during the lag phase and subsequently rebind for transpeptidation.

Porcine pepsin has long been known to catalyze transpeptidation as well as proteolysis (1Clement G.E. Prog. Bioorg. Chem. 1973; 2: 676-680Google Scholar). By analogy with serine proteases, the following mechanism was envisioned,E+P2­P1⇌E·P2­P1 →−P1 P2­E →+H2O P2+E‖ →+N E·P2­N→P2­N+ESCHEME Iwhere E is the proteolytic enzyme, P2-P1 is the polypeptide substrate with the scissile bond indicated by the hyphen, P1 is the first peptide product released by proteolysis, P2 is the second peptide product, N is an accepting peptide, and P2-N is the product of transpeptidation. P2-E is a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate that is the key to the transpeptidation mechanism in serine proteases; the covalent bond can be transferred to a hydroxyl of water to form a free carboxyl group, or it can be transferred to the amino terminus of an accepting peptide to form a new peptide bond. This has long been thought to be the only possible mechanism for transpeptidation. For example, Kasche (2Kasche V. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1989: 125-143Google Scholar) has written emphatically: “Only proteases that form covalent acyl-enzyme intermediates can be used as catalysts in kinetically controlled 1Kasche (2Kasche V. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1989: 125-143Google Scholar) makes a distinction betweenkinetic-controlled and equilibrium-controlledtranspeptidation. In the former, the transpeptidation product is a transient intermediate arising from a sacrificial peptide amid an unfavorable equilibrium; in the latter, the equilibrium favors peptide bond synthesis, because the concentration of water is lowered by the addition of organic solvents. peptide synthesis.” However, amid considerable controversy on how such an acyl-enzyme might form with aspartic proteases, various reports of transpeptidation yielding a product akin to N-P1 appeared, which led to an alternative proposal of an amino-enzyme intermediate,E-P1 (3Knowles J.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1970; 257: 135-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although no direct evidence was ever reported (4Fruton J.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 32: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Dunn M.B. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5241-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In opposition, James and Sielecki (6James M.N.G. Sielecki A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 163: 299-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) argued from x-ray crystallographic data that the formation of a covalent intermediate is not likely to occur. More convincingly, Antonov et al. (7Antonov V.K. Ginodman L.M. Rumsh L.D. Kapitannikov Y.V. Barshevskaya T.N. Yavashev L.P. Gurova A.G. Volkova L.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported the incorporation of 18O from water into the scissle carbonyl of P2-N transpeptidation products, which requires that P2 attain a free carboxyl at some intermediate stage. More recently, Hyland et al. (8Hyland L.J. Tomaszek Jr., T.A. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8454-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) invoked an enzyme-bound amide hydrate adduct to explain similar 18O exchange data with the human immunodeficiency virus aspartic protease. In addition, the relatively long incubation times 2Long incubation times result, in part, from the necessity of using very dilute pepsin to avoid autolysis. and low yields raised possibilities that the transpeptidation products of aspartic proteases may not be initial products but rather may arise from some secondary reaction or perhaps from a contaminating protease (6James M.N.G. Sielecki A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 163: 299-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, no alternative to a covalent mechanism was forthcoming, at least not until Rebholz and Northrop (9Rebholz K.L. Northrop D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 65-69Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) found that pepsin obeys an iso-mechanism in which the enzyme finishes the chemistry of proteolysis in a different form than it began, and the isomerization back to the starting form is kinetically significant. This finding offered new possibilities for the chemical mechanism of transpeptidation by aspartic proteases. In an attempt to link the two, efforts were made to induce transpeptidation by manipulation of reaction conditions known to perturb the iso-mechanism. Solvent isotope effects were successful and are described below. Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe-Nle3-Ala-Leu-OMe, Leu-Leu(-OH), Leu-Leu-NH2 and Boc-Leu-Leu were purchased from Bachem and D2O from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Porcine pepsin was purchased from Sigma and purified on a Bio-Scale Q2 column (7 × 52 mm) equilibrated with 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.0. A 0–1 m NaCl gradient was used with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The purified enzyme was found to be homogenous by electrophoresis. Separation of reactant and product peptides was accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC using a μ-Bondapack C-18 HPLC column (3.9 × 300 mm, particle size 10 μm, pore size 125 Å) obtained from Millipore and a Hitachi L-6200 chromatographic system. Transpeptidation reaction mixtures were run at 25 °C in 40 mm formate buffer pH or pD 4.0 and contained 1.15 nm pepsin, 1.2 mmLeu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe-Nle-Ala-Leu-OMe and 6.43 mmacceptor peptide, Leu-Leu. During the course of the reaction, aliquot parts were taken at time intervals up to 16 h and assayed by HPLC reverse-phase chromatography, monitored at either 214 or 254 nm, using a 0–70% acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were collected in the positive-ion mode using a VG Platform II mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, Manchester, UK) and a methanol mobile phase. Samples were dissolved in 98% formic acid and diluted methanol to 0.1 mm. The diluted sample was pumped into the mass spectrometer source (60 °C) at a flow rate of 0.01 ml/min. Progress curves of the formation of peptide products were fitted to the following equation describing a hysteretic burst or lag as described by Frieden (10Frieden C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 471-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) using a BASIC computer program employing the nonlinear regression routine of Duggleby (11Duggleby R.G. Comput. Biol. Med. 1984; 14: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar),P=i+vst+(vo−vs)(1−e−kt)k(Eq. 1) where P is the amount of product formed, iis the intercept (subtracted from the progress curves below),v o is the initial velocity at time zero,v s is the steady-state velocity, k is the rate constant controlling the hysteretic transition betweenv o and v s, and t is the elapsed time. Fig. 1 shows the HPLC optical absorption elution profiles, which document a transpeptidation reaction between Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe-Nle-Ala-Leu-OMe and Leu-Leu in the presence of porcine pepsin. Peak 3 could not be detected in the absence of either peptide. A similar peak was observed with Leu-Leu-NH2 as the accepting peptide, but not with Boc-Leu-Leu, which suggests a P2-N transpeptidation product. The product was more absorptive at 254 nm than at 214 nm, which is further suggestive of P2-N, because the P1 product, Nle-Ala-Leu-OMe identified as peak 5, is transparent at the higher wavelength. A transpeptidation product of P2-N in the form of Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe-Leu-Leu was confirmed by mass spectrometry of material from peak 3, giving a measured mass of 636.1 daltons (data not shown) as compared with a calculated value of 636. The increase in areas of peak 3 in profiles B–D of Fig. 1and other profiles not shown were converted to peptide concentration and are plotted as a function of time as shown in Fig. 2. A distinct lag is apparent in Fig. 2 A, the progress of the formation of the transpeptidation product that is even more pronounced in D2O, leading to a steady-state velocity that is more than twice as fast in D2O than in H2O and generating an inverse solvent isotope effect. Coincident with the lag is a burst in the progress of formation of the proteolytic products Nle-Ala-Leu-OMe and Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe shown in Fig. 2, B and C, respectively. These bursts are not seen in the absence of the accepting peptide or in the presence of Boc-Leu-Leu and are less pronounced in D2O. The progress curves in both Fig. 2 B and 2 C develop more slowly in D2O than in H2O, thus generating normal solvent isotope effects, but the effects are not the same for both products. The results of fitting the progress curves to Equation 1 are listed in Table I. Proteolysis of the substrate was severely inhibited as compared with the k cat of 133 s−1, presumably due to competitive inhibition from Leu-Leu. Fitted initial velocities from Fig. 2 A did not significantly differ from zero, so fittings were repeated withv o masked to enhance the precision of v s. The solvent isotope effects on initial velocities are the same for formation of Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe and Nle-Ala-Leu-OMe, but the effect on steady-state velocities is larger for the formation of Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe than for Nle-Ala-Leu-OMe by an amount that matches the inverse solvent isotope effect on the formation of the transpeptidation product(cf. 2.23 − 1.78 = 0.45 and 0.40). Moreover, the normal isotope effect on the steady-state formation of Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe (v H /v D = 2.23)matches the reciprocal of the inverse solvent isotope effect on the formation of the transpeptidation product(v D /v H = 1/0.4 = 2.5).Table IReaction velocities and solvent isotope effects of proteolysis and transpeptidationProduct formedReaction velocities (s−1)Solvent isotope effectsH2OD2Ov H/v Dk H/k DLeu-Ser-p-nitro-Phev o3.2 ± 0.70.97 ± 0.063.29 ± 0.71v s0.63 ± 0.040.28 ± 0.0022.23 ± 0.182.24 ± 0.76Nle-Ala-Leu-OMev o2.1 ± 0.40.64 ± 0.063.31 ± 0.59v s0.40 ± 0.020.23 ± 0.011.78 ± 0.111.78 ± 0.55Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe-Leu-Leuv o00v s0.014 ± 0.0010.036 ± 0.0070.40 ± 0.093.6 ± 1.8This new isotope effect is on the curvature of the plots in Fig. 2 (see Equation 1). Open table in a new tab This new isotope effect is on the curvature of the plots in Fig. 2 (see Equation 1). The lag in the transpeptidation reaction is consistent with a dissociation of Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe from pepsin followed by a dependence upon the accumulation of this proteolytic product in the reaction medium. In contrast, Kasche (2Kasche V. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1989: 125-143Google Scholar) describes the progress curves of transpeptidation by covalent acyl-enzyme intermediates as having a maximal rate at time 0 and progressively decreasing rates as products accumulate. The burst kinetics in the formation of proteolytic products similarly support a dissociative mechanism and are not consistent with any dependence upon an enzyme-bound product mechanism, covalent or otherwise. The correlation between lags and bursts shows a linkage between proteolysis and transpeptidation that effectively rules out participation of a contaminant enzyme or of a putative secondary reaction mechanism. The linkage between lags and bursts is dramatically evidenced in the numerical symmetry of the data in Table I. The inverse isotope effect on transpeptidation rules out the traditional interpretation (that is, effects originating in a substrate bond-breaking chemical step, which are normal) and instead requires that the effect originate from some change in equilibria. Equilibrium isotope effects, termed “fractionation factors” by Kresge (12Kresge A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 3065-3067Google Scholar), have a long history and are rarely this small. Moreover, the linkage to normal isotope effects with a reciprocal magnitude is inconsistent with the origins described by Kresge. Instead, the mix of solvent isotope effects in Table Iconstitutes a new type of isotope effect, with a kinetic origin but with similarities to fractionation factors; it arises from a change in the quasi-equilibrium distribution of intermediate enzyme forms associated with the steady-state phase of enzymatic catalysis. The diversion of the Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe away from proteolytic product accumulation and toward transpeptidation places the isotopically sensitive step “downstream” from the steps participating in transpeptidation. It was previously reported that solvent isotope effects were observed on V maxbut not on V max/K m (9Rebholz K.L. Northrop D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 65-69Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which only placed the isotopically sensitive step downstream from the first irreversible step, the release of the first product during initial velocity measurements. A reaction mechanism consistent with all solvent isotope effects is shown in Scheme II,E+P2­P1⇌E·P2­P1 →­P1,­P2 F⇌G →+H2O E‖→+N F·N →+P2 E·P2­N→E+P2­N SCHEME IIwhere E = (H2O)-pepsinCOO–COOH, F = pepsinCOOHCOO–, and G = pepsinCOO–COOH. The nomenclature is similar to that used in Scheme I, but Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe is considered the second product, P2, only by analogy. Because both products dissociate from the enzyme, the order of their dissociation is unknown and not designated. The dissociation of products is shown as being irreversible, because initially the concentration of products is zero. The starting form of enzyme,E, has water tightly bound at the active site and the two aspartic carboxyl groups are in the proper protonation state for catalysis. The product form of enzyme, F, is dehydrated, and the carboxyls are in the reverse state of protonation, having acted as a general acid and a general base during catalysis. ConvertingF to G, with the proper protonation, is the isotopically sensitive step. The final step in proteolysis is re-hydration of the re-protonated enzyme, shown here as being irreversible, because in 55 m H2O, the equilibrium would be very far to the right. F can bind the accepting peptide, N, and after sufficient product has accumulated,F·N can bind P2. Further support for this mechanism can be found in the solvent isotope effects associated with the onset of inhibition of pepsin by pepstatin (13Cho Y.-K. Rebholz K.L. Northrop D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which also placed the isotopically sensitive step after the release of both products but before rehydration, with rapid binding of pepstatin to the Gform of enzyme. In the new isotope effect, the analogy to the fractionation factor is actually a D2O-dependent diversion of F away from the upper rehydration pathway back to E, toward the lower transpeptidation pathway. 4By this analogy, the inverse isotope effect on transpeptidation might be termed a “diversion factor.” Although new to isotope effects, these reaction kinetics themselves have been described before in the form of the induced transport kinetics described by Britton (16Britton H.G. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and used to unequivocally establish iso-mechanisms. During induced transport, an F form of enzyme reacts with an isotopically labeled acceptor that is chemically identical with one product. For example, in the presence of an excess of H12CO3−, bovine carbonic anhydrase type II reacts with 13CO2and catalyzes the synthesis of H13CO3− (17Northrop D.B. Simpson F.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Curiously, pepsin and carbonic anhydrase have similar isomerization segments in that both involve an intramolecular proton transfer step that is isotopically sensitive plus a step involving the binding of a molecule of water. The chemical mechanism for pepsin is postulated to involve general acid catalysis by the carboxyl group of Asp-215, and general base catalysis by the carboxyl group of Asp-32 (5Dunn M.B. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5241-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which leaves the active site groups in the reverse state of protonation. Reprotonation of the carboxyls in a partially rate-limiting isomerization step of free enzyme is reminiscent of the iso-mechanism of proline racemase (14Fisher L.M. Albery J.W. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in which two thiols in opposite states of protonation act as a general acid and general base. The racemization of proline, however, has an equilibrium constant of one and the reaction runs freely in both directions. For pepsin, the reverse reaction (transpeptidation) must be initiated before the drop in free energy associated with the overall proteolysis is expressed. Hence, the origin of the free energy needed to synthesize a peptide bond between free peptides is the tightness of the binding of a water molecule in the active site. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the energy level of enzyme formF and enzyme with a reactant containing an intact peptide bond, such as ES, must be fairly equivalent, but the energy levels of the hydrated and dehydrated forms of free enzyme,E and G, respectively, must differ, with the hydrated E form lying much lower than G in 55m H2O. It follows, that a similar negative free energy must be associated with the enzymatic removal of a water molecule from between neighboring carboxyl and amino groups in the formation of a peptide bond as an alternative pathway for hydrating theF form of enzyme and converting it back to E (see Equation 2).R­COOH·F·H2N­R⇌H2O·E+R­CO­NH­R(Eq. 2) For this mechanism to account for the kinetics and solvent isotope effects of transpeptidation, it must be further postulated that the conversion of F to G be accompanied by a conformational change, which allows water to enter the active site. Hydration of the product form of enzyme, F, must await reprotonation, which is slower in D2O and which in turn raises the steady-state concentration of F. The increase in [F] drives the increase in the rate of transpeptidation in D2O. This change in [F] is the origin of the inverse solvent isotope effect and why it is analogous to an equilibrium isotope effect. Pepsin-catalyzed transpeptidation is extremely sensitive to pH and other reactant conditions. For example, although peptide bond cleavage of slow substrates has a maximum rate at pH 3.5 (15Hunkapiller M.W. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2829-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and therefore one might expect that the isomerization of free enzyme would be most rate-limiting, the transpeptidation described below could barely be detected at this pH. Equally confusing, at pH 5, where the chemical step is not at all favorable and therefore significantly rate-limiting, the original solvent isotope effect suggesting an iso-mechanism was first measured; nevertheless, transpeptidation was elusive and difficult to repeat at pH 5. But at pH 4, enzyme plus Leu-Ser-p-nitro-Phe-Nle-Ala-Leu-OMe and Leu-Leu consistently generate a large and reproducible peak on HPLC analysis, evidenced by the precision of the progress curves of Fig. 2. The sketchy and uncertain history of transpeptidation by aspartic proteases can now be appreciated with a more sympathetic understanding, especially for studies employing slow substrates, which we can now see as being very poor catalysts for transpeptidation because of the very low levels of F that would be present when the chemical segment is slow and rate-limiting. These reaction conditions may be exploited to develop practical methods of synthesizing specific peptide bonds. Kasche (2Kasche V. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1989: 125-143Google Scholar) noted the necessity for operating at a pH between the pK values of the carboxyl and amino groups to be joined together, that in many cases this occurs at acidic values of pH where many enzymes are unstable, and that “until better enzymes are found, this equilibrium-controlled synthesis is of no practical interest.” Pepsin is a “better enzyme” with both stability and catalytic activity at acidic pH, plus a kinetic mechanism ideally suited to joinfree carboxyl and amino groups in peptide bonds provided one drives the peptide synthesis kinetically with a sacrificial peptide that is a fast enough substrate to ensure that most of the pepsin is in the F form."
