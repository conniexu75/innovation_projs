https://openalex.org/W2790058132,"Grapevine is a very important crop species that is mainly cultivated worldwide for fruits, wine and juice. Identification of the genetic bases of performance traits through association mapping studies requires a precise knowledge of the available diversity and how this diversity is structured and varies across the whole genome. An 18k SNP genotyping array was evaluated on a panel of Vitis vinifera cultivars and we obtained a data set with no missing values for a total of 10207 SNPs and 783 different genotypes. The average inter-SNP spacing was ~47 kbp, the mean minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0.23 and the genetic diversity in the sample was high (He = 0.32). Fourteen SNPs, chosen from those with the highest MAF values, were sufficient to identify each genotype in the sample. Parentage analysis revealed 118 full parentages and 490 parent-offspring duos, thus confirming the close pedigree relationships within the cultivated grapevine. Structure analyses also confirmed the main divisions due to an eastern-western gradient and human usage (table vs. wine). Using a multivariate approach, we refined the structure and identified a total of eight clusters. Both the genetic diversity (He, 0.26–0.32) and linkage disequilibrium (LD, 28.8–58.2 kbp) varied between clusters. Despite the short span LD, we also identified some non-recombining haplotype blocks that may complicate association mapping. Finally, we performed a genome-wide association study that confirmed previous works and also identified new regions for important performance traits such as acidity. Taken together, all the results contribute to a better knowledge of the genetics of the cultivated grapevine."

The objective of our study was to determine whether retinal GCIPL (ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer) or nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness may serve as noninvasive biomarkers to diagnose AD. This cross-sectional case-control study enrolled 15 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 15 mild-moderate AD patients, and 18 cognitively normal adults. NFL and GCIPL thicknesses on optical coherence tomography (OCT) were measured using Duke Optical Coherence Tomography Retinal Analysis Program (DOCTRAP) and Spectralis software. We demonstrated that regional thicknesses of NFL or GCIPL on macular or nerve OCTs did not differ between groups. However, a multi-variate regression analysis identified macular areas with a significant thickening or thinning in NFL and GCIPL in MCI and AD patients. Our primary findings controvert previous reports of thinner NFL in moderate-to-severe AD. The areas of thickening of GCIPL and NFL in the macula adjacent to areas of thinning, as revealed by a more complex statistical model, suggest that NFL and GCIPL may undergo dynamic changes during AD progression."
https://openalex.org/W2788992701,"Background The association between socioeconomic status (SES) and smoking behaviors may differ across countries. This study aimed to estimate the association between socioeconomic status (income, occupation and education) and multiple measures of smoking behaviors among the Chinese elderly population. Methods Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in 2013, we examined the relationship between socioeconomic status and smoking behaviors through multivariate regression analysis. Sample selection models were applied to correct for sample selection bias. Smoking behaviors were measured by four indicators: smoking status, cigarette consumption, health risks related to smoking, and smoking dependence. Analyses were stratified by gender and urban-rural residence. Results Among Chinese people aged 45 years or older, smokers accounted for 40% of the population in 2013, smoking 19 cigarettes per day. It was also found that 79% of smokers were at an increased health risk. Overall, although the influence of income on smoking behaviors was small and even insignificant, occupation and education levels were significantly associated with smoking behaviors. Managers or professionals were more likely to smoke, however there was no significant relationship with smoking dependence. Individuals with higher educational attainment were less likely to be associated with smoking behaviors. In addition, gender and urban-rural differences existed in the relationship between SES and smoking behaviors. Conclusions Smoking disparities among diverse levels of socioeconomic status existed but varied greatly by SES indicators and population characteristics. Tobacco control policies in China should be increasingly focused on populations with low socioeconomic status in order to break the link between socioeconomic disadvantage and smoking behaviors. Further actions should mitigate inequalities in education, improve the social culture of cigarette use, and tailor interventions based on characteristics of the population."
https://openalex.org/W2790643784,"Dental caries is a biofilm-dependent oral disease and Streptococcus mutans is the known primary etiologic agent of dental caries that initiates biofilm formation on tooth surfaces. Although some Lactobacillus strains inhibit biofilm formation of oral pathogenic bacteria, the molecular mechanisms by which lactobacilli inhibit bacterial biofilm formation are not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that Lactobacillus plantarum lipoteichoic acid (Lp.LTA) inhibited the biofilm formation of S. mutans on polystyrene plates, hydroxyapatite discs, and dentin slices without affecting the bacterial growth. Lp.LTA interferes with sucrose decomposition of S. mutans required for the production of exopolysaccharide, which is a main component of biofilm. Lp.LTA also attenuated the biding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran to S. mutans, which is known to have a high affinity to exopolysaccharide on S. mutans. Dealanylated Lp.LTA did not inhibit biofilm formation of S. mutans implying that D-alanine moieties in the Lp.LTA structure were crucial for inhibition. Collectively, these results suggest that Lp.LTA attenuates S. mutans biofilm formation and could be used to develop effective anticaries agents."
https://openalex.org/W2793072587,"Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental endocrine-disrupting compound, has drawn a great attention for its adverse effect on behavioral development. Maternal exposure to this compound has been reported to induce anxiety and depression in offspring, but the effect of its paternal exposure is rarely discussed. This study investigated whether preconception paternal BPA exposure can affect the emotions of male rats and their offspring. Eighteen adult male rats (F0) received either a vehicle or 50 μg/kg/day BPA diet for 21 weeks and were then mated with non-exposed females to produce offspring (F1). The affective behaviors of F0 and F1 rats were evaluated in the open-field test, the elevated-plus maze and the forced swimming test, and their serum corticosterone were then examined. BPA exposure induced increased anxiety behaviors along with increased serum corticosterone in F0 rats. This paternal exposure also led to increased anxiety behaviors in F1 females and aggravated depression behaviors in both sexes of F1 rats. Furthermore, only F1 females exhibited increased serum corticosterone. Overall, these data indicate that preconception paternal exposure to a low dose of BPA may induce transgenerational sex-specific impairments in the affection of adult rats."
https://openalex.org/W2791215514,"Background Patient reports of their adherence behaviors, concerns about statins, and perceptions of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk could inform approaches for improving adherence to statin therapy. We examined these factors and their associations with adherence. Methods We conducted telephone interviews among a stratified random sample of adults receiving statins within an integrated delivery system (N = 730, 81% response rate) in 2010. We sampled equal numbers of individuals in three clinical risk categories: those with 1) coronary artery disease; 2) diabetes or other ASCVD diagnosis; and 3) no diabetes or ASCVD diagnoses. We assessed 15 potential concerns about and barriers to taking statins, and perceived risk of having a heart attack in the next 10 years (0–10 scale). We calculated the proportion of days covered (PDC) by statins in the last 12 months using dispensing data and used multivariate logistic regression to examine the characteristics associated with non-adherence (PDC<80%). Analyses were weighted for sampling proportions. Results Sixty-one percent of patients with PDC<50% reported not filling a new prescription, splitting or skipping statins, or stopping refilling statins in the last 12 months vs. 15% of those with PDC≥80% (p<0.05). The most commonly reported concerns about statins were preferring to lower cholesterol with lifestyle changes (66%), disliking medications in general (59%), and liver or kidney problems (31%); having trouble remembering to take statins (9%) was the most common reason for taking less than prescribed. In multivariate analyses, clinical risk categories were not significantly associated with odds of non-adherence; however, those with higher perceived risk of heart attack were less likely to be non-adherent. Conclusions Patient-reported medication-taking behaviors were correlated with statin PDC and those with lower perceived cardiovascular risk were less likely to be adherent. These findings highlight the importance of eliciting from and educating patients on their adherence behaviors and ASCVD risks."
https://openalex.org/W2791801614,"In Ethiopia, more than 62% of pregnant women attend antenatal care at least once, yet only about one in four women give birth at health facility. This gap has fueled the need to investigate on the quality of ANC services at public health facilities and its link with the use of institutional delivery.To assess the linkage between ANC quality and the use of institutional delivery among pregnant women attending ANC at public health facilities of BDR City Administration.A facility based prospective follow up study was conducted. and nine hundred seventy pregnant women with gestational age ≤ 16 weeks who came for their first ANC visit were enrolled.Women were followed from their first ANC visit until delivery. Longitudinal data was collected during consultation with ANC providers using structured observation checklist. ANC service was considered as acceptable quality if women received ≥75th percentile of the essential ANC services. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) was carried out to control cluster effect among women who received ANC in the same facility.Among 823 pregnant women who completed follow up, only about one third (27.6%) received acceptable quality of ANC services. In one health facility syphilis test was not done at all for the last two years. The odds of giving birth at health institution among pregnant women who received acceptable ANC quality service was about 3.38 times higher than among pregnant women who received unacceptable ANC quality service (AOR = 3.38, 95% CI: 1.67, 6.83).In this study the quality of ANC service provision in public health facilities was compromised/low. Provision of quality ANC service had a great role in promoting institutional delivery. Therefore the local authorities at each level of health sector or the nongovernmental organizations working to improve maternal health need to provide training on focused antenatal care protocol for ANC providers."
https://openalex.org/W2790441480,"Globally, epilepsy is a common serious brain disorder. In addition to seizure activity, epilepsy is associated with cognitive impairments including static cognitive impairments present at onset, progressive seizure-induced impairments and co-morbid dementia. Epilepsy occurs naturally in domestic dogs but its impact on canine cognition has yet to be studied, despite canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) recognised as a spontaneous model of dementia. Here we use data from a psychometrically validated tool, the canine cognitive dysfunction rating (CCDR) scale, to compare cognitive dysfunction in dogs diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy (IE) with controls while accounting for age. An online cross-sectional study resulted in a sample of 4051 dogs, of which n = 286 had been diagnosed with IE. Four factors were significantly associated with a diagnosis of CCD (above the diagnostic cut-off of CCDR ≥50): (i) epilepsy diagnosis: dogs with epilepsy were at higher risk; (ii) age: older dogs were at higher risk; (iii) weight: lighter dogs (kg) were at higher risk; (iv) training history: dogs with more exposure to training activities were at lower risk. Impairments in memory were most common in dogs with IE, but progression of impairments was not observed compared to controls. A significant interaction between epilepsy and age was identified, with IE dogs exhibiting a higher risk of CCD at a young age, while control dogs followed the expected pattern of low-risk throughout middle age, with risk increasing exponentially in geriatric years. Within the IE sub-population, dogs with a history of cluster seizures and high seizure frequency had higher CCDR scores. The age of onset, nature and progression of cognitive impairment in the current IE dogs appear divergent from those classically seen in CCD. Longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function from seizure onset is required to further characterise these impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2792056797,"Oncolytic virus (OV) is a replication competent virus that selectively invades cancer cells; as these cells die under the viral burden, the released virus particles proceed to infect other cancer cells. Oncolytic viruses are designed to also be able to stimulate the anticancer immune response. Thus, one may represent an OV by two parameters: its replication potential and its immunogenicity. In this paper we consider a combination therapy with OV and a checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD-1. We evaluate the efficacy of the combination therapy in terms of the tumor volume at some later time, for example, 6 months from initial treatment. Since T cells kill not only virus-free cancer cells but also virus-infected cancer cells, the following question arises: Does increasing the amount of the checkpoint inhibitor always improve the efficacy? We address this question, by a mathematical model consisting of a system of partial differential equations. We use the model to construct, by simulations, an efficacy map in terms of the doses of the checkpoint inhibitor and the OV injection. We show that there are regions in the map where an increase in the checkpoint inhibitor actually decreases the efficacy of the treatment. We also construct efficacy maps with checkpoint inhibitor vs. the replication potential of the virus that show the same antagonism, namely, an increase in the checkpoint inhibitor may actually decrease the efficacy. These results have implications for clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2763586138,"Although the WHO-developed Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool is a comprehensive and widely applied survey of health facility preparedness, SARA data have not previously been used to model predictors of readiness. We sought to demonstrate that SARA data can be used to model availability of essential medicines for treating non-communicable diseases (EM-NCD).We fit a Poisson regression model using 2013 SARA data from 196 Ugandan health facilities. The outcome was total number of different EM-NCD available. Basic amenities, equipment, region, health facility type, managing authority, NCD diagnostic capacity, and range of HIV services were tested as predictor variables.In multivariate models, we found significant associations between EM-NCD availability and region, managing authority, facility type, and range of HIV services. For-profit facilities' EM-NCD counts were 98% higher than public facilities (p < .001). General hospitals and referral health centers had 98% (p = .004) and 105% (p = .002) higher counts compared to primary health centers. Facilities in the North and East had significantly lower counts than those in the capital region (p = 0.015; p = 0.003). Offering HIV care was associated with 35% lower EM-NCD counts (p = 0.006). Offering HIV counseling and testing was associated with 57% higher counts (p = 0.048).We identified multiple within-country disparities in availability of EM-NCD in Uganda. Our findings can be used to identify gaps and guide distribution of limited resources. While the primary purpose of SARA is to assess and monitor health services readiness, we show that it can also be an important resource for answering complex research and policy questions requiring multivariate analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2787552463,"To subgroup chronic pain patients using psychometric data and regress the variables most responsible for subgroup discrimination.Cross-sectional, registry-based study.Chronic pain patients assessed at a multidisciplinary pain centre between 2008 and 2015.Data from the Swedish quality registry for pain rehabilitation (SQRP) were retrieved and analysed by principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, and partial least squares-discriminant analysis.Four subgroups were identified. Group 1 was characterized by low ""psychological strain"", the best relative situation concerning pain characteristics (intensity and spreading), the lowest frequency of fibromyalgia, as well as by a slightly older age. Group 2 was characterized by high ""psychological strain"" and by the most negative situation with respect to pain characteristics (intensity and spreading). Group 3 was characterized by high ""social distress"", the longest pain durations, and a statistically higher frequency of females. The frequency of three neuropathic pain conditions was generally lower in this group. Group 4 was characterized by high psychological strain, low ""social distress"", and high pain intensity.The identification of these four clusters of chronic pain patients could be useful for the development of personalized rehabilitation programs. For example, the identification of a subgroup characterized mainly by high perceived ""social distress"" raises the question of how to best design interventions for such patients. Differentiating between clinically important subgroups and comparing how these subgroups respond to interventions is arguably an important area for further research."
https://openalex.org/W2786348586,"The Mara River Basin in East Africa is a trans-boundary basin of international significance experiencing excessive levels of sediment loads. Sediment levels in this river are extremely high (turbidities as high as 6,000 NTU) and appear to be increasing over time. Large wildlife populations, unregulated livestock grazing, and agricultural land conversion are all potential factors increasing sediment loads in the semi-arid portion of the basin. The basin is well-known for its annual wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) migration of approximately 1.3 million individuals, but it also has a growing population of hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibius), which reside within the river and may contribute to the flux of suspended sediments. We used in situ pressure transducers and turbidity sensors to quantify the sediment flux at two sites for the Mara River and investigate the origin of riverine suspended sediment. We found that the combined Middle Mara-Talek catchment, a relatively flat but semi-arid region with large populations of wildlife and domestic cattle, is responsible for 2/3 of the sediment flux. The sediment yield from the combined Middle Mara-Talek catchment is approximately the same as the headwaters, despite receiving less rainfall. There was high monthly variability in suspended sediment fluxes. Although hippopotamus pools are not a major source of suspended sediments under baseflow, they do contribute to short-term variability in suspended sediments. This research identified sources of suspended sediments in the Mara River and important regions of the catchment to target for conservation, and suggests hippopotami may influence riverine sediment dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2789547307,"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been confirmed to act as a key regulatory molecule in different types of cancers and play a significant role in tumors initiation and progression. LncRNA can be as acompeting endogenous RNA(ceRNA) to regulate the expression of targeted genes by sponging miRNA. In the present study, we explore the functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs as ceRNAs in colon cancer and their potential implications for prognosis.The lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs expression profiles of 341 colon cancer tissues and 27 non-tumor colon tissues were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Differential expression of RNAs was identified using the “DESeq” bioconductor package in R. PPI network of differentially expressed genes was constructed using the STRING database. Survival analysis was estimated based on Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. We used KOBAS 3.0 to analyze the KEGG pathway of DEGs. The dysregulated lncRNA-associated ceRNA network was constructed in colon cancer based on bioinformatics generated from miRanda, PicTar, TargetScan, miRDB and miRcode. A total of 791 DElncRNAs and 200 DEmiRNAs were identified in colon cancer compared with matched normal tissues with thresholds of |log2foldChange (FC)| >3.0and adjusted P value<0.05.Twenty DElncRNAs were identified, may be related to tumorigenesis and/or progression of colon cancer. Nine out of 20 dysregulated lncRNA were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (P value<0.05). Finally, we successfully constructed colon cancer-associated ceRNA network, including 9 colon cancer-specific lncRNAs, 13 miRNAS and 70 mRNAs. In conclusion, our study will contribute to improve the understanding of ceRNA network regulatory mechanisms in colon cancer. These identified novel lncRNAs can be as candidate prognostic biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2788580917,"Background Sexuality is a physiological component of adolescent development, though early initiation is associated with reproductive health risk. This study aimed at identifying correlates and predictors of sexual initiation in a large multinational cohort of European adolescents. Methods A questionnaire addressing socio-demographics, behaviours, mental health and sexual activity, was delivered to 11,110 adolescents recruited from 168 randomly selected schools in 10 European countries between 2009 and 2011. A follow-up questionnaire was delivered after 12 months. The longitudinal association of baseline risk behaviors, psychological attributes and contextual vulnerabilities, with sexual initiation during follow-up was evaluated through simple and multivariable age/sex stratified logistic regression. Multinomial logistic regression measured the association between predictors and sexual initiation with or without coexisting reproductive risk factors, such as multiple partners or infrequent condom use. Results Baseline sexual experience was reported by 19.2% of 10,757 respondents (median age 15; IQR 14–15; females 59.6%). This was significantly more frequent among pupils older than 15 (41%) and males (20.8%). Of 7,111 pupils without previous experience who were available at follow-up (response rate 81.8%), 17% reported sexual initiation, without differences between females and males. Baseline smoking (age/sex adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.63), alcohol use (aOR 2.95), illegal drugs use (aOR 2.72), and poor sleep (aOR 1.71) predicted sexual initiation. Stratified analyses showed a particularly strong association in case of younger and female pupils, and, among girls, when initiation was reported together with multiple partners and/or infrequent condom use. Externalizing (i.e. conduct and hyperactivity) symptoms independently predicted sexual initiation. Internalizing difficulties (i.e. emotional and peer problems) were negatively associated with early and risky sexual initiation among boys. Significant predictors included also being bullied, fighting, truancy, and low parental involvement. Conclusions Adolescent sexual behaviours are related to non-sexual risk behaviours, psychological difficulties and contextual vulnerabilities. While gateway effects explain some associations, a comprehensive model is needed to understand adolescent sexual behaviours, their physical, mental, and social health outcomes, and their potential positive effects on wellbeing. Tailored interventions may need to consider younger girls as a particularly vulnerable group in view of a strong association between non-sexual and sexual behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2793850881,"The most common complication of silicone breast implants is capsular contracture (massive scar formation around the implant). We postulate that capsular contracture is always a sequel to inflammatory processes, with both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms participating. In general, fibroblasts and macrophages have been used as cell types to evaluate in vitro the biocompatibility of breast implant surfaces. Moreover, also T cells have been found at the implant site at the initial stage of fibrous capsule formation. However, only few studies have addressed the influence of surfaces with different textures on T-cell responses. The aim of the present study was to investigate the immune response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to commercially available silicone breast implants in vitro. PBMC from healthy female blood donors were cultured on each silicone surface for 4 days. Proliferation and phenotype of cultured cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Cytokine levels were determined by multiplex and real-time assay. We found that silicone surfaces do not induce T-cell proliferation, nor do they extensively alter the proportion of T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, naïve, effector memory). Interestingly, cytokine profiling identified matrix specific differences, especially for IL-6 and TNF-α on certain surface topographies that could lead to increased fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2789736158,"Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is differentially associated with cell proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly. We show here the effect of exogenous SPARC inhibition/induction on ECM and mitochondrial proteins expression and on the differentiation of C2C12 cells. The cells were cultured in growth medium (GM) supplemented with different experimental conditions. The differentiation of myoblasts was studied for 5 days, the expressions of ECM and mitochondrial proteins were measured and the formation of the myotubes was quantified after exogenous induction/inhibition of SPARC. The results indicate that the addition of recombinant SPARC protein (rSPARC) in cell culture medium increased the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and myogenin expression during the myotube formation. However, the treatment with antibody specific for SPARC (anti-SPARC) prevented the differentiation and decreased myogenin expression. The induction of SPARC in the proliferating and differentiating C2C12 cells increased collagen 1a1 protein expression, whereas the inhibition decreased it. The effects on fibronectin protein expression were opposite. Furthermore, the addition of rSPARC in C2C12 myoblast increased the expression of mitochondrial proteins, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein II (UQCRC2) and succinate dehydrogenase iron-sulfur subunit (SDHB), whereas the anti-SPARC decreased them. During the differentiation, only the anti-SPARC had the effects on mitochondrial proteins, NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone 1 beta subcomplex subunit 8 (NADHB8), SDHB and cytochrome c oxidase 1 (MTCO1). Thus, SPARC plays a crucial role in the proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 and may be involved in the link between the ECM remodeling and mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W2790385118,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of metabolic syndrome (MetS) induced by high-carbohydrate high-fat (HCHF) diet on bone mineral density (BMD), histomorphometry and remodelling markers in male rats. Twelve male Wistar rats aged 12 weeks old were randomized into two groups. The normal group was given standard rat chow while the HCHF group was given HCHF diet to induce MetS. Abdominal circumference, blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid profile were measured for the confirmation of MetS. Bone mineral density, histomorphometry and remodelling markers were evaluated for the confirmation of bone loss. The HCHF diet caused central obesity, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia in male rats. No significant difference was observed in whole body bone mineral content and BMD between the normal and HCHF rats (p>0.05). For bone histomorphometric parameters, HCHF diet-fed animals had significantly lower osteoblast surface, osteoid surface, osteoid volume, and significantly higher eroded surface; resulting in a reduction in trabecular bone volume (p<0.05). Feeding on HCHF diet caused a significantly higher CTX-1 level (p<0.05), but did not cause any significant change in osteocalcin level compared to normal rats (p>0.05). In conclusion, HCHF diet-induced MetS causes imbalance in bone remodelling, leading to the deterioration of trabecular bone structure."
https://openalex.org/W2790679608,"Climate changes, including chronic changes in precipitation amounts, will influence plant physiology and growth. However, such precipitation effects on switchgrass, a major bioenergy crop, have not been well investigated. We conducted a two-year precipitation simulation experiment using large pots (95 L) in an environmentally controlled greenhouse in Nashville, TN. Five precipitation treatments (ambient precipitation, and -50%, -33%, +33%, and +50% of ambient) were applied in a randomized complete block design with lowland ""Alamo"" switchgrass plants one year after they were established from tillers. The growing season progression of leaf physiology, tiller number, height, and aboveground biomass were determined each growing season. Precipitation treatments significantly affected leaf physiology, growth, and aboveground biomass. The photosynthetic rates in the wet (+50% and +33%) treatments were significantly enhanced by 15.9% and 8.1%, respectively, than the ambient treatment. Both leaf biomass and plant height were largely increased, resulting in dramatically increases in aboveground biomass by 56.5% and 49.6% in the +50% and +33% treatments, respectively. Compared to the ambient treatment, the drought (-33% and -50%) treatments did not influence leaf physiology, but the -50% treatment significantly reduced leaf biomass by 37.8%, plant height by 16.3%, and aboveground biomass by 38.9%. This study demonstrated that while switchgrass in general is a drought tolerant grass, severe drought significantly reduces Alamo’s growth and biomass, and that high precipitation stimulates its photosynthesis and growth."
https://openalex.org/W2791309585,"The use of in vitro membrane vesicles is attractive because of possible applications in therapies. Here we aimed to compare the stability and functionality of plasma membrane vesicles extracted from control and salt-treated broccoli. The impact of the amount of aquaporins was related to plasma membrane osmotic water permeability and the stability of protein secondary structure. Here, we describe for first time an increase in plant aquaporins acetylation under high salinity. Higher osmotic water permeability in NaCl vesicles has been related to higher acetylation, upregulation of aquaporins, and a more stable environment to thermal denaturation. Based on our findings, we propose that aquaporins play an important role in vesicle stability."
https://openalex.org/W2791471142,"Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising cells for cardiovascular regenerative medicine. However, their potential may be limited, because of their restricted cardiovascular differentiation potential and decline in their number and functional characteristics with increasing donor age. We have previously shown that rat fetus heart harbors primitive MSCs and administration of these cells improved left ventricular (LV) function after ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. To evaluate their potential as a new cell type for clinical cardiovascular cell therapy, we have undertaken this study on the isolation and characterization of human fetal cardiac MSCs (hfC-MSCs). Methods MSCs were isolated from the heart of five 14-16-week-old aborted human fetuses and studied for their growth characteristics, karyotypic stability and senescence over successive passages, expression of mesenchymal and embryonal markers by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry, constitutive expression of cardiovascular genes by RT-PCR, differentiation into cells of the cardiovascular lineage and their immunomodulatory properties. Results The hfC-MSCs grew as adherent monolayer with spindle shaped morphology and exhibited rapid proliferation with an average population doubling time of 34 hours and expansion to up to more than 80 population doublings with maintenance of a normal karyotype and without senescence. Immunophenotyping showed that they had similar phenotype as human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) expressing CD73, CD90, CD105 and lacking expression of CD31, CD34, CD45, HLA-DR. However, hfC-MSCs expressed significantly higher levels of CD117 and SSEA-4 compared to hBM-MSCs. In addition, hfC-MSCs expressed the embryonal markers Oct-4, Nanog and Sox-2 as compared to hBM-MSCs. Further, hfC-MSCs had significantly higher expression of the cardiovascular genes viz. ISL-1, flk-1, GATA-4, NKX2.5 and MDR-1 as compared to hBM-MSCs, and could be differentiated into major cardiovascular cells (cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells). Interestingly, hfC-MSCs markedly reduced T-lymphocyte proliferation with an increased secretion of TGF-β and IL-10. Conclusions Our results show that human fetus heart is a novel source of primitive MSCs with cardiovascular commitment which may have a potential therapeutic application in cardiovascular regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2787311534,"Global change has been acknowledged as one of the main threats to the biosphere and its provision of ecosystem services, especially in marine ecosystems. Seagrasses play a critical ecological role in coastal ecosystems, but their responses to ocean acidification (OA) and climate change are not well understood. There have been previous studies focused on the effects of OA, but the outcome of interactions with co-factors predicted to alter during climate change still needs to be addressed. For example, the impact of higher CO2 and different hydrodynamic regimes on seagrass performance remains unknown. We studied the effects of OA under different current velocities on productivity of the seagrass Zostera noltei, using changes in dissolved oxygen as a proxy for the seagrass carbon metabolism, and release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in a four-week experiment using an open-water outdoor mesocosm. Under current pH conditions, increasing current velocity had a positive effect on productivity, but this depended on shoot density. However, this positive effect of current velocity disappeared under OA conditions. OA conditions led to a significant increase in gross production rate and respiration, suggesting that Z. noltei is carbon-limited under the current inorganic carbon concentration of seawater. In addition, an increase in non-structural carbohydrates was found, which may lead to better growing conditions and higher resilience in seagrasses subjected to environmental stress. Regarding DOC flux, a direct and positive relationship was found between current velocity and DOC release, both under current pH and OA conditions. We conclude that OA and high current velocity may lead to favourable growth scenarios for Z. noltei populations, increasing their productivity, non-structural carbohydrate concentrations and DOC release. Our results add new dimensions to predictions on how seagrass ecosystems will respond to climate change, with important implications for the resilience and conservation of these threatened ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2792406478,"It has been known that EGF-like factor secreted from LH-stimulated granuloma cells acts on granulosa cells and cumulus cells to induce ovulation process. Granulosa cells are changed the morphology with differentiating cell functions to produce progesterone. Cumulus cells are detached to make a space between the cells to accumulate hyaluronan rich matrix. LH also changes extracellular matrix (ECM) components including fibronectin in the follicular walls and granulosa cell layers. EGF like factor and fibronectin synergistically play important roles in numerous cell functions, especially cancer cell migration, estimating that fibronectin would impact on granulosa cells and cumulus cells. To clear this hypothesis, the localizations of fibronectin and its receptor integrin were observed by immunofluorescence technique. The functions were monitored by the detection of downstream signaling pathway, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The pharmacological approach in both in vivo and in vitro were used for analyzing the physiological roles of FAK during ovulation process. The immunofluorescence staining revealed that fibronectin and integrin were observed in granulosa cells, cumulus cells and the space between cumulus cells and oocyte at 4 and 8 h after hCG injection. Concomitantly with the changes of fibronectin-integrin localization, FAK was phosphorylated in periovulatory follicles. The injection of FAK inhibitor suppressed not only ovulation but also luteinization of granulosa cells and cumulus expansion. In cultured-granulosa cells, fibronectin-integrin synergistically activated FAK with amphiregulin (AREG). Such cooperative stimulations induced a morphological change in granulosa cells, which resulted in the maximum level of progesterone production via the induction of Hsd3b. When cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured with AREG in the presence of serum, the maximum level of cumulus expansion was observed. The AREG-induced cumulus expansion was also suppressed by FAK inhibitor. Thus, it is concluded that fibronectin and AREG synergistically activate FAK not only in granulosa cells and cumulus cells to induce successful ovulation process."
https://openalex.org/W2789314411,"Background Over 75% of patients in the HIV cohort in French Guiana are of foreign origin. Our objective was to estimate what proportion of the migrant population of HIV-infected patients in Cayenne had been infected in French Guiana. Methods We included patients of known foreign origin who were followed in Cayenne, for whom the year of arrival in French Guiana was known and the initial CD4 count at the time of diagnosis was available. The time between seroconversion and time at diagnosis was estimated using the formula [square root (CD4 at seroconversion)-square root(CD4 at HIV diagnosis)] / slope of CD4 decline.CD4 counts at the time of infection and the slope were computed in an age and ethnicity-dependent variable. Results The median estimated time between infection and diagnosis was 4.5 years (IQR = 0.2–9.2). Overall, using a median estimate of CD4 count at the time of infection, it was estimated that 53.2% (95% CI = 48.3–58%) of HIV infected foreign patients had acquired HIV after having arrived in French Guiana. Patients having arrived in French Guiana before and during the 1990s and those receiving their HIV diagnosis before 2010 were more likely to have been infected in French Guiana. Conclusions Contrary to widespread belief suggesting that most migrants are already HIV-infected when they arrive in French Guiana, a large proportion of foreign HIV patients seem acquire the virus in French Guiana.There is still much to do in terms of primary prevention and testing among migrants."

TFE techniques with forceps debridement, balloon dilatation and laser ablation were used to implant stents, perform regular surveillance, maintain their functions, and expand the diameters of BEMS. Short-length (30cm-36cm) endoscopes of OD 3.2mm to 5.0mm coupled with the noninvasive ventilation, without ventilation bag, mask or airway tube, supported the whole procedures.146 BEMS were implanted in 87 consecutive children, including 84 tracheal, 15 carinal and 47 bronchial stents. At the time of placement, the mean age was 35.6 ± 54.6 month-old (range 0.3-228) and the mean body weight was 13.9 ± 10.6 kg (range 2.2-60). Surveillance period was 9.4 ± 6.7 years (range, 0.3-18.0). Satisfactory clinical improvements were noted immediately in all but two patients. Seventy-two (82.8%) patients were still alive with stable respiratory status, except two patients necessitating TFE management every two months. Fifty-one stents, including 35 tracheal and 16 bronchial ones, were successfully retrieved mainly with rigid endoscopy. Implanted stents could be significantly (< .001) further expanded for growing TB lumens. The final stent diameters were positively correlated to the implanted duration. Altogether, 33 stents expired (15 patients), 51 were retrieved (40 patients), and 62 remained and functioning well (38 patients), with their mean duration of 7.4 ± 9.5, 34.9 ± 36.3 and 82.3 ± 62.5 months, respectively.In pediatric patients, TFE with short-length scopes coupled with this NIV support has provided a safe, feasible and effective modality in placing and subsequently managing TB BEMS with acceptable long-term outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2786310243,"We investigate how Global Economic Policy Uncertainty (GEPU) drives the long-run components of volatilities and correlations in crude oil and U.S. industry-level stock markets. Using the modified generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity mixed data sampling (GARCH-MIDAS) and dynamic conditional correlation mixed data sampling (DCC-MIDAS) specifications, we find that GEPU is positively related to the long-run volatility of Financials and Consumer Discretionary industries; however, it is negatively related to Information Technology, Materials, Telecommunication Services and Energy. Unlike the mixed role of GEPU in the long-run volatilities, the long-run correlations are all positively related to GEPU across the industries. Additionally, the rankings of the correlations of Energy and Materials are time-invariant and classified as high, with the little exception of the latter. The Consumer Staples industry is time-invariant in the low-ranking group. Our results are helpful to policy makers and investors with long-term concerns."
https://openalex.org/W2786509631,"Cervicothoracic spinal tuberculosis is a rare disease. Due to its difficult and challenging surgical exposure, its surgical treatment approach remains inconclusive. Long-term follow-up studies to address this puzzling issue are rarely seen in the literature. The purpose of this study was to explore the selection of surgical treatment approaches for cervicothoracic spinal tuberculosis through a 10-year case review.From January 2003 to January 2013, 45 patients suffering from cervicothoracic spinal tuberculosis were treated surgically. According to the relation between the tuberculosis lesion segments and the suprasternal notch on sagittal MRI, 19 patients were treated with a single-stage anterior debridement, fusion and instrumentation approach, and the other 26 patients were treated with a single-stage anterior debridement and fusion, posterior fusion and instrumentation approach. The clinical efficacy was evaluated using statistical analysis based on the Cobb angle of kyphosis, the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring system. The neurofunctional recovery was assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) system.All patients were followed up for 6.6 years on average (range 3-13 years). No instrumentation loosening, migration or breakage was observed during the follow-up. The kyphosis angle and NDI and JOA scores were significantly changed from preoperative values of 34.7±6.8°, 39.6±4.6 and 10.7±2.8 to postoperative values of 10.2±2.4°, 11.4±3.6 and 17.6±2.4, respectively (p<0.05). Aside from one recurrent patient, bone fusion was achieved in the other 44 patients within 6 to 9 months (mean 7.2 months). No severe postoperative complications occurred, and patients' neurologic function was improved in various degrees.In the surgical treatment of cervicothoracic spinal tuberculosis, single-stage cervical anterior approach with or without partial manubriotomy is capable of complete debridement for tuberculosis lesions. The manner of fixation should be selected based on the anatomical relation of the suprasternal notch and the diseased segments as revealed on sagittal MRI images."
https://openalex.org/W2787066031,"To evaluate ocular fundus biological changes after scleral collagen cross-linking (CXL) with riboflavin/ ultraviolet A (UVA) on rhesus monkeys in vivo by analyzing retina and choroid biological parameters. Six 3-year-old male rhesus monkeys (12 eyes) were observed in this study, with scleral CXL procedures applied on superior temporal equatorial sclera on random eyes of all rhesus. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) examination were performed before and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after CXL. The thickness of retina and choroid and the flow density of retinal superficial vascular networks were analyzed respectively in different regions after CXL. As for retina thickness and flow density of retinal superficial vascular networks, no statistical difference was noted between CXL eyes and control eyes at 1 day, 1week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months (P>0.05). Among choroid parameters, the choroidal thickness in 1500μm temporal to the fovea center of CXL eyes revealed a significant reduction in 1 week postoperatively (P<0.05), but it subsequently increased from 1 month postoperatively, and no statistical difference was found between two groups in the following periods (P>0.05). The choroidal thickness nearby crosslinked region may change temporarily following scleral CXL, and it might recover gradually after 1 month postoperatively. The vascular flow density and thickness of retina were not affected by scleral CXL. Further study should be performed to evaluate the potential adverse effects at the direct vicinity of the application site and the long-term effect of scleral CXL in clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2790573278,"Purpose A cohort of pediatric patients with AML treated at hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information System was used to evaluate differences in opioid utilization by sex, age, race, and insurance. Methods Billing data were used to compute the prevalence of opioid exposure and to quantify rates of utilization among those exposed to opioids as days of use per 1000 inpatient days. Multivariable regressions were used to compare opioid prevalence, and rates of utilization among those exposed. Results On average across courses, 95.2% of patients were exposed to analgesics, 84.7% were exposed to non-opioid analgesics and 77.7% were exposed to opioids. The proportion of opioid-exposed patients increased with age, but did not differ by gender, race, or insurance status. Analyses limited to patients exposed to opioids revealed modest differences in days of opioid use among female patients (adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.28), patients <1 year (aRR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.55) or ≥10 years of age (aRR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.46, 1.82), whereas Asian patients received fewer days of opioids compared with white patients (aRR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.95). There was moderate hospital-level variability in both the prevalence of opioid utilization overall and preference for specific opioid medications. There was greater inconsistency in practice concerning choices for supplemental and alternative opioids than in first-line opioid utilization. Conclusion Additional work is needed to discern whether observed differences in opioid utilization by age and race reflect a difference in treatment or a difference in the experience of pain. Future studies should also explore the factors which guide decisions on opioid selections in an attempt to explain the variability across institutions."
https://openalex.org/W2792053456,"Background Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an inflammatory rheumatic disease typically diagnosed in young age and follows a chronic progressive course. Its impact on the patient is life-long and the burden that AS exerts on society is increasing cumulatively every year. We aimed to quantify the burden of AS and to identify the factors associated with comorbidity, disability, and healthcare expenditure in Korean AS patients. Methods We conducted a nationwide, population-based study using health insurance data (2003–2013). The analysis included individuals with incident AS (1,111 patients) and controls (5,555 patients) matched by age, sex, income, and geographic region. The incidence rates of extra-articular manifestations (EAMs), comorbidities, mortality, and disability (type and severity) were compared between AS patients and controls. Annual health expenditure per patient was also analyzed. Associations were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Results During the follow-up, 28% of AS patients experienced at least one EAM. AS diagnosis was significantly associated with Charlson comorbidity index ≥3 (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.91–2.48). Disability rate was higher in AS patients than in controls regardless of cause and severity (OR 2.94, 95% CI 2.48–3.48), but crude incidence rate ratios for mortality were not significantly higher. On multivariate analysis, male sex (OR 3.18, 95% CI 2.13–4.75), presence of an EAM (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15–2.32), and older age at diagnosis (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.20–1.35) were evidently associated with increased disability in AS. Presence of an EAM was also associated with increased AS-unrelated expenditures in biologic-naïve patients (median, 1112 vs. 877 USD per person, P < 0.05). Conclusions In patients with AS, demographic factors and systemic manifestations including EAMs and other comorbidities were associated with increased disability and healthcare expenditures."
https://openalex.org/W2787363731,"Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and despite advances in prevention, diagnosis and therapy, it is still regarded as a global health concern. The efficacy of the therapies for gastric cancer is limited by a poor response to currently available therapeutic regimens. One of the reasons that may explain these poor clinical outcomes is the highly heterogeneous nature of this disease. In this sense, it is essential to discover new molecular agents capable of targeting various gastric cancer subtypes simultaneously. Here, we present a multi-objective approach for the ligand-based virtual screening discovery of chemical compounds simultaneously active against the gastric cancer cell lines AGS, NCI-N87 and SNU-1. The proposed approach relays in a novel methodology based on the development of ensemble models for the bioactivity prediction against each individual gastric cancer cell line. The methodology includes the aggregation of one ensemble per cell line using a desirability-based algorithm into virtual screening protocols. Our research leads to the proposal of a multi-targeted virtual screening protocol able to achieve high enrichment of known chemicals with anti-gastric cancer activity. Specifically, our results indicate that, using the proposed protocol, it is possible to retrieve almost 20 more times multi-targeted compounds in the first 1% of the ranked list than what is expected from a uniform distribution of the active ones in the virtual screening database. More importantly, the proposed protocol attains an outstanding initial enrichment of known multi-targeted anti-gastric cancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2792931703,"The evolution of the tetrapod limb involved an expansion and elaboration of the endoskeletal elements, while the fish fin rays were lost. Loss of fin-specific genes, and regulatory changes in key appendicular patterning genes have been identified as mechanisms of limb evolution, however their contributions to cellular organization and tissue differences between fins and limbs remains poorly understood. During early larval fin development, hoxa13a/hoxd13a-expressing fin fold mesenchyme migrate through the median and pectoral fin along actinotrichia fibrils, non-calcified skeletal elements crucial for supporting the fin fold. Fin fold mesenchyme migration defects have previously been proposed as a mechanism of fin dermal bone loss during tetrapod evolution as it has been shown they contribute directly to the fin ray osteoblast population. Using the nitroreductase/metronidazole system, we genetically ablated a subset of hoxa13a/hoxd13a-expressing fin fold mesenchyme to assess its contributions to fin development. Following the ablation of fin fold mesenchyme in larvae, the actinotrichia are unable to remain rigid and the median and pectoral fin folds collapse, resulting in a reduced fin fold size. The remaining cells following ablation are unable to migrate and show decreased actinodin1 mesenchymal reporter activity. Actinodin proteins are crucial structural component of the actinotrichia. Additionally, we show a decrease in hoxa13a, hoxd13a, fgf10a and altered shha, and ptch2 expression during larval fin development. A continuous treatment of metronidazole leads to fin ray defects at 30dpf. Fewer rays are present compared to stage-matched control larvae, and these rays are shorter and less defined. These results suggest the targeted hoxa13a/hoxd13a-expressing mesenchyme contribute to their own successful migration through their contributions to actinotrichia. Furthermore, due to their fate as fin ray osteoblasts, we propose their initial ablation, and subsequent disorganization produces truncated fin dermal bone elements during late larval stages."
https://openalex.org/W2790512347,"There is growing concern about residual antibiotics and feed additives in the manure of treated animals because of the effects of these residues in the environment. Monensin is the most widely used ionophore coccidiostat in the U.S. The objective of this study was to determine the fate and effect of monensin during the anaerobic digestion of dairy manure. Duplicate plug flow field-scale digesters were operated using non-amended dairy manure and dairy manure amended with monensin to 1 and 10 mg/L for 56 days at 30°C at an organic loading rate of 1.4 kg VS/m3-d and 17-day hydraulic retention time. Results showed that monensin was reduced approximately 70% during anaerobic digestion. Methane production from digesters using manure amended with 1 mg/L monensin was comparable to that from digesters operated without added monensin. However, digesters using manure amended with 10 mg/L monensin yielded 75% less methane than digesters using manure without added monensin. These results suggest that anaerobic digestion is an effective treatment for reducing, but not eliminating, monensin in dairy manure. Monensin did not reduce methane production at concentrations expected in dairy manure at recommended dosage rates."
https://openalex.org/W2792866485,"A randomized controlled trial was conducted to prospectively compare the therapeutic effectiveness of switching bipolar (SB) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using cooled-wet electrodes and switching monopolar (SM) RFA using separable clustered (SC) electrodes in patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).This prospective study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Between April 2014 and January 2015, sixty-nine patients with 74 HCCs were randomly treated with RFA using either internally cooled-wet (ICW) electrodes in SB mode (SB-RFA, n = 36) or SC electrodes in SM mode (SM-RFA, n = 38). Technical parameters including the number of ablations, ablation time, volume, energy delivery, and complications were evaluated. Thereafter, 1-year and 2-year local tumor progression (LTP) free survival rates were compared between the two groups using the Kaplan-Meier method.In the SB-RFA group, less number of ablations were required (1.72±0.70 vs. 2.31±1.37, P = 0.039), the ablation time was shorter (10.9±3.9 vs.14.3±5.0 min, p = 0.004), and energy delivery was smaller (13.1±6.3 vs.23.4±12.8 kcal, p<0.001) compared to SM-RFA. Ablation volume was not significantly different between SB-RFA and SM-RFA groups (61.8±24.3 vs.54.9±23.7 cm3, p = 0.229). Technical failure occurred in one patient in the SM-RFA group, and major complications occurred in one patient in each group. The 1-year and 2-year LTP free survival rates were 93.9% and 84.3% in the SB-RFA group and 94.4% and 88.4% in the SM-RFA group (p = 0.687).Both SB-RFA using ICW electrodes and SM-RFA using SC electrodes provided comparable LTP free survival rates although SB-RFA required less ablations and shorter ablation time."
https://openalex.org/W2793299559,"Increasing production of nanomaterials in industrial quantities has led to public health concerns regarding exposure, particularly among pregnant women and developing fetuses. Information regarding the barrier capacity of the placenta for various nanomaterials is limited due to challenges working with ex vivo human placentas or in vivo animal models. To facilitate real-time in vivo imaging of placental transport, we have developed a novel, multifunctional nanoparticle, based on a core of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), and functionalized for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and fluorescent microscopy. Our MSN particles were tested as a tracking method for harmful and toxic nanomaterials. In gravid mice, intravenous injections of MSN were administered in the maternal circulation in early gestation (day 9) and late gestation (day 14). MRI and ultrasound were used to track the MSN following the injections. Changes in contrast relative to control mice indicated that MSN were observed in the embryos of mice following early gestation injections, while MSN were excluded from the embryo by the placenta following late gestation injections. The timing of transplacental barrier porosity is consistent with the notion that in mice there is a progressive increasing segregation by the placenta in later gestation. In addition, built-in physico-chemical properties of our MSN may present options for the therapeutic treatment of embryonic exposure. For example, if preventive measures such as detoxification of harmful compounds are implemented, the particle size and exposure timing can be tailored to selectively distribute to the maternal side of the trophoblast or delivered to the fetus."
https://openalex.org/W2790181256,"Peer-reviewed publication volume and caliber are widely-recognized proxies for academic merit, and a strong publication record is essential for academic success and advancement. However, recent work suggests that publication productivity for particular author groups may also be determined in part by implicit biases lurking in the publication pipeline. Here, we explore patterns of gender, geography, and institutional rank among authors, editorial board members, and handling editors in high-impact ecological publications during 2015 and 2016. A higher proportion of lead authors had female first names (33.9%) than editorial board members (28.9%), and the proportion of female first names among handling editors was even lower (21.1%). Female editors disproportionately edited publications with female lead authors (40.3% of publications with female lead authors were handled by female editors, though female editors handled only 34.4% of all studied publications). Additionally, ecological authors and editors were overwhelmingly from countries in the G8, and high-ranking academic institutions accounted for a large portion of both the published work, and its editorship. Editors and lead authors with female names were typically affiliated with higher-ranking institutions than their male peers. This description of author and editor features provides a baseline for benchmarking future trends in the ecological publishing culture."
https://openalex.org/W2791917688,"The pathophysiologic processes underlying the regulation of glucose homeostasis are considerably complex at both cellular and systemic level. A comprehensive and structured specification for the several layers of abstraction of glucose metabolism is often elusive, an issue currently solvable with the hierarchical description provided by multi-level models. In this study we propose a multi-level closed-loop model of whole-body glucose homeostasis, coupled with the molecular specifications of the insulin signaling cascade in adipocytes, under the experimental conditions of normal glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes.The ordinary differential equations of the model, describing the dynamics of glucose and key regulatory hormones and their reciprocal interactions among gut, liver, muscle and adipose tissue, were designed for being embedded in a modular, hierarchical structure. The closed-loop model structure allowed self-sustained simulations to represent an ideal in silico subject that adjusts its own metabolism to the fasting and feeding states, depending on the hormonal context and invariant to circadian fluctuations. The cellular level of the model provided a seamless dynamic description of the molecular mechanisms downstream the insulin receptor in the adipocytes by accounting for variations in the surrounding metabolic context.The combination of a multi-level and closed-loop modeling approach provided a fair dynamic description of the core determinants of glucose homeostasis at both cellular and systemic scales. This model architecture is intrinsically open to incorporate supplementary layers of specifications describing further individual components influencing glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2794316214,"Because of compositional effects (more highly educated unemployed) and differences in the vulnerability towards the health consequences of unemployment (i.e. disappointment paradox hypothesis and/or status inconsistency for highly educated unemployed), it is argued that indicators of educational attainment need to be included when investigating the social norm of unemployment. Data from the 2001 census linked to register data from 2001–2011 are used, selecting all Belgian employed and unemployed between 30 and 59-year-old at time of the census. Poisson multilevel modelling was used to account for clustering of respondents within sub-districts. For individuals with low education levels, the relative difference in mortality rate ratios between the unemployed and employed is smallest in those regions where aggregate unemployment levels are high. For highly educated, this social norm effect was not found. This study suggest that the social norm effect is stronger for workers with low education levels, while highly educated workers suffer from disappointment and status inconsistency."
https://openalex.org/W2785345173,"Cell surface expression of α4β7, α4β1 and αEβ7 integrins play a key role in T cell distribution. Understanding the contribution of integrins to the density and ratios of CD4+: CD4negT cell at the portals of entry for HIV is of fundamental importance for the advance of more effective HIV prevention strategies. We therefore set out to characterize and compare the expression of α4β7, α4β1 and αEβ7 integrins on systemic, cervical and rectal CD4+ and CD4negT cells isolated from a cohort of healthy Kenyan women at low risk for sexually transmitted infections (STI) (n = 45). Here we show that blood and cervix were enriched in α4+β1+CD4+T cells and α4+β7hiCD4+T cells, whereas the rectum had an equal frequency of α4+β7hiCD4+T cells and αE+β7hiCD4+T cells. Most cervical and rectal αE+β7hiCD4+T cells expressed CCR5 as well as CD69. Interestingly, αEβ7 was the predominant integrin expressed by CD4negT cells in both mucosal sites, outnumbering αE+β7hiCD4+T cells approximately 2-fold in the cervix and 7-fold in the rectum. The majority of αE+β7hiCD4negT cells expressed CD69 at the mucosa. Taken together, our results show unique tissue-specific patterns of integrin expression. These results can help in guiding vaccine design and also the use of therapeutically targeting integrin adhesion as a means to preventing HIV."

We aimed to describe their 1) attitudes toward low-dose lung computed tomography (LDCT) screening, 2) current practices and experiences of LDCT screening and 3) attitudes and opinions towards national lung cancer screening program (NLCSP). We conducted a national web-based survey of pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiological oncologists who are members of Korean Association for Lung Cancer (N = 183). Almost all respondents agreed that LDCT screening increases early detection (100%), improves survival (95.1%), and gives a good smoking cessation counseling opportunity (88.6%). Most were concerned about its high false positive results (79.8%) and the subsequent negative effects. Less than half were concerned about radiation hazard (37.2%). Overall, most (89.1%) believed that the benefits outweigh the risks and harms. Most (79.2%) stated that they proactively recommend LDCT screening to those who are eligible for the current guidelines, but the screening propensity varied considerably. The majority (77.6%) agreed with the idea of NLCSP and its beneficial effect, but had concerns about the quality control of CT devices (74.9%), quality assurance of radiologic interpretation (63.3%), poor access to LDCT (56.3%), and difficulties in selecting eligible population using self-report history (66.7%). Most (79.2%) thought that program need to be funded by a specialized fund rather than by the National Health Insurance. The opinions on the level of copayment for screening varied.

https://openalex.org/W2793071128,"Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder with an unregulated surplus of platelets. Complications of ET include stroke, heart attack, and formation of blood clots. Although platelet-enhancing mutations have been identified in ET cohorts, genetic networks causally implicated in thrombotic risk remain unestablished. In this study, we aim to identify novel ET-related miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks through comparisons of transcriptomes between healthy controls and ET patients. Four network discovery algorithms have been employed, including (a) Pearson correlation network, (b) sparse supervised canonical correlation analysis (sSCCA), (c) sparse partial correlation network analysis (SPACE), and, (d) (sparse) Bayesian network analysis–all through a combined data-driven and knowledge-based analysis. The result predicts a close relationship between an 8-miRNA set (miR-9, miR-490-5p, miR-490-3p, miR-182, miR-34a, miR-196b, miR-34b*, miR-181a-2*) and a 9-mRNA set (CAV2, LAPTM4B, TIMP1, PKIG, WASF1, MMP1, ERVH-4, NME4, HSD17B12). The majority of the identified variables have been linked to hematologic functions by a number of studies. Furthermore, it is observed that the selected mRNAs are highly relevant to ET disease, and provide an initial framework for dissecting both platelet-enhancing and functional consequences of dysregulated platelet production."

The second aim was to investigate the predictive value of preoperative NT-proBNP with regard to severe postoperative heart failure (SPHF) and postoperative mortality.A retrospective cohort study based on preoperative NT-proBNP measurements in an unselected cohort including all patients undergoing first time surgery for coronary artery disease (CAD; n = 2226), aortic stenosis (AS; n = 406) or mitral regurgitation (MR; n = 346) from April 2010 to August 2016 in the southeast region of Sweden (n = 2978). Concomitant procedures were not included, with the exception of Maze or tricuspid valve procedures.Preoperative NT-proBNP was 1.67 times (p<0.0001) and 1.41 times (p<0.0001) higher in patients with AS or MR respectively, than in patients with CAD after adjusting for confounders. NT-proBNP demonstrated significant discrimination with regard to SPHF in CAD (AUC = 0.79, 95%CI 0.73-0.85, p<0.0001), MR (AUC = 0.80, 95%CI 0.72-0.87, p<0.0001) and AS (AUC = 0.66, 95%CI 0.51-0.81, p = 0.047). In CAD patients NT-proBNP demonstrated significant discrimination with regard to postoperative 30-day or in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.78; 95%CI 0.71-0.85, p<0.0001). The number of deaths was too few in the AS and MR group to permit analysis. Elevated NT-proBNP emerged as an independent risk factor for SPHF, and postoperative mortality in CAD.Patients with AS or MR have higher preoperative NT-proBNP than CAD patients even after adjusting for confounders. The predictive value of NT-proBNP with regard to SPHF was confirmed in CAD and MR patients but was less convincing in AS patients."

By applying a set of tools such as Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), ANNOVAR, and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), we highlighted 561 potentially detrimental variants from PJL data, and 7374 variants from ExAC South Asian data. Likewise, filtration from ClinVar for CVDs revealed 03 pathogenic and 02 likely pathogenic variants from PJL and 112 pathogenic and 42 likely pathogenic variants from ExAC South Asians. The comparison of derived allele frequencies (DAF) revealed many of these prioritized variants having two fold and higher DAF in Pakistani individuals than in other populations. The highest number of deleterious variants contributing to common CVDs in descending order includes hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart failure, aneurysm, and coronary heart disease, and for Mendelian and congenital CVDs cardiomyopathies, cardiac arrhythmias, and atrioventricular septal defects."
https://openalex.org/W2788275089,"Despite the global value of barley, compared to its wild progenitor, genetic variation in this crop has been drastically reduced due to the process of domestication, selection and improvement. In the medium term, this will negatively impact both the vulnerability and yield stability of barley against biotic and abiotic stresses under climate change. Returning to the crop wild relatives (CWR) as sources of new and beneficial alleles is a clear option for enhancing the resilience of diversity and adaptation to climate change. Southeastern Anatolia constitutes an important part of the natural distribution of wild barley in the Fertile Crescent where important crops were initially domesticated. In this study, we investigated genetic diversity in a comprehensive collection of 281 geo-referenced wild barley individuals from 92 collection sites with sample sizes ranging from 1 to 9 individuals per site, collected from southeastern Anatolia and 131 domesticated genotypes from 49 different countries using 40 EST-SSR markers. A total of 375 alleles were detected across entire collection, of which 283 were carried by domesticated genotypes and 316 alleles were present in the wild gene pool. The number of unique alleles in the wild and in the domesticated gene pool was 92 and 59, respectively. The population structure at K = 3 suggested two groups of wild barley namely G1-W consisting wild barley genotypes from the western part and G1-E comprising those mostly from the eastern part of the study area, with a sharp separation from the domesticated gene pool. The geographic and climatic factors jointly showed significant effects on the distribution of wild barley. Using a Latent Factor Mixed Model, we identified four candidate loci potentially involved in adaptation of wild barley to three environmental factors: temperature seasonality, mean temperature of driest quarter, and precipitation of coldest quarter. These loci are probably the targets of genomic regions, with potential roles against abiotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2790623331,"Kievitone hydratase catalyzes the addition of water to the double bond of the prenyl moiety of plant isoflavonoid kievitone and, thereby, forms the tertiary alcohol hydroxy-kievitone. In nature, this conversion is associated with a defense mechanism of fungal pathogens against phytoalexins generated by host plants after infection. As of today, a gene sequence coding for kievitone hydratase activity has only been identified and characterized in Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli. Here, we report on the identification of a putative kievitone hydratase sequence in Nectria haematococca (NhKHS), the teleomorph state of F. solani, based on in silico sequence analyses. After heterologous expression of the enzyme in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, we have confirmed its kievitone hydration activity and have assessed its biochemical properties and substrate specificity. Purified recombinant NhKHS is obviously a homodimeric glycoprotein. Due to its good activity for the readily available chalcone derivative xanthohumol (XN), this compound was selected as a model substrate for biochemical studies. The optimal pH and temperature for hydratase activity were 6.0 and 35°C, respectively, and apparent Vmax and Km values for hydration of XN were 7.16 μmol min-1 mg-1 and 0.98 ± 0.13 mM, respectively. Due to its catalytic properties and apparent substrate promiscuity, NhKHS is a promising enzyme for the biocatalytic production of tertiary alcohols."
https://openalex.org/W2789537581,"In its most basic form, the spatial capital of a neighborhood entails that most aspects of daily life are located close at hand. Urban planning researchers have widely recognized its importance, not least because it can be transformed in other forms of capital such as economical capital (e.g., house prices, retail sales) and social capital (e.g., neighborhood cohesion). Researchers have already studied spatial capital from official city data. Their work led to important planning decisions, yet it also relied on data that is costly to create and update, and produced metrics that are difficult to compare across cities. By contrast, we propose to measure spatial capital in cheap and standardized ways around the world. Hence the name of our project ""World Wide Spatial Capital"". Our measures are cheap as they rely on the most basic information about a city that is currently available on the Web (i.e., which amenities are available and where). They are also standardized because they can be applied in any city in the five continents (as opposed to previous metrics that were mainly applied in USA and UK). We show that, upon these metrics, one could produce insights at the core of the urban planning discipline: which areas would benefit the most from urban interventions; how to inform planning depending on whether a city's activity is mono- or poly-centric; how different cities fare against each other; and how spatial capital correlates with other urban characteristics such as mobility patterns and road network structure."
https://openalex.org/W2789573965,"The interaction between actin filaments and myosin molecular motors is a power source of a variety of cellular functions including cell division, cell motility, and muscular contraction. In vitro motility assay examines actin filaments interacting with myosin molecules that are adhered to a substrate (e.g., glass surface). This assay has been the standard method of studying the molecular mechanisms of contraction under an optical microscope. While the force generation has been measured through an optically trapped bead to which an actin filament is attached, a force vector vertical to the glass surface has been largely ignored with the in vitro motility assay. The vertical vector is created by the gap (distance) between the trapped bead and the glass surface. In this report, we propose a method to estimate the angle between the actin filament and the glass surface by optically determining the gap size. This determination requires a motorized stage in a standard epi-fluorescence microscope equipped with optical tweezers. This facile method is applied to force measurements using both pure actin filaments, and thin filaments reconstituted from actin, tropomyosin and troponin. We find that the angle-corrected force per unit filament length in the active condition (pCa = 5.0) decreases as the angle between the filament and the glass surface increases; i.e. as the force in the vertical direction increases. At the same time, we demonstrate that the force on reconstituted thin filaments is approximately 1.5 times larger than that on pure actin filaments. The range of angles we tested was between 11° and 36° with the estimated measurement error less than 6°. These results suggest the ability of cytoplasmic tropomyosin isoforms maintaining actomyosin active force to stabilize cytoskeletal architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2764111929,"In this paper we study data from financial markets using an information-theory tool that we call the normalised Mutual Information Rate and show how to use it to infer the underlying network structure of interrelations in foreign currency exchange rates and stock indices of 14 countries world-wide and the European Union. We first present the mathematical method and discuss about its computational aspects, and then apply it to artificial data from chaotic dynamics and to correlated random variates. Next, we apply the method to infer the network structure of the financial data. Particularly, we study and reveal the interrelations among the various foreign currency exchange rates and stock indices in two separate networks for which we also perform an analysis to identify their structural properties. Our results show that both are small-world networks sharing similar properties but also having distinct differences in terms of assortativity. Finally, the consistent relationships depicted among the 15 economies are further supported by a discussion from the economics view point."
https://openalex.org/W2788088802,"Objective To study the long-term clinical, immunological and virological outcomes among people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Myanmar. Methods A retrospective analysis of people on ART for >9 years followed by a cross-sectional survey among the patients in this group who remained on ART at the time of the survey. Routinely collected medical data established the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics for adult patients initiating ART between 2004 and 2006. Patients remaining on ART between March-August 2015 were invited to participate in a survey assessing clinical, virological, immunological, and biochemical characteristics. Results Of 615 patients included in the retrospective analysis, 35 (6%) were lost-to-follow-up, 9 (1%) were transferred, 153 died (25%) and 418 (68%) remained active in care. Among deaths, 48 (31.4%) occurred within 3 months of ART initiation, and 81 (52.9%) within 12 months, 90.1% (n = 73) of which were initially classified as stage 3/4. Of 385 patients included in the survey, 30 (7.7%) were on second-line ART regimen; 373 (96.8%) had suppressed viral load (<250 copies/ml). The mean CD4 count was 548 cells/ mm3 (SD 234.1) after ≥9 years on treatment regardless of the CD4 group at initiation. Tuberculosis while on ART was diagnosed in 187 (48.5%); 29 (7.6%) had evidence of hepatitis B and 53 (13.9%) of hepatitis C infection. Conclusions Appropriate immunological and virological outcomes were seen among patients on ART for ≥9 years. However, for the complete initiating cohort, high mortality was observed, especially in the first year on ART. Concerning co-infections, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis were common among this population. Our results demonstrate that good long-term outcomes are possible even for patients with advanced AIDS at ART initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2788123145,"The catalytic activity of trypsin-like serine proteases is in many cases regulated by conformational changes initiated by binding of physiological modulators to exosites located distantly from the active site. A trypsin-like serine protease of particular interest is urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which is involved in extracellular tissue remodeling processes. Herein, we used hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) to study regulation of activity in the catalytic domain of the murine version of uPA (muPA) by two muPA specific monoclonal antibodies. Using a truncated muPA variant (muPA16-243), containing the catalytic domain only, we show that the two monoclonal antibodies, despite binding to an overlapping epitope in the 37s and 70s loops of muPA16-243, stabilize distinct muPA16-243 conformations. Whereas the inhibitory antibody, mU1 was found to increase the conformational flexibility of muPA16-243, the stimulatory antibody, mU3, decreased muPA16-243 conformational flexibility. Furthermore, the HDXMS data unveil the existence of a pathway connecting the 70s loop to the active site region. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis, we further identify the 70s loop as an important exosite for the activation of the physiological uPA substrate plasminogen. Thus, the data presented here reveal important information about dynamics in uPA by demonstrating how various ligands can modulate uPA activity by mediating long-range conformational changes. Moreover, the results provide a possible mechanism of plasminogen activation."
https://openalex.org/W2789584240,"Is the neural control of movements towards moving targets independent to that of static targets? In the following experiments, we used a visuomotor rotation adaptation paradigm to examine the extent to which adapting arm movements to static targets generalize to that of moving targets (i.e. pursuit or tracking). In the first and second experiments, we showed that adaptation to perturbed tracking movements generalizes to reaching movements; reach aftereffects following perturbed tracking were about half the size (≈9°) of those produced following reach training (≈ 19°). Given these findings, in the final experiment we associated opposing perturbations (-30° and +30°) with either reaching or tracking movements and presented them within the same experimental block to determine whether these contexts allow for dual adaptation. We found that the group that experienced opposing perturbations was able to reduce both reaching and tracking errors, as well as produce reach aftereffects following dual training of ≈7°, which were substantially smaller than those produced when reach training was not concurrent with tracking training. This reduction in reach aftereffects is consistent with the extent of the interference from tracking training as measured by the reach aftereffects produced when only that condition was performed. These results suggest partial, but not complete, overlap in the learning processes involved in the acquisition of tracking and reaching movements."
