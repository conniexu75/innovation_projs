https://openalex.org/W2127811153,"The total solids content of feedstocks affects the performances of anaerobic digestion and the change of total solids content will lead the change of microbial morphology in systems. In order to increase the efficiency of anaerobic digestion, it is necessary to understand the role of the total solids content on the behavior of the microbial communities involved in anaerobic digestion of organic matter from wet to dry technology. The performances of mesophilic anaerobic digestion of food waste with different total solids contents from 5% to 20% were compared and the microbial communities in reactors were investigated using 454 pyrosequencing technology. Three stable anaerobic digestion processes were achieved for food waste biodegradation and methane generation. Better performances mainly including volatile solids reduction and methane yield were obtained in the reactors with higher total solids content. Pyrosequencing results revealed significant shifts in bacterial community with increasing total solids contents. The proportion of phylum Chloroflexi decreased obviously with increasing total solids contents while other functional bacteria showed increasing trend. Methanosarcina absolutely dominated in archaeal communities in three reactors and the relative abundance of this group showed increasing trend with increasing total solids contents. These results revealed the effects of the total solids content on the performance parameters and the behavior of the microbial communities involved in the anaerobic digestion of food waste from wet to dry technologies."

Methods Genome wide gene expression was determined in paired samples of OA affected and preserved cartilage of the same joint using microarray analysis for 33 patients of the RAAK study. Results were replicated in independent samples by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Profiles were analyzed with the online analysis tools DAVID and STRING to identify enrichment for specific pathways and protein-protein interactions. Results Among the 1717 genes that were significantly differently expressed between OA affected and preserved cartilage we found significant enrichment for genes involved in skeletal development (e.g. TNFRSF11B and FRZB). Also several inflammatory genes such as CD55, PTGES and TNFAIP6, previously identified in within-joint analyses as well as in analyses comparing preserved cartilage from OA affected joints versus healthy cartilage were among the top genes. Of note was the high up-regulation of NGF in OA cartilage. RT-qPCR confirmed differential expression for 18 out of 19 genes with expression changes of 2-fold or higher, and immunohistochemistry of selected genes showed a concordant change in protein expression. Most of these changes associated with OA severity (Mankin score) but were independent of joint-site or sex. Conclusion We provide further insights into the ongoing OA pathophysiological processes in cartilage, in particular into differences in macroscopically intact cartilage compared to OA affected cartilage, which seem relatively consistent and independent of sex or joint. We advocate that development of treatment could benefit by focusing on these similarities in gene expression changes and/or pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2045487560,"The presence of pharmaceutical products in the aquatic environment has been reported in several studies. However, the impact of these drugs on living organisms is still uncharacterized. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to either diazepam or fluoxetine on the stress response in Danio rerio. We showed that diazepam and fluoxetine inhibited the stress axis in zebrafish. Intermediate concentrations of diazepam suppressed the stress response as measured by cortisol levels, whereas fluoxetine inhibited cortisol increase at concentrations similar to those found in the environment. These data suggest that the presence of psychoactive drugs in aquatic ecosystems could cause neuroendocrine dysfunction in fish."
https://openalex.org/W2061565315,"Mediterranean gorgonian forests are threatened by several human activities and are affected by climatic anomalies that have led to mass mortality events in recent decades. The ecological role of these habitats and the possible consequence of their loss are poorly understood. Effects of gorgonians on the recruitment of epibenthic organisms were investigated by manipulating presence of gorgonians on experimental panels at 24 m depth, for Eunicella cavolinii, and at 40 m depth, for Paramuricea clavata, at two sites: Tavolara Island (Tyrrhenian Sea) and Portofino Promontory (Ligurian Sea). After 4 months, the most abundant taxa on the panels were encrusting green algae, erect red algae and crustose coralline algae at 24 m depth and encrusting brown algae and erect red algae at 40 m depth. Assemblages on the panels were significantly affected by the presence of the gorgonians, although effects varied across sites and between gorgonian species. Species diversity and evenness were lower on panels with gorgonian branches. Growth of erect algae and recruitment of serpulid polychaetes were also affected by the presence of the gorgonians, primarily at Tavolara. Crustose coralline algae and erect sponges were more abundant on E. cavolinii panels at 24 m depth, while encrusting bryozoans were more abundant on P. clavata panels at 40 m depth. Effects of gorgonians on recruited assemblages could be due to microscale modification of hydrodynamics and sediment deposition rate, or by a shading effect reducing light intensity. Gorgonians may also intercept settling propagules, compete for food with the filter-feeders and/or for space by producing allelochemicals. Presence of gorgonians mainly limits the growth of erect algae and enhances the abundance of encrusting algae and sessile invertebrates. Therefore, the gorgonian disappearances may cause a shift from assemblages characterised by crustose coralline algae to filamentous algae assemblages, decreasing complexity and resilience of coralligenous bioconstructions."
https://openalex.org/W1978489506,"The lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) is an abundant and aggressive biter of humans, domestic animals, and wildlife in the southeastern-central USA and an important vector of several known and suspected zoonotic bacterial pathogens. However, the biological drivers of bacterial community variation in this tick are still poorly defined. Knowing the community context in which tick-borne bacterial pathogens exist and evolve is required to fully understand the ecology and immunobiology of the ticks and to design effective public health and veterinary interventions. We performed a metagenomic survey of the bacterial communities of questing A. americanum and tested 131 individuals (66 nymphs, 24 males, and 41 females) from five sites in three states. Pyrosequencing was performed with barcoded eubacterial primers targeting variable 16S rRNA gene regions 5–3. The bacterial communities were dominated by Rickettsia (likely R. amblyommii) and an obligate Coxiella symbiont, together accounting for 6.7–100% of sequences per tick. DNAs from Midichloria, Borrelia, Wolbachia, Ehrlichia, Pseudomonas, or unidentified Bacillales, Enterobacteriaceae, or Rhizobiales groups were also detected frequently. Wolbachia and Midichloria significantly co-occurred in Georgia (p<0.00001), but not in other states. The significance of the Midichloria-Wolbachia co-occurrence is unknown. Among ticks collected in Georgia, nymphs differed from adults in both the composition (p = 0.002) and structure (p = 0.002) of their bacterial communities. Adults differed only in their community structure (p = 0.002) with males containing more Rickettsia and females containing more Coxiella. Comparisons among adult ticks collected in New York and North Carolina supported the findings from the Georgia collection despite differences in geography, collection date, and sample handling, implying that the differences detected are consistent attributes. The data also suggest that some members of the bacterial community change during the tick life cycle and that some sex-specific attributes may be detectable in nymphs."
https://openalex.org/W1979776162,"Objective Glioblastoma is the most frequent and malignant form of primary brain tumor with grave prognosis. Mounting evidence supports that chronic inflammation (such as chronic overactivation of IL-1 system) is a crucial event in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. IL-1 also is an important cytokine with species-dependent regulations and roles in CNS cell activation. While much attention is paid to specific anti-tumor immunity, little is known about the role of chronic inflammation/innate immunity in glioma pathogenesis. In this study, we examined whether human astrocytic cells (including malignant gliomas) can produce IL-1 and its role in glioma progression. Methods We used a combination of cell culture, real-time PCR, ELISA, western blot, immunocytochemistry, siRNA and plasmid transfection, micro-RNA analysis, angiogenesis (tube formation) assay, and neurotoxicity assay. Results Glioblastoma cells produced large quantities of IL-1 when activated, resembling macrophages/microglia. The activation signal was provided by IL-1 but not the pathogenic components LPS or poly IC. Glioblastoma cells were highly sensitive to IL-1 stimulation, suggesting its relevance in vivo. In human astrocytes, IL-1β mRNA was not translated to protein. Plasmid transfection also failed to produce IL-1 protein, suggesting active repression. Suppression of microRNAs that can target IL-1α/β did not induce IL-1 protein. Glioblastoma IL-1β processing occurred by the NLRP3 inflammasome, and ATP and nigericin increased IL-1β processing by upregulating NLRP3 expression, similar to macrophages. RNAi of annexin A2, a protein strongly implicated in glioma progression, prevented IL-1 induction, demonstrating its new role in innate immune activation. IL-1 also activated Stat3, a transcription factor crucial in glioma progression. IL-1 activated glioblastoma-conditioned media enhanced angiogenesis and neurotoxicity. Conclusions Our results demonstrate unique, species-dependent immune activation mechanisms involving human astrocytes and astrogliomas. Specifically, the ability to produce IL-1 by glioblastoma cells may confer them a mesenchymal phenotype including increased migratory capacity, unique gene signature and proinflammatory signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1977231721,"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has received increasing interest in applied medicine, being widely used in clinical practice with the aim of stimulating tissue healing. Despite the reported clinical success, there is still a lack of knowledge when considering the biological mechanisms at the base of the activity of PRP during the process of muscle healing. The aim of the present study was to verify whether the local delivery of PRP modulates specific molecular events involved in the early stages of the muscle regeneration process. The right flexor sublimis muscle of anesthetized Wistar rats was mechanically injured and either treated with PRP or received no treatment. At day 2 and 5 after surgery, the animals were sacrificed and the muscle samples evaluated at molecular levels. PRP treatment increased significantly the mRNA level of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, and TGF-β1. This phenomenon induced an increased expression at mRNA and/or protein levels of several myogenic regulatory factors such as MyoD1, Myf5 and Pax7, as well as the muscular isoform of insulin-like growth factor1 (IGF-1Eb). No effect was detected with respect to VEGF-A expression. In addition, PRP application modulated the expression of miR-133a together with its known target serum response factor (SRF); increased the phosphorylation of αB-cristallin, with a significant improvement in several apoptotic parameters (NF-κB-p65 and caspase 3), indexes of augmented cell survival. The results of the present study indicates that the effect of PRP in skeletal muscle injury repair is due both to the modulation of the molecular mediators of the inflammatory and myogenic pathways, and to the control of secondary pathways such as those regulated by myomiRNAs and heat shock proteins, which contribute to proper and effective tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1984505320,"The Greater Caribbean biogeographic region is the high-diversity heart of the Tropical West Atlantic, one of four global centers of tropical marine biodiversity. The traditional view of the Greater Caribbean is that it is limited to the Caribbean, West Indies, southwest Gulf of Mexico and tip of Florida, and that, due to its faunal homogeneity, lacks major provincial subdivisions. In this scenario the northern 2/3 of the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern USA represent a separate temperate, ""Carolinian"" biogeographic region. We completed a comprehensive re-assessment of the biogeography of the Greater Caribbean by comparing the distributions of 1,559 shorefish species within 45 sections of shelf waters of the Greater Caribbean and adjacent areas. This analysis shows that that the Greater Caribbean occupies a much larger area than usually thought, extending south to at least Guyana, and north to encompass the entire Carolinian area. Rather than being homogenous, the Greater Caribbean is divided into three major provinces, each with a distinctive, primarily tropical fauna: (1) a central, tropical province comprising the West Indies, Bermuda and Central America; (2) a southern, upwelling-affected province spanning the entire continental shelf of northern South America; and (iii) a northern, subtropical province that includes all of the Gulf of Mexico, Florida and southeastern USA. This three-province pattern holds for both reef- and soft bottom fishes, indicating a general response by demersal fishes to major variation in provincial shelf environments. Such environmental differences include latitudinal variation in sea temperature, availability of major habitats (coral reefs, soft bottom shorelines, and mangroves), and nutrient additions from upwelling areas and large rivers. The three-province arrangement of the Greater Caribbean broadly resembles and has a similar environmental basis to the provincial arrangement of its sister biogeographic region, the Tropical Eastern Pacific."
https://openalex.org/W2008287781,"Importance Trauma is a global disease and is among the leading causes of disability in the world. The importance of outcome beyond trauma survival has been recognised over the last decade. Despite this there is no internationally agreed approach for assessment of health outcome and rehabilitation of trauma patients. Objective To systematically examine to what extent outcomes measures evaluate health outcomes in patients with major trauma. Data Sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (from 2006–2012) were searched for studies evaluating health outcome after traumatic injuries. Study selection and data extraction Studies of adult patients with injuries involving at least two body areas or organ systems were included. Information on study design, outcome measures used, sample size and outcomes were extracted. The World Health Organisation International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF) were used to evaluate to what extent outcome measures captured health impacts. Results 34 studies from 755 studies were included in the review. 38 outcome measures were identified. 21 outcome measures were used only once and only five were used in three or more studies. Only 6% of all possible health impacts were captured. Concepts related to activity and participation were the most represented but still only captured 12% of all possible concepts in this domain. Measures performed very poorly in capturing concepts related to body function (5%), functional activities (11%) and environmental factors (2%). Conclusion Outcome measures used in major trauma capture only a small proportion of health impacts. There is no inclusive classification for measuring disability or health outcome following trauma. The ICF may provide a useful framework for the development of a comprehensive health outcome measure for trauma care."
https://openalex.org/W2005710138,"The purpose of this study was to determine the functional recovery of the transplanted induced pluripotent stem cells in a rat model of Huntington's disease with use of 18F-FDG microPET/CT imaging. Methods In a quinolinic acid-induced rat model of striatal degeneration, induced pluripotent stem cells were transplanted into the ipsilateral lateral ventricle ten days after the quinolinic acid injection. The response to the treatment was evaluated by serial 18F-FDG PET/CT scans and Morris water maze test. Histological analyses and Western blotting were performed six weeks after stem cell transplantation. Results After induced pluripotent stem cells transplantation, higher 18F-FDG accumulation in the injured striatum was observed during the 4 to 6-weeks period compared with the quinolinic acid-injected group, suggesting the metabolic recovery of injured striatum. The induced pluripotent stem cells transplantation improved learning and memory function (and striatal atrophy) of the rat in six week in the comparison with the quinolinic acid-treated controls. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that transplanted stem cells survived and migrated into the lesioned area in striatum, and most of the stem cells expressed protein markers of neurons and glial cells. Conclusion Our findings show that induced pluripotent stem cells can survive, differentiate to functional neurons and improve partial striatal function and metabolism after implantation in a rat Huntington's disease model."
https://openalex.org/W2020114768,"Isolation of specific genomic regions retaining molecular interactions is essential for comprehensive identification of molecules associated with the genomic regions. Recently, we developed the engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) technology for purification of specific genomic regions. Here, we developed a retroviral expression system for enChIP using CRISPR. We showed that the target genomic locus can be purified with high efficiency by using this system. We also showed that contamination of potential off-target sites is negligible by using this system if the guide RNA (gRNA) for the target site has a sufficiently long unique sequence in its seed sequence. enChIP combined with stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) analysis identified proteins whose association with the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) promoter region increases in response to IFNγ stimulation. The list of the associated proteins contained many novel proteins in the context of IFNγ-induced gene expression as well as proteins related to histone deacetylase complexes whose involvement has been suggested in IFNγ-mediated gene expression. Finally, we confirmed IFNγ-induced increased association of the identified proteins with the IRF-1 promoter by ChIP. Thus, our results showed that the retroviral enChIP system using CRISPR would be useful for biochemical analysis of genome functions including transcription and epigenetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2028264836,"2-Butanol and its chemical precursor butanone (methyl ethyl ketone--MEK) are chemicals with potential uses as biofuels and biocommodity chemicals. In order to produce 2-butanol, we have demonstrated the utility of using a TEV-protease based expression system to achieve equimolar expression of the individual subunits of the two protein complexes involved in the B12-dependent dehydratase step (from the pdu-operon of Lactobacillus reuteri), which catalyze the conversion of meso-2,3-butanediol to butanone. We have furthermore identified a NADH dependent secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (Sadh from Gordonia sp.) able to catalyze the subsequent conversion of butanone to 2-butanol. A final concentration of 4±0.2 mg/L 2-butanol and 2±0.1 mg/L of butanone was found. A key factor for the production of 2-butanol was the availability of NADH, which was achieved by growing cells lacking the GPD1 and GPD2 isogenes under anaerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2168268145,"G-protein-coupled receptors have been shown to assemble at least as dimers early in the biosynthetic path, but some evidence suggests that they can also form larger oligomeric complexes. Using the human chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR2 as models, we directly probed the existence of higher order homo- and heterooligomers in human embryonic kidney cells. Combining bimolecular fluorescence and luminescence complementation (BiFC, BiLC) with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays, we show that CXCR4 and CCR2 can assemble as homo- and heterooligomers, forming at least tetramers. Selective activation of CCR2 with the human monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) resulted in trans-conformational rearrangement of the CXCR4 dimer with an EC50 of 19.9 nM, compatible with a CCR2 action. Moreover, MCP-1 promoted the engagement of Gαi1, Gα13, Gαz, and βarrestin2 to the heterooligomer, resulting in calcium signaling that was synergistically potentiated on coactivation of CCR2 and CXCR4, demonstrating that complexes larger than dimers reach the cell surface as functional units. A mutation of CXCR4 (N119K), which prevents Gi activation, also affects the CCR2-promoted engagement of Gαi1 and βarrestin2 by the heterooligomer, supporting the occurrence of transprotomer regulation. Together, the results demonstrate that homo- and heteromultimeric CXCR4 and CCR2 can form functional signaling complexes that have unique properties."
https://openalex.org/W2035876383,"Hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and cycling are a result of intricate autonomous epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Once the first HF cycle is complete it repeatedly undergoes cyclic transformations. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix where they influence a variety of biological processes by interacting with physiologically important proteins, such as growth factors. Inhibition of heparanase (an HS endoglycosidase) in in vitro cultured HFs has been shown to induce a catagen-like process. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the precise role of HS in HF morphogenesis and cycling. An inducible tetratransgenic mouse model was generated to excise exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 (Ext1) in keratin 14-positive cells from P21. Interestingly, EXT1(StEpiΔ/StEpiΔ) mice presented solely anagen HFs. Moreover, waxing the fur to synchronize the HFs revealed accelerated hair regrowth in the EXT1(StEpiΔ/StEpiΔ) mice and hindered cycling into catagen. The ablation of HS in the interfollicular epidermal cells of mature skin led to the spontaneous formation of new HFs and an increase in Sonic Hedgehog expression resembling wild-type mice at P0, thereby indicating that the HS/Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates HF formation during embryogenesis and prevents HF formation in mature skin. Finally, the knock-out of HS also led to the morphogenesis and hyperplasia of sebaceous glands and sweat glands in mature mice, leading to exacerbated sebum production and accumulation on the skin surface. Therefore, our findings clearly show that an intricate control of HS levels is required for HF, sebaceous gland, and sweat gland morphogenesis and HF cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2061868016,"The aim of this study was to investigate the differential time-course responses of the auditory cortex to repeated auditory stimuli in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) showing auditory hypersensitivity. Auditory-evoked field values were obtained from 21 boys with ASD (12 with and 9 without auditory hypersensitivity) and 15 age-matched typically developing controls. M50 dipole moments were significantly increased during the time-course study only in the ASD with auditory hypersensitivity compared with those for the other two groups. The boys having ASD with auditory hypersensitivity also showed more prolonged response duration than those in the other two groups. The response duration was significantly related to the severity of auditory hypersensitivity. We propose that auditory hypersensitivity is associated with decreased inhibitory processing, possibly resulting from an abnormal sensory gating system or dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2100397228,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can differentiate into notochordal cell (NC)-like cells when cultured in the presence of natural porcine nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue matrix. The method promises massive production of high-quality, functional cells to treat degenerative intervertebral discs (IVDs). Based on our previous work, we further examined the effect of cell-NP matrix contact and culture medium on the differentiation, and further assessed the functional differentiation ability of the generated NC-like. The study showed that direct contact between hiPSCs and NP matrix can promote the differentiation yield, whilst both the contact and non-contact cultures can generate functional NC-like cells. The generated NC-like cells are highly homogenous regarding the expression of notochordal marker genes. A culture medium containing a cocktail of growth factors (FGF, EGF, VEGF and IGF-1) also supported the notochordal differentiation in the presence of NP matrix. The NC-like cells showed excellent functional differentiation ability to generate NP-like tissue which was rich in aggrecan and collagen type II; and particularly, the proteoglycan to collagen content ratio was as high as 12.5–17.5 which represents a phenotype close to NP rather than hyaline cartilage. Collectively, the present study confirmed the effectiveness and flexibility of using natural NP tissue matrix to direct notochordal differentiation of hiPSCs, and the potential of using the generated NC-like cells for treating IVD degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1963837125,"p-Aminobenzoic acid (pABA) plays important roles in a wide variety of metabolic processes. Herein we report the synthesis, theoretical calculations, crystallographic investigation, and in vitro determination of the biological activity and phytotoxicity of the pABA salt, 2-hydroxyethylammonium p-aminobenzoate (HEA-pABA). The ability of neutral and anionic forms of pABA to interact with TIR1 pocket was investigated by calculation of molecular electrostatic potential maps on the accessible surface area, docking experiments, Molecular Dynamics and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics calculations. The docking study of the folate precursor pABA, its anionic form and natural auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) with the auxin receptor TIR1 revealed a similar binding mode in the active site. The phytotoxic evaluation of HEA-pABA, pABA and 2-hydroxyethylamine (HEA) was performed on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col 0 at five different concentrations. HEA-pABA and pABA acted as potential auxin-like regulators of root development in Arabidopsis thaliana (0.1 and 0.2 mM) and displayed an agravitropic root response at high concentration (2 mM). This study suggests that HEA-pABA and pABA might be considered as potential new regulators of plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2047139104,"Low molecular mass hyaluronans are known to induce inflammation. To determine the role of the acetyl groups of low molecular mass hyaluronan in stimulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines, partial N-deacetylation was carried out by hydrazinolysis. This resulted in 19.7 ± 3.5% free NH2 functional groups, which were then acylated by reacting with an acyl anhydride, including acetic anhydride. Hydrazinolysis resulted in bond cleavage of the hyaluronan chain causing a reduction of the molecular mass to 30-214 kDa. The total NH2 and N-acetyl moieties in the reacetylated hyaluronan were 0% and 98.7 ± 1.5% respectively, whereas for butyrylated hyaluronan, the total NH2, N-acetyl, and N-butyryl moieties were 0, 82.2 ± 4.6, and 22.7 ± 3.8%, respectively, based on (1)H NMR. We studied the effect of these polymers on cytokine production by cultured human macrophages (THP-1 cells). The reacetylated hyaluronan stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production to levels similar to LPS, whereas partially deacetylated hyaluronan had no stimulatory effect, indicating the critical role of the N-acetyl groups in the stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. Butyrylated hyaluronan significantly reduced the stimulatory effect on cytokine production by the reacetylated hyaluronan or LPS but had no stimulatory effect of its own. The other partially N-acylated hyaluronan derivatives tested showed smaller stimulatory effects than reacetylated hyaluronan. Antibody and antagonist experiments suggest that the acetylated and partially butyrylated lower molecular mass hyaluronans exert their effects through the TLR-4 receptor system. Selectively N-butyrylated lower molecular mass hyaluronan shows promise as an example of a novel semisynthetic anti-inflammatory molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2065759966,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) has either tumor-suppressive roles or pro-tumor roles in different types of human tumors. A number of GSK3 targets in diverse signaling pathways have been uncovered, such as tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2 and β-catenin. The O subfamily of forkhead/winged helix transcription factors (FOXO) is known as tumor suppressors that induce apoptosis. In this study, we find that FOXO binds to type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) promoter and stimulates its transcription. GSK3 positively regulates the transactivation activity of FOXO and stimulates IGF-IR expression. Although kinase-dead GSK3β cannot up-regulate IGF-IR, the constitutively active GSK3β induces IGF-IR expression in a FOXO-dependent manner. Serum starvation or Akt inhibition leads to an increase in IGF-IR expression, which could be blunted by GSK3 inhibition. GSK3β knockdown or GSK3 inhibitor suppresses IGF-I-induced IGF-IR, Akt, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, knockdown of GSK3β or FOXO1/3/4 leads to a decrease in cellular proliferation and abrogates IGF-I-induced hepatoma cell proliferation.

These results suggest that GSK3 and FOXO may positively regulate IGF-I signaling and hepatoma cell proliferation. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) was originally identified as a serine/threonine protein kinase that could phosphorylate and inactivate glycogen synthase, the final enzyme of glycogen biosynthesis (1.Cohen P. Frame S. The renaissance of GSK3.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Besides glucose homeostasis, GSK3 plays important roles in a variety of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, microtubule dynamics, cell cycle, and apoptosis (2.Frame S. Cohen P. GSK3 takes centre stage more than 20 years after its discovery.Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). It is known that GSK3 has diverse roles in a variety of human diseases, including diabetes, inflammation, neurological disorders, and cancer (3.Luo J. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in tumorigenesis and cancer chemotherapy.Cancer Lett. 2009; 273: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The mammalian GSK3 family consists of two members, namely GSK3α and GSK3β. In addition to regulating glycogen metabolism, GSK-3 has been implicated in the regulation of glucose transport. Activation of GSK3 leads to a decrease in glucose transporter 1 expression and glucose uptake (4.Buller C.L. Loberg R.D. Fan M.H. Zhu Q. Park J.L. Vesely E. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Brosius 3rd, F.C.

Whereas phosphorylation at tyrosine 216 in GSK3β or tyrosine 279 in GSK3α enhances the kinase activity of GSK3, phosphorylation of serine 9 in GSK3β or serine 21 in GSK3α significantly decreases its enzymatic activity (5.Jope R.S. Yuskaitis C.J. Beurel E. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3): inflammation, diseases, and therapeutics.Neurochem. Res. 2007; 32: 577-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The best characterized upstream kinase that inactivates GSK3β through phosphorylation of its N terminus at Ser-9 is Akt/PKB (6.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 by insulin mediated by protein kinase B.Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4374) Google Scholar). In addition, protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) are known to phosphorylate Ser-9 of GSK3β in a context-dependent manner (7.Frame S. Cohen P.

Phosphorylation by GSK3 may either positively or negatively regulates its downstream substrates. GSK3 has been found to regulate the proteolysis of an increasing number of proteins. For example, casein kinase I phosphorylation of β-catenin primes it for subsequent GSK3β phosphorylation at multiple sites at the N terminus, leading to the recognition by β-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase and rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome (10.Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Control of β-catenin phosphorylation/degradation by a dual-kinase mechanism.Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Also, phosphorylation by GSK3 induces both activation and degradation of MafA, SRC-3, and BCL-3 (11.Han S.I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K.

Previous studies indicate that GSK3β is a double-edged sword in tumorigenesis. Both GSK3β inhibition and activation may drive tumor progression, depending on the cell type. Although GSK3β promotes tumorigenesis in some cancer types such as pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and leukemia, it inhibits tumor growth in breast cancer and skin cancer (15.Ougolkov A.V.

Kinase-inactive glycogen synthase kinase 3β promotes Wnt signaling and mammary tumorigenesis.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5792-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The inactivation of GSK3β has been detected in some cancer types, such as skin, breast, lung cancer, and melanoma, but is absent in gastrointestinal cancer, hepatic cancer, and pancreatic cancer (20.Kang T. Wei Y. Honaker Y. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Hung M.C. Piwnica-Worms H. GSK-3β targets Cdc25A for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and GSK-3β inactivation correlates with Cdc25A overproduction in human cancers.Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 36-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the pleiotrophic effects of GSK3β may be attributable to its central role in diverse signaling pathways such as Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways (21.Woodgett J.R. Can a two-faced kinase be exploited for osteosarcoma?.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2012; 104: 722-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Whereas GSK3 targets β-catenin, a key mediator in the Wnt pathway, for proteasomal degradation, thereby antagonizing Wnt signaling, it targets IκB, a repressor of NF-κB, for degradation, thereby promoting NF-κB activation. Besides GSK3β, the O subfamily of Forkhead/winged helix transcription factors (FOXO) is another downstream substrate of Akt, a key signaling node in multiple signal transduction pathways, including insulin signaling, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, and epidermal growth factor signaling. FOXO proteins are phylogenetically conserved and regulate key physiological functions, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and survival (22.Huang H. Tindall D.J. Dynamic FoxO transcription factors.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2479-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Similar to GSK3, phosphorylation of FOXO by Akt leads to inactivation of FOXO. FOXOs activate transcription of the cell cycle inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21Cip1/WAF1, although they repress transcription of the cell cycle activators cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 (23.Kloet D.E. Burgering B.M. The PKB/FOXO switch in aging and cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1813: 1926-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). FOXO also activates the cell cycle inhibitor cyclin G2 (24.Martínez-Gac L. Marqués M. García Z. Campanero M.R. Carrera A.C. Control of cyclin G2 mRNA expression by Forkhead transcription factors: Novel mechanism for cell cycle control by phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Forkhead.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2181-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, insulin and IGF-I have been reported to down-regulate the expression of cyclin G2 as part of their mitogenic effect (25.Svendsen A.M. Winge S.B. Zimmermann M. Lindvig A.B. Warzecha C.B. Sajid W. Horne M.C. De Meyts P. Down-regulation of cyclin G2 by insulin, IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor 1) and X10 (AspB10 insulin): role in mitogenesis.Biochem. J. 2014; 457: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Hence, FOXOs are considered as tumor suppressors. However, signaling downstream of FOXO is both cell type-specific and tissue-specific. FOXOs are lineage-restricted redundant tumor suppressors (26.Paik J.H. Kollipara R. Chu G. Ji H. Xiao Y. Ding Z. Miao L. Tothova Z. Horner J.W. Carrasco D.R. Jiang S. Gilliland D.G. Chin L. Wong W.H.

FoxOs are lineage-restricted redundant tumor suppressors and regulate endothelial cell homeostasis.Cell. 2007; 128: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Although many studies indicate that FOXOs are bona fide tumor suppressors, recent studies demonstrate that they have roles in promoting tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Depletion of FOXO3 reduced G1/S transition and cell proliferation in MCF7 breast cancer cells and H1299 lung cancer cells (27.Zhang Y. Xing Y. Zhang L. Mei Y. Yamamoto K. Mak T.W. You H.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5717-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Elevated FOXO3 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia exhibiting normal cytogenetics, and genetic ablation of FOXO3 reduces disease burden in a murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia (28.Santamaría C.M.

Another recent study has revealed that FOXO inhibition triggers myeloid cell maturation and acute myeloid leukemia cell death (30.Sykes S.M. Lane S.W. Bullinger L. Kalaitzidis D. Yusuf R. Saez B.

FOXOs promote survival of hematopoietic cells after DNA damage (31.Lei H. Quelle F.W. FOXO transcription factors enforce cell cycle checkpoints and promote survival of hematopoietic cells after DNA damage.Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, FOXOs up-regulate BCL-10 and activate NF-κB, thereby promoting survival of tumor cells under serum starvation (32.Li Z. Zhang H. Chen Y. Fan L. Fang J. Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a protein activates nuclear factor κB through B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) protein and promotes tumor cell survival in serum deprivation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 17737-17745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GSK3β positively regulates FOXO1 activity through direct binding to FOXO1 (33.Sakamaki J. Daitoku H. Kaneko Y. Hagiwara A. Ueno K. Fukamizu A. GSK3β regulates gluconeogenic gene expression through HNF4α and FOXO1.J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 2012; 32: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Insulin and IGF signaling can induce Akt-mediated GSK3β and FOXO phosphorylation, resulting in the inactivation of GSK3β and FOXO. Even though GSK3 is a well known downstream target of IGF-IR, 2The abbreviations used are: IGF-IRtype I insulin-like growth factor receptormTORmammalian target of rapamycin. it remains unclear whether GSK3β controls upstream elements governing IGF-IR signaling. Here, we report that GSK3 positively regulates IGF-IR expression. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by activation of FOXO transcription factors that directly bind to the IGF-IR promoter. Inhibition of GSK3 leads to a decrease in IGF-I-induced Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cellular proliferation. Together, these findings provide a mechanism whereby GSK3β enhances IGF-I signaling in hepatoma cells. type I insulin-like growth factor receptor mammalian target of rapamycin. LiCl was purchased from Sigma. IGF-I was purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ) and prepared by reconstituting in deionized water to the appropriate concentration and stored at −20 °C. The anti-IGF-IR, anti-FOXO1, anti-FOXO3, anti-FOXO4, anti-Akt, anti-ERK1/2, anti-HA, anti-phosphorylated IGF-IR (Tyr-1135), anti-phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473), and anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Another FOXO1 antibody for chromatin immunoprecipitation was from Abcam Ltd. (Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong). Anti-GSK3 antibody was purchased from Signalway Antibody LLc (Baltimore, MD). Anti-phosphorylated GSK3β (Ser-9) was purchased from Eptomics (Burlingame, CA). Anti-actin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Hepatoma cancer cell lines HepG2 and SMMC-7721 were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% newborn calf serum and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Culture medium was changed every 2 days. The two target sequences for GSK3β knockdown are as follows: 1, GATCTGTCTTGAAGGAGAA; 2, ATAGTCCGATTGCGTTATT. The target sequences for FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 knockdown are GAGCGTGCCCTACTTCAAG, CAACCTGTCACTGCATAGT, and AGAAGCCGATATGTGGACC, respectively. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) against GSK3β and a negative control siRNA were provided by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). The siRNA against FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 are provided by GenePharma Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Proliferating cells in 6-well plates were incubated with 50 nm siRNA in 2 ml of OPTI-MEM® I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) containing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed with cold RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors for 30 min. 30 μg of protein was loaded into Tris-HCl-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA in TBST, followed by incubating with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing the membrane in TBST three to four times, the membrane was incubated with appropriate HRP-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was detected with chemifluorescent reagent. Total RNAs were extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNAs were synthesized using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers. GSK3β and IGF-IR were amplified by real time PCR using the SYBR® Select Master Mix (Invitrogen), and the total volume was 20 μl. β-Actin was also amplified as a reference gene. The primer sequences for human GSK3β were 5′-CTCCTCATGCTCGGATTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCAGAAGCAGCATTATTGG-3′ (reverse). The primer sequences for human IGF-IR were 5′-AATCGCATCATCATAACCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATCCTGCCCATCATACTC-3′ (reverse). Relative quantification with the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) was done using the Ct method. The amount of GSK3β or IGF-IR gene normalized to the endogenous reference gene (β-actin) is given by 2− ΔCt, where ΔCt is Ct (GSK3β or IGF-IR) −Ct (β-actin). ChIP assays were performed with the chromatin immunoprecipitation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Briefly, cells were fixed with formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with 1× cold PBS containing proteinase inhibitor mixture II, the cells were scraped and lysed with cell lysis buffer and nuclear lysis buffer, and then the DNA was broken into pieces 200–1,000 bp in length by sonication. Soluble chromatin was co-immunoprecipitated with antibody against FOXO1 or IgG at 4 °C overnight. The de-cross-linked DNA samples were subjected to PCR. HepG2 or SMMC-7721 cells were seeded in six-well plates. After treatment with lithium chloride (LiCl) or transfection with siRNA or GSK3 plasmids, the cells were transfected with a total of 320 ng of FOXO-responsive luciferase construct (Addgene Inc., Cambridge, MA) per well mixed with the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested with 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega BioSciences, San Luis Obispo, CA). Luciferase activities were measured using the Promega luciferase assay kit. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5000 cells per well. Twenty four hours later, the cells were treated with or without LiCl (5 mm) or siRNA, followed by treating with or without 5 nm IGF-I. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 50 μm EdU medium for 2 h. Next, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and incubated with 2 mg/ml glycine for 10 min. Following permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, the cells were incubated in Apollo® 567 working solution for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with 1× Hoechst 33342 for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the cells with PBS three times, the cells were observed under fluorescence microscope. To determine whether GSK3 regulates IGF-IR expression, we treated hepatoma cells HepG2 with LiCl, a GSK3 inhibitor, and then detected IGF-IR levels by Western blotting. Treatment of HepG2 with LiCl led to a decrease in IGF-IR expression (Fig. 1A). Similar results were detected in another hepatoma cell line, SMMC-7721 (Fig. 1A). In addition, transfection of siRNA against GSK3β (siGSK3β) into both HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells resulted in decreased IGF-IR levels (Fig. 1B). Similar results were detected in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells transfected with another siRNA against GSK3β (siGSK3β#2) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, GSK3α knockdown resulted in decreased IGF-IR expression to a much lesser extent than GSK3β depletion (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the next studies focus on GSK3β. Consistent with above-mentioned findings, overexpression of the constitutively active GSK3β (K85A) mutant in hepatoma cells led to an increase in IGF-IR expression, although overexpression of the kinase-dead GSK3β (S9A) mutant did not affect IGF-IR expression (Fig. 1D). To determine whether GSK3β regulates IGF-IR expression at the transcription level, we treated hepatoma cells with LiCl and then detected IGF-IR mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR. Treatment of hepatoma cells with LiCl led to a decrease in IGF-IR transcription (Fig. 1E). GSK3β knockdown also reduced IGF-IR transcription (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that GSK3β positively regulates IGF-IR expression. Although IGF-IR is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells, little is known how IGF-IR expression is regulated. Bioinformatic analysis of the IGF-IR promoter indicates that there are two potential FOXO-binding sites (site 1, −1460TTGTTTTC−1453; site 2, −981TTGTTTAC−974) within the promoter of IGF-IR (34.Xuan Z. Zhang M.Q. From worm to human: bioinformatics approaches to identify FOXO target genes.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previous study also demonstrated that knockdown of FOXO, especially FOXO3, abrogated Akt inhibitor-induced IGF-IR expression in breast cancer cells (35.Chandarlapaty S. Sawai A. Scaltriti M. Rodrik-Outmezguine V. Grbovic-Huezo O. Serra V. Majumder P.K. Baselga J. Rosen N. AKT inhibition relieves feedback suppression of receptor tyrosine kinase expression and activity.Cancer Cell. 2011; 19: 58-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether FOXO directly binds to IGF-IR promoter. To determine whether FOXO directly binds to these potential sites, we took advantage of CHIP analysis. We designed two pairs of primers to amplify DNA sequences spanning two potential FOXO-binding sites and one pair of primer to amplify an irrelevant sequence. The chromosome DNA immunoprecipitated by anti-FOXO1 antibody, and IgG was subjected to PCR with three pairs of primers indicated in Fig. 2A. The results demonstrated that FOXO1 binds to the site more close to the transcription start site (−981TTGTTTAC−973) (Fig. 2A). To determine whether FOXO regulates IGF-IR expression in hepatoma cells, we transfected HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells with siRNA to FOXO1, FOXO3, or FOXO4, followed by Western blot analysis of IGF-IR expression. FOXO1, FOXO3, or FOXO4 knockdown led to a decrease in IGF-IR expression in both HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). These data demonstrate that FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 activate IGF-IR expression. To ensure that GSK3 regulates FOXO activity in hepatoma cells, we transfected FOXO-luc into HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, followed by treatment with LiCl and detection of luciferase activity. LiCl significantly inhibited the transactivation activity of FOXO in both HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells (Fig. 3A). In addition, GSK3β knockdown resulted in a decrease in the transactivation activity of FOXO (Fig. 3B). A similar effect was detected in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells transfected with siGSK3β#2 (Fig. 3C). Consistent with above-mentioned findings, overexpression of HA-tagged constitutively active GSK3β in SMMC-7721 cells led to an increase in the transactivation activity of FOXO, although overexpression of HA-tagged kinase-dead GSK3β did not affect the transactivation activity of FOXO (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that GSK3β positivity regulate FOXO activity in hepatoma cells. To determine whether FOXO mediated the effect of GSK3β on IGF-IR expression, we transfected constitutively active GSK3β into SMMC-7721 cells, followed by transfection with siRNA to FOXO1/3/4 or control siRNA and Western blotting analysis of IGF-IR expression. Overexpression of active GSK3β increased IGF-IR expression. FOXO1/3/4 knockdown abrogated the induction of IGF-IR expression by active GSK3β (Fig. 3E). These data demonstrate that GSK3β stimulates IGF-IR expression through a FOXO-dependent mechanism. Because serum starvation could lead to the derepression of GSK3β, we detected the effects of serum starvation on IGF-IR expression. Upon serum starvation, a decrease in GSK3β phosphorylation and an increase in IGF-IR expression were detected in both HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells (Fig. 4A). To determine whether serum starvation leads to changes in IGF-IR transcription, we detected levels of IGF-IR mRNA in serum-starved cells by real time RT-PCR. Serum starvation led to increased IGF-IR transcription in both HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells (Fig. 4B). To determine whether GSK3β contributes to increased IGF-IR expression in response to serum starvation, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were treated with or without LiCl, followed by serum starvation. Treatment of HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells with LiCl abrogated the induction of IGF-IR expression by serum starvation (Fig. 4C). GSK3β knockdown also abrogated the induction of IGF-IR expression by serum starvation (Fig. 4D). Next, we detected the effect of serum starvation on the transactivation activity of FOXO. Serum starvation resulted in a significant increase in the transactivation activity of FOXO in both HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells (Fig. 4E). Treatment with LiCl inhibited the increase in the transactivation activity of FOXO (Fig. 4E). GSK3β knockdown also blunted the stimulation of FOXO activity by serum starvation (Fig. 4F). Moreover, FOXO1/3/4 knockdown abrogated the induction of IGF-IR expression by serum starvation (Fig. 4G). These data demonstrate that the GSK3β-FOXO axis contributes to the induction of IGF-IR expression by serum starvation. Akt can phosphorylate and inactivate both GSK3 and FOXO. We found that treatment of hepatoma cells with Akt inhibitor resulted in an increase in IGF-IR expression (Fig. 5A). Treatment of hepatoma cells with LiCl abrogated the increase in IGF-IR expression in response to Akt inhibition (Fig. 5B). The above-mentioned data demonstrate that GSK3β positively regulates IGF-IR expression. To determine the effects of GSK3β on IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR and its downstream effectors, including ERK1/2 and Akt, HepG2 cells were pretreated with or without LiCl, followed by treating with or without IGF-I. Cell lysates were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis of the phosphorylation of IGF-IR, ERK1/2, and Akt. The results demonstrated that LiCl inhibited IGF-IR expression and IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR, ERK1/2, and Akt (Fig. 6A). Similar results were detected in SMMC-7721 cells (Fig. 6A). In addition, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were transfected with or without siRNA against GSK3β, followed by treating with or without IGF-I. Cell lysates were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis of the phosphorylation of IGF-IR, ERK1/2, and Akt. GSK3β knockdown led to a decrease in IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR, ERK1/2, and Akt in both cell lines (Fig. 6B). Similar effects were detected in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells transfected with siGSK3β#2 (Fig. 6C). Collectively"

Determining the emergence and nature of mucosal HIV-specific immune responses in such women is important, since these responses may contribute to protection and could provide insight for the rational design of HIV-1 vaccines.We first conducted a pilot study to compare three sampling devices (Dacron swabs, flocked nylon swabs and Merocel sponges) for detection of HIV-1-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in vaginal secretions. IgG antibodies from HIV-1-positive women reacted broadly across the full panel of eight HIV-1 envelope (Env) antigens tested, whereas IgA antibodies only reacted to the gp41 subunit. No Env-reactive antibodies were detected in the HIV-negative women. The three sampling devices yielded equal HIV-1-specific antibody titers, as well as total IgG and IgA concentrations. We then tested vaginal Dacron swabs archived from 57 HIV seronegative women who participated in a microbicide efficacy trial in Southern Africa (HPTN 035). We detected vaginal IgA antibodies directed at HIV-1 Env gp120/gp140 in six of these women, and at gp41 in another three women, but did not detect Env-specific IgG antibodies in any women.Vaginal secretions of HIV-1 infected women contained IgG reactivity to a broad range of Env antigens and IgA reactivity to gp41. In contrast, Env-binding antibodies in the vaginal secretions of HIV-1 uninfected women participating in the microbicide trial were restricted to the IgA subtype and were mostly directed at HIV-1 gp120/gp140."
https://openalex.org/W2077627382,"Long interspersed element 1 (L1) is a retroelement constituting ∼17% of the human genome. A single human cell has 80-100 copies of L1 capable of retrotransposition (L1-RTP), ∼10% of which are ""hot L1"" copies, meaning they are primed for ""jumping"" within the genome. Recent studies demonstrated induction of L1 activity by drugs of abuse or low molecular weight compounds, but little is known about the underlying mechanism. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism and effects of methamphetamine (METH) and cocaine on L1-RTP. Our results revealed that METH and cocaine induced L1-RTP in neuronal cell lines. This effect was found to be reverse transcriptase-dependent. However, METH and cocaine did not induce double-strand breaks. RNA interference experiments combined with add-back of siRNA-resistant cDNAs revealed that the induction of L1-RTP by METH or cocaine depends on the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). METH or cocaine recruited the L1-encoded open reading frame 1 (ORF1) to chromatin in a CREB-dependent manner. These data suggest that the cellular cascades underlying METH- and cocaine-induced L1-RTP are different from those behind L1-RTP triggered by DNA damage; CREB is involved in drug-induced L1-RTP. L1-RTP caused by drugs of abuse is a novel type of genomic instability, and analysis of this phenomenon might be a novel approach to studying substance-use disorders."

This severe disease is characterized by neurological disorders, hemorrhagic lesions, and frequent fatal outcomes. Stx2e consists of an enzymatically active A subunit and five B subunits that bind to a specific glycolipid receptor on host cells. It is evident that antibodies binding to the A subunit or the B subunits of Shiga toxin variants may have the capability to inhibit their cytotoxicity. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a VHH single domain antibody (nanobody) isolated from a llama phage display library that confers potent neutralizing capacity against Stx2e toxin. We further present the crystal structure of the complex formed between the nanobody (NbStx2e1) and the Stx2e toxoid, determined at 2.8 Å resolution. Structural analysis revealed that for each B subunit of Stx2e, one NbStx2e1 is interacting in a head-to-head orientation and directly competing with the glycolipid receptor binding site on the surface of the B subunit. The neutralizing NbStx2e1 can in the future be used to prevent or treat edema disease. Shiga toxin Stx2e is the major known agent that causes edema disease in newly weaned pigs. This severe disease is characterized by neurological disorders, hemorrhagic lesions, and frequent fatal outcomes. Stx2e consists of an enzymatically active A subunit and five B subunits that bind to a specific glycolipid receptor on host cells. It is evident that antibodies binding to the A subunit or the B subunits of Shiga toxin variants may have the capability to inhibit their cytotoxicity. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a VHH single domain antibody (nanobody) isolated from a llama phage display library that confers potent neutralizing capacity against Stx2e toxin. We further present the crystal structure of the complex formed between the nanobody (NbStx2e1) and the Stx2e toxoid, determined at 2.8 Å resolution. Structural analysis revealed that for each B subunit of Stx2e, one NbStx2e1 is interacting in a head-to-head orientation and directly competing with the glycolipid receptor binding site on the surface of the B subunit. The neutralizing NbStx2e1 can in the future be used to prevent or treat edema disease. Shiga toxin Stx2e-producing strains of Escherichia coli are the major cause of edema disease (ED) 5The abbreviations used are: EDedema diseaseBistris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneSPRsurface plasmon resonanceCDRcomplementarity-determining region. in newly weaned piglets. This is a disease that is highly contagious and leads to neurological disorders, hemorrhagic lesions, and frequent fatal outcome (1.Gyles C.L. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli: an overview.J.

The A subunit confers N-glycosidase activity that specifically cleaves an adenosine base in the 28 S rRNA of the 60 S ribosomal subunits, inhibiting protein synthesis in target cells. The B subunits of Stx2e, on the other hand, bind to the glycolipid receptor, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), or preferentially to globotetraosylceramide (Gb4) (4.DeGrandis S. Law H. Brunton J. Gyles C.

The high mortality rate in Stx2e-producing E. coli-infected pigs has had dire economic consequences for the swine industry. To date, no vaccine or effective therapeutic agent is available for the treatment of ED, and the standard treatment is the use of antibiotics. However, excessive use of antibiotics and the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant porcine Stx2e-producing E. coli isolates are of increasing concern, underscoring the urgent need to develop new therapeutic approaches. Recently, an immunoprophylaxis approach, where piglets and sows were immunized with a genetically inactivated Stx2e (Stx2e toxoid), showed promising results (5.Oanh T.K. Nguyen V.K. De Greve H. Goddeeris B.M. Protection of piglets against Edema disease by maternal immunization with Stx2e toxoid.Infect. Immun. 2012; 80: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunized piglets and pregnant sows were protected against Stx2e toxin challenge. Moreover, immunized pregnant sows provide high levels of passive antibodies in piglets (5.Oanh T.K. Nguyen V.K.

It has been shown that antibodies binding to the A subunit or the B subunits of Shiga toxin variants have the capability to inhibit their cytotoxicity (6.Nakao H. Kiyokawa N. Fujimoto J. Yamasaki S.

Despite the promising preclinical and early clinical results, there are several considerations to be taken into account in the development and application of these mAbs, including the difficulty and the high cost of optimization and production of mAbs, the mode and timing of delivery of mAbs, and whether they are likely to mitigate or alter the outcome of the diseases. The promising preclinical and early clinical results of these mAbs have spurred significant interest to exploit VHH single domain antibodies (nanobodies) (13.Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Naturally occurring antibodies devoid of light chains.Nature. 1993; 363: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) derived from camelids that possess significant advantages over conventional antibodies. While conferring high affinity and antigen specificity, the relative smaller size of the nanobodies, their high stability and solubility, and their easy and cost-effective production make them a propitious therapeutic agent (14.Muyldermans S. Nanobodies: natural single-domain antibodies.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 775-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Moreover, the amenability of nanobodies as multivalent molecules that recognize a number of targets has significant therapeutic applications (14.Muyldermans S. Nanobodies: natural single-domain antibodies.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 775-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent study has identified nanobodies that neutralize Shiga toxin variant Stx1 and/or Stx2 (15.Tremblay J.M. Mukherjee J. Leysath C.E. Debatis M. Ofori K. Baldwin K. Boucher C. Peters R. Beamer G. Sheoran A. Bedenice D. Tzipori S. Shoemaker C.B. A single VHH-based toxin neutralizing agent and an effector antibody protects mice against challenge with Shiga toxins 1 and 2.Infect. Immun. 2013; 81: 4592-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This study further showed that fusing multiple nanobodies that recognize the Stx1/2 B subunits results in a potent cross-specific nanobody that confers protection in mice against Shiga toxin challenge (15.Tremblay J.M. Mukherjee J. Leysath C.E. Debatis M. Ofori K. Baldwin K. Boucher C. Peters R. Beamer G. Sheoran A. Bedenice D. Tzipori S. Shoemaker C.B. A single VHH-based toxin neutralizing agent and an effector antibody protects mice against challenge with Shiga toxins 1 and 2.Infect. Immun. 2013; 81: 4592-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanism of inhibition of this nanobody, however, remains to be established. In this study, we described the identification and characterization of a potent Stx2e-neutralizing nanobody, NbStx2e1, and further elucidated the structural basis for its mechanism of neutralization. The co-complex structure uncovers atomic details of the NbStx2e1 paratope-epitope interactions and further shows that the neutralization of Stx2e cytotoxicity by NbStx2e1 is achieved by direct interaction with the Stx2e B subunit binding site for glycolipid, thereby impeding toxin-host cell receptor contacts. The construction, expression, and purification of Stx2e toxin and toxoid (with mutations at two amino acid positions (Y77S and E167Q) in the active site of the A subunit) were as described previously by Oanh et al. (5.Oanh T.K. Nguyen V.K. De Greve H. Goddeeris B.M. Protection of piglets against Edema disease by maternal immunization with Stx2e toxoid.Infect. Immun. 2012; 80: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For Stx2, total genomic DNA from E. coli strain C600 (933W) (16.Strockbine N.A. Jackson M.P. Sung L.M. Holmes R.K. O'Brien A.D. Cloning and sequencing of the genes for Shiga toxin from Shigella dysenteriae type 1.J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as template to amplify the stx2 operon with primers Stx2-2 (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAATGCCTCAGTCATTATTAAACTGCACTTC-3′) and Stx2-3 (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAGGTGCTGATTACTTCAGCCAAAAG-3′). The resulting PCR fragment was cloned in the pDONR221 vector using the BP reaction (Gateway Technology, Invitrogen) and transformed in CaCl2-competent DH5α cells. Transformants were selected on LB medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and sequenced with the primers SeqLA and SeqLB (5.Oanh T.K. Nguyen V.K. De Greve H. Goddeeris B.M. Protection of piglets against Edema disease by maternal immunization with Stx2e toxoid.Infect. Immun. 2012; 80: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) located in the pDONR221. A positive clone, pHD983, was selected to introduce the stx2 operon into the expression vector pDEST14 (Gateway Technology, Invitrogen) using the LR reaction yielding pHD914. The clone harboring pHD914 was induced at 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C. Cells were collected and suspended in PBS. The cell suspension was disrupted by sonication, and crude extract of Stx2 was clarified by centrifugation. All animal vaccination experiments were executed in strict accordance with good animal practices, following the European Union animal welfare legislation and after approval of the local ethical committee (Committee for the Use of Laboratory Animals at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel). Every effort was made to minimize animal suffering. A llama was immunized six times with 330 μg of purified Stx2e toxoid over a period of 6 weeks. From the anti-coagulated blood of the immunized llama, lymphocytes were used to prepare cDNAs that served as a template to amplify the open reading frames coding for the variable domains of the heavy chain antibodies. The PCR fragments, encoding the open reading frames of the nanobodies, were ligated into the pMES4 (GenBankTM accession number GQ907248) phage display vector and transformed in E. coli TG1 cells (17.Pardon E. Laeremans T. Triest S. Rasmussen S.G. Wohlkönig A. Ruf A. Muyldermans S. Hol W.G. Kobilka B.K. Steyaert J. A general protocol for the generation of Nanobodies for structural biology.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 674-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The selection of Stx2e-specific nanobodies was performed by phage display. After selection, phages were eluted by incubating the Stx2e-coated wells with 100 mm triethylamine (pH 10) for 10 min. The Stx2e-coated wells were then washed once with Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and several times with PBS, and freshly grown TG1 cells were added to the wells to recover the non-eluted phages. After two rounds of panning, 90 individual colonies were selected and grown in 2× TY medium supplemented with ampicillin and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for expression of soluble periplasmic nanobodies. The periplasmic extract was subjected to ELISA to assess the presence of nanobodies recognizing purified Stx2e toxoid. Nanobodies were expressed and purified as described previously by Conrath et al. (18.Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frère J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. β-Lactamase inhibitors derived from single-domain antibody fragments elicited in the camelidae.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli strain WK6 harboring plasmid encoding a nanobody bearing a C-terminal His tag was grown at 37 °C in lysogeny broth (LB) medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were induced at A600 nm of 0.9 with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 28 °C overnight, and the nanobody was isolated by periplasmic extraction of cells. Nanobodies were purified using a HisTrap FF (Fast Flow) column (GE Healthcare) and subjected to a 20 mm to 1 m imidazole linear gradient in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing the nanobody, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C. The purity of the isolated nanobodies was assessed in SDS-PAGE. To assess the interaction of nanobodies with Stx2e toxoid, Nunc MaxiSorpTM flat-bottom 96-well plates (eBioscience) were coated with purified Stx2e toxoid at 2 μg/ml suspended in coating buffer (NaHCO3 at pH 8.4). The wells were washed three times with PBST (PBS and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20) and blocked with 2% skimmed milk in PBS. A serial dilution of nanobodies was performed with a starting concentration for each nanobody of 20 μg/ml. The interaction of nanobodies with Stx2e toxoid was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-histidine tag antibody (AbD Serotec) followed by alkaline phosphate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). The reaction was developed in the presence of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma), and absorbance was read at 405 nm. The Stx2e toxin-neutralizing activity of nanobodies was assessed in a Vero cell-based assay, as described previously (5.Oanh T.K. Nguyen V.K. De Greve H. Goddeeris B.M. Protection of piglets against Edema disease by maternal immunization with Stx2e toxoid.Infect. Immun. 2012; 80: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-fold serial dilutions of nanobodies in PBS were performed with a starting concentration of 500 ng/ml and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of an equal volume of purified Stx2e toxin at a predetermined dilution (2 ng/ml). The Stx2e toxin/nanobody mixtures were added to wells of a 96-well plate (Falcon BD) containing a confluent culture of Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. After a 1-day incubation in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 environment), medium was removed, and the remaining cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Cells were then stained with 0.13% (w/v) crystal violet dissolved in 5% ethanol, 0.2% formaldehyde, PBS for 5 min. Cells were washed six times with water. Cell-adsorbed crystal violet was extracted in 200 μl of 50% ethanol plus PBS, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm. Nanobody-only and toxin-only controls were included in the assays. The results were expressed as percentage viability compared with that of control Vero cells in the presence of nanobody without toxin (100% viability) and with toxin only (0% viability). The IC50 values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism. SPR experiments were carried out using a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare). The surface of a CM5 sensor chip was activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.4 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride. After activation of the surface the Stx2e toxin (20 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 3 was injected to flow cell 2 (FC2) to be immobilized on the sensor surface via primary amine groups present on Stx2e. As a control the surface of FC1 was activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. Residual unreacted active ester groups were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.5. NbStx2e1 was flowed over the chip surface with concentrations ranging from 0.122 to 250 nm in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. Data were evaluated using the software BIAeval, and a Langmuir binding model with a 1:1 stoichiometry was fitted to the data, from which the rate constants kon and koff and the dissociation constant KD were obtained. The purified Stx2e toxoid was added to the purified NbStx2e1 in equimolar concentration and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The dialyzed sample was then subjected to HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) purification. Prior to loading the sample onto the column, 1 m NaCl was added and then subjected to a 20 mm to 1 m imidazole linear gradient in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing the Stx2e toxoid-NbStx2e1 complex, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl. The complex was concentrated to 12 mg/ml. Crystallization of Stx2e toxoid-NbStx2e1 complex was achieved at 20 °C by vapor diffusion with 0.5-μl sitting drops and a complex/well solution (0.5 m succinic acid, pH 7.0, 0.1 m Bistris propane, pH 7.0) ratio of 1:1 (v/v). Single-crystal x-ray wavelength diffraction data were collected at 0.98-Å wavelength at the Diamond Light Source beamline I24. Data were indexed and processed to 2.82 Å resolution using XDS (19.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38551) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The crystals belonged to the P 21 21 2 space group containing one Stx2e molecule and five NbStx2e1 molecules per asymmetric unit. Data were phased by molecular replacement (Phaser) (20.McCoy A.J.

The model was rebuilt and refined against the native data to 2.8 Å resolution using iterative cycles of the graphics program COOT (22.Emsley P. Cowtan K.

Open table in a new tab To obtain nanobodies that recognize Stx2e, a llama was immunized with purified Stx2e toxoid from Oanh et al. (5.Oanh T.K. Nguyen V.K. De Greve H. Goddeeris B.M. Protection of piglets against Edema disease by maternal immunization with Stx2e toxoid.Infect. Immun. 2012; 80: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The PCR fragments of the nanobody repertoire generated from the llama lymphocyte's cDNAs were cloned into the phage display vector pMES4 (17.Pardon E. Laeremans T. Triest S. Rasmussen S.G. Wohlkönig A. Ruf A. Muyldermans S. Hol W.G. Kobilka B.K. Steyaert J. A general protocol for the generation of Nanobodies for structural biology.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 674-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). A nanobody library of 2.5 × 107 transformants was obtained with an insert rate of at least 87% as determined by PCR. Eight Stx2e-recognizing nanobodies were identified through two successive rounds of panning. The experimental panning conditions were similar to those reported by Ghahroudi et al. (24.Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Selection and identification of single domain antibody fragments from camel heavy-chain antibodies.FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that these nanobodies belong to six unique families on the basis of differences in their complementarity-determining region CDR3 (Fig. 1). The production of selected nanobodies as soluble His-tagged proteins was achieved after transforming the corresponding pMES4 vector carrying the nanobody genes in E. coli WK6 cells. Periplasmic extract of nanobodies carrying a C-terminal His tag was purified by nickel-immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The produced nanobodies were found to be highly pure (>95%) as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The purified nanobodies were tested in ELISA to confirm their capability to recognize Stx2e toxoid. The ELISA results confirmed that all of the eight nanobodies recognized Stx2e toxoid at varying degrees in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Four of these nanobodies, NbStx2e1, NbStx2e2, NbStx2e3, and NbStx2e6, showed strong binding to Stx2e toxoid and were selected for further characterization. The capability of the selected Stx2e toxoid-recognizing nanobodies to neutralize Stx2e toxin was assessed in a Vero cell-based neutralization assay. Of the nanobodies tested, NbStx2e2 and NbStx2e3 showed a lack of neutralizing potency at concentrations lower than 500 ng/ml. NbStx2e1 conferred the most potent neutralizing capacity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 116 ng/ml (∼8 nm) (95% confidence interval: 99–136 ng/ml; R2 = 0.97) and followed by NbStx2e6 with an IC50 value of 265 ng/ml (21 nm) (95% confidence interval: 201–349 ng/ml; R2 = 0.96) (Fig. 3). The promising neutralizing potency of NbStx2e1 prompted further elucidation of the neutralization mechanism of Stx2e by NbStx2e1 using x-ray crystallography. For safety reasons and because of the need to produce protein in a large enough quantity for protein crystallography, we used Stx2e toxoid for the subsequent experiments. The complex between NbStx2e1 and the Stx2e toxoid was co-purified, and the structure was determined to a resolution of 2.8 Å (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows that Stx2e consists of a catalytic A subunit of 297 amino acids with N-glycosidase activity and a pentamer of B subunits (68 amino acids). The B subunit of Stx2e is essential to interact preferentially with the globotetraose (GalNAcβ1–3Galα1–4Galβ1–4Glc, Gb4) receptor, the latter present on the target cells as a glycolipid. The carboxyl end of the A subunit forms an α-helix that protrudes through the pore of the B-pentamer. In the earlier determined crystal structure of Stx2e, the last six residues of the A subunit of the Stx2e structure were disordered (3.Ling H. Pannu N.S. Boodhoo A. Armstrong G.D. Clark C.G. Brunton J.L. Read R.J.

In our crystal structure, only the last lysine residue from Stx2e remained undetectable in the electron density map, and it shows that the C-terminal part of the A subunit extends slightly outward from the B subunit pore (Fig. 4). Termination mutations introduced in two of the last six residues showed no effect on the proteolytic processing or enzymatic activity in Stx2 (25.Haddad J.E. al-Jaufy A.Y. Jackson M.P. Minimum domain of the Shiga toxin A subunit required for enzymatic activity.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4970-4978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the stretch of amino acid residues from position 242 to 258 of the A subunit of Stx2e is not visible in the electron density map. For each B subunit of Stx2e, one NbStx2e1 is interacting in a head-to-head orientation (Fig. 4) and directly competing with the glycolipid receptor binding site on the B subunits (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Binding of Stx2e to the cell surface is a crucial initial step in the cytotoxicity, and the interaction of Stx2e with the target receptors on host tissue is obstructed by the steric hindrance the NbStx2e1 nanobodies impose upon binding. Each NbStx2e1 molecule is involved only in interactions with one single B subunit. When examining the interaction surface in more detail, all three CDRs of NbStx2e1 provide affinity and specificity to the interaction with Stx2e (Fig. 5, A and B). On CDR1, the side chain of Arg-30 is forming hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asp-16 and Thr-18 of the Stx2e B subunit. In addition, the main chain oxygen atom of Arg-30 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn-31 of NbStx2e1. On the CDR2 loop, the main chain oxygen atom of Tyr"

The respective patterns of white matter damage in these syndromes have not been directly contrasted. Beyond cortical involvement, damage to white matter pathways may critically contribute to both common and specific symptoms in both conditions. Here we assessed patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia and corticobasal syndrome with whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging to identify the white matter networks underlying these pathologies. Twenty patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, 19 with corticobasal syndrome, and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Differences in tract integrity between (i) patients and controls, and (ii) patients with the corticobasal syndrome and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia were assessed with whole brain tract-based spatial statistics and analyses of regions of interest. Behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia and the corticobasal syndrome shared a pattern of bilaterally decreased white matter integrity in the anterior commissure, genu and body of the corpus callosum, corona radiata and in the long intrahemispheric association pathways. Patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia showed greater damage to the uncinate fasciculus, genu of corpus callosum and forceps minor. In contrast, corticobasal syndrome patients had greater damage to the midbody of the corpus callosum and perirolandic corona radiata. Whereas several compact white matter pathways were damaged in both the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia and corticobasal syndrome, the distribution and degree of white matter damage differed between them. These findings concur with the distinctive clinical manifestations of these conditions and may improve the in vivo neuroanatomical and diagnostic characterization of these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2033648825,"The post-lactational regression of mammary gland is a complex multi-step process designed to conserve the biological function of the gland for next pregnancy. This developmental stage is a biological intrigue with great relevance to breast cancer research, and thus has been the subject of intensive scrutiny. Multipronged studies (microarray, proteomics profiling, animal knock-out models) have provided a repertoire of genes critical to involution. However, the caveat of these approaches remains in their failure to reveal post-translational modification(s), an emerging and critical aspect of gene regulation in developmental processes and mammary gland remodeling. The massive surge in the lysosomal enzymes concurrent with the onset of involution has been known for decades, and considered essential for ""clearance"" purposes. However, functional significance of these enzymes in diverse biological processes distinct from their proteolytic activity is just emerging. Studies from our laboratory had indicated specific post-translational modifications of the aspartyl endopeptidase Cathepsin D (CatD) at distinct stages mammary gland development. This study addresses the biological significance of these modifications in the involution process, and reveals that post-translational modifications drive CatD into the nucleus to cleave Histone 3. The cleavage of Histone 3 has been associated with cellular differentiation and could be critical instigator of involution process. From functional perspective, deregulated expression and increased secretion of CatD are associated with aggressive and metastatic phenotype of breast cancer. Thus unraveling CatD's physiological functions in mammary gland development will bridge the present gap in understanding its pro-tumorigenic/metastatic functions, and assist in the generation of tailored therapeutic approaches."

Biophysical interactions between antifungal agents with glucose molecules were investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared, and 1H NMR. Glucose has a higher affinity to bind with voriconazole by hydrogen bonding and decrease the susceptibility of antifungal agents during chemotherapy. In addition to confirming the results observed in vitro, theoretical docking studies demonstrated that voriconazole presented three important hydrogen bonds and amphotericin B presented two hydrogen bonds that stabilized the glucose. In vivo results also suggest that the physiologically relevant higher glucose level in the bloodstream of diabetes mellitus mice might interact with the available selective agents during antifungal therapy, thus decreasing glucose activity by complex formation.

https://openalex.org/W2073541618,"Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) is caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene, which encodes for a putative lysosomal transmembrane protein with thus far undescribed structure and function. Here we investigate the membrane topology of human CLN3 protein with a combination of advanced molecular cloning, spectroscopy, and in silico computation. Using the transposomics cloning method we first created a library of human CLN3 cDNA clones either with a randomly inserted eGFP, a myc-tag, or both. The functionality of the clones was evaluated by assessing their ability to revert a previously reported lysosomal phenotype in immortalized cerebellar granular cells derived from Cln3Δex7/8 mice (CbCln3Δex7/8). The double-tagged clones were expressed in HeLa cells, and FRET was measured between the donor eGFP and an acceptor DyLight547 coupled to a monoclonal α-myc antibody to assess their relative membrane orientation. The data were used together with previously reported experimental data to compile a constrained membrane topology model for hCLN3 using TOPCONS consensus membrane prediction algorithm. Our model with six transmembrane domains and cytosolic N- and C-termini largely agrees with those previously suggested but differs in terms of the transmembrane domain positions as well as in the size of the luminal loops. This finding improves understanding the function of the native hCLN3 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2015298406,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play critical roles in the development and adult physiology of all metazoan organisms. Most of the known molecular interactions of HSPGs are attributed to the structurally highly complex heparan sulfate (HS) glycans. However, whether a specific HSPG (such as syndecan) contains HS modifications that differ from another HSPG (such as glypican) has remained largely unresolved. Here, a neural model in C. elegans is used to demonstrate for the first time the relationship between specific HSPGs and HS modifications in a defined biological process in vivo. HSPGs are critical for the migration of hermaphrodite specific neurons (HSNs) as genetic elimination of multiple HSPGs leads to 80% defect of HSN migration. The effects of genetic elimination of HSPGs are additive, suggesting that multiple HSPGs, present in the migrating neuron and in the matrix, act in parallel to support neuron migration. Genetic analyses suggest that syndecan/sdn-1 and HS 6-O-sulfotransferase, hst-6, function in a linear signaling pathway and glypican/lon-2 and HS 2-O-sulfotransferase, hst-2, function together in a pathway that is parallel to sdn-1 and hst-6. These results suggest core protein specific HS modifications that are critical for HSN migration. In C. elegans, the core protein specificity of distinct HS modifications may be in part regulated at the level of tissue specific expression of genes encoding for HSPGs and HS modifying enzymes. Genetic analysis reveals that there is a delicate balance of HS modifications and eliminating one HS modifying enzyme in a compromised genetic background leads to significant changes in the overall phenotype. These findings are of importance with the view of HS as a critical regulator of cell signaling in normal development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2102486129,"Organized flight of homing pigeons (Columba livia) was previously shown to rely on simple leadership rules between flock mates, yet the stability of this social structuring over time and across different contexts remains unclear. We quantified the repeatability of leadership-based flock structures within a flight and across multiple flights conducted with the same animals. We compared two contexts of flock composition: flocks of birds of the same age and flight experience; and, flocks of birds of different ages and flight experience. All flocks displayed consistent leadership-based structures over time, showing that individuals have stable roles in the navigational decisions of the flock. However, flocks of balanced age and flight experience exhibited reduced leadership stability, indicating that these factors promote flock structuring. Our study empirically demonstrates that leadership and followership are consistent behaviours in homing pigeon flocks, but such consistency is affected by the heterogeneity of individual flight experiences and/or age. Similar evidence from other species suggests leadership as an important mechanism for coordinated motion in small groups of animals with strong social bonds."

This investigation focused on developing this ultrasound modality as an imaging-based non-invasive method that can be used to monitor therapeutic ultrasound and radiation effects. High-frequency (25 MHz) ultrasound was used to image tumor responses caused by ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles in combination with radiation. Human prostate xenografts grown in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were treated using 8, 80, or 1000 µL/kg of microbubbles stimulated with ultrasound at 250, 570, or 750 kPa, and exposed to 0, 2, or 8 Gy of radiation. Tumors were imaged prior to treatment and 24 hours after treatment. Spectral analysis of images acquired from treated tumors revealed overall increases in ultrasound backscatter intensity and the spectral intercept parameter. The increase in backscatter intensity compared to the control ranged from 1.9±1.6 dB for the clinical imaging dose of microbubbles (8 µL/kg, 250 kPa, 2 Gy) to 7.0±4.1 dB for the most extreme treatment condition (1000 µL/kg, 750 kPa, 8 Gy). In parallel, in situ end-labelling (ISEL) staining, ceramide, and cyclophilin A staining demonstrated increases in cell death due to DNA fragmentation, ceramide-mediated apoptosis, and release of cyclophilin A as a result of cell membrane permeabilization, respectively. Quantitative ultrasound results indicated changes that paralleled increases in cell death observed from histology analyses supporting its use for non-invasive monitoring of cancer treatment outcomes."

In contrast, low doses of rapamycin (10 μg/kg) increase mTORC1 activity and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. Similar changes are found with SLF (synthetic ligand for FKBP12, which does not inhibit mTORC1) and in mice with a skeletal muscle-specific FKBP12 deficiency. These interventions also increase Ca(2+) influx to enhance refilling of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores, slow muscle fatigue, and increase running endurance without negatively impacting cardiac function. FKBP12 deficiency or longer treatments with low dose rapamycin or SLF increase the percentage of type I fibers, further adding to fatigue resistance. We demonstrate that FKBP12 and its ligands impact multiple aspects of muscle function."
https://openalex.org/W2126132055,"When the adhesive toe pads of geckos become wet, they become ineffective in enabling geckos to stick to substrates. This result is puzzling given that many species of gecko are endemic to tropical environments where water covered surfaces are ubiquitous. We hypothesized that geckos can recover adhesive capabilities following exposure of their toe pads to water by walking on a dry surface, similar to the active self-cleaning of dirt particles. We measured the time it took to recover maximum shear adhesion after toe pads had become wet in two groups, those that were allowed to actively walk and those that were not. Keeping in mind the importance of substrate wettability to adhesion on wet surfaces, we also tested geckos on hydrophilic glass and an intermediately wetting substrate (polymethylmethacrylate; PMMA). We found that time to maximum shear adhesion recovery did not differ in the walking groups based on substrate wettability (22.7±5.1 min on glass and 15.4±0.3 min on PMMA) but did have a significant effect in the non-walking groups (54.3±3.9 min on glass and 27.8±2.5 min on PMMA). Overall, we found that by actively walking, geckos were able to self-dry their wet toe pads and regain maximum shear adhesion significantly faster than those that did not walk. Our results highlight a unexpected property of the gecko adhesive system, the ability to actively self-dry and recover adhesive performance after being rendered dysfunctional by water."
https://openalex.org/W1992391800,"Enteroendocrine cells (EEC) produce neuropeptides, which are crucially involved in the maintenance of the intestinal barrier. Hence, EEC dysfunction is suggested to be involved in the complex pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is characterized by decreased intestinal barrier function. However, the underlying mechanisms for EEC dysfunction are not clear and suitable models for a better understanding are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) is specifically expressed in EEC of the murine colon and ileum and that its deficiency is associated with reduced intestinal levels of Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Peptide YY (PYY), which are both produced by EEC. Moreover, cpe−/− mice exhibit an aggravated course of DSS-induced chronic colitis compared to wildtype littermates. In addition, we observed elevated mucosal IL-6 and KC transcript levels already at baseline conditions in cpe−/− mice. Moreover, supernatants obtained from isolated intestinal crypts of cpe−/− mice lead to increased IL-6 and KC expression in MODE-K cells in the presence of LPS. This effect was reversible by co-administration of recombinant NPY, suggesting a CPE mediated immunosuppressive effect in the intestines by influencing the processing of specific neuropeptides. In this context, the chemotaxis of bone marrow derived macrophages towards respective supernatants was enhanced. In conclusion, our data point to an anti-inflammatory role of CPE in the intestine by influencing local cytokine levels and thus regulating the migration of myeloid immune cells into the mucosa. These findings highlight the importance of EEC for intestinal homeostasis and propose EEC as potential therapeutic targets in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2019908450,"Nicotine is a main alkaloid in tobacco and is also the primary toxic compound in tobacco wastes. It can be degraded by bacteria via either pyridine pathway or pyrrolidine pathway. Previously, a fused pathway of the pyridine pathway and the pyrrolidine pathway was proposed for nicotine degradation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33, in which 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine (HSP) is a key intermediate connecting the two pathways. We report here the purification and properties of an NADH-dependent HSP hydroxylase from A. tumefaciens S33. The 90-kDa homodimeric flavoprotein catalyzed the oxidative decarboxylation of HSP to 2,5-dihydroxypyridine (2,5-DHP) in the presence of NADH and FAD at pH 8.0 at a specific rate of about 18.8 ± 1.85 µmol min-1 mg protein-1. Its gene was identified by searching the N-terminal amino acid residues of the purified protein against the genome draft of the bacterium. It encodes a protein composed of 391 amino acids with 62% identity to HSP hydroxylase (HspB) from Pseudomonas putida S16, which degrades nicotine via the pyrrolidine pathway. Considering the application potential of 2,5-DHP in agriculture and medicine, we developed a route to transform HSP into 2,5-DHP with recombinant HSP hydroxylase and an NADH-regenerating system (formate, NAD+ and formate dehydrogenase), via which around 0.53 ± 0.03 mM 2,5-DHP was produced from 0.76 ± 0.01 mM HSP with a molar conversion as 69.7%. This study presents the biochemical properties of the key enzyme HSP hydroxylase which is involved in the fused nicotine degradation pathway of the pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways and a new green route to biochemically synthesize functionalized 2,5-DHP."

Predicted topology models for PCFT suggest that the loop domain between transmembrane domains (TMDs) 2 and 3 resides in the cytosol. Mutations involving Asp-109 or Arg-113 in the TMD2-3 loop result in loss of activity. By structural homology to other solute carriers, TMD2 may form part of the PCFT substrate binding domain. In this study we mutated the seven cysteine (Cys) residues of human PCFT to serine, creating Cys-less PCFT. Thirty-three single-Cys mutants spanning TMD2 and the TMD2-3 loop in a Cys-less PCFT background were transfected into PCFT-null HeLa cells. All 33 mutants were detected by Western blotting, and 28 were active for [3H]methotrexate uptake at pH 5.5. For the active residues, we performed pulldown assays with membrane-impermeable 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate-biotin and streptavidin beads to determine their aqueous-accessibilities.

Despite their different mechanisms and limited sequence homologies, the structures of LacY and GlpT are similar and show a symmetry in which two bundles of six hydrophobic helices are joined by a hydrophilic linker and surround a central cavity formed by helices 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the N-terminal segment and helices 7, 8, 10, and 11 of the C-terminal segment (23.Abramson J.

Helices 3, 6, 9, and 12 do not directly contribute to the central transmembrane cavity and substrate binding domain and are embedded in the lipid membrane (23.Abramson J. Kaback H.R. Iwata S.

Qiu A. Goldman I.D. N-Linked glycosylation and its impact on the electrophoretic mobility and function of the human proton-coupled folate transporter (HsPCFT).Biochim. Biophys.

This has been experimentally validated by indirect immunofluorescence staining of N- and C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged hPCFT and by substituted cysteine (Cys) accessibility methods (SCAM) involving Cys insertions into the TMD loop domains and reaction with 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA)-biotin (25.Zhao R.

The extracellular location of the loop connecting TMDs 1 and 2 was further evidenced by the fact that two predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in that loop (Asn-58 and Asn-68) are glycosylated in human PCFT (24.Unal E.S. Zhao R. Qiu A. Goldman I.D. N-Linked glycosylation and its impact on the electrophoretic mobility and function of the human proton-coupled folate transporter (HsPCFT).Biochim. Biophys.

Other aspects of hPCFT structure have been validated, including reactivity of membrane-impermeable methanethiosulfonate reagents with Phe-157, Gly-158, and Leu-161 in TMD4 and with Ile-188 in TMD5. Because methanethiosulfonate reactivity was protected by the hPCFT antifolate substrate Pemetrexed (PMX), these residues likely lie within or near the aqueous accessible substrate binding site (26.Shin D.S. Zhao R. Fiser A. Goldman I.D. Role of the fourth transmembrane domain in proton-coupled folate transporter function as assessed by the substituted cysteine accessibility method.Am. J. Physiol.

A number of specific amino acid residues were implicated as functionally important in hPCFT including Glu-185 (TMD5; involved in proton coupling), His-281 (TMD7; involved in substrate binding), and Arg-376 (TMD10; impacts proton and substrate binding) (Fig. 1) (7.Mahadeo K.

His-247, localized to the loop domain between TMDs 6 and 7, is predicted to interact with Ser-172 at the cytoplasmic opening to control substrate access to the aqueous binding site (29.Unal E.S.

This stretch is predicted to have a cytoplasmic orientation (Fig. 1) and includes Asp-109 and Arg-113, both of which cannot be replaced by other amino acids regardless of charge or polarity (9.Zhao R.

However, experimental confirmation was not provided. In this report we use SCAM with a Cys-less (CL) hPCFT that exhibits functional characteristics virtually identical to wild-type (WT) hPCFT and MTSEA-biotin, combined with systematic site-directed mutagenesis, to directly explore the structural and functional significance of the TMD2-3 loop domain and TMD2 in hPCFT. Our results establish that the TMD2-3 domain forms a novel reentrant loop structure (31.Yan C. Luo J. An analysis of reentrant loops.Protein J. 2010; 29: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and suggest that amino acids at positions 93 and 94 in TMD2 may comprise part of a critical substrate binding domain with aqueous accessibilities. Our results are unprecedented and provide important new insights into key structural and functional determinants of hPCFT uptake. [3′,5′,7-3H]Methotrexate (MTX) (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Unlabeled MTX was provided by the Drug Development Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Folic acid was purchased from Sigma. PMX (Alimta) was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Tissue culture reagents and supplies were purchased from assorted vendors with the exception of fetal bovine serum (FBS), which was purchased from Hyclone Technologies (Logan, UT). CLhPCFT, including a HA epitope at the C terminus (hereafter, CL-PCFT) in pCDNA3, was prepared by PCR from the C-terminal HA-tagged WT hPCFT (hereafter, WT-PCFT) construct by mutagenizing individual Cys residues (Cys-21, -66, -151, -229, -298, -328, and -397) to serine using the QuikChangeTM Multi Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Single amino acid substitutions were generated using either WT- or CL-hPCFT as a template and the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). Primers were developed using the QuikChangeTM Primer Design program (Agilent) and are available upon request. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min for 16 cycles. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing by Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ). The hPCFT-null R1-11 HeLa cell line was a gift of Dr. I. David Goldman (Bronx, NY) (32.Diop-Bove N.K. Wu J. Zhao R. Locker J. Goldman I.D. Hypermethylation of the human proton-coupled folate transporter (SLC46A1) minimal transcriptional regulatory region in an antifolate-resistant HeLa cell line.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 2424-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. For transfections with hPCFT constructs, R1-11 cells were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 0.8 million cells per plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with hPCFT expression constructs (above) in pCDNA3 (1 μg/plate) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (10 μl/plate) in Opti-MEM as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After 4 h the transfection medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cellular uptake of [3H]MTX (0.5 μm) was measured over 2 min at 37 °C in 60-mm dishes in MES-buffered saline (20 mm MES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose; pH 5.5) as previously described (33.Desmoulin S.K. Wang Y. Wu J. Stout M. Hou Z. Fulterer A. Chang M.H. Romero M.F. Cherian C. Gangjee A. Matherly L.H. Targeting the proton-coupled folate transporter for selective delivery of 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolate inhibitors of de novo purine biosynthesis in the chemotherapy of solid tumors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were washed 3× with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were solubilized in 0.5 n NaOH. Levels of intracellular radioactivity were calculated as pmol/mg of protein based on measurements of radioactivity and protein concentrations of the alkaline cell homogenates (34.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments cells were pretreated for 15 min at 37 °C with MTSEA-biotin (see below) before the transport assays with [3H]MTX treatments. To measure MTX transport kinetics, cells were treated with concentrations of [3H]MTX between 0.33 and 5 μm with results analyzed using Lineweaver-Burke plots for determinations of Kt and Vmax values. For determining Ki values for nonradioactive substrates including folic acid and PMX, cells were treated with 0.5 μm [3H]MTX and inhibitors at concentrations from 0.3 to 1.5 μm. Results were analyzed by Dixon plots to calculate Ki values. To compare the optimal pH for transport by WT- and CL-PCFT, transport assays were performed at pH values from 5.5 and 7.2. MES-buffered saline was used for pHs 5.5, 6.0 and 6.5, whereas HEPES-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose) was used for pH values 6.8 and 7.2. Forty-eight hours post-transfection (above), cell surface proteins were surface-biotinylated with MTSEA-biotin (Biotium, Hayward, CA). MTSEA-biotin was freshly dissolved in DMSO at 2 mg/100 μl and then diluted 1:100 in PBS. Cells were washed with PBS twice and treated with MTSEA-biotin solution for 30 min at room temperature. The MTSEA-biotin was aspirated, and cells were treated with 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol in PBS for 5 min to quench the reactions then washed twice with PBS. Plates were placed in 4 °C and treated with 1.4 ml of hypotonic buffer (0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were removed from the plates with a rubber policeman followed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed, and cell pellets were resuspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4) by vortexing then mixed on a rotisserie shaker for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, leaving the detergent-solubilized membrane proteins in the supernatant. An aliquot (25 μl) of this fraction was used as a loading control, and the remaining 375 μl were added to 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose resin (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) (prewashed with 3× lysis buffer). This mixture was mixed overnight at 4 °C in a rotisserie shaker. The following day the mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was aspirated. The resin was washed 3 times with lysis buffer followed by a wash with lysis buffer supplemented with 2% SDS. Bound proteins were released from the streptavidin resin by heating to 95 °C for 5 min in 2× Laemmli loading buffer (35.Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) that contained dithiothreitol. For some experiments protection from MTSEA-biotin biotinylation by the PCFT substrate, PMX, was tested. For these experiments, plates were treated with 2 ml of PBS containing 250 μm PMX for 15 min immediately before MTSEA-biotin treatment. Results were compared with those for untreated controls, incubated in parallel. Procedures for plasma membrane preparation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pierce) were identical to previously reported methods (36.Hou Z.

Blots were probed with anti-HA antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ) and IRDye800-conjugated secondary antibody. Anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used to probe for loading controls. Imaging and densitometry were performed with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Unpaired t tests were conducted using GraphPad 6.0 software. A previous study used progressive alanine substitution mutagenesis with stretches of alanines to disrupt the predicted TMD2-3 β-turn in hPCFT and found that transport activity was abolished due to impaired intracellular trafficking to the plasma membrane (30.Subramanian V.S.

https://openalex.org/W2010389022,"The constitutive androstane (CAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) are ligand-mediated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor protein superfamily. Functional CAR:RXR heterodimers recruit coactivator proteins, such as the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC1). Here, we show that agonist ligands can potentiate transactivation through both coactivator binding sites on CAR:RXR, which distinctly bind two SRC1 molecules. We also observe that SRC1 transitions from a structurally plastic to a compact form upon binding CAR:RXR. Using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) we show that the CAR(tcp):RXR(9c)·SRC1 complex can encompass two SRC1 molecules compared with the CAR(tcp):RXR·SRC1, which binds only a single SRC1. Moreover, sedimentation coefficients and molecular weights determined by analytical ultracentrifugation confirm the SAXS model. Cell-based transcription assays show that disrupting the SRC1 binding site on RXR alters the transactivation by CAR:RXR. These data suggest a broader role for RXR within heterodimers, whereas offering multiple strategies for the assembly of the transcription complex."
https://openalex.org/W2031907230,"The generation of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) by epitope-based immunization is difficult because the immunogenicity of simple peptides is poor and T cells must be potently stimulated and immunological memory elicited. A strategy in which antigen is incorporated into the adenoviral capsid protein has been used previously to develop antibody responses against several vaccine targets and may offer a solution to this problem. In this study, we used a similar strategy to develop HAdv-7-neutralizing MAbs using rAdMHE3 virions into which hexon hypervariable region 5 (HVR5) of adenovirus type 7 (HAdv-7) was incorporated. The epitope mutant rAdMHE3 was generated by replacing HVR5 of Ad3EGFP, a recombinant HAdv-3-based vector expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein, with HVR5 of HAdv-7. We immunized BALB/c mice with rAdMHE3 virions and produced 22 different MAbs against them, four of which showed neutralizing activity against HAdv-7 in vitro. Using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis and an antibody-binding-competition ELISA with Ad3EGFP, HAdv-7, and a series of chimeric adenoviral particles containing epitope mutants, we demonstrated that the four MAbs recognize the neutralization site within HVR5 of the HAdv-7 virion. Using an immunoblotting analysis and ELISA with HAdv-7, recombinant peptides, and a synthetic peptide, we also showed that the neutralizing epitope within HVR5 of the HAdv-7 virion is a conformational epitope. These findings suggest that it is feasible to use a strategy in which antigen is incorporated into the adenoviral capsid protein to generate neutralizing MAbs. This strategy may also be useful for developing therapeutic neutralizing MAbs and designing recombinant vector vaccines against HAdv-7, and in structural analysis of adenoviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2072008994,"Estimating the abundance of wild carnivores is of foremost importance for conservation and management. However, given their elusive habits, direct observations of these animals are difficult to obtain, so abundance is more commonly estimated from sign surveys or radio-marked individuals. These methods can be costly and difficult, particularly in large areas with heavy forest cover. As an alternative, recent research has suggested that wolf abundance can be estimated from occupancy-abundance curves derived from ""virtual"" surveys of simulated wolf track networks. Although potentially more cost-effective, the utility of this approach hinges on its robustness to violations of its assumptions. We assessed the sensitivity of the occupancy-abundance approach to four assumptions: variation in wolf movement rates, changes in pack cohesion, presence of lone wolves, and size of survey units. Our simulations showed that occupancy rates and wolf pack abundances were biased high if track surveys were conducted when wolves made long compared to short movements, wolf packs were moving as multiple hunting units as opposed to a cohesive pack, and lone wolves were moving throughout the surveyed landscape. We also found that larger survey units (400 and 576 km2) were more robust to changes in these factors than smaller survey units (36 and 144 km2). However, occupancy rates derived from large survey units rapidly reached an asymptote at 100% occupancy, suggesting that these large units are inappropriate for areas with moderate to high wolf densities (>15 wolves/1,000 km2). Virtually-derived occupancy-abundance relationships can be a useful method for monitoring wolves and other elusive wildlife if applied within certain constraints, in particular biological knowledge of the surveyed species needs to be incorporated into the design of the occupancy surveys. Further, we suggest that the applicability of this method could be extended by directly incorporating some of its assumptions into the modelling framework."
https://openalex.org/W1994887505,"WNT signaling mediates various physiological and pathological processes. We previously showed that WNT10A is a novel angio/stromagenic factor involved in such processes as tumor growth, wound healing and tissue fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the role of WNT10A in promoting the fibrosis that is central to the pathology of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). We initially asked whether there is an association between kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR) and WNT10A expression using kidney biopsies from 20 patients with AIN. Interestingly, patients with WNT10A expression had significantly lower eGFR than WNT10A-negative patients. However, changes in kidney function were not related to the level of expression of other WNT family members. Furthermore, there was positive correlation between WNT10A and α-SMA expression. We next investigated the involvement of WNT10A in kidney fibrosis processes using COS1 cells, a kidney fibroblast cell line. WNT10A overexpression increased the level of expression of fibronectin and peroxiredoxin 5. Furthermore, WNT10A overexpression renders cells resistant to apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide and high glucose. Collectively, WNT10A may induce kidney fibrosis and associate with kidney dysfunction in AIN."
https://openalex.org/W2003924521,"A cDNA gene encoding a mature peptide of the mono- and diacylglycerol lipase (abbreviated to PcMdl) from Penicillium cyclopium PG37 was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. The recombinant PcMdl (rePcMdl) with an apparent molecular weight of 39 kDa showed the highest activity (40.5 U/mL of culture supernatant) on 1,2-dibutyrin substrate at temperature 35°C and pH 7.5. The rePcMdl was stable at a pH range of 6.5–9.5 and temperatures below 35°C. The activity of rePcMdl was inhibited by Hg2+ and Fe3+, but not significantly affected by EDTA or the other metal ions such as Na+, K+, Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+. PcMdl was identified to be strictly specific to mono- and diacylglycerol, but not triacylglycerol. Stereographic view of PcMdl docked with substrate (tri- or diacylglycerol) analogue indicated that the residue Phe256 plays an important role in conferring the substrate selectivity. Phe256 projects its side chain towards the substrate binding groove and makes the sn-1 moiety difficult to insert in. Furthermore, sn-1 moiety prevents the phosphorus atom (substitution of carboxyl carbon) from getting to the Oγ of Ser145, which results in the failure of triacylglycerol hydrolysis. These results should provide a basis for molecular engineering of PcMdl and expand its applications in industries."
https://openalex.org/W2162752924,"Boolean implications (if-then rules) provide a conceptually simple, uniform and highly scalable way to find associations between pairs of random variables. In this paper, we propose to use Boolean implications to find relationships between variables of different data types (mutation, copy number alteration, DNA methylation and gene expression) from the glioblastoma (GBM) and ovarian serous cystadenoma (OV) data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find hundreds of thousands of Boolean implications from these data sets. A direct comparison of the relationships found by Boolean implications and those found by commonly used methods for mining associations show that existing methods would miss relationships found by Boolean implications. Furthermore, many relationships exposed by Boolean implications reflect important aspects of cancer biology. Examples of our findings include cis relationships between copy number alteration, DNA methylation and expression of genes, a new hierarchy of mutations and recurrent copy number alterations, loss-of-heterozygosity of well-known tumor suppressors, and the hypermethylation phenotype associated with IDH1 mutations in GBM.

https://openalex.org/W1973742376,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-binding cassette drug pump that protects us from toxic compounds and confers multidrug resistance. The protein is organized into two halves. The halves contain a transmembrane domain (TMD) with six transmembrane segments and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The drug- and ATP-binding sites reside at the TMD1/TMD2 and NBD1/NBD2 interfaces, respectively. ATP-dependent drug efflux involves changes between the open inward-facing (NBDs apart, extracellular loops (ECLs) close together) and the closed outward-facing (NBDs close together, ECLs apart) conformations. It is controversial, however, whether the open conformation only exists transiently in intact cells because of the presence of high levels of ATP. To test for the presence of an open conformation in intact cells, reporter cysteines were placed in extracellular loops 1 (A80C, N half) and 4 (R741C, C half). The rationale was that cysteines A80C/R741C would only come close enough to form a disulfide bond in an open conformation (6.9 Å apart) because they are separated widely (30.4 Å apart) in the closed conformation. It was observed that the mutant A80C/R741C cross-linked spontaneously (>90%) when expressed in cells. In contrast to previous reports showing that trapping P-gp in a closed conformation highly activated ATPase activity, here we show that A80C/R741C cross-linking inhibited ATPase activity and drug efflux. Both activities were restored when the cross-linked mutant was treated with a thiol-reducing agent. The results show that an open conformation can be readily detected in cells and that cross-linking of cysteines placed in ECLs 1 and 4 inhibits activity.

In contrast to previous reports showing that trapping P-gp in a closed conformation highly activated ATPase activity, here we show that A80C/R741C cross-linking inhibited ATPase activity and drug efflux. Both activities were restored when the cross-linked mutant was treated with a thiol-reducing agent. The results show that an open conformation can be readily detected in cells and that cross-linking of cysteines placed in ECLs 1 and 4 inhibits activity."
https://openalex.org/W1976758764,"The molecular chaperone Hsc70 assists in the folding of non-native proteins together with its J domain- and BAG domain-containing cofactors. In Caenorhabditis elegans, two BAG domain-containing proteins can be identified, one of them being UNC-23, whose mutation induces severe motility dysfunctions. Using reporter strains, we find that the full-length UNC-23, in contrast to C-terminal fragments, localizes specifically to the muscular attachment sites. C-terminal fragments of UNC-23 instead perform all Hsc70-related functions, like ATPase stimulation and regulation of folding activity, albeit with lower affinity than BAG-1. Interestingly, overexpression of CFP-Hsc70 can induce muscular defects in wild-type nematodes that phenocopy the knockout of its cofactor UNC-23. Strikingly, the motility dysfunction in the unc-23 mutated strain can be cured specifically by down-regulation of the antagonistic Hsc70 cochaperone DNJ-13, implying that the severe phenotype is caused by misregulation of the Hsc70 cycle. These findings point out that the balanced action of cofactors in the ATP-driven cycle of Hsc70 is crucial for the contribution of Hsc70 to muscle functionality.

https://openalex.org/W2019135422,"The goal of this study was to elucidate the action of the CD28 mimetic peptide p2TA (AB103) that attenuates an excessive inflammatory response in mitigating radiation-induced inflammatory injuries. BALB/c and A/J mice were divided into four groups: Control (C), Peptide (P; 5 mg/kg of p2TA peptide), Radiation (R; total body irradiation with 8 Gy γ-rays), and Radiation + Peptide (RP; irradiation followed by p2TA peptide 24 h later). Gastrointestinal tissue damage was evaluated by analysis of jejunum histopathology and immunohistochemistry for cell proliferation (Cyclin D1) and inflammation (COX-2) markers, as well as the presence of macrophages (F4/80). Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and KC as well as fibrinogen were quantified in plasma samples obtained from the same mice. Our results demonstrated that administration of p2TA peptide significantly reduced the irradiation-induced increase of IL-6 and fibrinogen in plasma 7 days after exposure. Seven days after total body irradiation with 8 Gy of gamma rays numbers of intestinal crypt cells were reduced and villi were shorter in irradiated animals compared to the controls. The p2TA peptide delivery 24 h after irradiation led to improved morphology of villi and crypts, increased Cyclin D1 expression, decreased COX-2 staining and decreased numbers of macrophages in small intestine of irradiated mice. Our study suggests that attenuation of CD28 signaling is a promising therapeutic approach for mitigation of radiation-induced tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W2034146014,"Chinese rare earth export policies currently result in accelerating its depletion. Thus adopting an optimal export trade selection strategy is crucial to determining and ultimately identifying the ideal trading partners. This paper introduces a multi-attribute decision-making methodology which is then used to select the optimal trading partner. In the method, an evaluation criteria system is established to assess the seven top trading partners based on three dimensions: political relationships, economic benefits and industrial security. Specifically, a simple additive weighing model derived from an additive utility function is utilized to calculate, rank and select alternatives. Results show that Japan would be the optimal trading partner for Chinese rare earths. The criteria evaluation method of trading partners for China's rare earth exports provides the Chinese government with a tool to enhance rare earth industrial policies."
https://openalex.org/W2046613330,"Background Dyslipidemia associated with obesity often manifests as increased plasma LDL and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein levels suggesting changes in hepatic lipoprotein receptor status. Persistent organic pollutants have been recently postulated to contribute to the obesity etiology by increasing adipogenesis, but little information is available on their potential effect on hepatic lipoprotein metabolism. Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the common environmental pollutant, benzo[α]pyrene (B[α]P) on two lipoprotein receptors, the LDL-receptor and the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) as well as the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) using cell and animal models. Results LSR, LDL-receptor as well as ABCA1 protein levels were significantly decreased by 26–48% in Hepa1-6 cells incubated (<2 h) in the presence of B[α]P (≤1 µM). Real-time PCR analysis and lactacystin studies revealed that this effect was due primarily to increased proteasome, and not lysosomal-mediated degradation rather than decreased transcription. Furthermore, ligand blots revealed that lipoproteins exposed to 1 or 5 µM B[α]P displayed markedly decreased (42–86%) binding to LSR or LDL-receptor. B[α]P-treated (0.5 mg/kg/48 h, i.p. 15 days) C57BL/6J mice displayed higher weight gain, associated with significant increases in plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and liver cholesterol content, and decreased hepatic LDL-receptor and ABCA1 levels. Furthermore, correlational analysis revealed that B[α]P abolished the positive association observed in control mice between the LSR and LDL-receptor. Interestingly, levels of other proteins involved in liver cholesterol metabolism, ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 and scavenger receptor-BI, were decreased, while those of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 and 2 were increased in B[α]P-treated mice. Conclusions B[α]P demonstrates inhibitory action on LSR and LDL-R, as well as ABCA1, which we propose leads to modified lipid status in B[α]P-treated mice, thus providing new insight into mechanisms underlying the involvement of pollutants in the disruption of lipid homeostasis, potentially contributing to dyslipidemia associated with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2066753552,"Although human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) have been identified as a new source of MSCs for potential application in regenerative medicine, their full potential of differentiation has not been determined. In particular, whether they have the capability to differentiate into epithelial cells of endodermal origin such as the prostate epithelial cells is unknown. Here we report that when hUC-MSCs were combined with rat urogenital sinus stromal cells (rUGSSs) and transplanted into the renal capsule in vivo, they could differentiate into prostate epithelial-like cells that could be verified by prostate epithelial cell-specific markers including the prostate specific antigen. The prostatic glandular structures formed in vivo displayed similar cellular architecture with lumens and branching features as seen for a normal prostate. In addition, the human origin of the hUC-MSCs was confirmed by immunocytochemistry for human nuclear antigen. These findings together indicate that hUC-MSCs have the capability to differentiate into epithelial-like cells that are normally derived from the endoderm, implicating their potential applications in tissue repair and regeneration of many endoderm-derived internal organs."
https://openalex.org/W2058388201,"The mechanism(s) by which Rab GTPases are specifically recruited to distinct intracellular membranes remains elusive. Here we used Rab27a localisation onto melanosomes as a model to investigate Rab targeting. We identified the α1 subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase (ATP1a1) as a novel Rab27a interacting protein in melanocytes and showed that this interaction is direct with the intracellular M4M5 loop of ATP1a1 and independent of nucleotide bound status of the Rab. Knockdown studies in melanocytes revealed that ATP1a1 plays an essential role in Rab27a-dependent melanosome transport. Specifically, expression of ATP1a1, like the Rab27a GDP/GTP exchange factor (Rab3GEP), is essential for targeting and activation of Rab27a to melanosomes. Finally, we showed that the ability of Rab27a mutants to target to melanosomes correlates with the efficiency of their interaction with ATP1a1. Altogether these studies point to a new role for ATP1a1 as a regulator of Rab27a targeting and activation."
https://openalex.org/W2005820459,"Self-organizing artificial neural networks are a popular tool for studying visual system development, in particular the cortical feature maps present in real systems that represent properties such as ocular dominance (OD), orientation-selectivity (OR) and direction selectivity (DS). They are also potentially useful in artificial systems, for example robotics, where the ability to extract and learn features from the environment in an unsupervised way is important. In this computational study we explore a DS map that is already latent in a simple artificial network. This latent selectivity arises purely from the cortical architecture without any explicit coding for DS and prior to any self-organising process facilitated by spontaneous activity or training. We find DS maps with local patchy regions that exhibit features similar to maps derived experimentally and from previous modeling studies. We explore the consequences of changes to the afferent and lateral connectivity to establish the key features of this proto-architecture that support DS."
https://openalex.org/W2036707196,"Neural crest cells are highly motile, yet a limited number of genes governing neural crest migration have been identified by conventional studies. To test the hypothesis that cell migration genes are likely to be conserved over large evolutionary distances and from diverse tissues, we searched for vertebrate homologs of genes important for migration of various cell types in the invertebrate nematode and examined their expression during vertebrate neural crest cell migration. Our systematic analysis utilized a combination of comparative genomic scanning, functional pathway analysis and gene expression profiling to uncover previously unidentified genes expressed by premigratory, emigrating and/or migrating neural crest cells. The results demonstrate that similar gene sets are expressed in migratory cell types across distant animals and different germ layers. Bioinformatics analysis of these factors revealed relationships between these genes within signaling pathways that may be important during neural crest cell migration."
