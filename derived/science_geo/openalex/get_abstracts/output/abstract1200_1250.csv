https://openalex.org/W1520029826,"Low concentrations of sodium metaperiodate induce specific oxidative cleavage of sialic acids between carbon 7 and carbon 8 or carbon 8 and carbon 9. The aldehydes formed can easily be reduced with NaB3H4 to tritiated 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-L-arabino-2-heptulosonic acid or 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-L-arabino-2-octulosonic acid. At 0 degrees, the periodate anion penetrates the cell plasma membrane very slowly and only externally exposed sialic acids are oxidized. This was shown by (a) limited labeling of the sialoglycoproteins in a preparation of inside-out erythrocyte vesicles; (b) trapping 14C-labeled fetuin within resealed erythrocyte ghosts; fetuin was then poorly labeled, whereas the erythrocyte sialoglycoproteins were highly labeled; (c) comparison of labeled glycoproteins of mouse lymphoid cells before and after treatment with neuraminidase. This simple method of specifically introducing a radioactive label into cell surface sialic acids is useful in the study of cell surface sialic acid-containing glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1564134240,"The alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-binding lectin previously purified from Bandeiraea simplicifolia seeds (Hayes, C.H., and Goldstein, I.J. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 1904) is shown to consist of five isolectins separable on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9.5. The isolectins are tetrameric structures composed of various combinations of two different glycoprotein subunits designated A and B. The A and B subunits appear to be immunochemically indistinguishable against rabbit antisera prepared from the isolectin mixture. The A subunit contains no methionine, whereas the B subunit contains 1 residue. The subunits migrate differently on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and, although each subunit contains 1 residue of cysteine, they react differently toward 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The carbohydrate binding specificity of the two subunits differs significantly: the A subunit exhibits a primary specificity for alpha-D-GalNAcp but also reacts with alpha-D-Galp units, whereas the B subunit shows a sharp specificity toward alpha-D-Galp residues. The differences in carbohydrate binding specificity were exploited in separating the isolectins. B. simplicifolia I isolectins (A4) and (A3B) were purified on a Bio-Gel melibionate column, and (A2B2), (AB3), and (B4) were separated on a column of insolubilized blood group A substance."

https://openalex.org/W2045066046,Four human neuroblastoma cell lines were studied by chromosome banding techniques. All of the lines contained a marker chromosome with a long nonbanding homogeneously staining region (HSR). The HSR-containing chromosome differed in each line. One line contained two classes of cells: one with an HST marker chromosome and the other with double minute chromosomes. Each cell had one of these abnormalities; no cell had both. The presence of two additional chromosomal markers in all cells of this line indicates a common origin. These observations suggest that the double minute chromosomes are derived from the HSR.

At least one common antigen was located in the zona pellucida as determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Serum samples from 22 infertile women were tested on pig eggs by immunofluorescence, and six of these samples produced strong and nine produced moderate reactions with the zona pellucida. The autoantibodies may be responsible for infertility in these women."

https://openalex.org/W2114095768,"Murine leukemia viruses, such as Rauscher leukemia virus (RLV), contain a proteolytic factor which becomes activated after detergent treatment of the virus. This factor specifically cleaves P70, the gag precursor polyprotein which is enriched for in preparations of immature virus core subparticles. The factor has been partially purified on Sephadex G-75 columns. It has a molecular weight of 10,000-12,000 daltons but does not coincide in elution position with the major peaks of the viral polypeptides p10 or p12. Under optimal conditions, that is 2% NP-40 (v/v), 10 mM DTT, (pH 7.2) and incubation for 16 hr at 22 degrees C, cleavage of labeled P70 occurs and increasing amounts of the four gag polypeptides p30, p15, p12 and p10 are obtained. The P70 cleavage activity is blocked by TLCK, TAME, CBZ-lysine and other lysyl-containing protease inhibitors. Further, the CBZ-lysine inhibition is reversible, while an inhibition by phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) is irreversible. These inhibition studies suggest that a similarity exists between the P70 proteolytic factor and some serine proteases, such as trypsin. The cleavage pattern of P70-rich immature cores treated with trypsin or chymotrypsin is different from that obtained with the P70 proteolytic factor. Thus murine leukemia virions apparently contain a unique, highly specific protease which is present in small amounts and cleaves P70."

https://openalex.org/W2155231219,"A novel purification procedure for DNA complementary to individual mRNA species has been developed by using restriction endonuclease cleavage of cDNA transcribed from a complex mixture of mRNAs. This procedure has allowed us to isolate and analyze DNA fragments complementary to the mRNA coding for the human peptide hormone chorionic somatomammotropin (HCS). The mRNA for this hormone is a major constituent of placental polyadenylated RNA as shown by in vitro translation of placental RNA and by nucleic acid hybridization using HCS cDNA as a specific probe. The purification of HCS cDNA was achieved by Hae III and Hha I restriction endonuclease cleavage of single-stranded cDNA synthesized in vitro from total polyadenylated placental RNA. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the products allowed detection and purification of discrete DNA fragments. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of these fragments with that predicted from the amino acid sequence of HCS demonstrated that the fragments are transcripts of HCS mRNA, containing most of the translated and 3′ untranslated regions. The latter region is characterized by a UAG termination codon immediately adjacent to the translated region (a second in phase UAG occurs 9 nucleotides away) and a palindromic sequence (GUGACCCCUCCCCAGUG) centered 27 nucleotides from the termination codon. The purification scheme outlined for HCS cCNA should be applicable to DNA sequences complementary to mRNA species which represent at least 2% of any polyadenylated RNA preparation. This was demonstrated by restriction endonuclease cleavage of cDNA synthesized from a mixture of purified rabbit globin and total polyadenylated human placental RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2009498901,"The 5' noncoding region sequence of rabbit beta-globin mRNA has been determined. This region is 53 nucleotides long, not including the A-U-G initiator sequence or m7Gppp ""cap"" structure. 32P-labeled DNA complementary to the 5' noncoding region was synthesized using reverse transcriptase with the synthetic deoxyoctanucleotide d(G-C-A-C-C-A-T-T) as a ""primer"". The cDNA produced was then sequenced using a modification of the gel-sequencing technique previously developed for DNA sequencing (G.G. Brownlee and E.M. Cartwright, manuscript in preparation). The sequence obtained was checked by depurination and nearest-neighbor analysis. The known sequence at the 3' end of rabbit 18S ribosomal RNA cannot base-pair extensively with the 5' noncoding region of beta-globin mRNA; however, it does form 6 base pairs around the initiation codon."
https://openalex.org/W1586035589,"HLA antigens have been purified to homogeneity after detergent solubilization from RPMI 4265, a human lymphoblastoid line. The inhibition of cytotoxicity assay for HLA antigen was modified, using preincubation with bovine serum albumin of antigen samples containing detergent to prevent lysis of target cells by detergent. Solubilization was tested with many types of detergents. A polyethyleneglycol oleyl ether nonionic detergent mixture, Brij 99:Brij 97 (2:1) was selected for solubilization, since it selectively solubilized HLA antigens, had a low absorbance at 280 nm and was uncharded. HLA antigens were then purified by Lens culinaris lectin affinity chromatography and Bio-Gel A-5m filtration. The antigen specifity HLA-A2 was separated from specificities HLA-B7,12 by isoelectric focusing. Purified HLA antigens contained a subunit of Mr=44,000 with NH2-terminal glycine, and a subunit of Mr=12,000, beta2-microglobulin, with NH2-terminal isoleucine."
https://openalex.org/W2079980140,"Scoliosis in fish is caused by several diverse agents that possibly act on the central nervous system, neuromuscular junctions, or ionic metabolism. The organochlorine pesticide Kepone induces scoliosis in the sheepshead minnow. Some effects associated with Kepone-induced scoliosis in these fish are disruption of myotomal patterns, inter- and intramuscular hemorrhage, fractured centra of vertebrae, and death. The histological syndrome of Kepone poisoning in fish and the clinical syndrome in humans suggest that the nervous system is a primary target for Kepone and that scoliosis is a secondary effect of Kepone poisoning in fish."

These heteromorphisms are limited to certain groups, and are heritable1. Consistent variability between people, in both size and staining properties, is observed. This may reflect either structural or biochemical variations. Before chromosome banding procedures, the length of the Y was known to vary from person to person and from one ethnic group to another2. Some autosomal regions were also found to differ in various racial groups3,4. Using Q- and C-banding procedures, we have regions scored were (1) on the long arms (qh) of chromosomes 1,9 and 16; (2) on the short arms (P) of the acrocentric autosomes (13–15 and 21–22); and (3) on the centromere (c) of all other chromosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2050571993,"The extent of binding of various RNA species to the three forms of avian sarcoma virus B77 RNA-dependent DNA polymerase was determined using a sensitive nitrocellulose filter binding technique which was capable of detecting binding reactions with association constants as low as 3 X 10(6) liters X mole-1. All three enzyme forms, alphabeta, beta2, and alpha, bound to all single-stranded RNA species that were tested, including nonviral RNAs. 70 S viral RNA exhibited the highest association constant (about 10(11) liters X mole-1), and a population of virus-derived tRNA molecules from which tRNATrp had been removed, the lowest (about 3000 times lower). The affinity for other RNAs was roughly proportional to their size. The affinity of RNAs for the alphabeta enzyme form always exceeded that for the two others by a factor that depended on the particular RNA, never exceeded 6 and was sometimes as low as 1.2. The association constant of the alphabeta enzyme form with viral 70 S RNA was about 15-fold higher than that with viral 35 S RNA. 35 S RNA annealed to tRNATrp had an association constant that was only 2.5 times higher than that of 35 S RNA alone. This finding suggests that the tertiary structure of 70 S RNA plays a significant role in its affinity for B77 DNA polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W2049571916,"Two amino acid sequences from the same regions of guinea pig and bovine myelin basic protein which induce experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats were synthesized. The sequences of these two regions may be defined by residues 69 to 84 of the bovine basic protein. The encephalitogenic sequence from guinea pig basic protein (peptide S49), H-Gly-Ser-Leu-Pro-Gln-Lys-Ala-Gin-Arg-Pro-Gin-Asp-Glu-Asn-OH, is a much more potent encephalitogen than that of H-Gly-Ser-Leu-Pro-Gln-Lys-Ala-Gln-Gly-His-Arg-Pro-Gln-Asp-Glu-Asn-OH (peptide S8) found in the bovine protein. The primary structures of the two determinants are similar; however, a Gly-His deletion from the guinea pig sequence is noted. Study of the encephalitogenicity of peptide S49, peptide S8, and the parent proteins suggests that the difference in the encephalitogenic potency of the parent proteins in Lewis rats is due to a natural modification in the primary structure of their respective encephalitogenic determinants."

https://openalex.org/W1520384953,"Antigenic properties of 14 fragments of bovine albumin were measured using antisera to albumin and to two of its fragments. All seven fragments larger than 21,000 daltons formed immune precipitates. Although immune precipitates were not formed with smaller fragments, inhibition tests indicated the presence of antigenic sites on several of these fragments as well. The results predict the occurrence of six or more antigenic determinants and allow assignment of their positions in the parent molecule. These sites are distributed along the entire protein chain, with the sites of greatest antibody affinity situated in the COOH-terminal region. Evidence is presented that some sites are homologous, reacting with the same populations of antibodies, and that other sites are unique, binding to an exclusive population of antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W1516221353,"Rabbit globin complementary DNA made with RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) was used as a template for in vitro synthesis of 32P-labeled RNA and deoxysubstituted RNA. The sequences of the nucleotides in most of the fragments resulting from combined ribonuclease T1 and alkaline phosphatase digestion have been determined. In addition, the 3' nearest neighbor was determined for several fragments resulting from digestion with T1 ribonuclease. The utility of the deoxysubstitution technique was demonstrated by the ease with which the sequences of pyrimidine-rich fragments could be determined. Many sequences thus determined were long enough to fit uniquely with the alpha- or beta-globin amino acid sequences. The positions of these fits were found to be clustered, leading us to believe that only certain regions of the complementary DNA are transcribed by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. Other unique characteristics of RNA synthesis from a complementary DNA template include a high yield of free poly(A) and the fact that one must use low rather than high salt buffers to obtain transcripts of high molecular weight."
