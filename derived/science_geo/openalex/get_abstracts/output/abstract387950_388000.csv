Ideas on this question have varied considerably over the years. Periodic charts have commonly placed thorium, protactinium, and uranium in positions immediately below the elements hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten. The latter group of elements are members of a transition series in which the 5d electron shell is being filled. Hence this earlier placement of the three heavy elements corresponded to the assumption that they are members of a 6d transition series. Indeed thorium, protactinium, and, to a much smaller extent, uranium do show considerable resemblance in chemical properties to the 4d and 5d transition series elements. The electronic configuration beyond the radon core on this basis would be written thus: thorium (6d 27s 2), protactinium (6d 37s 2), and uranium (6d 47s 2)."

Both the optical forms are utilized2. If the nutrient solution contains aspartic acid as well as nitrate and ammonium sulphate, all these nitrogen sources are utilized simultaneously (see accompanying table). Aspartic acid thus competes with nitrate and ammonium nitrogens as a nitrogen source for peas, an important fact to be borne in mind when discussing the ability of plants to utilize organic nitrogen in natural conditions. Nitrogen nutrition has a marked effect on the structure of pea roots. Peas grown on nitrate nitrogen and without nitrogen form in this respect a special group; peas grown on aspartic acid nitrogen, on ammonium nitrogen and on nitrogen supplied by root nodules another."

Since this and phenylacetie acid were known to be present in the penicillin tested, it is concluded that they are responsible for the inhibition activity against seeds. None of the crystalline penicillins tested appreciably retarded germination."

Mexico, 1944, 74, 61-74), one further point has been discovered. It has usually been considered that there were only two different proposals involving malariae as a new specific name-Oscillaria malariae Laveran, 1881, and Haemamoeba malariae Feletti and Grassi, 1890. Actually it now appears that there were three!"
