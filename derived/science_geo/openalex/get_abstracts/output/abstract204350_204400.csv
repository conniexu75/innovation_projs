The run was continued long enough so that any fatty acid having a retention volume less than that of a 30-carbon saturated fatty acid would be detected. The actual quantitative determination was made with the run continuing for sufficient time to detect all the fatty acids which were shown to be present by the preliminary analysis. Because these analyses were made over a period of several months, there was some variation in the conditions under which the chromatographic columns were operated. The preferred conditions, and those generally used, were: liquid phase, 12 weight y0 of ethylene glycol adipate polyester on 60 to 80 mesh, acid-washed and neutralized Chromosorb W; column length, 200 cm; temperature, 200”; He flow rate, 50 ml per minute, standard temperature and pressure; sample size, 0.5 to 5 ~1. A comparison of the retention volumes of the unknowns with those of suitable standards and the fatty acid compositions already reported for these fats (3,7) formed the bases for assigning identification to the individual fatty acids. None of the fats studied are reported to contain unusual fatty acids. Consequently, the identity assigned to the acids is probably correct. Fatty acids that constitute less than 1% of the total are not reported because of the large relative error in such values. Therefore, the sum of the individual acids of many of the fats is not lOO$$."

However, the viral progeny which do grow in the presence of guani-dine may become approximately 10,000 times more resistant to the drug. The phenomenon of drug resistance poses yet another problem in the search for a satisfactory viral chemotherapeutic agent."

https://openalex.org/W2091125477,"Lateral root-tip chromosomes of Vicia faba were treated with mitomycin C. Chromatid aberrations were observed from 24 through 96 hours after treatment. The effect of mitomycin C was not altered appreciably by changes in p H, temperature, oxygen tension, or lack of adenosine triphosphate. The relationship of mitomycin C to other radiomimetic compounds is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2055467043,"THE occurrence of 1,3-α linkage in some dextrans has already been suggested by many workers1–5. Barker et al.3,4 have fractionated the partial acid hydrolysate of the dextran produced by Betacoccus arabinosaseous (Birmingham strain) on a charcoal column and recognized the presence of a trace of nigerose by paper chromatography. Jeanes et al.5 have characterized dextrans from 96 strains of bacteria by periodate oxidation analysis and classified them into several groups on the basis of the proportions of 1,3 like linkages. According to their results, 29 of them appeared to contain more than 10 per cent 1,3 -linkages and a few of them showed an extremely high content of 1,3-linkages (more than 30 per cent)."

After treatment with phenol, lambda bacteriophage yields material, presumably desoxyribonucleic acid, which is infectious for protoplasts but not for intact bacterial host cells. Examination of the composition and structure of lambda desoxyribonucleic acid indicates that it has the conventional double stranded configuration. (auth)"

More recently, a detailed description of the histo-chemical reactions of these cells in the mouse thymus has been given by Loewenthal and Smith2, who pointed out that these cells gave a strong red colour when stained with the periodic acid–Schiff reagent (PAS)."

https://openalex.org/W1806100640,"It has long been known that treatment with propylthiouracil and other antithyroid drugs inhibits organic binding of iodine and leads to a reduction in total iodine in the thyroid (1). The work of Franklin et al. (2-4) showed that these agents also prevent incorporation of radioiodine into organic compounds by thyroid slices in Z.&O. Pitt-Rivers (5), finding that acetyldiiodotyrosine did not form acetylthyroxine when incubated with these compounds, suggested that they may act by inhibiting coupling of diiodotyrosines to form thyroxine in vivo. However, Slingerland (6) was unable to obtain evidence in support of this possibility. Recent investigations have suggested that although propylthiouracil blocks the iodination of tyrosyl groups in thyroglobulin, it inhibits the formation of diiodotyrosine more strongly than the formation of monoiodotyrosine. Slingerland et al. (7) felt that this block favored the synthesis of triiodothyronine over that of thyroxine, whereas Richards and Ingbar (8) found no triiodothyronine and a reduced quantity of thyroxine in the glands of rats treated with small amounts of propylthiouracil. All of the studies on the effect of propylthiouracil on the intrathyroid metabolism of radioiodine have been conducted by administration of radioiodine after treatment with graded doses of the drug. In the studies to be described we thought it might be informative to “label” the thyroids of animals before drug treatment and to follow subsequently the radioactivity in the several iodine-containing compounds in the glands after instituting antithyroid treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2074476622,"The results of combination treatments of the roots of Vicia faba with certain radiomimetic compounds (8-ethoxycaffeine, maleic hydrazide, beta-propiolactone, potassium cyanide) and x-ray as well as combination treatments of certain radiomimetic compounds with one another were observed to determine whether interaction will occur between chromosomal breaks induced by different agents. Interaction was observed between breaks induced by x-rays and all of the breaks induced by chemicals but not between breaks induced by any two chemicals. The results are discussed in terms of possible breakage bond differences and the effects of temporal and spatial differences in breaks induced by different agents."

Many of the behavioral patterns encountered have previously been described only in brain-damaged animals when they have been used as an index of ""hypersexuality."" Identical behavior occurs in normal males as a simple training effect."

More than 90 percent of the strontium-90 came from deposition on aboveground plant parts, and less than 10 percent was taken up through the soil. About 1 to 2 percent of the strontium-90 fallout during the time the heads were exposed was retained in the grain."
