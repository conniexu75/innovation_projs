https://openalex.org/W2014742609,"Fractions purified from scrapie-infected hamster brain contain a unique protein, designated PrP. It was labeled with N-succinimidyl 3-(4-hydroxy-5-[125I]-iodophenyl) propionate, which did not alter the titer of the scrapie prion. The concentration of PrP was found to be directly proportional to the titer of the infectious prion. Both PrP and prion infectivity were resistant for 2 hr at 37 degrees C to hydrolysis by proteinase K under nondenaturing conditions. Prolonging the digestion resulted in a concomitant decrease in both PrP and the scrapie prion. When the amino-acid-specific proteases trypsin or SV-8 protease were used instead of proteinase K, no change in either PrP or the prion was detected. The parallel changes between PrP and the prion provide evidence that PrP is a structural component of the infectious prion. Our findings also suggest that the prion contains only one major protein, namely PrP."

https://openalex.org/W2017001433,"Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying either a rearranged or unrearranged c-myc oncogene were examined with the use of probes from the 5' exon and for the second and third exon of the oncogene. The results indicate that the normal c-myc gene on chromosome 8 and the 5' noncoding and 3' coding segments of the c-myc oncogene separated by the chromosomal translocation are under different transcriptional control in the lymphoma cells. Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying a translocated but unrearranged c-myc oncogene express normal c-myc transcripts. In contrast, lymphoma cells carrying a c-myc gene rearranged head to head with the immunoglobulin constant mu region gene express c-myc transcripts lacking the normal untranslated leader."

https://openalex.org/W2064607219,"Signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein consisting of six distinct polypeptides and one molecule of small cytoplasmic 7SL-RNA. The particle was previously shown to function in protein translocation across, and protein integration into, the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. A rapid procedure was developed to disassemble SRP into native protein and RNA components. The method utilizes unfolding of SRP with EDTA and dissociation on polycationic matrixes. SRP proteins prepared this way sediment below 7S and are inactive in activity assays. When recombined with 7SL-RNA in the presence of magnesium, the proteins are shown to reassociate stoichiometrically with 7SL-RNA to form fully active 11S SRP."

https://openalex.org/W2081296087,Intracisternal injection of ovine corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) into the pylorus-ligated rat or the rat with gastric fistula resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of gastric secretion stimulated with pentagastrin or thyrotropin-releasing hormone. When injected into the lateral hypothalamus--but not when injected into the cerebral cortexâ€”CRF suppressed pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. The inhibitory effect of CRF was blocked by vagotomy and adrenalectomy but not by hypophysectomy or naloxone treatment. These results indicate that CRF acts within the brain to inhibit gastric acid secretion through vagal and adrenal mechanisms and not through hypophysiotropic effects.
https://openalex.org/W2026750051,"A mutation in any one of eight spoO genes of Bacillus subtilis blocks the process of spore formation at its earliest stage. To investigate how the products of the spoO genes may be involved in developmental gene expression, we fused the lacZ gene of E. coli to spoVG, a sporulation gene whose induction at the onset of sporulation is under spoO control. In cells of Spo+ bacteria containing a single copy of the gene fusion, conditions leading to the onset of sporulation resulted in the induction of beta-galactosidase synthesis. This induction was moderately to severely impaired by mutations in any of seven spoO genes. Deletion and hybridization analysis demonstrated that this sporulation-induced enzyme synthesis was exclusively expressed from the two overlapping promoters, which comprise the spoVG transcription-initiation region, and that a small DNA segment (157 bp) containing the spoVG promoters was sufficient to cause spoO-dependent induction of the fused lacZ gene."

https://openalex.org/W1484745378,"A protein with properties of laminin has been isolated from human placental extracts by using monoclonal antibodies. Placental tissue was extracted with 0.5 M NaCl and high molecular weight proteins were isolated from the extract by salt precipitation and gel filtration on Sepharose 6B. The resulting protein fraction which contained material cross-reactive with anti-sera to rat laminin was used as immunogen to prepare hybridomas. Thirteen hybrids produced antibodies which reacted with basement membrane-associated antigens in indirect immunofluorescence of tissues. One of these, 4E10, was characterized in detail. This monoclonal antibody reacted with human laminin as shown by several lines of evidence. Immunoprecipitation from metabolically labeled culture media of a human amniotic epithelial cell line with the 4E10 antibody followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed polypeptides with Mr similar to those of rat laminin. Immunochromatography of placental extracts obtained by limited pepsin digestion yielded material with main polypeptides at 160 and 130 kilodaltons in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after reduction. These peptic fragments cross-reacted with rat laminin in immunodiffusion and enzyme immunoassay, and a polyclonal antiserum against the fragments reacted with basement membranes in tissues in a manner identical with the 4E10 antibody. Electron microscopic images of the human peptic fragments showed structures similar to the cross-shaped images of murine laminins, although the short arms were truncated to various degrees or even absent. The isolated peptic fragments also displayed biological activity similar to that of murine laminins in that the outgrowth of neurites by neuronal cells was promoted on plates coated with the fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2069757711,"The tripartite protein toxin of Bacillus anthracis consists of protective antigen (PA), edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF). As a first step in developing a more efficacious anthrax vaccine, recombinant plasmids containing the PA gene have been isolated. A library was constructed in the E. coli vector pBR322 from Bam HI-generated fragments of the anthrax plasmid, pBA1. Two clones producing PA were identified by screening lysates with ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Western blots revealed a full-size PA protein in the recombinant E. coli, and a cell elongation assay demonstrated biological activity. Both positive clones had a 6 kb insert of DNA, which mapped in the Bam HI site of the vector. The two inserts are the same except that they lie in opposite orientations with respect to the vector. Thus PA is encoded by the plasmid pBA1."
https://openalex.org/W1624368848,"Cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with the lysosomal storage disease galactosialidosis lack a 54-kDa which is a precursor of 32-kDa and 20-kDa proteins, which immunoprecipitate with human anti-beta-galactosidase antiserum. The lack of a 32-kDa protein results in a combined deficiency of beta-galactosidase and sialidase. The mechanism of protection of lysosomal beta-galactosidase against proteolytic degradation is elucidated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and immunoprecipitation studies. In normal fibroblasts at the low intralysosomal pH, more than 85% of beta-galactosidase exists as a high molecular weight (600-700 kDa) multimer and about 10% as a monomer of 64-kDa. In mutant cells from galactosialidosis patients, the residual enzyme activity, about 10%, is present as a monomer and no multimer exists. After addition of the 54-kDa precursor form of the protective protein, the density pattern of beta-galactosidase in galactosialidosis cells is normalized. Immunoprecipitation studies after sucrose density gradient centrifugation on homogenate and on purified beta-galactosidase from normal fibroblasts show that the protective is associated only with the multimeric form of beta-galactosidase. We propose that intralysosomal protection against proteolysis of beta-galactosidase and sialidase is accomplished by aggregation into a high molecular weight complex consisting of multimeric beta-galactosidase, sialidase, and protective protein. The genetic deficiency of the latter, as in galactosialidosis, results in a rapid degradation of monomeric beta-galactosidase and a loss of sialidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1534242591,"The minimum primary structural requirement for N-glycosylation of proteins is the sequence -Asn-X-Thr/Ser-. In the present study, NH2-terminal derivatives of Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2 and peptides with asparagine replacements have been tested as substrates or inhibitors of N-glycosylation. The glycosylation of a known acceptor, N alpha-[3H]Ac-Asn-Leu-Thr-NHCH3, was optimized in chicken oviduct microsomes. The reaction was shown to be dependent upon Mn2+ and linear for 10 min at 30 degrees C; the apparent Km for the peptide was found to be 10 microM. N alpha-Acyl derivatives of Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2 (N-acetyl, N-benzoyl, N-octanoyl, or N-t-butoxycarbonyl) inhibited the glycosylation of N alpha-[3H] Ac-Asn-Leu-Thr-NHCH3 in a dose-dependent manner; additional experiments demonstrated that these compounds were alternative substrates rather than true inhibitors. The benzoyl and octanoyl derivatives were 10 times as effective as N alpha-Ac-Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2 in inhibiting glycosylation. In contrast, peptides containing asparagine modifications or substitutions were neither substrates nor inhibitors of N-glycosylation. They did not compete for glycosylation of 3H-peptide at 100-fold greater concentrations, and did not deplete endogenous pools of oligosaccharide-lipid. Thus, the asparagine side chain is an absolute requirement for recognition by the transferase. The majority of the glycosylated product (61%), but only 1% of the unglycosylated peptide, remained associated with the microsomes after high speed centrifugation. A large 41-amino acid residue acceptor peptide, alpha-lac17-58, was a poor substitute for glycosylation unless detergent was added to the microsomes. In contrast, glycosylation of tripeptide acceptors was not stimulated by detergent. Both of these findings suggest that the tripeptides are freely permeable to the microsomal membrane and support the earlier conclusion that glycosylation of proteins occurs at the luminal face of the microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1582460637,"Turpentine induced inflammation has been shown to elevate liver sialyl- and galactosyltransferase activities (Turchen, B., Jamieson, J.C., Huebner, E., and van Caeseele, L. (1977) Can. J. Zool. 55, 1567-1571; Lombart, C., Sturgess, J., and Schachter, H. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Acta 629, 1-12). We now report that serum sialyl-, but not galactosyltransferase activities are significantly elevated in turpentine inflammation. A liver slice system is used to demonstrate that liver releases large amounts of sialyltransferase activity into medium after inflammation, whereas only a low level of galactosyltransferase activity is released. Studies with rat and human asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein as acceptors, coupled with the use of lactose to confirm the nature of the linkages formed, showed that Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc alpha 2 leads to 6 sialyltransferase is released from liver in turpentine inflammation and is mainly responsible for the elevated sialyltransferase activity found in serum. The alpha 2 leads to 6 sialyltransferase is exhibiting the properties of a typical acute phase reactant."

https://openalex.org/W1591981947,"Transcription of a Xenopus laevis tRNATyr gene and splicing of the transcript have been studied in HeLa cell extracts. This tRNATyr gene has a 13-base intervening sequence and is expressed as mature tRNA when transfected into mammalian cells. The tRNATyr gene is transcribed under conditions of low concentrations of magnesium and ATP, but is processed by splicing only when both of these cofactors are added at higher concentrations. The endonucleolytic activity of the tRNA-splicing system in the HeLa extract produces exons with 3'-phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl groups. The 3'-phosphate is retained during the ligation reaction and forms the phosphodiester bond in the mature tRNA. Retention of the 3'-phosphate during tRNA splicing differs from the more extensively studied process in yeast extracts where a phosphate group from an ATP cofactor is used to form the phosphodiester bond joining the exons. Thus, eucaryotic organisms can splice tRNA precursors by at least two distinguishable mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2003751281,"Two series of deletion mutants have been constructed in the 5'-flanking DNA of a variant methionine tRNA gene of X. laevis. When assayed in homologous cell-free extracts, mutants of both series are expressed at very different levels and they initiate transcription at either or both of the two major sites used by the wild-type gene. No similarities are evident in the 5'-flanking regions of well expressed mutants, but two DNA segments are identified that inhibit transcription. The most inhibitory one, between residues -20 and -12, consists of 9 bp of alternating purines and pyrimidines: TGCGCGTGC. The second has only a weak inhibitory effect when in its normal location from -43 to -32, but it can reduce transcription severely when brought closer to the gene; it is composed of 12 bp of alternating purines and pyrimidines with one residue out of alternation: ATGCACAGCGCA. The composition of these tracts has some possible implications for their conformation, which may account for their inhibition of gene expression."

Pharyngitis, the most common problem for which patients seek medical care in the United States, may be caused by nonviral, potentially treatable organisms more often than had been suspected."
https://openalex.org/W1525955379,"Rat ovarian granulosa cells were isolated from immature female rats after stimulation with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and maintained in culture. Proteoglycans were labeled with [35S]sulfate, [3H]glucosamine, [3H]serine, or [3H]mannose as precursors. A low buoyant density dermatan sulfate proteoglycan was separated from a larger hydrodynamic size, high buoyant density dermatan sulfate proteoglycan and from a heparan sulfate proteoglycan using DEAE-Sephacel and Sepharose CL-4B chromatography under dissociative conditions in the presence of detergent. This low buoyant density dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, which constituted approximately 30% of the 35S-labeled proteoglycans in the culture medium, has a relatively small hydrodynamic size (Kd = 0.45 on Sepharose CL-4B) and shows a broad buoyant density distribution in CsCl density gradients, primarily due to the heterogeneity in glycosaminoglycan composition. The average molecular weight of the protein coreoligosaccharide complex obtained by chondroitinase ABC digestion of the proteoglycan was estimated to be approximately 230,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After digestion with chondroitinase ABC, the dermatan sulfate chains (average Mr = 33,000) yielded 81% 4-sulfated disaccharides and 17% disulfated disaccharides (sulfate groups on the 6-position of the galNAc and probably on the 2-position of the iduronic acid). Alkaline borohydride treatment of this proteoglycan released three distinct size species of oligosaccharides; a species of N-linked oligosaccharide which contains mannose, glcNAc, and sialic acid, and two species of O-linked oligosaccharides. Trypsin digestion of the proteoglycan generated fragments which contain (a) glycosaminoglycan-peptides with an average of 2 dermatan sulfate chains, (b) clusters of O-linked oligosaccharide-peptides, and (c) N-linked oligosaccharide-peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1962620463,"We have developed a fast and reliable method for the separation of two membrane fractions respectively enriched in outer and inner envelope membranes from isolated, intact, purified spinach chloroplasts kept in a hypertonic medium (0.6 M mannitol). This separation was achieved by osmotically shrinking the inner envelope membrane, thus widening the intermembrane space, and then subsequently removing the loosened outer envelope membrane by applying low pressure to the shrunken chloroplasts and slowly extruding them through the small aperture of a Yeda press under controlled conditions. By centrifugation of the mixture obtained through a discontinuous sucrose gradient, we were able to separate two membrane fractions having different densities (fraction 2 or light fraction, d = 1.08 g/cm3, and fraction 3 or heavy fraction, d = 1.13 g/cm3). The recent characterization of polypeptides localized on the outer envelope membrane from spinach chloroplasts, E10 and E24 (Joyard, J., Billecocq, A., Bartlett, S. G., Block, M. A., Chua, N.-H., and Douce, R. J. Biol. Chem., 258, 10000-10006) enabled us to characterize our two membrane fractions. Analyses of the polypeptides by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting have shown that fraction 2 (light fraction) was completely devoid of polypeptide E30, which is involved in the transport of phosphate across the inner envelope membrane, but was enriched in polypeptides E10 and E24. The reverse was true for fraction 3 (heavy fraction). Under these conditions, it is clear that fraction 2 is strongly enriched in outer envelope membrane whereas fraction 3 consisted mostly of inner envelope membrane. Indeed, by immunoelectrophoresis, we were able to demonstrate that, on a protein basis, fraction 2 contained about 90% of outer membrane, whereas fraction 3 contained about 80% of inner membrane. Further characterization of the outer envelope membrane was achieved by using thermolysin, a nonpenetrant protease."
https://openalex.org/W1672160734,"Histamine N-methyltransferase is a major enzyme for inactivating histamine in mammalian tissues. Development of a sensitive and specific assay for histamine N-methyltransferase has permitted quantification of this activity in 25 rat tissues. Additionally, renal histamine N-methyltransferase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The pivotal step in the purification scheme was an affinity column procedure which involved the specific elution of histamine N-methyltransferase from DEAE-Sephacel by 1 mM histamine. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 33,400 and a narrow pH dependency with an optimum at 8.0-8.25. Specific antibody produced to renal histamine N-methyltransferase also immunoprecipitated the brain enzyme completely, therefore indicating neuronal and non-neuronal histamine N-methyltransferase share common antigenic determinants."

Two plasmid constructions encoded hybrid proteins that reacted with antibodies against D. melanogaster RNA polymerase II. Use of subunit-specific antibodies indicated that these hybrid proteins displayed antigenic determinants unique to the largest polypeptide (215 kDa) of the enzyme. This RpII locus, the site at which mutations to amanitin-resistance occur, must therefore encode the largest polymerase II subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1605980863,"The relationship between post-translational modifications of macromolecules and their intracellular routing is of fundamental importance. The availability of the indolizidine alkaloid, swainsonine, which interferes with glycoprotein processing, provides a new probe for studying relationships between glycosylation of proteins and their cellular routing. Using fibronectin as a model glycoprotein, we have explored the effect of swainsonine upon oligosaccharide structure, glycoprotein synthesis, and secretion. Confluent human fibroblasts were labeled with radioactive mannose or glucosamine in the presence or absence of swainsonine. Fibronectin was secreted into the medium of swainsonine-treated cultures and found to contain endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides, instead of the normal complex endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant oligosaccharides. Pronase-released glycopeptides and hydrazine-released oligosaccharides of isolated fibronectin from the culture media were analyzed using endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and specific exoglycosidase digestions in conjunction with calibrated gel filtration chromatography. The structure of the swainsonine-modified endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive oligosaccharide was found to be a hybrid type, Gal beta leads to GlcNAc beta leads to Man alpha leads to [Man alpha leads to (Man alpha leads to) Man alpha leads to]Man beta leads to GlcNAc beta leads to (+/- Fuc alpha leads to)-GlcNAc. Other experiments showed that the synthesis and secretion of fibronectin were not affected by its change in glycosylation. The results also infer that swainsonine inhibits Golgi mannosidase II in intact cells, and that removal of two mannose residues by that mannosidase is not a prerequisite for addition of galactose to the existing peripheral nonreducing GlcNAc or for the addition of fucose to the innermost reducing GlcNAc. The composite results indicate that significant changes in oligosaccharide structure had little effect upon the routing and cellular release of a typical N-asparagine-linked glycoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W2126497628,"We have determined the organization and transcription of a Drosophila DNA segment coding for the purine pathway enzyme, GAR transformylase. Because the transcript encoding this enzyme is very rare, we used a novel method for exon mapping without isolating a cDNA. Our results suggest a long polypeptide having multiple domains, with GAR transformylase at the COOH terminus preceded by an extensive repeat. Part of the same DNA segment specifies a shorter transcript, which consists of the same 5' exons but lacks the last three 3' exons. A polyadenylation signal within an intron allows this single gene to encode two polypeptides. We hypothesize that alternative processing of a transcript is a basis for channeling metabolic intermediates into two different pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1503831983,"Mutant mouse lymphoma cells that overproduce ornithine decarboxylase have been generated by selection for resistance to difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of the enzyme. Starting with wild type S49 mouse lymphoma cells, sensitive to growth inhibition by 10 microM difluoromethylornithine, we obtained the Z.12 line, which is approximately 100 times more resistant to that drug (McConlogue, L., and Coffino, P. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8384-8388). Subsequent selection for still higher levels of resistance was applied to the Z.12 cells and resulted in the generation of the D4.1 line, resistant to 10 mM difluoromethylornithine. The relative synthesis of ornithine decarboxylase in wild type, Z.12, and D4.1 cells was assessed by pulse labeling these cells with [35S]methionine and analyzing the radiolabeled proteins directly, or after immunoprecipitation, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. As shown previously, the rate of ornithine decarboxylase synthesis is augmented in Z.12 as compared to wild type. In D4.1 cells, the rate of synthesis of ornithine decarboxylase exceeds that of any other single protein; about 15% of total protein synthesis is devoted to the enzyme. The relative amounts of translatable ornithine decarboxylase mRNA in each cell line was determined by in vitro translation of extracted RNA. These results showed that the relative rate of synthesis in each cell line is a reflection of the cell's relative content of translatable ornithine decarboxylase mRNA. Examination of the chromosomes of wild type and D4.1 cells revealed that the former are pseudodiploid and the latter tetraploid. Two of the four chromosomes 14 in D4.1 contain large homogeneously staining regions, a finding consistent with the presence of regions of gene amplification."

https://openalex.org/W2412099857,"NADPH-dependent oxygen utilization by liver microsomal fractions was stimulated by the addition of increasing concentrations of butylated hydroxyanisole concomitant with the inhibition of benzphetamine N-demethylase activity. The apparent conversion of monooxygenase activity to an oxidase-like activity in the presence of the antioxidant was correlated with the partial recovery of the reducing equivalents from NADPH in the form of increased hydrogen peroxide production. The progress curve of liver microsomal NADPH oxidase activity in the presence of butylated hydroxyanisole displayed a lag phase indicative of the formation of a metabolite capable of uncoupling the monooxygenase activity. Ethyl acetate extracts of microsomal reaction mixtures obtained in the presence of butylated hydroxyanisole, oxygen, and NADPH stimulated the NADPH oxidase activity of either liver microsomes or purified NADPH-cytochrome c (P-450) reductase. Using high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry techniques, two metabolites of butylated hydroxyanisole, namely t-butylhydroquinone and t-butylquinone, were identified. The quinone metabolite and/or its 1-electron reduction product interact with the flavoprotein reductase to directly link the enzyme to the reduction of oxygen which results in an inhibition of the catalytic activity of the cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase."

https://openalex.org/W1551458838,"Isozyme-specific enzymatic activities, radial immunodiffusion, and Western blotting were used to study the effects of phenobarbital, Aroclor 1260, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on microsomal levels of cytochrome P-450 forms 2, 5, and 6. The pulmonary concentration of form 2 was decreased to trace levels by the administration of Aroclor 1260 but not TCDD; co-administration of phenobarbital did not mitigate the decrease. The pulmonary concentration of form 5 was not significantly changed following treatment with Aroclor 1260, phenobarbital, or TCDD. The pulmonary content of form 6 was increased 5- and 10-fold by administration of Aroclor 1260 and TCDD, respectively, and decreased 2-fold by treatment with phenobarbital. Further, phenobarbital antagonized the induction of form 6 by Aroclor 1260 but not by TCDD. In the liver, increases and decreases in form 2-mediated benzphetamine N-demethylation were observed following treatment with Aroclor 1260 depending on the time after dose and individual rabbit response. Hepatic induction of form 2 by phenobarbital was significantly decreased by co-administration of Aroclor 1260. However, form 5 was induced in the liver by either Aroclor 1260 or phenobarbital or both. Thus, the effect of Aroclor 1260 on the control of the concentration of form 2 is independent of that of form 5 in the lung and liver. Fractionation of the Aroclor 1260 to remove co-planar polychlorinated biphenyls and dibenzofurans was useful in demonstrating that the pulmonary induction of form 6 was dependent on these components and unrelated to the repression of form 2 in the lung and liver. The apparent repressive effect of phenobarbital on form 6 in the lung is interesting as it suggests an interaction between phenobarbital and polycyclic hydrocarbon-mediated induction."
https://openalex.org/W1604051618,"Glucose (16.7 mM)-induced insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets of rats was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone (phenidone), 3-amino-1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-pyrazoline (BW755C), 2,3,5-trimethyl-6-(12-hydroxy-5,10-dodecadiynyl)-1,4-benzoquinone (AA861), and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT). Indomethacin and aspirin, however, failed to inhibit the glucose-induced insulin secretion but rather tended to enhance it. The glucose-induced insulin secretion was inhibited by 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) (50 microM), 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) (100 microM), and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) (100 microM), but not by 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) (100 microM). Exogenous 5-HETE (10 microM) induced significant insulin secretion in a low glucose (3.3 mM) medium. Racemic 5-HETE also showed insulinotropic effect in a concentration-dependent manner with the concentrations 20 microM or above, whereas 12-HETE, 15-HETE, 15-HPETE, 5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, 5-hydroxy-6-glutathionyl-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, 5-hydroxy-6-cysteinylglycinyl-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, prostaglandin E2, and prostaglandin F2 alpha failed to induce insulin secretion. Although significant insulin release was observed with arachidonic acid (greater than or equal to 100 microM), reduce cell viability was evident at 200 microM. When the 10,000 X g supernatant of isolated pancreatic islet homogenate was incubated with [3H]arachidonic acid at 37 degrees C in the presence of GSH and Ca2+, and the labeled metabolites then extracted with ethyl acetate and subjected to reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, several radioactive peaks, coeluted with authentic 15-, 12-, and 5-HETE, were observed. The radioactive peaks were completely suppressed by the addition of either NDGA, BW755C, or phenidone into the medium. The results support our contention i.e. the involvement of lipoxygenase product(s) in the secretory mechanism of insulin, and further suggest that 5-lipoxygenase system may play a role."
https://openalex.org/W260998659,"The complete amino acid sequences of three cyanogen bromide peptide fragments (CB3, CB4, and CB50 of type 24 M protein extracted from Streptococcus pyogenes by limited pepsin digestion were determined by automated Edman degradation of the uncleaved peptides and their tryptic peptides. CB3 and CB4 each contain 35 amino acid residues, whereas CB5 contains 37. The sequence of CB3 was found to be: (formula: see text) (where Hse represents homoserine). The sequence of CB4 was identical except for amino acid substitutions of arginine and glutamine at positions 23 and 24, respectively. The sequence of CB5 also was identical with that of CB3 except for substitutions of aspartic acids at positions 28 and 29; leucine, glutamic acid, and glycine at positions 33, 34, and 35, respectively; and an additional two amino acids, alanine and homoserine, at positions 36 and 37, respectively. A comparison of the structures of these three peptide fragments with those previously reported for CB6 and CB7 revealed as few as one to six amino acid substitutions among the five repeating peptides; CB4 and CB6 differed only by a single Asp/Glu substitution at position 26. When covalently linked to polylysine and injected as an emulsion in complete Freund's adjuvant, CB3, CB4, and CB5 each evoked high titers of type-specific opsonic and bactericidal antibodies in rabbits. A chemically synthesized peptide identical with native CB3 except that it contained methionine instead of homoserine at its COOH terminus was similarly immunogenic. None of the conjugated native or synthetic peptides raised antibodies at reacted in immunofluorescence tests with sarcolemmal membranes of human heart tissue. Mapping studies with monoclonal antibodies revealed a number of distinct protective and nonprotective epitopes. The single Asp/Glu substitution between CB4 and CB4 rendered the 35-residue peptide unrecognizable by protective monoclonal antibodies but recognizable by a nonprotective one. Our studies demonstrate that the repeating covalent structures of native and chemically synthesized polypeptide fragments of streptococcal M protein possess several unique as well as repeating epitopes that evoke opsonic and presumably protective, but not heart cross-reactive, antibodies against a rheumatogenic strain of S. pyogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1489744792,"Bacillus subtilis glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.47) has been purified from sporulating cell extract to apparent homogeneity (as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing). The enzyme purified as a single molecular species with no evidence for a multiple form of the enzyme. The B. subtilis glucose dehydrogenase has an apparent isoelectric point of 4.7-4.8 and an apparent Mr = 126,000 and is comprised of four subunits of Mr = 31,500 each. The glucose 2-deoxyglucose and glucosamine substrate specificity of the enzyme is similar to the substrate specificity for B. subtilis spore germination, suggesting that the spore glucose dehydrogenase may play some role in spore germination. The B. subtilis glucose dehydrogenase is extremely dependent on the presence of glycerol or other hydrophobic bond-stabilizing agents (or NAD) for retention of enzymatic activity, and the presence of glycerol (20% w/v) in the extraction and purification buffers was absolutely necessary for the successful purification of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1512565762,"The selection of Chinese hamster ovary cells resistant to ornithine analogues has been extended to very high levels of the suicide inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine. Stepwise selections resulted in stepwise increases in the inducible levels of ornithine decarboxylase activity. The enzyme is shown by several criteria to be normal in every respect: regulation in the cell cycle, inhibition by antizyme, absolute specific activity as determined with the help of alpha-[3H]difluoromethylornithine. The enzyme has been highly purified from such overproducing cells. The subunit molecular weight of the mammalian enzyme has been confirmed to be approximately 54,000. The location of the enzyme in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was determined, and the protein could be detected on two-dimensional gels with extracts from our best overproducers."
https://openalex.org/W1581942917,"Growing cultures of Ashbya gossypii were supplemented with various 13C-labeled precursors including [1-13C]acetate, [2-13C]acetate, [1-13C]ribose, [1-13C]glucose, [6-13C]glucose, and [2-13C]glycerol. Riboflavin was isolated from the culture medium, chemically converted to riboflavin tetraacetate, and analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The xylene ring of riboflavin is formed by dismutation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, thus the 8 carbon atoms of the riboflavin xylene ring are composed of 4 biochemically different carbon atoms which are duplicated in the dismutation. The formation of the lumazine from a pyrimidine precursor requires the addition of these 4 carbon atoms which constitute C-6 alpha, C-6, C-7, and C-7 alpha of the lumazine. Results from the present work indicate that these 4 carbon atoms do not arise from acetate, diacetyl, acetoin, or a tetrose, nor from loss of 1 or 2 carbon atoms from either end of a pentose or hexose. Additionally, the data do not support the recent contention that these 4 atoms arise via a dismutation of the pyrimidine precursor of the lumazine. The findings show that there exists a close correspondence between the lumazine carbons 6 alpha, 6, and 7 with C-1, C-2, and C-3, respectively, of a pentose, while C-7 alpha corresponds to C-5 rather than C-4 of a pentose. This in conjunction with results reported earlier indicates an intramolecular rearrangement involving carbons 3, 4, and 5 of a pentose or its biochemical equivalent."

https://openalex.org/W1614324901,"The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration of calcium-tolerant rat myocytes has been measured by the null point titration technique using arsenazo III as a Ca2+ indicator and digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane. The mean value obtained for 8 separate preparations was 270 +/- 35 nM. The distribution of releasable calcium between the mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic reticular compartments was measured by the successive additions of uncoupler and A23187 to cells pretreated with ruthenium red. The relative distribution of calcium in each pool was independent of the cell calcium content up to the maximum value of releasable calcium investigated (4.5 nmol/mg of cell dry weight) and was distributed in the approximate ratio of 2:1 in favor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The cells contained 1 nmol of calcium/mg of cell dry weight in a form nonreleasable by A23187, which was independent of the total cell calcium content as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. It is calculated that the calcium content of mitochondria in heart under physiological conditions is about 5 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein. At this level, the mitochondria are likely to provide effective buffering of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration of quiescent heart cells. The corresponding intramitochondrial free Ca2+ is in a range above values needed to regulate the activity of Ca2+-dependent enzymes of the citric acid cycle in heart. The physiological calcium content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in heart cells is estimated to be about 2.5 nmol/mg of cell dry weight, which is at least 5-fold greater than the amount of calcium release calculated to cause maximum tension development of cardiac muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1574964963,"UDP-glucuronyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17) in intact, untreated microsomes from pig liver is activated by relatively low concentrations of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. This property is absent after treatment of microsomes with detergents or phospholipases, and also is not a characteristic of pure, delipidated enzyme. Sensitivity to activation by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was reconstituted, however, by incorporation of pure, delipidated enzyme into unilamellar bilayers of phosphatidylcholine that were in a gel phase. Warming of these bilayers to just above the temperature for the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition led to an abrupt loss of sensitivity of UDP-glucuronyltransferase to activation by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. These experiments establish that sensitivity to activation by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine is an inherent property of UDP-glucuronyltransferase. The data also suggest that the lipid environment of UDP-glucuronyltransferase in intact, untreated microsomes can modulate the sensitivity of this enzyme to allosteric activation by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and that this lipid environment is in a gel phase in intact microsomes at 37 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1664108429,"32P-labeled perfused rat hearts were used to study the hormonal regulation of glycogen synthase. Following equilibration of perfused hearts with inorganic [32P]phosphate for 30 min, there was an incorporation of approximately 200 pmol of [32P]phosphate/unit of enzyme activity that arose from an exchange of [32P] phosphate with the endogenous [31P]phosphate. Maximum insulin-induced activation (10 milliunits/ml for 5 min), which promoted an I/D activity ratio change from 25% I to 40% I, was associated with a 22% decrease in phosphate content of the enzyme. With hearts from alloxan-induced diabetic animals, there was a 17% higher level of phosphate incorporation and a 4-fold decrease in % I glycogen synthase activity compared to normal animals, but with the diabetic tissue, insulin added to the perfusate had no effect on either the phosphate content or the activity ratio of the enzyme. In perfused hearts from normal animals, DL-isoproterenol and glucagon caused an increase in glycogen synthase phosphorylation of 85-100 pmol/unit of enzyme activity, while L-phenylephrine increased the phosphate content by only 20-35 pmol, but all three hormones caused the same degree of inactivation. The increase in cardiac glycogen synthase phosphorylation induced by DL-isoproterenol, glucagon, and L-phenylephrine was identical, with or without insulin pretreatment; this despite the fact that these three hormones promoted a 3- to 4-fold larger decrease in the enzyme activity ratio with the insulin-treated tissue. In perfused diabetic hearts, DL-isoproterenol, glucagon, and L-phenylephrine caused increased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase without affecting the albeit already low activity ratio of the enzyme. These results show that in the intact perfused heart the same degree of glycogen synthase inactivation can occur as a consequence of differing degrees of phosphorylation, presumably due to phosphorylation at different sites promoted by different second messengers. Conversely, the data indicate that the same extent of phosphorylation, as stimulated by the same second messenger, can inactivate glycogen synthase by different amounts depending upon the prior phosphorylation state of other sites in the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1536177736,"The conjugated alpha-keto acid (E)-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-oxo-3-butenoic acid, a suicide substrate (Kuo, D. J., and Jordan, F. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 3735-3740), when reacted with brewer's yeast pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1), was found to produce a new absorption band centered at 440 nm. The band was attributed to the formation of a thiamindiphosphate-bound intermediate produced upon decarboxylation and was not observed in the absence of either thiamindiphosphate or apoprotein. Simultaneously, with the appearance of the spectral band, the enzyme was inactivated irreversibly. The combined evidence suggested that the spectral band pertains to an enzyme-bound conjugated enamine and the results constitute the first direct observation of such an intermediate in any thiamindiphosphate requiring enzymatic reaction. It could be concluded that for the alpha-keto acid employed, CO2 loss and C-protonation of the enamine take place in a stepwise, rather than concerted, manner and that the steps culminating in CO2 loss are faster overall than the subsequent steps that lead to the release of the product. The observation of stoichiometric concentration of enzyme-bound enamine intermediate supports the previous suggestion that alpha-hydroxyethyl thiamindiphosphate is not the true intermediate, but rather the enamine is (Ullrich, J., and Mannshreck, A. (1967) Eur. J. Biochem 1, 110-116)."
https://openalex.org/W1492725668,"Abstract Effective resolution of detergent-solubilized Tetrahymena microsomal cytochrome b560ms, which is similar to mammalian cytochrome b5, was obtained by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration. On the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight of Tetrahymena cytochrome b560ms is 22,000. The absorption peaks are 414 nm in the oxidized form and 560, 528, and 425 nm in the dithionite-reduced form. The alpha-peak of the reduced form, which is situated at 560 nm and asymmetric with a shoulder at 556 nm, is different from that of mammalian liver microsomal cytochrome b5. The spectra of the reduced and the oxidized cytochrome b560ms are not altered by the presence of cyanide, azide, and carbon monoxide. The alpha-peak is resolved into two distinct peaks at 551 and 558 nm at low temperature. The absorption peaks at 557, 527, and 418 nm in the pyridine ferrohemochrome spectrum indicate that protoheme is the prosthetic group of the purified b-type cytochrome. The oxidation-reduction potential (E'0) is -42 mV. It is reducible by NADH in the presence of an NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase purified from rat liver microsomes. The present results suggest that the pathways of electrons to microsomal cytochrome b560ms-linked oxidative desaturation of fatty acyl-CoA in protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis are via either of the two microsomal flavoprotein reductases, NADH-ferricyanide reductase or NADPH-cytochrome c reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1494600407,"Abstract A photoaffinity analogue of UDP-galactose, 4-azido-2-nitrophenyluridylyl pyrophosphate (ANUP), has been synthesized for the investigation of the binding topography of alpha-lactalbumin on galactosyltransferase. Results obtained from steady state kinetics show that ANUP is an effective competitive inhibitor against UDP-galactose in the reactions of lactose and N-acetyllactosamine syntheses. The specific binding of ANUP to the UDP-galactose-binding site is further demonstrated by its ability to facilitate the formation of the lactose synthase complex on solid supports, either alone or in the presence of glucose or N-acetyl-glucosamine. ANUP inactivates galactosyltransferase on irradiation. One mole of ANUP was incorporated per mol of enzyme inactivated. This process is Mn2+-dependent and can be prevented by UDP-galactose. Glucose and N-acetylglucosamine render only partial protection. Photoaffinity labeling of lactose synthase either free in solution or immobilized on Sepharose does not result in any reduction of the alpha-lactalbumin modifier activity. In addition, no incorporation of radioactivity into alpha-lactalbumin was observed when radioactive ANUP was used, whereas galactosyltransferase was labeled. These data indicate that alpha-lactalbumin does not bind to galactosyltransferase in the region of the ANUP site, suggesting that the location of protein-protein interaction between the two subunits of lactose synthase may be removed from the UDP-galactose-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1513132053,"The VA RNA genes of human adenoviruses are transcribed by RNA polymerase III and, like other RNA polymerase III transcriptional units, contain internal regulatory regions. By means of a scheme for directed mutagenesis which employs a deletion mutation to define the target, point mutations have been induced in the regulatory region of a cloned VAI gene. One mutant plasmid which fails to direct VAI transcription and several others which direct the synthesis of normal amounts of RNA of aberrant electrophoretic mobilities were identified using an in vitro transcription assay. The nucleotide sequences of the regulatory regions of three of these plasmids have been determined. All three contain mutations which fall in a block of nucleotides whose sequence (GGTTCGANNCC) is highly conserved in RNA polymerase III promoters (Galli, G., Hofstetter, H., and Birnstiel, M. L. (1981) Nature (Lond.) 294, 626-631). The VAI-negative mutant (pRR5028) contains a G leads to A transition mutation at the second position, which is invariant in functional RNA polymerase III promoters. One mobility variant carries three point mutations, including one G leads to A base change at the position adjacent on the 5' side to that altered in pRR5028. The third mutant contains a single C leads to T transition mutation, in the final position of the conserved block."

The chloride effect on the p50 values of Hb S and Hb M was identical to that of Hb A. In contrast, the effect of chloride on the p50 values of Hb Y was only 20% of that of Hb A. Cross-linking between the two beta 82 lysyl residues with fumarate decreased the chloride effect by 40%. The effect of chloride on cross-linked Hb Y, in which both beta 82 lysyl and beta 146 histidyl residues were modified, was unchanged from that on Hb Y (20% of Hb A). The effect of chloride on the p50 value of SY asymmetrical hybrid hemoglobin was 40% of that of Hb A or Hb S, which is midway between the values obtained for cross-linked Hb S and Hb Y. From these results, the contribution of beta 146 His and beta 82 Lys on oxygen affinity by binding of chloride was calculated to be 40% each; the remaining 20% chloride effect was attributed to alpha 1 Val."

This revealed the presence of equal amounts of two major oligonucleotides having structures of m7Gppp(Np)7 and m7Gppp(Np)4 plus minor amounts of m7Gppp(Np)2 and m7GpppNp. The total mRNAlys contained the cap structures m7Gpppm6Am, m7GpppGm, m7GpppAm, m7GpppCm, m7GpppA, and m7GpppG, in decreasing order of abundance. The m7Gppp(Np)7 oligonucleotide contained only A-caps and the m7Gppp(Np)4, only G-caps. 32P-labeled 5'-terminal T1-oligonucleotides were prepared, and at least 12 different types were observed, the most abundant being m7Gppp(Np)7 and m7Gppp(Np)4. Their sequences were determined to be m7Gppp(m6)AmNmUCCCG and m7GpppGmNmAG. Taken together with the findings of Grez et al. (Grez, M., Land, H., Giesecke, K., Schutz, G., Jung, A., and Sippel, A. E.
