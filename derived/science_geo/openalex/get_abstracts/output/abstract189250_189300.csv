https://openalex.org/W2029232177,"Adaptive behavior is optimized in organisms that maintain flexible representations of the value of sensory-predictive cues. To identify central representations of predictive reward value in humans, we used reinforcer devaluation while measuring neural activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We presented two arbitrary visual stimuli, both before and after olfactory devaluation, in a paradigm of appetitive conditioning. In amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, responses evoked by a predictive target stimulus were decreased after devaluation, whereas responses to the nondevalued stimulus were maintained. Thus, differential activity in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex encodes the current value of reward representations accessible to predictive cues."
https://openalex.org/W1997179110,"Cell division in many mammalian tissues is associated with specific times of day, but just how the circadian clock controls this timing has not been clear. Here, we show in the regenerating liver (of mice) that the circadian clock controls the expression of cell cycle–related genes that in turn modulate the expression of active Cyclin B1-Cdc2 kinase, a key regulator of mitosis. Among these genes, expression of wee1 was directly regulated by the molecular components of the circadian clockwork. In contrast, the circadian clockwork oscillated independently of the cell cycle in single cells. Thus, the intracellular circadian clockwork can control the cell-division cycle directly and unidirectionally in proliferating cells."
https://openalex.org/W2046306550,"The FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex is required for transcript elongation through nucleosomes by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in vitro. Here, we show that FACT facilitates Pol II-driven transcription by destabilizing nucleosomal structure so that one histone H2A-H2B dimer is removed during enzyme passage. We also demonstrate that FACT possesses intrinsic histone chaperone activity and can deposit core histones onto DNA. Importantly, FACT activity requires both of its constituent subunits and is dependent on the highly acidic C terminus of its larger subunit, Spt16. These findings define the mechanism by which Pol II can transcribe through chromatin without disrupting its epigenetic status."
https://openalex.org/W2085759022,"Previous studies have suggested that transcription elongation results in changes in chromatin structure. Here we present studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt6, a conserved protein implicated in both transcription elongation and chromatin structure. Our results show that, surprisingly, an spt6 mutant permits aberrant transcription initiation from within coding regions. Furthermore, transcribed chromatin in the spt6 mutant is hypersensitive to micrococcal nuclease, and this hypersensitivity is suppressed by mutational inactivation of RNA polymerase II. These results suggest that Spt6 plays a critical role in maintaining normal chromatin structure during transcription elongation, thereby repressing transcription initiation from cryptic promoters. Other elongation and chromatin factors, including Spt16 and histone H3, appear to contribute to this control."

We found that VacA could efficiently block proliferation of T cells by inducing a G1/S cell cycle arrest. It interfered with the T cell receptor/interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling pathway at the level of the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a transcription factor acting as a global regulator of immune response genes, was abrogated, resulting in down-regulation of IL-2 transcription. VacA partially mimicked the activity of the immunosuppressive drug FK506 by possibly inducing a local immune suppression, explaining the extraordinary chronicity of Hp infections."
https://openalex.org/W1972758800,"In memory consolidation, the memory trace stabilizes and becomes resistant to certain amnesic agents. The textbook account is that for any memorized item, consolidation starts and ends just once. However, evidence has accumulated that upon activation in retrieval, the trace may reconsolidate. Whereas some authors reported transient renewed susceptibility of retrieved memories to consolidation blockers, others could not detect it. Here, we report that in both conditioned taste aversion in the rat and fear conditioning in the medaka fish, the stability of retrieved memory is inversely correlated with the control of behavior by that memory. This result may explain some conflicting findings on reconsolidation of activated memories."
https://openalex.org/W2105840785,"There is evidence for strong functional antagonistic interactions between adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) and dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs). Although a close physical interaction between both receptors has recently been shown using co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays, the existence of a A2AR-D2R protein-protein interaction still had to be demonstrated in intact living cells. In the present work, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) techniques were used to confirm the occurrence of A2AR-D2R interactions in co-transfected cells. The degree of A2AR-D2R heteromerization, measured by BRET, did not vary after receptor activation with selective agonists, alone or in combination. BRET competition experiments were performed using a chimeric D2R-D1R in which helices 5 and 6, the third intracellular loop (I3), and the third extracellular loop (E3) of the D2R were replaced by those of the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R). Although the wild type D2R was able to decrease the BRET signal, the chimera failed to achieve any effect. This suggests that the helix 5-I3-helix 6-E3 portion of D2R holds the site(s) for interaction with A2AR. Modeling of A2AR and D2R using a modified rhodopsin template followed by molecular dynamics and docking simulations gave essentially two different possible modes of interaction between D2R and A2AR. In the most probable one, helix 5 and/or helix 6 and the N-terminal portion of I3 from D2R approached helix 4 and the C-terminal portion of the C-tail from the A2AR, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2058241451,An ultracold molecular quantum gas is created by application of a magnetic field sweep across a Feshbach resonance to a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms. The ability to separate the molecules from the atoms permits direct imaging of the pure molecular sample. Magnetic levitation enables study of the dynamics of the ensemble on extended time scales. We measured ultralow expansion energies in the range of a few nanokelvin for a sample of 3000 molecules. Our observations are consistent with the presence of a macroscopic molecular matter wave.

The carbonates are widely distributed in the martian dust, and there is no indication of a concentrated source. The presence of small concentrations of carbonate minerals in the surface dust and in martian meteorites can sequester several bars of atmospheric carbon dioxide and may have been an important sink for a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere in the martian past."
https://openalex.org/W1971196679,"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription through nucleosomes is facilitated in vitro by the protein complex FACT ( Fa cilitates C hromatin T ranscription). Here we show that FACT is associated with actively transcribed Pol II genes on Drosophila polytene chromosomes. FACT displays kinetics of recruitment and of chromosome tracking in vivo similar to Pol II and elongation factors Spt5 and Spt6. Interestingly, FACT does not colocalize with Pol III–transcribed genes, which are known to undergo nucleosome transfer rather than disassembly in vitro. Our observations are consistent with FACT being restricted to transcription that involves nucleosome disassembly mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1996883746,"A major West Antarctic ice stream discharges by sudden and brief periods of very rapid motion paced by oceanic tidal oscillations of about 1 meter. Acceleration to speeds greater than 1 meter per hour and deceleration back to a stationary state occur in minutes or less. Slip propagates at approximately 88 meters per second, suggestive of a shear wave traveling within the subglacial till. A model of an episodically slipping friction-locked fault reproduces the observed quasi-periodic event timing, demonstrating an ice stream's ability to change speed rapidly and its extreme sensitivity to subglacial conditions and variations in sea level."
https://openalex.org/W1988712957,"Early events required for induction of apoptosis by CD95 are preassociation of CD95, the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and clustering of CD95 in distinct membrane domains. Here, we identify the molecular ordering of these events and show that the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) functions upstream of the DISC to mediate CD95 clustering in ceramide-enriched membrane platforms, an event that is required for DISC formation. Experiments in ASM-deficient cells revealed that CD95 ligation, in the absence of ceramide generation, triggers <1% of full caspase 8 activation at the receptor. This event, however, is both necessary and sufficient to trigger translocation of ASM onto the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, ASM activation and ceramide release, but insufficient for apoptosis induction. Ceramide-mediated CD95 clustering then amplifies the primary CD95 signaling and drives the second step of CD95 signaling, that is, formation of the DISC yielding 100% caspase activity and apoptosis. These studies suggest that the most parsimonious interpretation of the molecular ordering of the earliest events in CD95 signaling, at least in some cells, is: CD95 ligation-->1% of maximum caspase 8 activation-->ASM translocation-->ceramide generation-->CD95 clustering-->DISC formation-->100% of maximum caspase 8 activation-->apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1973050277,"XRCC1 participates in DNA single strand break and base excision repair (BER) to preserve genetic stability in mammalian cells. XRCC1 participation in these pathways is mediated by its interactions with several of the acting enzymes. Here, we report that XRCC1 interacts physically and functionally with hOGG1, the human DNA glycosylase that initiates the repair by BER of the mutagenic oxidized base 8-oxoguanine. This interaction leads to a 2- to 3-fold stimulation of the DNA glycosylase activity of hOGG1. XRCC1 stimulates the formation of the hOGG1 Schiff-base DNA intermediate without interfering with the endonuclease activity of APE1, the second enzyme in the pathway. On the contrary, the stimulation in the appearance of the incision product seems to reflect the addition of the effects of XRCC1 on the two first enzymes of the pathway. The data presented support a model by which XRCC1 will pass on the DNA intermediate from hOGG1 to the endonuclease APE1. This results in an acceleration of the overall repair process of oxidized purines to yield an APE1-cleaved abasic site, which can be used as a substrate by DNA polymerase β. More importantly, the results unveil a highly coordinated mechanism by which XRCC1, through its multiple protein-protein interactions, extends its orchestrating role from the base excision step to the resealing of the repaired DNA strand.

A major threat to genetic stability is the damaging of DNA by either endogenous or exogenous compounds. This is underscored by the cancer-prone phenotype of human cells defective in DNA repair processes. Exposure of the cellular DNA to reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; 8-oxoG, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine; BER, base excision repair; polβ, polymerase β; Lig3, DNA ligase 3; NTD, N-terminal domain; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PNK, polynucleotide kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; dRP, deoxyribose-5-phosphate; SSBR, single strand break repair. generated either by the normal metabolism of the cell or by chemical and physical exogenous agents, is at the origin of lesions that can have genotoxic or mutagenic consequences. To avoid the effects of ROS and, therefore, to maintain the integrity of their genetic information, organisms have evolved multiple DNA repair mechanisms (1Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Because of its capacity to pair with an adenine during replication, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), an oxidized derivative of guanine, is arguably the major mutagenic lesion in DNA. Indeed, in Escherichia coli, the inactivation of the genes involved in the repair of this oxidized base leads to one of the strongest spontaneous mutator phenotypes, characterized by the exclusive increase in G to T transversions. Like for other ROS-induced modifications of DNA, 8-oxoG is mainly repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. This pathway is initiated by the recognition and excision of the oxidized guanine by a DNA glycosylase, OGG1 being the major one in yeast and mammalian cells (2Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Karaya D.A. Advances in DNA Damage and Repair. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 35-45Crossref Google Scholar). In human cells, the resulting abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)) site can be cleaved by a second enzymatic activity of the hOGG1 polypeptide, namely an AP lyase activity. If such a reaction takes place, the nick produced has a 3′-open aldehyde residue that is supposed to be removed by the 3′-deoxyribose phosphatase activity of APE1, the major AP endonuclease. However, recent data suggest that, once the base is removed by hOGG1, the AP site is cleaved by APE1, bypassing the AP lyase step (3Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 4Vidal A.E. Hickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This would not only make the initial steps of the repair more efficient, but also avoid the exposure of 3′-blocked single strand DNA nicks to the cellular milieu that could lead to cell death or chromosomal instability. The resulting nick would then be used as substrate by DNA polymerase β gap filling and deoxyribose-5-phosphate (dRP) lyase activities. The importance of the coordination of the various steps in the BER pathway is further suggested by the finding of multiple interactions between the proteins of the pathway. In particular, the polypeptide coded by the XRCC1 gene seems to play a central role in coordinating the activities of the enzymes participating in the BER pathway. Abundant evidence has emerged for a critical role of XRCC1 in various DNA repair processes in mammalian cells (5Thompson L.H. West M.G. Mutat Res. 2000; 459: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This gene was identified by its capacity to complement the radiosensitivity of mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (6Thompson L.H. Brookman K.W. Jones N.J. Allen S.A. Carrano A.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6160-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Cells lacking a functional XRCC1 protein are not only hypersensitive to ionizing radiation but also to oxidizing and alkylating agents. Moreover, they display genetic instability, reflected in a elevated spontaneous frequency of chromosomal aberrations and deletions (5Thompson L.H. West M.G. Mutat Res. 2000; 459: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Xrcc1 –/– mice display embryonic lethality (7Tebbs R.S. Flannery M.L. Meneses J.J. Hartmann A. Tucker J.D. Thompson L.H. Cleaver J.E. Pedersen R.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). All these phenotypes point to an essential role for XRCC1 in the maintenance of the DNA repair capacity of the cells. Recent data has associated the presence of XRCC1 polymorphisms to the occurrence of tumors (8Seedhouse C. Bainton R. Lewis M. Harding A. Russell N. Das-Gupta E. Blood. 2002; 100: 3761-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Ladiges W. Wiley J. MacAuley A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2003; 124: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Smith T.R.

Biomarkers Prev. 2002; 11: 1279-1284PubMed Google Scholar). The coordinating role for XRCC1 in BER has been proposed, because this protein, even though devoid of any known enzymatic activity, interacts with all the enzymes involved in BER downstream of the DNA glycosylase, namely APE1 (13Vidal A.E. Boiteux S. Hickson I.D. Radicella J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6530-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), DNA polymerase β (polβ) (14Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), and DNA ligase 3 (Lig3) (16Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interactions can result in a stimulation or stabilization of the corresponding enzyme, as it is the case for APE1 or Lig3, respectively. The complete structure of XRCC1 is not known. However, it is known to possess three distinct globular domains (17Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). An N-terminal domain (NTD) has been characterized by NMR and provides the interface with the DNA polβ (18Marintchev A. Mullen M.A. Maciejewski M.W. Pan B. Gryk M.R. Mullen G.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Two BRCT domains (BRCT1 and 2) mediate the interactions with the PARP proteins (19Schreiber V. Ame J.C. Dolle P. Schultz I.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5207-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), respectively. The two linker regions between the globular domains have been denominated hinges and have been predicted to be unstructured (17Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In single strand break repair (SSBR), the interactions with key enzymes of the pathway, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1), polynucleotide kinase (PNK), polβ, and Lig3 (22Caldecott K.W. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), mediate XRCC1 role. In both SSBR and BER pathways, XRCC1 could be recruited to the DNA by the enzyme recognizing the lesion (APE1 for AP sites and PARP-1 for SSBs) and then could itself capture the downstream activities to the repair intermediates. Likewise, XRCC1, through this scaffolding role, could coordinate the rate and sequence of the enzymatic activities to avoid the exposure of recombinogenic strand breaks, generated as intermediates in both pathways, that could lead to chromosomal rearrangements. Here we explore the role of XRCC1 in the very first step of BER of 8-oxoG initiated by the human DNA glycosylase hOGG1. Oligonucleotide Substrates and Enzymes—The 34-mer oligodeoxynucleotide containing an 8-oxoguanine was labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The 32P-labeled strand was hybridized with a complementary sequence containing a cytosine (C) opposite to the lesion yielding the duplex 8-oxoG:C. The recombinant hOGG1 and APE1 proteins were purified as described (23Audebert M. Radicella J.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2672-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Rothwell D.G. Hang B. Gorman M.A. Freemont P.S. Singer B. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2207-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). hOGG1 was further purified by fixation to an heparin column. The XRCC1 pET16b expression vector was kindly donated by K. Caldecott. His-tagged recombinant XRCC1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 as described before (25Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). After XRCC1 induction, cells from 4 liters of culture (A 600 = 1.3) were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, and sonicated in 150 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 8) with antipain (2.5 μg/ml), aprotinin (2.5 μg/ml), leupeptin (2.5 μg/ml), and lysozyme (1 mg/ml). The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was precipitated with 50% saturation ammonium sulfate. The precipitated proteins containing XRCC1 were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer, desalted on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer with 0.05% Triton X-100 added, and loaded on 1 ml of nickel column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with lysis buffer (plus Triton X-100) containing 40 mm imidazole, and XRCC1 was eluted at 300 mm imidazole. Lysis buffer was exchanged using PD10 against A100 buffer (buffer A: 50 mm NaPO4, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, supplemented with 100 mm NaCl). The protein was loaded on a 1-ml heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in A100 buffer, eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in buffer A and collected at 250 mm NaCl. Two-hybrid Analysis—The full-length hOGG1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using 5′ and 3′ primers that contained SmaI and BamH1 sites, for direct cloning into pGBKT7 (Clontech). Screening of a HeLa cell activation cDNA library cloned in pACT2 (Clontech) using pGBKT7/hOgg1cDNA as bait was performed in AH109 strain following the manufacturer's instructions. The prey plasmids from the positive clones were analyzed by sequencing, and the identity of the inserts was determined using the Genome Data Base Blast Service (www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast). β-Galactosidase liquid assays were performed as described previously (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Values correspond to the mean of two independent experiments. In Vitro Transcription/Translation of XRCC1—In vitro transcription/translation of XRCC1 was performed using a TnT-coupled lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction containing [35S]methionine and the pBS-XRCC1 expression vector was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. Reaction products were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and used for the GST-pull-down experiments with E. coli-expressed GST-hOGG1. GST Pull-down Experiments—An hOGG1 open-reading frame was cloned into plasmid pBC to transiently express a GST-hOGG1 fusion in mammalian cells. The GST-XRCC1141–572 fusion was expressed from the plasmid described by Masson et al. (20Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) in HeLa cells expressing an myc-tagged HOGG1. These cells were obtained by transformation of HeLa cells with a pCDNA3.1 myc vector (Invitrogen) in which the hOGG1 cDNA was cloned (pPR77). The GST pull-down experiments were performed as described (13Vidal A.E. Boiteux S. Hickson I.D. Radicella J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6530-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 20Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). For immunodetection, blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-XRCC1 (20Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-hOGG1 (27Audebert M. Charbonnier J.B. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. DNA Repair (Amst). 2002; 1: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or monoclonal anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For the GST pull-down of the in vitro synthesized 35S-XRCC1, the GST or GST-hOGG1 proteins were expressed in E. coli and fixed to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of GST or GST-hOGG1 proteins (∼25 μg) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated in the presence of the labeled XRCC1 in 250 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) for 15 min at 37 °C. The beads were subsequently washed several times with binding buffer, and the bound proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and scanned using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). 8-oxoG DNA Glycosylase and AP-lyase Assays—In a standard reaction (10-μl final volume), 50 fmol of the 8-oxoG:C-labeled duplex was incubated in glycosylase reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.6) with various amounts of hOGG1, XRCC1, and or APE1. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for the time indicated and stopped on ice with NaOH for the glycosylase assays (0.1 n final concentration) or NaBH4 for the AP-lyase experiment (50 mm final concentration). The reactions were then incubated 5 min at 37 °C and stopped with formamide dye, followed by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. The products of the reactions were resolved by denaturing 20% PAGE (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Gels were scanned, and band intensities were quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager. APE1 Cleavage Assay—In a standard reaction (16-μl final volume), 50 fmol of the 8-oxoG:C-labeled duplex was incubated in APE1 reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mg/ml BSA, pH 8) with various amounts of hOGG1, APE1, and or XRCC1. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C during different times and stopped by adding 6 μl of formamide dye, followed by heating for 5 min at 95 °C. The products of APE1 reactions were analyzed as for the hOGG1 glycosylase assay. Borohydride Trapping Assay—The assay was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min with 10 fmol of 8-oxoG:C-labeled duplex and various amounts of hOGG1, APE1, and or XRCC1. NaBH4 at a final concentration of 50 mm was then added, and incubation continued for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer (1× final) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Trapped complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and scanned using a Storm PhosphorImager. MBP Pull-down Assays—For each of the eight polypeptide-coding sequences, two oligonucleotides were designed for PCR, the first one introducing a EcoRI restriction site on the 5′ extremity and the second a XbaI restriction site on the 3′ end. The oriented amplified sequences, spanning amino acids indicated in Fig. 5, were cloned into pMAL-c2x plasmid (New England Biolabs) in fusion with a maltose-binding protein (MBP) expressing sequence. The plasmid pMAL-c2x, harboring the different XRCC1 domains, was introduced in BL21-Rosetta cells (Invitrogen). Cultures and inductions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Pellets of induced cells were resuspended and sonicated at A = 30 in MBP lysis buffer (20 mm NaPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.2) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, antipain (2.5 μg/ml), aprotinin (2.5 μg/ml), leupeptin (2.5 μg/ml), and lysozyme (1 mg/ml). The lysis solutions were centrifuged at 4 °C during 30 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatants were used in MBP pulldown assays. For each interaction, 30 μl of amylose resin (New England Biolabs), equilibrated in MBP lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, was incubated, for 20 min at 4 °C in a shaker, with an excess (1 ml) of protein extract prepared as described above. The amylose resin was recovered by centrifugation and washed with 1 ml of MBP lysis buffer containing 75 mm NaCl. 1.5 μg of purified hOGG1 or APE1 in 60 μl of this buffer were then added to the resin, and incubation was pursued for another 20 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed twice with 1 ml of MBP lysis buffer containing 75 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were separated on SDS-10% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by Western blot analysis with either rabbit polyclonal anti-APE1 (kind gift from Ian Hickson) or rabbit polyclonal anti-hOGG1 (our laboratory). In parallel, we checked by Coomassie Blue staining that the same amount of each MBP-fused protein was bound to amylose. The Human OGG1 DNA Glycosylase Interacts with XRCC1— Two parallel approaches were used to identify potential protein partners for hOGG1. Specific candidates, mainly other BER proteins, were explored for their potential interaction with hOGG1 in mammalian cells. With that aim, pPR77 plasmid DNA was introduced by transfection into HeLa cells to transiently express a GST-hOGG1 fusion protein. After lysis of the cells, the fusion peptide was purified by affinity to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the associated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting and identified using antibodies against BER proteins. Fig. 1A shows that the XRCC1 protein co-purifies with the GST-hOGG1 fusion from the cell extracts (lane 3). No signal for the XRCC1 protein could be detected when a plasmid coding for GST fused to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was used (lane 2). Conversely, when a GST-XRCC1 fusion was transiently expressed in HeLa cells stably expressing an myc-tagged hOGG1, the glycosylase was found associated to the GST-XRCC1 fusion peptide. This was revealed by the detection of hOGG1 with an antibody against myc only when the cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing the XRCC1 fusion, whereas no signal was observed using a GST-NLS-expressing plasmid (Fig. 1B). The presence of hOGG1 associated to GST-XRCC1 was confirmed by the detection of the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity on the glutathione-Sepharose beads (data not shown). The co-purification from human cell extracts of XRCC1 and hOGG1 shows that these two proteins are associated in mammalian cells, either directly or through interaction with other proteins. Simultaneously, yeast AH109 cells expressing the two-hybrid bait construct pGBKT7-hOGG1 were used for screening a human HeLa cDNA library. From 9.2 × 106 transformants, 250 clones displayed the double adenine/histidine prototrophy, but only 23 clones were obtained possessing an associated β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1C). Sequencing of the cDNA candidates revealed that two of them shared exact homology with the XRCC1 open reading frame (amino acids 141–633), suggesting a direct interaction between hOGG1 and XRCC1. Biochemical evidence for such direct interaction between the two proteins emerged from the specific association of an in vitro synthesized 35S-XRCC1 with a GST-hOGG1 expressed in E. coli (Fig. 1D). Taken together, the data presented demonstrate that XRCC1 interacts with hOGG1 through direct protein-protein contact. XRCC1 Stimulates the DNA Glycosylase Activity of hOGG1—To assess whether the physical interaction between XRCC1 and hOGG1 had an impact in the latter's protein activity, we performed enzymatic tests on an oligonucleotide substrate carrying a single 8-oxoG. To analyze the hOGG1 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1 n NaOH to chemically cleave all the AP sites generated by incubation with hOGG1 in the presence or absence of varying amounts of XRCC1. The addition of an excess of XRCC1 to the hOGG1 reaction mix results in a 2-fold increase in the appearance of cleaved products (Fig. 2, A and B). XRCC1 by itself has no cleavage activity on the 8-oxoG-harboring substrate (Fig. 2A, last lane); therefore, ruling out a contamination of the preparation with a DNA glycosylase capable of removing 8-oxoG from DNA. Furthermore, the stimulation is XRCC1-specific, because an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) has no effect on the enzymatic activity (data not shown), and all reactions were carried out in the presence of an excess of BSA to avoid nonspecific stabilizing effects. To examine whether XRCC1 also stimulates the AP lyase activity of hOGG1, equivalent aliquots of the same reaction mixtures used above were analyzed without addition of NaOH (Fig. 2B). Under conditions where XRCC1 maximally stimulated hOGG1 DNA glycosylase activity, no AP lyase activity was detectable. These results are consistent with the reported dissociation between the DNA glycosylase and AP lyase activities of OGG1 (28Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the course of the reaction carried out by hOGG1 on 8-oxoG-harboring substrates, a Schiff base intermediate is formed (29Nash H.M. Lu R. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This reaction intermediate can be trapped by the formation of a DNA-protein covalent complex in the presence of a reducing agent and detected by denaturing PAGE. We used this approach to further characterize the effect of XRCC1 on the hOGG1 enzymatic activity. Fig. 2C shows that the addition of XRCC1 to the reaction resulted in a 2-fold increase of the sodium borohydride trapping of hOGG1 with 8-oxoG:C-containing duplex oligonucleotide. This stimulation is observed with XRCC1 in only a 6-fold excess with respect to hOGG1, compared with the over 200-fold excess needed to detect the DNA glycosylase stimulation. Because the Schiff base is formed after or simultaneously to the excision of the base, these results suggest that XRCC1 stimulates either the binding of hOGG1 to the damaged DNA or the glycosylase step itself rather than the enzyme turnover. APE1 and XRCC1 Have Additive Effects on hOGG1 Activity—The increased trapping of hOGG1 shown above can be interpreted as a stabilization of the enzyme on its product. Because APE1 has been shown to stimulate the glycosylase activity of hOGG1 by increasing its turnover (3Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 4Vidal A.E. Hickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the presence of XRCC1 interferes with the APE1 stimulation of hOGG1. Surprisingly, the addition of both proteins, APE1 and XRCC1, to the reaction of hOGG1 with an 8-oxoG: C-carrying duplex had an additive effect on the DNA glycosylase activity of hOGG1 (Fig. 3A). Because the reactions were performed in the absence of magnesium and terminated by the addition of NaOH, this assay reveals all the AP sites formed, reflecting the extent of base excision by hOGG1, independently of the incision activities of the proteins. The final product of the reaction, including an active APE1, was analyzed by similar experiments performed in the presence of magnesium (Fig. 3B). In this case, no NaOH was added at the end the reaction. The presence of APE1 increased the yield of the cleaved product as a result of both the stimulation of the glycosylase activity and the processing of the AP sites left by hOGG1. The addition of XRCC1 to the reaction further stimulated the appearance of cleaved substrate. However, the addition of XRCC1 to hOGG1 alone did not increase the extent of AP lyase product of hOGG1. Parallel experiments carried out using a 3′-labeled substrate indicated that the final product in the presence of all three proteins is indeed that of the cleavage of the AP site by APE1, leaving a 5′-dRP (data not shown), consistent with the bypass of the AP lyase activity of hOGG1. Therefore, addition of both proteins, APE1 and XRCC1, further stimulated the accumulation of the end product. Borohydride trapping experiments were used to characterize the XRCC1 stimulation mechanism of the overall reaction leading to an APE1-incised DNA (Fig. 3C). In this assay, APE1 and XRCC1 by themselves produce seemingly contradictory effects on the hOGG1 activity. As it had been shown by Hill et al. (3Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), the presence of APE1 inhibits the trapping of hOGG1 with the 8-oxoG-containing DNA. Our results show that XRCC1 enhanced the formation of the covalent complex (Fig. 2B). The simultaneous presence of all three proteins results in a lower yield of covalent complex (Fig. 3C). The Same Region of XRCC1 Is Required for Its Interaction with Both hOGG1 and APE1—XRCC1 has been shown to interact with several other proteins. In particular, XRCC1 interacts and is associated in cells with polβ, PARPs 1 and 2, Lig3, APE1, and PNK. Except for the latter two, the interface domains of XRCC1 in those interactions have been determined. In the case of polβ, it is the N-terminal domain (NTD) of XRCC1 that interacts with the DNA polymerase (30Marintchev A. Robertson A. Dimitriadis E.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2049-2059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two PARP proteins share the BRCT1 domain as a contact region (19Schreiber V. Ame J.C. Dolle P. Schultz I. Rinaldi B.

In contrast to many other monocyte/macrophage markers, its expression is absent in monocytes and strongly induced during late stages of human macrophage differentiation. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying its cell typerestricted and maturation-associated expression in macrophages, we initiated a detailed study of the proximal HC-gp39 promoter. Deletion analysis of reporter constructs in macrophage-like THP-1 cells localized a region directing high levels of macrophage-specific reporter gene expression to ∼300 bp adjacent to the major transcriptional start site. The promoter sequence contained consensus binding sites for several known factors, and specific binding of nuclear PU.1, Sp1, Sp3, USF, AML-1, and C/EBP proteins was detectable in gel shift assays. In vivo footprinting assays with dimethyl sulfate demonstrate that the protection of corresponding sequences was enhanced in macrophages compared with monocytes. Mutational analysis of transcription factor binding sites indicated a predominant role for a single Sp1 binding site in regulating HC-gp39 promoter activity.

Our results further highlight the important role of Sp1 in macrophage gene regulation. Human blood monocytes are able to differentiate into morphologically and functionally heterogeneous effector cells, including macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells, and osteoclasts (1Hume D.A. Ross I.L. Himes S.R. Sasmono R.T. Wells C.A. Ravasi T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the differentiation of precursor cells, this development generally proceeds in the absence of proliferation. In myelomonocytic cell types, several transcription factors have been identified that are important for lineage commitment, subsequent differentiation, and cell type-specific gene regulation. These include members of the Ets, C/EBP, and CBF families and several other transcription factors (2Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3377-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 3Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular the Ets family transcription factor PU.1 is essential for normal monocyte/macrophage differentiation and cell type-specific gene expression (4McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L.

Nature. 1997; 386: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The defect of PU.1–/–hematopoietic progenitors may be attributed to their failure to express the receptors for macrophage colony stimulating factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, which are critical for progenitor cell survival and proliferation (7Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Conners K. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The acquisition of a mature macrophage phenotype is clearly distinct from monocytic lineage commitment and requires expression of a new set of genes. Also, most “macrophage-specific” marker genes that have been studied previously are already expressed in peripheral blood monocytes. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of macrophage differentiation, we identified a number of genes that are specifically up-regulated during the differentiation of human blood monocytes into macrophages (17Krause S.W. Rehli M. Kreutz M. Schwarzfischer L. Paulauskis J.D. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because of its unique cell type-restricted and maturation-associated expression, the gene CHI3L1 was chosen as a model to investigate late transcriptional events during macrophage differentiation. The CHI3L1 gene product, human cartilage 39-kDa glycoprotein (HC-gp39, 1The abbreviations used are: HC-gp39, human cartilage 39-kDa glycoprotein; MO, monocytes; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR. also known as YKL-40), is a mammalian member of glycosyl hydrolase family 18 (18Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to chitotriosidase, a related active chitinase that is also expressed during late stages of macrophage differentiation (19Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), HC-gp39 lacks hydrolytic activity, probably because of a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic center region and acts as a chitin-specific lectin (20Renkema G.H.

The described expression pattern suggests a putative role in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and tumor metastasis. More recently, HC-gp39 was shown to stimulate proliferation of human connective-tissue cells and to activate both extracellular signal-regulated kinase- and protein kinase B-mediated signaling pathways, indicating a role as a growth factor (27Recklies A.D. White C. Ling H. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The expression of HC-gp39 is restricted to a small number of cell types (chondrocytes (18Hakala B.E.

To approach the molecular mechanisms of gene expression during late stages of macrophage differentiation, we analyzed the expression of the gene for HC-gp39 (CHI3L1) at the transcriptional level. We cloned and sequenced the CHI3L1 gene (29Rehli M. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Genomics. 1997; 43: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and initiated a detailed characterization of its macrophage-specific promoter. Several cis-elements important for HC-gp39 promoter activity in macrophages were defined and shown to bind Sp1, C/EBP, ETS, and CBF family transcription factors in vitro. Interestingly, binding sites for tissue-restricted transcription factors were largely dispensable for promoter reporter activity in THP-1 macrophages. Instead, a central role for Sp1 family factors was established in regulating HC-gp39 promoter activity. Chemicals—All chemical reagents used were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Protease inhibitors are from Roche Biochemicals. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Antisera for supershift analyses were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) were separated by leukapheresis of healthy donors, followed by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll/Hypaque. MO were isolated from MNC by counter-current centrifugal elutriation in a J6M-E centrifuge (Beckman, München, Germany) as previously described (17Krause S.W. Rehli M. Kreutz M. Schwarzfischer L. Paulauskis J.D. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). MO were >85% pure as determined by morphology and expression of CD14 antigen. Isolated MO were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with vitamins, antibiotics, pyruvate, nonessential amino acids (all from Invitrogen), 5 × 10–8m β-mercaptoethanol, 2% human pooled AB-group serum on teflon foils for a period of 7 days. The human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U937 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and the human melanoma cell line Mel Im (a gift from Dr. A. Bosserhof) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Where indicated, cells were treated with PMA (10–8m) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (10–7m; Hoffman-La Roche). Drosophila S2 Schneider cells (a gift from Dr. W. Falk) were cultivated in DES serum-free medium (Invitrogen). RNA Preparation and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from different cell lines by the guanidine thiocyanate/acid phenol method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis, Northern blotting, and cDNA hybridization were carried out as described previously (17Krause S.W. Rehli M. Kreutz M. Schwarzfischer L. Paulauskis J.D. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A 1200-bp cDNA of the coding region was used as HC-gp39-specific probe. Gene Cloning, Plasmid Construction, and Purification—A genomic library constructed in λFIXII (Stratagene) was screened with a 1.3-kb probe corresponding to the proximal promoter region of HC-gp39 (HC-1300) that was previously generated using Promoter Walking PCR (29Rehli M. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Genomics. 1997; 43: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Two genomic clones covering the 5′-region of the CHI3L1 gene were identified by Southern analysis and gene-specific PCR. From one of these clones, a 1.0-kb fragment of the proximal promoter was amplified using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and the primers HC1023_S and HC1_AS. Introduced restriction sites for NheI and BglII were used for subcloning into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-B (Promega) to yield the HC-1023 reporter plasmid. Larger fragments of the HC-gp39 promoter were released from genomic λ clones by restriction digest with NcoI/ApaI and SalI/ApaI, sequenced, and subcloned into the existing HC-1023 plasmid, generating the –4.3-kb and –3.2-kb reporter constructs. Unidirectional deletions of the HC-1023 construct were generated using the nested deletion kit (Amersham Biosciences). Subclones generated in steps of ∼50–150 nucleotides were sequenced and used in reporter analysis. The HC-377 plasmid was generated by PCR using the primers HC377S and HC1AS. Mutation of individual binding sites and construction of chimeric constructs and constructs with specific internal deletions was done by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using primers in Supplemental Table II. PCR fragments with correctly introduced alterations were subcloned back into the corresponding wild-type plasmid. Drosophila expression plasmids for human Sp1 family proteins were a gift from Dr. G. Suske. For transient transfections, plasmids were isolated and purified using the EndoFree plasmid kit from Qiagen. DMS in Vivo Footprinting—Genomic footprinting was performed essentially as described (31Niller H.H. Glaser G. Knuchel R. Wolf H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12864-12868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For each footprint reaction 107 cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 1 min with 5 μl of dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 ml of DMS stop solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol in PBS. Cells were washed once more in DMS stop solution and twice more with PBS. Finally, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and genomic DNA was prepared. Footprinted DNAs were subjected to piperidine treatment (32Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). For visualization of footprints by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), 2 μg of sequenced or footprinted DNA were analyzed as described (33Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 34Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) with modifications (31Niller H.H. Glaser G. Knuchel R. Wolf H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12864-12868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The primers for LM-PCR are listed in Supplemental Table II. The first strand primer extension reaction was done in 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.8, 25 °C (Vent buffer; New England Biolabs), containing 0.3 pmol of primer LM1 of each set, 240 μm each dNTP, and 1 unit of Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 5 min at 94 °C, 30 min at 60 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C. For ligation of the common linker, the sample was transferred to ice and 5 μl of PCR linker mix as in Mueller and Wold (34Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), 2 μl of ligation buffer (660 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithioerythritol, 10 mm ATP, pH 7.5, 20 °C; Roche Applied Science), 1 μl of T4-DNA-ligase (5 units/μl, Roche Applied Science), and 12 μl of water were added. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the DNA was ethanol-precipitated, washed once with 75% ethanol, dried, and then resuspended in water. The PCR amplification was done in 100 μl of Vent buffer containing 10 pmol primer LM2 of each set and the longer linker primer, 240 μm each dNTP, and 3 units of Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase for 20 cycles using 1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 60 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. For labeling, the sample was transferred to ice; 5 pmol of T4-kinase [γ-32P]-ATP-labeled primer LM3 of each set, 2.5 nmol each dNTP, 0.5 units Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase in a volume of Vent buffer not exceeding 15 μl were added. Then the sample was heated to 94 °C for 1.5 min, subjected to 8 cycles of 2 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 62 °C, and 5 min at 72 °C, and kept at 72 °C for 5 more minutes. Samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, ethanol-washed, and resuspended in loading dye. One fifth of each sample was separated on a standard 5% sequencing gel, and the gels were dried and autoradiographed for 15 h at room temperature with Kodak BioMax MR film. DNA Sequence Analysis—The cDNA sequencing was done by Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing (Applied Biosystem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences were analyzed on the Applied Biosystems DNA sequencing system (model 373A). Transient DNA Transfections—THP-1 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran as described earlier (16Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The cell lines HeLa and Mel Im were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 × 105 HeLa cells were transfected using 7 μl of LipofectAMINE and 1 μg of total DNA (including 0.05 μg of Renilla control vector) and incubated for 5 h before the addition of complete medium. 2.7 × 105 Mel Im cells were transfected using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE and 1 μg of total DNA (including 0.05 μg of Renilla control vector) and incubated for 6 h before the addition of complete medium. The transfection mixture was removed after 24 h and substituted with complete medium. The transfected cell lines were cultivated for 48 h, harvested, and cell lysates assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on a Lumat LB9501 (Berthold). Firefly luciferase activity of individual transfections was normalized against Renilla luciferase activity. Drosophila S2 Schneider cells were transfected using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 × 106 Schneider cells were cells were co-transfected using 10 μl of Effectene reagent and 1.5 μg of total DNA (1 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of individual expression plasmids). Duplicate transfections were harvested after 48 h and cell lysates assayed for firefly luciferase activity using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity of individual transfections was normalized against protein concentration measured using a BCA assay (Sigma). Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells, THP-1, or in vitro differentiated human macrophages were prepared using Nonidet P-40 lysis as described (15Rehli M. Lichanska A. Cassady A.I. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1559-1565PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from freshly isolated human monocytes were prepared using identical buffers except that nuclei were released without detergent by shearing with 15–20 passages through a 26-gauge needle mounted in a 1-ml syringe. All buffers used contained 1 mm Na3VO4 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml bestatin, 5 μg/ml E46, 50 μg/ml antipain, 100 μg/ml chymostatin). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase or with [α-32P]dNTP using Klenow DNA polymerase. The binding reaction contained 2.5 μg of nuclear extract protein or 0.5–2 μl of the in vitro translation reaction, 0.5 μg of poly(dI/C), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, and 20 nmol of probe DNA in a final volume of 10 μl. Antisera used in supershift analyses were added after 15 min, and samples were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels after standing at room temperature for a total of 30 min. Buffers and running conditions used have been described (15Rehli M. Lichanska A. Cassady A.I. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1559-1565PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were fixed in 5% acetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed. Expression of HC-gp39 in Human Macrophages and Myeloid Cell Lines—We recently identified HC-gp39 as a marker for late stages of macrophage maturation (17Krause S.W. Rehli M. Kreutz M. Schwarzfischer L. Paulauskis J.D. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To enable studies of the HC-gp39 promoter, several myeloid leukemia cell lines were analyzed for HC-gp39 expression. The myeloid cell lines were either left untreated or induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells with 1,25-Vitamin D3 or PMA. Fig. 1 shows a Northern analysis of the myeloid cell lines U937, THP-1, and MonoMac6 as compared with human blood monocytes and in vitro differentiated macrophages. No HC-gp39 expression was detectable in treated or untreated U937 cells. HC-gp39 was also undetectable in untreated MonoMac6 but was markedly induced by PMA. THP-1 cells expressed HC-gp39 without treatment, and expression was further increased by the addition of 1,25 Vitamin-D3 or PMA. HC-gp39 mRNA expression in primary cells and cell lines also correlated with protein expression determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Tissue-specific Reporter Activity of the 5′-proximal HC-gp39 Promoter—To test whether the HC-gp39 promoter could confer cell type-specific activity in reporter assays, we cloned a 1.0-kb fragment of the 5′-proximal promoter region of the human CHI3L1 gene into a luciferase reporter plasmid (HC-1023). Transient transfection analysis was performed in the myeloid cell lines THP-1 and U937 and two non-myeloid cell lines, Mel Im (melanoma) and HeLa (cervical carcinoma), which do not express HC-gp39 mRNA (data not shown). Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency by co-transfection with a Renilla construct, and results for individual cell lines were compared relative to the activity of a positive control (a cytomegalovirus-driven luciferase construct). As shown in Table I, strong reporter activity was detectable only in THP-1 cells, which is consistent with endogenous HC-gp39 expression in this cell line. Similar results were obtained using a shorter (377 bp) fragment of the proximal promoter (Table I).Table ITissue-specific activity of the proximal HC-gp39 promoterHC-377HC-377Relative luciferase unitsTHP-196.9 ± 15.0aValues are % luciferase activities relative to a cytomegalovirus-driven control vector and are means (± S.D.) from at least four independent experiments.60.4 ± 4.7U9371.0 (±0.9)0.4 (±0.2)HeLa1.3 (±0.6)0.8 (±0.2)Mel Im0.8 (±0.5)NDbNot determined.a Values are % luciferase activities relative to a cytomegalovirus-driven control vector and are means (± S.D.) from at least four independent experiments.b Not determined. Open table in a new tab Deletion Analysis of the 5′-flanking HC-gp39 Sequence Region—To narrow down regions that are important for HC-gp39 promoter activity in macrophages, multiple deletion constructs were generated. λ clones containing the promoter of the human CHI3L1 gene were isolated by hybridization screening. 4.4 kb of the proximal 5′-flanking region were subcloned into the pGL3 vector and sequenced. Deletions of the 4.4-kb promoter were constructed by restriction digest or nested deletion. Transient transfection analysis was performed with reporter constructs of different lengths in the monocytic cell line THP-1 to identify regulatory sequences in the 5′-flanking HC-gp39 region. As shown in Fig. 2, the two longest promoter constructs showed a relatively low reporter activity, indicating the presence of repressive transcriptional elements more than 1.3 kb 5′ of the transcriptional start site. Maximal reporter activity was observed with the –1.3-kb promoter fragment. Further deletion of the promoter to –433 bp caused a strong decrease in promoter activity. The activity was largely restored after the removal of a further 56 nucleotides, indicating another repressor element in this region. Deletion down to –144 bp resulted in a strong loss of activity. These results suggested that cis-elements important for the macrophage-specific activity of the proximal promoter were located between base pairs –377 and –144. Structure of the Proximal HC-gp39 Promoter—The initial deletion analysis localized a region directing strong macrophage-specific reporter gene expression to ∼300 bp proximal to the major transcriptional start site that was determined by primer extension in a previous study (29Rehli M. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Genomics. 1997; 43: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In contrast to many other myeloid-specific genes, the HC-gp39 promoter contains a TATA box and a TATA-like CATA element, both ∼30 bp upstream of the two transcriptional initiation sites (sequence is shown in Supplemental Fig. 10). Within the proximal promoter region, several putative binding sites for ubiquitous transcription factors (Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, basic helix-loop-helix) and tissue-restricted factors (e.g. C/EBP, AML-1) were identified by computer analysis using the MatInspector data base (Genomatix). In addition we identified several purine-rich elements that might be bound by members of the Ets family, including the myeloid and B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1. To compare human and murine promoters, the corresponding promoter region of the putative mouse homologue brp39 was cloned. Sequence comparison with the human HC-gp39 promoter revealed a marked degree of conservation between the species man and mouse (Supplemental Fig. 10). Deletion Analysis of the Proximal HC-gp39 Promoter—To further localize cis-acting elements in the proximal HC-gp39 promoter, a more detailed deletion analysis was performed. A schematic representation of the luciferase constructs tested by transient transfection in THP-1 cells is shown in Fig. 3A. The region between bp –377 and –217 was largely dispensable for transient reporter gene expression. Luciferase activity only dropped ∼12% if this region was removed from the 5′-end. However, strong decreases in reporter activity were observed after deletion of the putative Sp1 (S) sequence and a putative binding site for bHLH-ZIP (B) transcription factors. Internal deletions were generated"
https://openalex.org/W1970500939,"Fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) is an ∼63-kDa plasma membrane protein that facilitates the influx of fatty acids into adipocytes as well as skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Previous studies with FATP1 expressed in COS1 cell extracts suggested that FATP1 exhibits very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) activity and that such activity may be linked to fatty acid transport. To address the enzymatic activity of the isolated protein, murine FATP1 and ACS1 were engineered to contain a C-terminal Myc-His tag expressed in COS1 cells via adenoviral-mediated infection and purified to homogeneity using nickel affinity chromatography. Kinetic analysis of the purified enzymes was carried out for long chain palmitic acid (C16:0) and very long chain lignoceric acid (C24:0) as well as for ATP and CoA. FATP1 exhibited similar substrate specificity for fatty acids 16–24 carbons in length, whereas ACS1 was 10-fold more active on long chain fatty acids relative to very long chain fatty acids. The very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity of the two enzymes was comparable as were the Km values for both ATP and coenzyme A. Interestingly, FATP1 was insensitive to inhibition by triacsin C, whereas ACS1 was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of the compound. These data represent the first characterization of purified FATP1 and indicate that the enzyme is a broad substrate specificity acyl-CoA synthetase. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that that fatty acid uptake into cells is linked to their esterification with coenzyme A.

These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that that fatty acid uptake into cells is linked to their esterification with coenzyme A. The mechanism by which fatty acids enter cells has been the source of considerable debate. Similar to other hydrophobic compounds, fatty acids are able to cross membranes by passive diffusion in a protein-independent mechanism (1Hamilton J.A. Johnson R.A. Corkey B. Kamp F. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 16: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Hamilton J.A. Guo W. Kamp F. Mol Cell Biochem. 2002; 239: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) driven by the concentration gradient on either side of the membrane. Whether passive diffusion within the biological context is sufficient to supply the amount of fatty acids required for tissues with high lipid flux remains to be determined. A second view contends that fatty acids traverse the plasma membrane via specific protein-mediated transporters (3Abumrad N. Harmon C. Ibrahimi A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Abumrad N. Coburn C. Ibrahimi A. Biochim. Biophys.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 745-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), support the hypothesis that fatty acid transport occurs by a saturable protein-mediated mechanism and several candidate proteins have been identified.A variety of proteins have been implicated in protein-mediated fatty acid import. These include the fatty acid-binding protein from the plasma membrane (FABPPM) 1The abbreviations used are: FABPPM, fatty acid binding protein from the plasma membrane; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; FAT/CD36, fatty acid translocase/CD36 antigen.1The abbreviations used are: FABPPM, fatty acid binding protein from the plasma membrane; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; FAT/CD36, fatty acid translocase/CD36 antigen. and the fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) as well as the fatty acid transport protein family of molecules (FATP) (reviewed in Ref. 7Frohnert B.I. Bernlohr D.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 83-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). FATP1 is a member of a large family of related proteins from diverse organisms that increase fatty acid import when expressed in cultured cells (8Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 9Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, FATP isoforms 1–6 have been identified based on sequence similarity and have distinct tissue-specific distributions of expression (9Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The yeast homologue (Fat1p) has been shown by genetic and biochemical analyses to be required for fatty acid uptake (10Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).FATP1 shares sequence similarity with the family of acyl-CoA synthetases and has been demonstrated to increase very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity of extracts when expressed in COS1 cells (11Coe N.R. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I. Watkins P.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). FATP1 contains two functional motifs: motif 1, which contains a putative site for the binding of ATP (via serine 250) that is part of the acyl-CoA synthetase reaction mechanism, and motif 2, which is proposed to be a ligand (fatty acid) binding domain (11Coe N.R.

Overexpression of FATP1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells results in an increased rate of fatty acid influx for both C18:1 and C24:0, which are channeled to triacylglycerol biosynthesis (14Hatch G.M. Smith A.J. Xu F.Y. Hall A.M. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1380-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As such, fatty acid transport protein 1 has been proposed to be a bifunctional protein capable of facilitating transbilayer movement of fatty acids and their metabolic activation (esterification) with coenzyme A.To characterize the FATP1 acyl-CoA synthetase reaction, murine FATP1 was engineered to contain a C-terminal Myc-His tag, expressed in COS1 cells, and purified to homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography. Additionally, the well studied long chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACS1) was cloned, expressed, and purified similarly to make a comparative analysis. Kinetic analysis of purified FATP1 and ACS1 was carried out for two model fatty acid substrates (C16:0 and C24:0), ATP, and CoA. These data lay the foundation for the biochemical dissection of FATP1-dependent fatty acid uptake and metabolic activation and provide evidence consistent with the model for vectoral acylation of fatty acids at the plasma membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—[3H]Palmitic acid and [3H]lignoceric acid were obtained from American Radiochemicals Company. All of the non-labeled fatty acid was obtained from NuChek Prep., Inc. (Elysian, MN). Triacsin C was obtained from Biomol. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. All of the other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma.Generation of FATP1 and ACS1 Recombinant Adenovirus—A recombinant adenovirus expressing both the green fluorescent protein (controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter) and either murine FATP1 or ACS1 were constructed by recombination in Escherichia coli using the methods described by He and colleagues (15He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was recombined into pADEasy in E. coli BJ5183 cells recreating the replication-deficient adenovirus genome. Linear constructs of the recombinant adenovirus were transfected (LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen) into 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) to allow packaging and amplification of the adenovirus. Large-scale adenovirus preparations from twenty 10-cm plates of infected cells were propagated until ∼50% of the cells were lysed. The cells and medium were collected, and the remaining cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. The medium was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the cellular debris, and the supernatant containing virus particles was recovered and frozen in aliquots at –70 °C.Protein Expression of Recombinant FATP1 and ACS1 Proteins in COS1 Cells—FATP1 and ACS1 His-tagged proteins were expressed in COS1 cells using adenovirus infection. Prior to infection, COS1 cells were plated in 10-cm plates and grown to ∼80% confluency at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For infection, the effective concentration of infectious adenoviral particles was experimentally determined by monitoring green fluorescent protein expression and COS1 cell viability 72 h post-infection. Adenovirus particles that yielded ∼90–100% infection were delivered in 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum/plate. 72 h post-transfection, cells were harvested by centrifugation, immediately frozen, and stored at –70 °C.Affinity Purification of Recombinant FATP1 and ACS1 Proteins— COS1 cells expressing FATP1 or ACS1 were thawed in buffer A (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, and 150 mm NaCl), subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles, and solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 for 4 h at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was separated from debris by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and recovered, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%. For purification of recombinant proteins, the nickel affinity matrix beads (Qiagen) were equilibrated with buffer A plus 30 mm imidazole and the bound protein eluted with five column volumes of buffer A plus 150 mm imidazole. Eluates were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C until use. FATP1 and ACS1 migrated as single bands on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were judged to be at least 90% pure by Coomassie Blue staining. The level of murine FATP1 enrichment obtained from the Ni2+ column purification was ∼2000-fold as assessed by comparison of the specific activity of the loaded fraction (0.5 nmol/min/mg for C16:0) to the eluted fraction (1000 nmol/min/mg for C16:0). To determine the amount of purified protein, samples were precipitated (16Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar) and protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetase Assays—Samples were assayed for acyl-CoA synthetase activity by the conversion of [3H]palmitate or [3H]lignocerate to their CoA derivatives by a modified method from Nagamatsu et al. (17Nagamatsu K. Soeda S. Mori M. Kishimoto Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All of the kinetic studies reported used 0.5–2 μg of purified FATP1 or ACS1 for 2 min at pH 7.5 and 30 mm NaCl in 250 μl of a buffer containing 20 μm fatty acid, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm CoA, and 200 μm dithiothreitol. The addition of enzyme purified in the presence of 2% Triton X-100 resulted in a final concentration of 0.4% Triton X-100 in all of the standard assays. Reactions were terminated with the addition of 1.25 ml of isopropyl alcohol:heptane:H2SO4 (40:10:1, v/v/v), 0.5 ml of H20, and 0.75 ml of heptane to facilitate organic phase separation. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with 0.75 ml of heptane to remove unreacted fatty acids, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid phase scintillation counting. The enzyme activity was stable in 20% glycerol and was retained for 2 months without significant loss of activity when stored at –70 °C.Competition Studies—Because of the unavailability of commercially radiolabeled fatty acids, the lipid substrate specificity of the purified FATP1 was indirectly determined by competitive enzymatic inhibition analysis. In these studies, unlabeled fatty acids at a fixed concentration of 15 μm was added to either [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]lignoceric acid and the rate of reaction was monitored. A selectivity series for fatty preference was generated by determining the fraction of acyl-CoA synthetase activity at [S]0.5. The detergent-like effects of fatty acids are not significant because 0.4% Triton X-100 is present in the standard assays.RESULTSExpression and Purification of Recombinant FATP1 Protein—Previous studies in cellular extracts have suggested that FATP1 is an acyl-CoA synthetase (11Coe N.R. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I. Watkins P.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, an alternate possibility is that FATP1 activates a latent endogenous acyl-CoA synthetase present in cells that results in increased fatty acid esterification. Alternatively, the fatty acid transport activity of FATP1 could lead to an influx of fatty acids that in turn generates signaling molecules, which regulate the expression of an acyl-CoA synthetase gene. To demonstrate that FATP1 exhibits intrinsic fatty acid CoA synthetase activity and to kinetically characterize the properties of such a reaction, murine FATP1 was purified and studied. To facilitate purification, FATP1 was C-terminal tagged with a Myc epitope and a poly-histidine tract. The purification involved detergent extraction of FATP1 from the membrane with Triton X-100 and chromatography on Ni2+-agarose resin. Fig. 1 presents the SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions collected during a typical FATP1 purification. The purified enzyme was essentially homogenous as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of ∼68 kDa (Fig. 1), a value that agrees well with the calculated molecular mass from the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA (63 kDa) plus that of the Myc-His epitope and linker amino acids.Optimization of the FATP1 Acyl-CoA Synthetase Reaction—An analysis of very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity enriched from rat liver microsomes demonstrated an inhibitory effect of Triton X-100 on the activity (18Nagamatsu K. Soeda S. Kishimoto Y. Lipids. 1986; 21: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To determine whether FATP1 acyl-CoA synthetase activity was sensitive to Triton X-100, purified enzyme was assayed with increasing concentration detergent. FATP1 activity (for both C16:0 and C24:0 esterification) was sensitive to Triton X-100 in the reaction buffer (Fig. 2). To establish standard reaction conditions, 0.4% Triton X-100 in the final assay buffer was adopted as routine. This level of Triton X-100 partially inhibited both FATP1 catalytic activity but was in a region of the progress curve that was relatively insensitive to small changes in detergent concentrations.Fig. 2FATP1 sensitivity to Triton X-100. Purified FATP1 was assayed for acyl-CoA synthetase activity with C16:0 (□) or C24:0 (▪) in the presence of increasing concentrations of Triton X-100. The values are expressed as the average of duplicates ± S.D. from a representative experiment of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The FATP1 acyl-CoA synthetase activity was optimized with respect to several standard reaction parameters for both long chain (C16:0) and very long chain (C24:0) fatty acids. As shown in Fig. 3, the activity was dependent on and proportional to the amount of enzyme added to the reaction (Fig. 3A) as well as the time of reaction (Fig. 3B). In addition, the pH sensitivity of the reaction was evaluated (Fig. 3C) as was the influence of ionic strength (Fig. 3D). The purified FATP1 has broad pH dependence with 6.5–8.0 being generally optimal, and there was little effect on enzymatic activity when the NaCl concentration was varied from 30 to 150 mm; however, the activity was reduced by 80% at 500 mm. Importantly, optimization utilizing C16:0 as a substrate yielded results that were essentially identical to those obtained with C24:0 as a substrate.Fig. 3FATP1 acyl-CoA synthetase reaction conditions.

The apparent Km values of the purified enzyme were determined for palmitic acid (C16:0), lignoceric acid (C24:0), ATP, and CoA at 37 °C (Fig. 4). FATP1 demonstrated high affinity toward its substrates and co-substrates, exhibiting a Km of 21 μm for C16:0, 13 μm for C24:0, 850 μm for ATP, and 8.3 μm for CoA (Table I). It should be stressed that because these studies are done in the presence of detergent, the free concentration of fatty acids cannot be determined and the Km values reported for each fatty acid represent apparent values assuming that all of the lipid was available to the enzyme. Because the solubility of lignoceric acid and palmitic acid vary greatly, this assumption is probably incorrect but represents an experimentally tractable method for analyzing the data and comparing one enzyme to another. A catalytic constant of 1.5 s–1 at 37 °C was calculated from the molecular mass of the purified enzyme (68 kDa) and the maximal specific activity of 1000 nmol/min/mg for C16:0.Fig. 4Substrate analysis for purified FATP1 (▪) and ACS1 (□).

Open table in a new tab The kinetic properties of purified ACS1 protein were evaluated and compared with those for FATP1. The kinetic profile obtained in this study closely resembled that for both purified native ACS1 and FLAG-tagged ACS1 (Fig. 4) (15He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). Purified His-tagged ACS1 demonstrated the expected high affinities toward C16:0, ATP, and CoA with Km values of 33, 320, and 6.4 μm, respectively (Table I). Interestingly, ACS1 also utilized very long chain fatty acids (C24:0) with a Km of 18 μm. The maximal velocity of ACS1 for C16:0 was approximately 3200 nmol/min/mg but was greatly reduced for C24:0 to 240 nmol/min/mg. Consistent with the reduced velocity for very long chain fatty acids, ACS1 was 10-fold more active toward C16:0 than C24:0 as demonstrated by V max/Km values of 100 and 15, respectively. FATP1 exhibited similar activities toward C16:0 (V max/Km of 6) and increased specificity for C24:0 (V max/Km of 17).Fatty Acid Specificity of FATP1—Because a large number of different fatty acids are not commercially available in radiolabeled form, the fatty acid substrate specificity of the purified FATP1 was indirectly determined by a competitive enzymatic inhibition by the addition of unlabeled fatty acids in the reaction in addition to either [3H] palmitic acid or [3H] lignoceric acid (Fig. 5). Esterification of labeled lignoceric acid was effectively inhibited by the addition of 15 μm of various long chain fatty acids with the rank order of C18:1 > C20:4 > C16:0 > C12. Similarly, the conversion of [3H]palmitate to palmitoyl-CoA was decreased by the addition of very long chain fatty acids with the rank order of C22:0 = C20:0 > C24:0 > C16:0. As with the other kinetic analysis, because of the differing solubilities of the various competing fatty acids, true Ki values cannot be determined and a simple selectivity series is presented. These results are consistent with a model for FATP1 having a single fatty acid binding domain that is utilized for esterification of both long and very long chain fatty acids.Fig. 5Competition studies with various long chain and very long chain fatty acids. Purified FATP1 was assayed for long chain or very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity in the presence of indicated fatty acids at a concentration of 15 μm. Panel A, C16:0 (▪) esterification was evaluated with the following competitor fatty acids: C24:0 (•), C20:0 (○), C22:0 (×), and C16:0 (▵). Panel B, C24:0 (▪) esterification was evaluated with C12:0 (○), C16:0 (▾), C18:1 (♦), and C20:4 (•).

To determine whether FATP1 is regulated by feedback inhibition, increasing concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA were titrated into the standard reaction conditions (Fig. 6) and the activity of FATP1 evaluated. At a concentration of 10 μm palmitoyl-CoA, the FATP1 acyl-CoA synthetase reaction was inhibited by ∼20–25%, whereas 100 μm inhibited the reaction by greater than 60% for both C16:0 and C24:0. Although to a slightly less degree, a similar inhibition was observed for ACS1.Fig. 6Palmitoyl-CoA inhibits FATP1 activity.

However, studies in crude cellular extracts suggested that FATP1 may not be similarly affected (14Hatch G.M. Smith A.J. Xu F.Y. Hall A.M. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1380-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To test whether triacsin C inhibits purified FATP1, various concentrations were added to the standard reaction mixture (Fig. 7) and the conversion of C16:0 and C24:0 was evaluated. Surprisingly, triacsin C had no effect on FATP1 acyl-CoA synthetase activity, whereas ACS1 was inhibited in the reported dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 1 μm. Troglitazone at concentrations up to 10 μm inhibited FATP1-dependent acylation of C16:0 or C24:0 by only 20% (data not shown).Fig. 7FATP1 is insensitive to triacsin C inhibition.

FABPPM was purified by oleate-agarose affinity chromatography from hepatocytes, adipocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, and cardiomyocytes and was proposed to play a role in fatty acid import (22Sorrentino D. Stump D. Potter B.J. Robinson R.B. White R. Kiang C.L. Berk P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Partial protein sequencing of FABPPM revealed an identity with mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase. Furthermore, antibodies to mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase were able to inhibit uptake of oleate into 3T3-L1 adipocytes, further supporting the conclusion that these proteins are identical (23Stump D.D. Zhou S.L. Berk P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G894-G902PubMed Google Scholar). CD36, also known as FAT, was identified based on its ability to bind a cross-linking sulfonsuccinimidyl fatty acid derivative (24Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Influx of fatty acid analogs is reduced in the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues in CD36-null mice (25Irie H. Krukenkamp I.B. Brinkmann J.F. Gaudette G.R. Saltman A.E. Jou W. Glatz J.F. Abumrad N.A. Ibrahimi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6819-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CD36 also functions as a multi-ligand scavenger receptor, binding oxidized low density lipoproteins, thrombospondin, and collagen. The additional functions of FABPPM and FAT complicate their interpretation and role in fatty acid uptake.The FATP family of proteins was originally identified by the ability to facilitate fatty acid uptake using a fluorescent fatty acid internalization assay (8Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of cloned FATP family members revealed two sequence motifs indicative of acyl-CoA synthetases. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of FATP1, FATP2, or FATP4 in COS1 cells increases cell-associated acyl-CoA synthetase activities (11Coe N.R. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I.

Several unusual features, including a large elastic anisotropy, a small-shear elastic modulus C', a Kohn-like anomaly in the T1[011] branch, and a pronounced softening of the [111] transverse modes, are found. These features can be related to the phase transitions of plutonium and to strong coupling between the lattice structure and the 5f valence instabilities.

We have recently characterized a 10.2-kDa protein, called dispersin, which is exported from the bacteria and which promotes dispersal of EAEC across the intestinal mucosa. Here, we present evidence that dispersin is exported by a putative ABC transporter complex, which is encoded by a genetic locus of the EAEC virulence plasmid pAA2. We demonstrate that the locus comprises a cluster of five genes (designated aat-PABCD), including homologs of an inner-membrane permease (AatP), an ATP-binding cassette protein (AatC) and the outer membrane protein TolC (AatA). We show that, like TolC, AatA localizes to the outer membrane independently of its ABC partner. Dispersin appears to require the Aat complex for outer membrane translocation but not for secretion across the inner membrane. We also show that, like the dispersin gene, transcription of the aat cluster is dependent on AggR, a regulator of virulence genes in EAEC. We propose that the aat cluster encodes a specialized ABC transporter, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of EAEC by transporting dispersin out of the bacterial cell.

The pathogenesis of EAEC infection is thought to involve the adherence of the bacterium to the intestinal mucosa, possibly in both the small and large intestines, followed by secretion of one or more enterotoxins (5Nataro J.P.

The defining feature of EAEC is its characteristic aggregative adherence (AA) phenotype in the standard HEp-2 adherence assay (10Nataro J.P. Kaper J.B. Robins-Browne R. Prado V. Vial P. Levine M.M. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1987; 6: 829-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In this in vitro assay, EAEC strains adhere to the epithelial cell surface, to the glass substratum, and to each other in a distinctive stacked-brick formation. We have described the related adhesins aggregative adherence fimbriae I and II (AAF/I and AAF/II), which are encoded on a large virulence plasmid called pAA (11Nataro J.P. Deng Y. Maneval D.R.

The proven human pathogenic strain 042 requires AAF/II fimbrial antigen for adherence to the colonic mucosa, suggesting that this adhesin is a virulence factor for human infection (12Czeczulin J.R.

Whereas most EAEC strains lack a recognizable AAF adhesin (7Czeczulin J.R. Whittam T.S. Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2692-2699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bernier C. Gounon P. Le Bouguenec C. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4302-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the majority carry the ∼100-kb pAA plasmid, which harbors several conserved genetic loci. Most prominent among the plasmid-encoded factors is a transcriptional activator of the AraC class designated AggR (14Nataro J.P. Yikang D. Yingkang D. Walker K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4691-4699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AggR is required for expression of both AAF/I and AAF/II, but it is also present in a large percentage of EAEC strains that do not express any identified AAF (7Czeczulin J.R. Whittam T.S. Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2692-2699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we characterized a novel AggR-dependent gene lying immediately upstream of aggR in the EAEC strain 042 (15Sheikh J. Czeczulin J.R. Harrington S. Hicks S. Henderson I.R. LeBouguenec C. Gounon P. Phillips A. Nataro J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This novel gene encodes a secreted 10.2-kDa protein, designated Aap (anti-aggregation protein), which appears to form a protein capsule on the bacterial cell surface and which promotes dispersal of EAEC on the intestinal mucosa. In light of this property, Aap has been given the more descriptive name dispersin. Initial studies revealed that the translocation of dispersin to the surface of EAEC does not require the secretion apparatus required to construct the AAF fimbriae; however, the mechanism by which dispersin is translocated remained initially unclear. The current work provides the first insight into the mechanism of dispersin secretion. In addition to the putative virulence factors AAF, dispersin, Pet, EAST1, and AggR, the pAA plasmid also harbors sequences homologous to an empirically derived EAEC probe (16Baudry B. Savarino S.J. Vial P. Kaper J.B. Levine M.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 161: 1249-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the original report, the EAEC probe was found to be 89% sensitive and 99% specific for EAEC detection, and subsequent data suggest that the probe may constitute a marker for pathogenic EAEC strains (17Okeke I.N.

Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was introduced into E. coli DH5α, DH5αλpir, and S17-1λpir by heat-shock transformation of competent cells according to the method of Hanahan (23Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8147) Google Scholar), or into 042 by electroporation using the Gene Pulser II system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The sequence of relevant regions of plasmid pAA2 was determined in laboratories at both the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the University of Wisconsin. Sequences from the two facilities were compared, and discrepancies were reconciled by sequencing of selected library templates. At the University of Maryland, sequences were determined from a random pBluescript library, as reported previously (24Elias Jr., W.P. Czeczulin J.R. Henderson I.R. Trabulsi L.R. Nataro J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1779-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequence determination was performed in the University of Maryland School of Medicine Department of Microbiology & Immunology Biopolymer Facility on an Applied Biosystems model 373A sequencer. For sequencing at the University of Wisconsin, plasmid pAA2 was propagated in host strain HB101, and DNA was isolated using the Large Construct Kit (Qiagen). Purified plasmid DNA (5 μg) was randomly sheared by nebulization as described previously (25Mahillon J. Kirkpatrick H.A. Kijenski H.L. Bloch C.A. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Rose D.J. Plunkett 3rd., G.

Plunkett 3rd., G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Genomics. 1993; 16: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Templates for sequencing were prepared by PCR followed by treatment with exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH). Sequencing was performed with dye-terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems Prism reagents), and data were collected on ABI 377 or 3700 automated sequencers. Sequence reads were assembled by Seqman II (DNASTAR) software. Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed using programs available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the ExPASy server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (www.expasy.ch). The sequence of the Aat cluster has been submitted to GenBank™ under accession number AY351860. Polymerase Chain Reaction and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Amplifications were performed with 500 ng of purified genomic DNA as template in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.5 μm of each primer, 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 μl of the manufacturer's buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Amplification reactions were performed in an MJ Minicycler for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min per kilobase, concluding with extension at 72 °C for 10 min unless otherwise stated.

Hicks S. Dall'Agnol M. Phillips A.D. Nataro J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) from LB cultures shaking to mid-log phase; preparations were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) to eliminate contaminating DNA. The absence of contaminating genomic DNA in RNA preparations was verified by performing PCR for the chromosomal chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene of strain 042. To synthesize cDNA, total RNA (2 μg) was subjected to reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions using Thermoscript RT (Invitrogen) and gene-specific reverse primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used for RT-PCR are shown in Table III. Amplification reactions were performed in an MJ Minicycler for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min per kilobase, concluding with extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The products were separated by 0.7-1.0% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with UV transillumination. AatA Expression and Purification—The aatA gene product was expressed by cloning a 1064-bp fragment generated by PCR into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the expression vector pET21a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). The sequences of aatA-F and aatA-R primers are shown in Table III. The protein was thereby expressed as a fusion with a 6-histidine tag and a T7 tag at the C terminus. Protein expression was achieved by incubating an LB culture of the construct at 37 °C with shaking to an A 600 of 0.5-0.6; expression was then induced with 0.4 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for 3 h. The fusion protein was purified under denaturing conditions by passage through Talon metal affinity resin according to manufacturer's protocols (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The column eluate was dialyzed overnight against PBS containing 8 m urea (pH 7.4). The fusion protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Sigma). To confirm the identity of the protein, the band was excised from an SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Research Facility, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA. Generation of AatA-specific Antibodies—Rabbit antiserum specific for AatA was raised by subcutaneous injection of AatA preparations in Freund's adjuvant as described (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Affinity purification was performed to concentrate and purify AatA-specific antibodies. The His6 tag AatA fusion protein (10 mg) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) according to manufacturer's protocols, and hyperimmune rabbit antiserum was absorbed by mixing with His6-AatA protein-coupled Sepharose for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, bound antibodies were eluted with 0.2 m glycine (pH 1.85) and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The eluate was dialyzed against PBS, concentrated using a Vivaspin 20, 50,000 molecular weight cut-off (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany), and used for Western immunoblotting. Preparation and Analysis of Cellular Fractions—To prepare culture supernatant fractions, strains were grown overnight or for 6 h at 37 °C in 5 ml of DMEM 0.45% glucose (high glucose DMEM). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, protein in the supernatant was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as follows. One-fourth volume of trichloroacetic acid containing 0.4% (w/v) deoxycholate was added to culture supernatants and incubated on ice for 30 min. The pellet was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min and washed with acetone for 15 min at room temperature. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, dried, and suspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. To remove the Aap protein from the bacterial cell surface, 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to the medium as described (15Sheikh J. Czeczulin J.R. Harrington S. Hicks S. Henderson I.R. LeBouguenec C. Gounon P. Phillips A. Nataro J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Outer membrane proteins were extracted from cultures grown overnight at 37 °C in 20 ml of high glucose DMEM. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 3.0 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The cells were lysed with a French pressure cell and centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 240 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 60 μl of 10% Triton X-100, and 1.5 μl of 1 m MgCl2 (29Skare J.T. Champion C.I. Mirzabekov T.A. Shang E.S. Blanco D.R. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Shigematsu M. Takade A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The pellet was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Periplasmic proteins were extracted from cultures grown overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of high glucose DMEM. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 3800 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 3 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) (31Thorstenson Y.R. Zhang Y. Olson P.S. Mascarenhas D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5333-5339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suspension was kept on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 3800 × g. The supernatant was collected and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described above. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer for separate analysis. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed on 10-15% (w/v) acrylamide separating gels and 4.0% (w/v) acrylamide stacking gels according to standard protocols (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or the Silver Stain kit from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). For immunoblot analyses, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using standard protocols. For detection of AatA and Aap, anti-AatA or anti-Aap antiserum (15Sheikh J. Czeczulin J.R. Harrington S. Hicks S. Henderson I.R. LeBouguenec C. Gounon P. Phillips A. Nataro J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) were used at dilutions of 1:1,000 and 1:8,000, respectively; antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:40,000 and visualized using a chemiluminescence ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Mutagenesis and Complementation—Insertional mutants of aat genes were constructed by single-crossover insertion of plasmid pJP5603 as previously described (24Elias Jr., W.P. Czeczulin J.R. Henderson I.R. Trabulsi L.R. Nataro J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1779-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an internal portion of the target gene was generated by PCR using primers described in Table III, and the product was cloned into XbaI and EcoRI sites of the π-dependent suicide vector pJP5603 (33Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids (pINTP, pINTA, pINTB, pINTC, or pINTD) were propagated in E. coli DH5α λpir prior to transformation into the donor E. coli strain in S17-1λpir. The mutant strain was then obtained by conjugal mating between the wild type parent strain 042 (which is nalidixic acid-resistant) and S17-1λpir(pINT). Transconjugants were selected on LB agar supplemented with kanamycin and nalidixic acid. This process resulted in merodiploid integration of pINT into the homologous site in the aat gene. Integration of pJP5603 constructs resulted in duplication of predicted codons 64-230 of aatP, 100-272 of aatA, 58-204 of aatB, 36-136 of aatC, and 73-239 of aatD. To complement aat mutants, the aat cluster was amplified by PCR using primers listed in Table III and cloned into the single copy vector pZC320. Amplifications were performed with 500 ng of purified genomic DNA as templates in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 2.5 units of Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase, 0.5 μm of each primer, 0.3 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate,"

https://openalex.org/W2049076566,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), normally activated by Janus kinase (JAK) in response to cytokine stimulation, has been shown to have oncogenic potential. In addition to JAK, recent data suggest that STAT3 can also be activated by other proteins such as the aberrant fusion protein, NPM-ALK, which is expressed in a subset of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). In this study, we investigated the possible role of JAK in activating STAT3 in ALCL using two ALK-positive ALCL cell lines, Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1. At the steady state, JAK3 showed detectable tyrosine phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation. Treatment with AG490, a JAK inhibitor, decreased but did not completely abrogate tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT3 in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained using two other inhibitors of JAK3, WHI-P131 and WHI-P154. These biochemical changes were associated with apoptosis in both cell lines that was coupled with activation of caspase 3 and decreased bcl-xL and bcl-2. Cell cycle analysis revealed a decrease in the S phase, which may be attributed to cyclin D3 downregulation and p21waf1 upregulation. Importantly, the tyrosine kinase activity of NPM-ALK, as assessed by an in vitro assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of AG490. Our findings highlight the importance of JAK3 in activating STAT3 in ALCL, and that NPM-ALK-mediated activation of STAT3 is influenced by the functional status of JAK3."
https://openalex.org/W2159465854,"Clp ATPases are unique chaperones that promote protein unfolding and subsequent degradation by proteases. The mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of ClpX is a C4-type zinc binding domain (ZBD) involved in substrate recognition. ZBD forms a very stable dimer that is essential for promoting the degradation of some typical ClpXP substrates such as λO and MuA but not GFP-SsrA. Furthermore, experiments indicate that ZBD contains a primary binding site for the λO substrate and for the cofactor SspB. Removal of ZBD from the ClpX sequence renders the ATPase activity of ClpX largely insensitive to the presence of ClpP, substrates, or the SspB cofactor. All these results indicate that ZBD plays an important role in the ClpX mechanism of function and that ATP binding and/or hydrolysis drives a conformational change in ClpX involving ZBD.

All these results indicate that ZBD plays an important role in the ClpX mechanism of function and that ATP binding and/or hydrolysis drives a conformational change in ClpX involving ZBD. Clp ATPases are a unique group of ATP-dependent chaperones associated with the disassembly of protein complexes (1.Hoskins J.R. Sharma S. Sathyanarayana B.K. Wickner S. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 413-429Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). They are members of the AAA family of proteins, which are ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities. The key feature of this family is a highly conserved AAA module of about 230 amino acids that is present in one or more copies in each protein. Each module can typically be divided into two subdomains: one αβ and one all α (2.Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the αβ subdomain, there is a conserved Walker A motif, involved in binding the phosphate of ATP, and a Walker B motif, involved in metal binding and ATP catalysis (3.Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The unifying structural feature of these AAA proteins is the arrangement of the subunits into ring-shaped hexameric or heptameric complexes. The main Clp ATPases in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm are ClpA, ClpB, ClpX, and HslU. They function to unfold proteins or to disaggregate protein aggregates. They all have N-terminal domains followed by AAA modules, except for HslU, which has an insertion in the AAA module that is thought to correspond to the N-terminal domains in the other Clps (4.Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Both ClpA and ClpB have two AAA modules, whereas ClpX and HslU have only one, which is homologous to the second AAA module in ClpA and ClpB (3.Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). ClpA and ClpX form hexameric complexes that can associate with ClpP (5.Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a serine protease consisting of two rings with 7-fold symmetry (6.Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Several ClpXP and ClpAP substrates are known (reviewed in Ref. 1.Hoskins J.R. Sharma S. Sathyanarayana B.K. Wickner S. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 413-429Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ClpA substrates include RepA, HemA, N-end rule proteins, and ClpA itself. Known ClpX substrates include λO, MuA, Mu repressor, UmuD′, σS, and Phd. Some of these proteins, such as λO and RepA, are recognized by the chaperones mainly through their N termini, whereas others, like MuA and Mu repressor, seem to be recognized mainly through their C termini. More recently, a proteomics approach revealed more than 50 potential ClpXP substrates in E. coli (7.Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Analysis of these substrates revealed three C-terminal ClpX recognition consensus sequences and two such N-terminal sequences. Both ClpXP and ClpAP have been implicated in the degradation of C-terminally SsrA-tagged proteins (8.Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The SsrA tag, which has a very hydrophobic sequence of 11 amino acids, is cotranslationally added to the C terminus of stalled nascent chains (9.Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). In addition, ClpA and ClpX have been shown to bind to adaptor proteins that affect their function (10.Zhou Y. Gottesman S.

It has been proposed that an SspB dimer binds to two GFP-SsrA molecules and that this complex subsequently binds to the ClpX hexamer (12.Wah D.A. Levchenko I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A number of elegant studies have demonstrated the ability of ClpX and ClpA to unfold native proteins (15.Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L.

Experiments have suggested that unfolding, translocation, and degradation take place in a unidirectional manner starting from the attachment point of the degradation tag (19.Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 20.Reid B.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Weber-Ban E.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3768-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The importance of the N-terminal domain of Clp ATPases in these processes has been rather enigmatic. The N terminus of ClpB from Thermus thermophilus has been shown not to be essential for chaperone activity in vitro (21.Beinker P. Schlee S. Groemping Y. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47160-47166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and ClpB from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 with the N terminus deleted was able to restore bacterial thermotolerance in vivo (22.Clarke A.K. Eriksson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7092-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the other hand, E. coli ClpB lacking its N terminus was shown to be either inactive (23.Barnett M.E.

ClpA deleted of the N terminus can mediate the ClpP-dependent degradation of SsrA-tagged substrates (11.Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol.

Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, the N terminus of ClpX is not required for the degradation of GFP-SsrA by ClpXP but is required for the degradation of λO (26.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The importance of the N-terminal domain of ClpX is evident from its conservation across all sequenced genomes. The domain is present in almost all known clpX sequences (Table I). Here we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of ClpX is a C4-type zinc binding domain (ZBD) 1The abbreviations used are: ZBDzinc binding domainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMBPmaltose binding proteinPAR4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinolPMBp-hydroxymercuribenzoateICP-AESinductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBSAbovine serum albuminNi-NTAnickelnitrilotriacetic acid.1The abbreviations used are: ZBDzinc binding domainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMBPmaltose binding proteinPAR4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinolPMBp-hydroxymercuribenzoateICP-AESinductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBSAbovine serum albuminNi-NTAnickelnitrilotriacetic acid. that forms a very stable constitutive dimer, which is necessary for binding of λO and SspB to ClpX. In addition, we show that, unlike the full-length chaperone, the presence of ClpP, substrates, or cofactors does not significantly affect the ATPase activity of ClpX lacking the zinc binding domain.Table IConservation of ClpP and ClpX across different genomesClpPClpXPresentPresentZBDIGFArchaebacteria16 complete genomesNoNoBacteria118 genomesYesYesYesYesMollicutes, six complete genomesNoNoEukaryotes FungiNeurospora crassaNoYesNoYesSaccharomyces cerevisiaeNoYesNoNoSchizosaccharomyces pombeNoNoEncephalitozoon cuniculiNoNo PlantArabidopsis thalianaYesYes (3)Yes (2), No (1)Yes (3)Oryza sativaYesYesYesYes AnimalCaenorhabditis elegansYesYesYesYesAnopheles gambiaeYesYesYesYesDrosophila melanogasterYesYesYesYesHomo sapiensYesYesYesYesMus musculusYesYesYesYesRattus norvegicusYesYesYesYes CryptophytaGuillardia theta NUCLEOMORPHYesNo AlveolataPlasmodium falciparumYesNo Open table in a new tab zinc binding domain green fluorescent protein maltose binding protein 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol p-hydroxymercuribenzoate inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bovine serum albumin nickelnitrilotriacetic acid. zinc binding domain green fluorescent protein maltose binding protein 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol p-hydroxymercuribenzoate inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bovine serum albumin nickelnitrilotriacetic acid. Subcloning and Mutagenesis—All proteins were expressed from the pProEX HTb vector (Invitrogen) except for MBP-ZBD[1–60], which was expressed from pMAL C2 vector (New England Biolabs). Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's protocol. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. pET9aClpP overexpressing untagged ClpP was a gift from Dr. John Flanagan (Brookhaven National Laboratory). pRLM266 overexpressing λO protein was a gift from Dr. Roger McMacken (Johns Hopkins University). pMK951 overexpressing MuA protein was a gift from Dr. George Chaconas (University of Western Ontario). Protein Purification and Peptide Synthesis—All tagged proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocols, and, if required, the tag was removed using tobacco etch virus protease. ClpP (27.Flanagan J.M. Wall J.S. Capel M.S. Schneider D.K. Shanklin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10910-10917Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), λO (28.Roberts J.D. McMacken R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7435-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and MuA (29.Baker T.A. Mizuuchi M. Savilahti H. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1993; 74: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were purified according to published protocols. Protein concentrations were determined using either the Bradford assay or the 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) assay to measure cysteine content. The SsrA peptide was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry. Analysis of ZBD Zinc Content—Zinc content was analyzed either by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Optima 3000 spectrometer or by a colorimetric assay. For ICP-AES, protein samples were dialyzed against two changes of Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 10–20 mg/ml Chelex resin (Bio-Rad). The emission of 19 metals was monitored. In the colorimetric assay, ZBD was diluted to 5 μm in Buffer B (25 mm TrisHCl, pH 8, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 100 μm 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) at room temperature and then p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (PMB) was titrated into the solution. A sample was removed after each addition to monitor formation of PAR2·Zn+2 at 500 nm. The average of the Zn+2 concentration, determined from a standard curve, released after four molar equivalents of PMB was divided by the protein concentration in the assay to determine the moles of Zn+2 metal bound per mole of protein monomer. Mu Phage Assay—Mu phage particles were isolated and purified from HM8305 F' Mucts62 E. coli strain, according to published protocols (30.Morgan G.J. Hatfull G.F. Casjens S. Hendrix R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 337-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The strain was a gift from Dr. George Chaconas (University of Western Ontario). Mu phage plaque formation at 37 °C in MC4100 clpX::KanR strain transformed with different ClpX mutants was measured. The strain was a gift from Ariane Toussaint (Université Libre de Bruxelles). All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Measurement of GFP-SsrA Expression and Stability in Vivo—E. coli strains MC4100 and MC4100 clpX::KanR were transformed with pGFP or pGFP-SsrA (ChloramphenicolR) (31.Bohn C. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and the ΔclpX strains were subsequently transformed with pProEX HTb (AmpR) plasmid encoding clpX or clpXΔZBD genes. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with appropriate antibiotic selection until A600 of ∼0.4, and the expression of GFP and GFP-SsrA was induced using 0.2% arabinose. Samples were taken at 20, 40, and 60 min post-induction and diluted to an A600 of ∼0.3 using Buffer C (25 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). Fluorescence was measured by setting excitation at 395 nm and monitoring emission from 410–600 nm. The emission was normalized to the peak at 456 nm, which is dependent on the density of the cells. Coexpression of H6-ZBD[1–60] and ClpX—The plasmids pET28b and pET3a expressing H6-ZBD and ClpX, respectively, were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells, and the coexpression of the two proteins was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. ClpX was also expressed alone as a control. Cells from 50 ml of culture were lysed by sonication in Buffer D (25 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole) with 1 mg/ml lysozyme after 20 min of incubation on ice. Purification was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bound proteins were eluted with Buffer D plus 250 mm imidazole. Proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE. Cross-linking of ZBD[1–60]—Cross-linking was carried out in Buffer E (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm ZnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) using glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 0.05% and a final protein concentration of 1 μm. Samples were removed at different time points, and the reaction was quenched by adding TrisHCl, pH 8, to a final concentration of 0.5 m. Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis of ZBD[1–60]—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments and analysis were performed at the Analytical Centrifugation Facility at the Ontario Cancer Institute (Toronto). ZBD[1–60] was exchanged into Buffer F [25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine] and diluted to concentrations of 100, 166, and 233 μm. Experiments were performed at four different speeds at 20 °C. Circular Dichroism of ZBD—CD measurements were obtained using an AVIV Circular Dichroism spectrometer Model 62ADS or a Jasco J-810. Proteins were diluted into Buffer G (25 mm TrisHCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm ZnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Fitting the Denaturation Curves—To analyze the data from thermal and chemical denaturation experiments, a model where the native ZBD dimer (N2) unfolds directly to two unfolded monomers (U) was used. Analysis was carried out according to Bowie and Sauer (32.Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7139-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); however, a global fit to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, shown in Equation 1, was done to obtain Tm, ΔH(Tm), and ΔCp, where Tm is the temperature at which KU = [U]2/[N2] = 1.ΔGU=ΔH(Tm)(1-TTm)+ΔCp[T-Tln(TTm)-Tm](Eq. 1) Degradation Assays—Assays were typically carried out by preincubating a degradation mixture consisting of 1.5 units of creatine kinase, 16 mm creatine phosphate, 3 mm ATP, 4 μm substrate protein, 1.2 μm ClpP in Buffer H (25 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.03% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol) at 37 °C for 3 min. Subsequently, 1 μm ClpX or ClpX mutant was added to the reaction, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C. All concentrations are those of monomers. Samples were taken at the indicated time points, and the degradation was stopped by addition of 4× Laemmli buffer and boiling. Proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE, and the intensities of the protein bands (IPB) were quantified using ImageQuant 5.0. The initial rate (V0) was determined from the slope of the plot of ln(IPB) versus time for the first 5 min of the reaction. Degradation of GFP-SsrA was also monitored by fluorescence using a Fluorolog spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon) with the excitation wavelength set at 395 nm and the emission wavelength set at 509 nm. For the GFP-SsrA competition assays, SsrA peptide, λO, MuA, or SspB were preincubated with the degradation mixture prior to the addition of ClpX. ELISA Assay—The wells of a 96-well plate were coated with λO, MuA, GFP-SsrA, or BSA (100 μl, 20 μg/ml) in 20 mm Na2CO3, pH 9, for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed with Buffer I (25 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with 200 μl of 5% milk protein in Buffer I for an additional hour at 37 °C. The wells were then washed with Buffer J (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20) plus 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated with increasing amounts of ZBD[1–60] for 1 h (total volume 100 μl). This step and all subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Wells were washed with Buffer J (200 μl, three times), incubated with 100 μl of a 1:3000 dilution of anti-ClpX serum for 1 h, and washed and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A (1:10,000 dilution, 100 μl) in Buffer J was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed, and 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate (T0440; Sigma) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min, and the absorbance was measured at 650 nm using a SPECTRAmax 340PC plate reader (Molecular Devices). ATPase Activity Using NADH—ATPase activity of ClpX was measured using a coupled assay (33.Norby J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Assays were typically carried out by preincubating 1.0 μm ClpX or ClpX mutant, 0.2 mm NADH, 3.0 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 4.7 units of pyruvate kinase, and 7.4 units of lactate dehydrogenase in Buffer H at 37 °C for 3 min. 1.2 μm ClpP, 4 μm GFP-SsrA, 4 μm λO, or 0.33 μm SspB were included as indicated. Subsequently, 5 mm ATP was added to the reaction, and the change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 20 min at 37 °C. The rate of ADP formation was calculated assuming a 1:1 correspondence between NADH oxidation and ATP regeneration and an extinction coefficient of 6230 m–1 cm–1 (33.Norby J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The assay was repeated at least three times. The N Terminus of ClpX Is a Dimer Containing a C4-type Zinc Binding Motif—Purified ClpX (10 μg in 140 μl) was subjected to limited proteolysis using sub-stoichiometric amounts of trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. At very low trypsin quantities (0.1 ng), a 7-kDa peptide that mapped to the N-terminal 60 amino acids of ClpX was detected (numbering according to Swiss-Prot P33138). This region appeared to be very stable and was not degraded with higher protease quantities. Our results are generally consistent with earlier observations made by Singh et al. (26.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the N terminus of ClpX was cloned and purified, and its ability to bind Zn+2 was characterized using ICP-AES and a colorimetric assay (Fig. 1A). Both techniques clearly demonstrated that the N terminus of ClpX spanning residues 1–60 bound Zn+2 in a ratio of one Zn+2 ion per protein monomer. We call this domain ZBD[1–60] for zinc binding domain of ClpX spanning residues 1 to 60. Only the first four cysteines (Cys-14, Cys-17, Cys-36, and Cys-39) are involved in chelating the Zn+2, because mutants lacking the fifth cysteine (Cys-43) were still able to bind Zn+2 in one to one molar ratio, whereas the C36A mutant resulted in the formation of a destabilized domain that did not contain Zn+2 (Fig. 1A). These results, as well as previous observations (34.Banecki B. Wawrzynow A. Puzewicz J. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), clearly suggest that the highly conserved CX2CX18–40CX2C motif in ZBD of ClpX is a C4-type zinc finger. ZBD[1–60] migrated as a 28-kDa protein on a gel filtration column (not shown). This is much larger than a monomer, because the predicted molecular mass of ZBD[1–60] is 7.046 kDa. Consequently, the oligomeric state of ZBD[1–60] was further investigated using several techniques. In an initial approach, chemical cross-linking was performed using glutaraldehyde. It was found that a cross-linked dimer could be detected in as little as 15 s, and higher oligomers were not detected even after 30 min (Fig. 1B). This oligomerization was judged to be specific at the protein concentration used (1 μm), because denaturation of ZBD[1–60] either by chemical or heat treatment (Fig. 1B) yielded no detectable dimeric species even after 30 min. ZBD[1–60] was further characterized by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation at higher concentrations (100, 166, and 233 μm). The data was best fit to a single species with an apparent molecular mass of 14.94 kDa (Fig. 1C). This value is very close to the expected molecular mass of a dimer. The dimerization of ZBD[1–60] is not mediated by Cys-43, because ZBD[1–41] also formed a dimer as determined by gel filtration (not shown). ZBD[1–53], which has the domain boundaries identified by Singh et al. (26.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), also migrated as a dimer. Furthermore, ZBD was able to force the dimerization of known monomers. Two fusion proteins, ZBD[1–60]-GFP (N-terminal fusion with green fluorescent protein) and MBP-ZBD[1–60] (C-terminal fusion with maltose binding protein), migrated as dimers when examined by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1D). Both GFP and MBP migrated as monomers. These experiments, together with the cross-linking and ultracentrifugation data, clearly demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of ClpX is not a monomer as published previously (26.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but rather forms a stable dimer. To demonstrate that this domain exists as a dimer in the context of the full-length chaperone, ClpX and His-tagged ZBD[1–60] were coexpressed and purified on a Ni-NTA column. ClpX co-purified on Ni-NTA only when coexpressed with His-tagged ZBD, whereas it did not bind to the resin nonspecifically in the absence of H6-ZBD[1–60] (Fig. 2A). However, when purified, untagged ZBD[1–60], which is already dimeric, was mixed with purified His-tagged ClpX, which forms mixed oligomers, and then passed over the Ni-NTA column, no interaction between the two proteins was observed (Fig. 2B). H6-ClpX bound specifically to the column, whereas untagged ZBD[1–60] did not bind to the column. Similarly, Singh et al. (26.Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) had shown that the N-terminal domain of ClpX does not interact with the rest of the chaperone as determined by gel filtration. Hence, in the coexpression experiment, untagged ClpX must be interacting with His-tagged ZBD[1–60] through the dimerization of newly synthesized H6-ZBD[1–60] with the N-terminal domains of newly synthesized ClpX. This surprising observation of the dimerization of the ClpX N terminus leads us to propose that the hexameric ClpX could possibly function as a trimer-of-dimers. Stability of the ZBD Dimer—CD spectra of ZBD[1–60] were obtained for the native, denatured, and renatured protein (Fig. 3A). The spectrum of the renatured protein overlays perfectly with that of the native protein, indicating that thermal denaturation is completely reversible. Thermally and chemically induced unfolding of ZBD[1–60], as monitored by CD at 220 nm, was reversible and occurred in a cooperative fashion, with a single transition region (Fig. 3, B and C). The stability of ZBD[1–60] was decreased in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 3B) indicating that Zn+2 is a structural metal necessary for the stability of this small domain. Furthermore, the denaturation profile exhibited a concentration dependence as expected for a protein oligomer (compare 3 to 30 μm in Fig. 3B). This result further establishes ZBD[1–60] as a dimer. The single transition observed upon thermal and chemical denaturation, and the concentration dependence of the denaturation process, all indicate that the dimer is present in the unfolding transition region. The monomer is not populated to a great extent in that region, because the free energy of unfolding, ΔGU, in the transition region of the thermal denaturation is the same at the two different concentrations (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the denaturation data were fit to a two state model where the native ZBD[1–60] dimer (N2) unfolds directly to two unfolded monomers (U). Based on this model and the fit of the data in Fig. 3D to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation (see “Experimental Procedures”), the thermodynamic parameters for ZBD[1–60] stability at 25 °C were found to be ΔGU = 9.9 Kcal mol–1, ΔHU = 16.5 Kcal mol–1, ΔSU = 22 cal mol–1 K–1, and ΔCp = 0.41 Kcal mol–1 K–1. These values demonstrate that ZBD[1–60] is a very stable dimer that can withstand thermal stress and is ideally suited to be a domain in a protein involved in heat stress response. ZBD Is Essential for ClpX Function in Mu Phage Replication—Replicative transposition during the lytic cycle of bacteriophage Mu requires the function of the ClpX chaperone (35.Mhammedi-Alaoui A. Pato M. Gama M.J. Toussaint A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2089283797,"Transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 gene is a key step in cell proliferation. Accordingly, cyclin D1 overexpression is frequently an early step in neoplastic transformation, particularly in mammary epithelium. Numerous studies have linked elevated cyclin D1 promoter activity to a sustained activation of the ERK1/2 cascade. Here we show that the ERK5 cascade, a distinct mitogen-induced MAPK pathway, can also drive cyclin D1 expression. In CCL39 cells, serum induces a strong, prolonged peak of ERK1/2 and ERK5 phosphorylation, and subsequently elevates cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of constitutively active MEK5 and wt ERK5 induces a cyclin D1 reporter gene (D1 −973-luciferase) at least as well as constitutively active MEK1. Activation is blocked by kinase-dead mutants of ERK5 and ERK2, respectively. Mutation of the CRE at −50 in the cyclin D1 promoter decreases activation by the ERK5 but not the ERK1/2 cascade. Importantly, expression of kinase-dead ERK5 diminishes endogenous cyclin D1 protein induction by serum in CCL39 cells and the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and HS579. These data identify the cyclin D1 gene as a novel target of the ERK5 cascade, an observation with important implications in cancers involving cyclin D1 deregulation."

Sensitization was accompanied by caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation, whereas no cleavage of caspase-9 was observed. Determination of cell surface receptors by flow cytometry demonstrated no difference in Apo2L/TRAIL-R1 and -R2 expression, the two receptors with functional death domains, between resistant and sensitized cells. In cells treated with the combination of Apo2L/TRAIL and PG490, we observed activation of ERK2, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. Furthermore, sensitization could be blocked by the ERK inhibitor U0126 but not the p38 inhibitor SB203580, suggesting that activation of ERK2 is required for this effect. In addition, sensitization of lung cancer cells was also seen in ex vivo culture of lung cancer tissue from four patients who underwent surgery. Immunohistochemical staining showed a clear reduction in proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in tissue treated with Apo2L/TRAIL and PG490. In conclusion, apoptosis induced by the combination of Apo2L/TRAIL and PG490 warrants further evaluation as a potential new strategy for the treatment of lung cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2087128098,"Secreted proteins and their cognate receptors are implicated in a myriad of activities that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. CREG, a cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes, is a secreted glycoprotein that antagonizes cellular transformation by E1A and ras. We have previously shown that CREG expression is induced very early during differentiation of pluripotent cells and, even in the absence of other inducers, CREG promotes neuronal differentiation of human teratocarcinoma NTERA-2 cells. Here we show that ectopic expression of CREG in NTERA-2 cells results in a delay of the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle and growth inhibition. We show that CREG binds directly to the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) dependent on CREG glycosylation. The M6P/IGF2R is a tumor suppressor that functions to control cell growth through interactions with multiple ligands. By analysing CREG activity in cells lacking M6P/IGF2R expression, we show that this receptor is required for CREG-induced growth inhibition. These studies reveal that CREG inhibits cell growth dependent on the M6P/IGF2R and suggest that interactions between CREG and a well-characterized tumor suppressor may contribute to regulation of proliferation and differentiation in multiple lineages."

The toxic purine analogs (6-methylpurine (MeP) and 2-fluoroadenine (F-Ade)) generated from these prodrugs readily diffuse across cell membranes, have high bystander activity not requiring cell-to-cell contact, and can kill the complete cell population even with gene expression in only 0.1-1% of the cells (15Sorscher E.J.

To optimize PNP anticancer gene therapy, the prodrug should be completely inert with respect to human enzymes and efficiently cleaved only by tumor cells expressing E. coli PNP. But whereas excellent in vivo antitumor activity has been demonstrated with MeP-dR, F-araA, and F-dAdo, these compounds all have dose-limiting toxicities. A better understanding of the structural basis for substrate specificity of the enzyme would allow modification of the prodrugs coupled with enzyme redesign to maintain activity levels while decreasing toxicity. Therefore, we have used crystallography to study the binding of MeP-dR, F-dAdo, and other nucleoside analogs to E. coli PNP. In our previous work (10Mao C. Cook W.J. Zhou M. Koszalka G.W. Krenitsky T.A. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the purine binding site was identified in complexes with R 1-P and 6-iodopurine, whereas Koellner et al. determined the structure of complexes with the inhibitors formycin B (FMB; 8-aza-7-deazainosine) (30Koellner G. Luic M. Shugar D. Saenger W. Bzowska A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and formycin A (8-aza-7-deazaadenosine) (31Koellner G. Bzowska A. Wielgus-Kutrowska B. Luic M. Steiner T. Saenger W. Stepinski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 351-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We report here the structure of E. coli PNP in association with 10 purine nucleosides (Fig. 1), which vary in both the base (hypoxanthine, 8-aza-7-deazahypoxanthine, adenine, 7-deazaadenine, 2-fluoroadenine, 6-methylpurine, and 6-methylthiopurine) and sugar (ribose, 2′-deoxyribose, arabinose, and xylose) portion of the molecule. We have also performed kinetic studies on the substrates and carried out computer modeling to examine the role of sugar modifications on reactivity. This information, together with knowledge about the structure of mammalian PNPs (32Koellner G. Luic M. Shugar D. Saenger W. Bzowska A. J. Mol.

Furthermore, an understanding of substrate analog binding should allow us to rationally change the enzyme to cleave novel prodrugs that are not cleaved by either human or wild type bacterial PNPs. Crystallization—Purified E. coli PNP was a gift from Dr. George W. Koszalka of Wellcome Research Laboratories. Crystals have been reported in hexagonal (34Cook W.J. Ealick S.E. Krenitsky T.A.

Ealick S.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) forms. Soaks using monoclinic crystals gave poor ligand electron density. Therefore, the hexagonal crystal form (space group P6122 with three monomers designated A, B, and C per asymmetric unit) was used. Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. Drops contained 3 μl of 60 mg/ml E. coli PNP and 3 μl of well solution consisting of 1 ml of 30% ammonium sulfate and 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.4. Needle-like crystals appeared in about 1 week, with approximate dimensions of 1 mm in length × 0.1 mm in thickness. Typical unit cell dimensions were a = 122.0 Å and c = 242.8 Å with 56% solvent content. X-ray Intensity Measurements—Ligands were soaked into the crystals for 24-36 h, with concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 mm depending on solubility. Crystals were flash frozen at 100 K with liquid nitrogen, using 30% glycerol as a cryoprotectant, and typically diffracted to about 2.2-Å resolution. Data were collected at CHESS stations A1, F1, and F2. Various CCD x-ray detectors were used, including Area Detector Systems Quantum 1 single module and Quantum 4 mosaic CCD detectors and a Princeton Scientific Instruments 2k CCD detector. Exposure times ranged from 30 to 50 s per frame with a frame typically consisting of 1° of rotation. A total of 50-120° of data were collected depending on beam time constraints and the type of detector used. The data were processed using the programs DENZO (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and SCALEPACK (36Otwinowski Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing 29-30 January.

The E. coli PNP structure from the monoclinic crystal form (Protein Data Bank code 1ECP) was used as a search model. A set of 3-fold related monomers was positioned in the unit cell and used to calculate a difference Fourier map using the PHASES software (38Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The structure was refined by simulated annealing with restricted, isotropic individual B-factors. A final round of crystallographic energy minimization and B-factor refinement, including all reflections, was performed using CNS (39Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Manual side chain adjustments were performed using the programs CHAIN (40Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar) and O (41Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The loop region from residue 205 to 220 showed varying degrees of disorder, with the best electron density generated using a weighted (2mFo - dFc)exp(αcalc) map based on SIGMAA (42Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 package (43Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Some loops could be built at the 0.8 σ level, but others have missing residues in the final model. Temperature factors in this region were much higher than for the rest of the molecule. Models of inosine (Ino), FMB, 7-deazaadenosine (tubercidin (TBN)), 2-fluoroadenosine (F-Ado), 9-β-d-ribofuranosyl-6-methylthiopurine (MTP-R), MeP-dR, and F-dAdo were directly constructed into the corresponding difference electron density. The ligand densities for adenosine (Ado), 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyladenine (AraA), and 9-β-d-xylofuranosyladenine (XylA) were less clear. These maps were improved by 3-fold averaging using the program RAVE (44Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Water molecules were included after the ligand model building. The final models contain three protein chains, three ligand molecules, three ions modeled as phosphates, and several hundred water molecules. B-factors for the ligands sometimes varied considerably among monomers of the same complex. The lowest average ligand B-factors within a complex ranged from 18 (F-Ado monomer C) to 76 (AraA monomer C). In 2Fo - Fc maps based on the final model, density connectivity between sugar and base was observed for all monomers of all complexes except AraA and Ado.

The enzyme concentration was adjusted for each compound so that product formation increased linearly with respect to time. The substrate concentrations were near the Km values and in all cases were in great excess of the enzyme concentration (>1000-fold). After incubation for the desired time at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by boiling, and the precipitated proteins were removed by filtration (0.2 μm). Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (5-μm BDS Hypersil C-18 column, 150 × 4.6 mm; Keystone Scientific Inc., State College, PA) was used to separate products from substrates, which were detected as they eluted from the column by their absorbance at their absorbance maxima. The mobile phase was 1.25-5% acetonitrile (depending on the nucleoside) in 50 mm ammonium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The Michaelis-Menten parameters were determined from linear double reciprocal plots of 1/velocity versus 1/concentration of the substrate. The best line was determined by linear regression of at least five datum points (the regression coefficient for each measurement was greater than 0.95), and the Km and Vmax values were determined from the intercept of the x and y axis, respectively.

Modeling of Intermediate Formation—To examine the role of sugar pucker in reaching the proposed oxocarbenium intermediate reaction state, computer modeling was carried out on the Ado, AraA, Ino, and XylA ligands using the GB/SA solvation model (45Qiu D. Shenkin P.S. Hollinger F.P. Still W.C. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1997; 101: 3005-3014Crossref Scopus (931) Google Scholar) and AMBER* force field implemented in MacroModel version 7.2 (46Mohamadi F.

Because the bottom of the energy well of the crystal structure appeared to be wide, a weak restraint of 1.0 kJ/mol-Å2 was applied to the substrate to prevent drifting away from the crystallographic position, whereas the protein was restrained at 200 kJ/mol-Å2, and the phosphate was left unrestrained due to software limitations. To mimic the formation of the oxocarbenium intermediate, the force field parameter for the glycosidic bond was adjusted to a bond length 50% greater than normal, and the O-4′-C-1′-N-9 and C-2′-C-1′-N-9 angle parameters were set to 90°. The structures were energy-minimized with these modified parameters to obtain an approximate model for how the ligand moves during the reaction. Modeling of Ribose 1-Phosphate—Because only density for the adenine base was observed in an attempted soak including R 1-P, the DockVision program (47Hart T.N. Read R.J. Proteins. 1992; 13: 206-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was utilized to position a R 1-P molecule into the E. coli PNP active site. Both the Monte Carlo simulation option and genetic algorithm within DockVision were used, but only the Monte Carlo simulation gave reasonable results. These calculations were performed using the Cornell Theory Center work station cluster. Four Monte Carlo simulations and two genetic algorithm runs were performed with a distance cut-off of 8.0 Å. For the four Monte Carlo simulations, the numbers of trials were set at 10,000, 20,000, 10,000, and 20,000, and dielectric constants were set at 1, 1, 2, and 4, respectively. For genetic algorithm runs, the number of generations was set at 10,000, and the dielectric constant was set at 1 or 2. The results of the genetic algorithm runs were inconsistent with no convergence. The Monte Carlo simulation gave much better results, and the run with the highest dielectric constant resulted in a cluster of 26 R 1-P structures located near the expected binding site. Of these 26 models, the one with the lowest energy had the best hydrogen bonding interactions and is the one described in this paper.

The PNP hexamer is a disc 60 Å thick and 100 Å in diameter, with D3 symmetry and a noncrystallographic 3-fold axis in the crystal form utilized for these studies (Fig. 2). The monomers alternate in an up/down fashion around the disc, with three of the active sites near the top and three near the bottom. Each of the six active sites utilizes residues from a pair of 2-fold related monomers. In the present work, the structures of the three crystallographically independent monomers vary slightly within the hexamer and from complex to complex. The largest difference is the conformation of the loop region from residues 205-220, which follows the catalytically important residue Asp204. The other three subunits of the hexamer are generated by crystallographic symmetry. No global differences in domain orientation are observed for the previously reported structures and the 10 complexes reported here. Each monomer consists of a mixed β-sheet core flanked by eight α-helices. The core can be divided into a large eight-stranded β-sheet and a smaller five-stranded β-sheet that pack together to form a distorted β-barrel, an arrangement also found in human PNP (2Ealick S.E.

The purine binding site consists of Ala156, Phe159, Val178, Met180, Ile206, and Asp204. The first four of these residues form a hydrophobic pocket around the purine base. Phe159 is located between the purine base and the hydrophobic face of the sugar and makes an angle of ∼60° with the plane of the purine ring. Met180 also lies between the purine base and the hydrophobic face of the ribosyl group. It has been proposed that in E. coli PNP, a protonated Asp204 stabilizes the transition state, in which electron density from the weakening bond is transferred to the purine ring, by donating a hydrogen bond to the purine N-7 atom (10Mao C. Cook W.J. Zhou M. Koszalka G.W. Krenitsky T.A. Ealick S.E. Structure. 1997; 5: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Evidence for protonation of Asp204 comes from fluorescence studies on the inhibitor FMB, which exists in tautomeric equilibrium between N-7-H and N-8-H forms (IUPAC conventions for ring numbering systems vary among bases; for consistency, we use only the purine ring numbering as shown for inosine in Fig. 1). Although the N-8-H form (which could hydrogen-bond to a protonated Asp204) is the minor (∼20%) tautomer in solution (30Koellner G. Luic M. Shugar D. Saenger W. Bzowska A. J. Mol.

Acta. 2000; 1476: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), fluorescence studies have detected an equilibrium shift in favor of this tautomer upon binding to E. coli PNP (49Kierdaszuk B. Modrak-Wojcik A. Wierzchowski J. Shugar D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Also consistent with the proposed role for Asp204, mutating this residue to Ala results in a ∼100-fold reduction in activity on MeP-dR and F-araA. 2E. M. Bennett, C. Li, P. W. Allan, W. B.

In MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, chronic administration of 1 μm dexamethasone (DEX) starting at confluency results in >98% inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) expression and apatite mineral deposition. Here, it is shown that brief exposure to recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2), as short as 6 h, is sufficient to induce irreversible commitment to mineralization in DEX-treated cultures. RhBMP-2 dose dependently rescued mineralization but not collagen accumulation in DEX-inhibited cultures. The selective restoration of mineralization was evident in the higher mineral to matrix ratios of DEX/rhBMP-2 co-treated cultures compared with control. We tested the involvement of the runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in the DEX inhibition and rhBMP-2 rescue of mineralization. Surprisingly, DEX did not decrease Runx2 DNA binding activity, transactivation, or association with the endogenous osteocalcin gene promoter. Furthermore, the rhBMP-2 rescue did not involve Runx2 stimulation, suggesting an important role for factors other than Runx2 in BMP-2 action. Finally, we studied the differentiation-related cell cycle, which persists during commitment to mineralization in untreated cultures, but is inhibited along with mineralization in DEX-treated cultures. Although both rhBMP-2 alone and DEX alone were antimitogenic, rhBMP-2 stimulated this cell cycle in DEX-inhibited cultures. In conclusion, brief rhBMP-2 treatment restores mineralization in DEX-inhibited MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts via a mechanism different from Runx2 stimulation. This restoration may be functionally related to the accompanying rescue of the differentiation-related cell cycle.

A major side effect of GC treatment is rapid bone loss and increased risk for fracture (1Van Staa T.P. Leufkens H.G. Abenhaim L. Zhang B. Cooper C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). The chief mechanism underlying bone loss during long term GC treatment is impairment of bone formation (2Weinstein R.S.

Investigation of the adverse effects of GCs on osteoblasts has been hampered by the positive actions of these same agents, which are primarily seen in vitro. In some isolated osteoblast cultures, the positive versus the negative effects occur at physiological versus pharmacological concentrations, respectively (18Ishida Y. Heersche J.N. J. Bone Miner.

Moreover, in these cultures, administration of the synthetic GC dexamethasone (DEX) at pharmacological concentrations of 0.1–1 μm strongly inhibits collagen accumulation and mineralization (11Smith E.

Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the DEX inhibition of mineralization occurs only during a commitment stage that is characterized by a cobblestone culture morphology and a uniquely controlled cell cycle (12Smith E. Coetzee G.A. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18191-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Additionally, DEX inhibits this commitment-associated cell cycle, possibly revealing a mechanism for the DEX inhibition of nodule formation and mineralization (11Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R.

Recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) has been shown to overcome the inhibitory action of prednisolone on fracture healing (27Luppen C.A. Blake C.A. Ammirati K.M. Stevens M.L. Seeherman H.J. Wozney J.M. Bouxsein M.L. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the DEX-mediated arrest of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast differentiation is associated with strong inhibition of endogenous BMP-2 gene expression (16Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This inhibition appears to play a pivotal role in the overall adverse effect of GCs because administration of exogenous rhBMP-2 along with DEX counteracted the inhibitory effect of DEX on mineralization (16Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, nodule formation, characteristic of osteoblast differentiation in vitro, was not rescued by rhBMP-2 in the DEX-inhibited cultures (16Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although collagen mRNA was induced by rhBMP-2 in the DEX-treated cultures, the DEX inhibition of extracellular collagen fibril accumulation was not reversed by rhBMP-2 (16Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of GCs on mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cultures is reversible (11Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, we began the present study by asking if rhBMP-2 could rescue mineralization in DEX-treated cultures when administered after DEX. Also, because GCs cannot inhibit mineralization when administered after the commitment stage described above, we asked if brief rhBMP-2 exposure of chronically DEX-treated cultures could elicit a commitment process sufficient for mineralization. Furthermore, we asked if a rescue mediated by brief exposure to rhBMP-2 is associated with recapitulation of the commitment-associated cell cycle as observed in untreated cultures. Additionally, because GCs inhibit Runx2 in calvarial and bone marrow stromal osteoblast cultures (17Chang D.J. Ji C. Kim K.K. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol.

Bone. 2002; 30: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and because BMPs induce Runx2 (29Gori F. Thomas T. Hicok K.C. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), we tested the involvement of this osteoblast master transcription factor in the rhBMP-2 rescue. We report that brief exposure to rhBMP-2 indeed restores both a differentiation-related cell cycle and mineralization in GC-treated MC3T3-E1 cultures. Moreover, both the cell cycle and mineralization are rescued even when exposure to rhBMP-2 commences after DEX treatment has begun. Surprisingly, the rhBMP-2 rescue is not associated with increased Runx2 activity. Reagents—To maintain the MC3T3-E1 cell line, α-minimum essential medium and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA). Individual lots of fetal bovine serum, also from Invitrogen, were selected based on their ability to support mineralization. The lot used in the current study was somewhat less osteogenic than that used in our recent study (16Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner.

The luciferase assay system was purchased from Promega Corp. Luciferase constructs based on osteocalcin promoter sequences were generously provided by Dr. Gerard Karsenty (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX).

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 30,000 cells/cm2 in 12-well plates for histological and biochemical assays, 6-well plates for transfection, and 100-mm plates for cell cycle, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Northern, reverse transcriptase-PCR, electromobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1.5% penicillin/streptomycin. Starting at 80% confluency (typically day 3, after plating on day 0), the culture medium was supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. In some experiments that are not shown, calcium deposition was measured in DEX-treated cultures after brief or chronic exposure to rhBMP-2, all in the presence of 5 mm instead of 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and the results were essentially unchanged. Histological Demonstration of Calcium Deposition—Culture wells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 1 h at 4 °C in 70% ethyl alcohol. Calcium deposits were stained for 10 min at room temperature with Alizarin Red solution (40 mm, pH 4.2) that was filtered through Whatman paper prior to application. Nonspecific staining was removed by several washes in water. Biochemical Assays—Extracts for biochemical assays were collected by scraping the contents of each well in 10 mm Tris saline buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The extracts were tested for alkaline phosphatase activity using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. To measure calcium and DNA, aliquots of the extracts were acid-hydrolyzed (final concentration 0.5 n HCl) prior to processing. The spectrophotometric analyses of the protein (562 nm), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (410 nm), and calcium (575 nm) assays were conducted in 96-well plates using a PowerWaveX microplate scanning spectrophotometer (Biotek Instruments, Winooski, VT). The fluorometric DNA assay was conducted using diaminobenzoic acid essentially according to a published protocol, 2P. G. Held (2001) Lab Division Applications Detail, www.biotek.com. using excitation wavelength 400 ± 15 nm and emission wavelength 485 ± 10 nm on a FLx800 fluorescence microplate reader (Biotek Instruments). For collagen accumulation, cell layers were scraped in PBS, centrifuged, and hydrolyzed in 0.5 m acetic acid for 18 h at 4° C. The acid extracts were reacted with Sircol® reagent, and the collagen-bound dye was quantitated according to the manufacturer's protocol. FTIR—Extracellular matrix composition was analyzed by FTIR. Cell layers were collected in ammoniated water (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0), lyophilized, and analyzed as potassium bromide (KBr) pellets on a Bio-Rad FTS 40-A spectrometer (Bio-Rad). The spectral data were baseline corrected and analyzed using GRAMS/386 software (Galactic Industries, Salem, NH) as previously described (32Kato Y. Boskey A. Spevak L. Dallas M. Hori M. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1622-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The mineral to matrix ratio was derived from the areas of phosphate (900 to 1200 cm-1) and protein amide I (1585 to 1720 cm-1) absorbance. Crystallinity, or crystal maturity, was evaluated based on the intensity ratios of the 1030:1020 sub-bands of the phosphate ν1,ν3 absorbance spectrum (33Boskey A.L. Spevak L. Paschalis E. Doty S.B. McKee M.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2002; 71: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The presence of crystalline apatite was verified by a split phosphate ν2 band (500 to 635 cm-1). RNA Analyses—Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and osteocalcin gene expression was evaluated as previously described (16Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, 15 μg of total RNA was separated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with a 300-bp mouse osteocalcin probe excised from pBGP with BamHI and EcoRI. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The blots were washed extensively in buffer containing 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then at 50 °C and exposed to film overnight. For reverse transcriptase-PCR, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from the Trizol-extracted, DNase-treated RNA. A 187-bp osteocalcin cDNA fragment was PCR amplified as described previously under conditions providing close to linear signal as a function of input (16Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Runx2 Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Cultures for whole cell extract preparation were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell layers were scraped and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1.5 packed cell volumes of lysis buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 28% glycerol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μm MG132). The cells were further subjected to successive passes through 18.5-, 20.5-, and then 23-gauge needles, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was snap frozen and stored at -80 °C. EMSA was performed with 15 μg of whole cell extract and 80 fmol of an end-labeled 23-base pair oligonucleotide probe containing the Runx2-binding OSE2 site from the mouse osteocalcin gene 2 (OG2) promoter (34Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The cell extract was initially preincubated on ice for 10 min in the presence of 100 mm KCl with 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA and, when indicated, unlabeled oligonucleotides or antibodies. Probe binding reaction (final volume: 20 μl) was then performed in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing (final concentrations) 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 2.8% glycerol for 10 min on ice followed by 15 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were then resolved in a 0.25× TBE native polyacrylamide (5%) gel containing 5% glycerol. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—MC3T3-E1 cells were plated as above (day 0) and transiently transfected on day 1 using calcium phosphate co-precipitation as described previously (11Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DEX (1 μm) and/or rhBMP-2 (100 ng/ml) treatment commenced as cultures became confluent on day 4 and lasted 48 h. Cells were then lysed and luciferase activity was determined using an MLX microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). ChIP—ChIP was performed essentially as previously described (35Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed using 1% formaldehyde (10 min, 25 °C) and was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were swelled in hypotonic buffer: 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). Nuclei were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.1) containing 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Resulting chromatin solution was sonicated using a Virsonic 60 sonicator (VirTis Co., Gardiner, NY; 4 pulses at 4 watts, 10 s each) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. At this point, samples were diluted to adjust the absorbance to 0.25 A 260 units and 100 μl was further diluted 10 times with IP buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl) and protease inhibitors. Preclearing was performed with 2 μg of preimmune rabbit IgG and 100 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads. Following overnight incubation with 10 μg of Runx2 antibodies, complexes were precipitated with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose and the beads were sequentially washed with IP buffer, high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), Sarcosyl buffer (0.2% Sarcosyl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and TE. Complexes were eluted twice with 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) and cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h. The DNA was then deproteinized and purified on QIAquick PCR purification column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The osteocalcin -264/-7 promoter fragment was amplified with the primers 5′-gagagcacacagtaggagtggtggag and 5′-tccagcatccagtagcatttatatcg. The insulin -246/-4 promoter fragment was amplified as a negative control with the primers 5′-tggatgcccaccagctttatagtcc and 5′-aactggttcatcaggccatctggtc. PCR were performed within a close to linear range under conditions that yield comparable signals for osteocalcin and insulin when genomic DNA is used as template. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle profiles were determined as previously described (11Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min) in phosphate-buffered saline. Following centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 100% ethyl alcohol and kept at -20 °C. The ethyl alcohol was removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min) and the cells were resuspended in Hanks' balanced buffer solution containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml DNase-free ribonuclease A. Following 30 min incubation at room temperature, the stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using the EPICS™ XL-MCL analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and the percentages of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined using MultiCycle analysis software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Statistical Analysis—Results from each quantitative assay were analyzed to test four effects: (i) the effect of DEX in the absence of BMP-2; (ii) the effect of BMP-2 in the absence of DEX; (iii) the effect of BMP-2 in the presence of DEX and (iv) the effect of chronic versus brief rhBMP-2 treatment for each condition. Mean ± S.D. were compared using the Student's t test and the differences were considered significant when p ≤ 0.05. Inhibition of Mineralization by Chronic DEX Treatment Is Corrected by Chronic BMP-2 Treatment Commencing 48 h after DEX—We have previously shown that rhBMP-2 counteracts GC-mediated inhibition of mineralization in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures (16Luppen C.A. Smith E. Spevak L. Boskey A.L. Frenkel B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In that study the negative regulator, DEX, and the positive regulator, rhBMP-2, were administered together commencing on day 3. The ability of rhBMP-2 to rescue mineralization in cultures that have already been exposed to DEX for a substantial period of time was not tested. Therefore, in the current study, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with DEX starting on day 3 and rhBMP-2 was added 48 h later (day 5). DEX and rhBMP-2 treatments continued throughout the rest of the experiment. Analysis of calcium deposition on day 14, by either Alizarin Red staining (Fig. 1A) or biochemical assay (Fig. 1B), showed that 1 μm DEX completely inhibited mineralization while rhBMP-2, at either 10 or 100 ng/ml, dramatically counteracted the DEX inhibition. A time course experiment (Fig. 1B) revealed that the rhBMP-2-rescued mineralization was even accelerated as compared with that of control cultures. Furthermore, FTIR analysis of day 14 cultures showed that the crystallinity of the rescued mineral was comparable with that of control; the intensity ratio between the 1030 and 1020 phosphate sub-bands ranged between 1.057 and 1.068 in the control cultures and between 1.051 and 1.088 in the cultures rescued with ei"
https://openalex.org/W2000415243,"BRCA1 has been linked to the genetic susceptibility of a majority of familial breast and ovarian cancers. Several lines of evidence indicate that BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor and its expression is downregulated in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer cases. Therefore, the identification of genes involved in the regulation of BRCA1 gene expression might lead to new insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of these tumors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that has well-established roles in the regulation of adipocyte development and glucose homeostasis. More recently, it has been shown that ligands of PPARγ have a potent antitumorigenic activity in breast cancer cells. In the present study we have found that two distinct ligands of PPARγ; 15-deoxy-Δ-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15dPG-J2) and rosiglitazone, increase the levels of BRCA1 protein in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed that, after treatment with 15dPG-J2, the BRCA1 protein is mainly localized in the nucleus. Functional analysis by transient transfection of different 5′-flanking region fragments, as well as gel mobility shift assays and mutagenic analysis, suggests that the effects of 15dPG-J2 and rosiglitazone are mediated through a functional DR1 located between the nucleotides −241 and −229, which is a canonical PPARγ type response element. Our data suggest that PPARγ is a crucial gene regulating BRCA1 gene expression and might therefore be important for the BRCA1 regulatory pathway involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic breast and ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2039103044,"C1-tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthase is a trifunctional enzyme found in eukaryotes that contains the activities 10-formyl-THF synthetase, 5,10-methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase, and 5,10-methylene-THF dehydrogenase. The cytoplasmic isozyme of C1-THF synthase is well characterized in a number of mammals, including humans; but a mitochondrial isozyme has been previously identified only in the yeast Saccharomyces. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the human gene encoding a functional mitochondrial C1-THF synthase. The gene spans 236 kilobase pairs on chromosome 6 and consists of 28 exons plus one alternative exon. The gene encodes a protein of 978 amino acids, including an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. The mitochondrial isozyme is 61% identical to the human cytoplasmic isozyme. Expression of the gene was detected in most human tissues, but transcripts were highest in placenta, thymus, and brain. Two mRNAs were detected, a 3.6-kb transcript and a 1.1-kb transcript, and both transcripts were observed in varying ratios in each tissue. The shorter transcript results from an alternative splicing event, where exon 7 is spliced to exon 8a instead of exon 8. Exon 8a is derived from an exonized Alu sequence, sharing no homology with exon 8 of the long transcript, and encodes just 15 amino acids followed by a stop codon and a polyadenylation signal. This short transcript potentially encodes a bifunctional enzyme lacking 10-formyl-THF synthetase activity. Both transcripts initiate at the same 5′-site, 107 nucleotides up-stream of the ATG start codon. The full-length (2934 bp) cDNA fused to a C-terminal V5 epitope tag was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Immunoblots of subfractionated cells revealed a 107-kDa protein only in the mitochondrial fractions of these cells, confirming the mitochondrial localization of the protein. Yeast cells expressing the full-length human cDNA exhibited elevated 10-formyl-THF synthetase activity, confirming its identification as the human mitochondrial C1-THF synthase.

These activities, along with serine hydroxymethyltransferase (Fig. 1, reaction 4), are central to the interconversion of the one-carbon units carried by the biologically active form of folic acid, THF. The activated one-carbon units are used in a variety of cellular processes, including de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis, serine and glycine interconversion, methionine biosynthesis, and protein synthesis in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In eukaryotic cells, the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments each contain a parallel set of one-carbon unit-interconverting enzymes (1Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). For example, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isozymes of C1-THF synthase (encoded by the nuclear genes MIS1 and ADE3, respectively) have been purified and characterized (2Paukert J.L. Williams G.R. Rabinowitz J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Shannon K.W. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both isozymes exist as homodimers of 100-kDa subunits. Each subunit consists of a C-terminal 10-formyl-THF synthetase domain of ∼70 kDa and an N-terminal bifunctional dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain of ∼30 kDa linked via a proteolytically sensitive connector region. This subunit size and domain structure are shared by cytoplasmic isozymes from mammalian and avian sources (4Paukert J.L. Straus L.D.A. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol.

Our studies with intact rat liver mitochondria and mitochondrial extracts demonstrated the ability of these organelles to oxidize carbon 3 of serine to formate by a folate-dependent pathway (Fig. 1, reactions 1–4) (11Garcia-Martinez L.F. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4671-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the existence, structure, and function of the folate-interconverting activities of C1-THF synthase in mammalian mitochondria have been controversial. MacKenzie and co-workers (12Mejia N.R.

This bifunctional enzyme lacks the large C-terminal domain catalyzing the 10-formyl-THF synthetase activity and thus is unable to produce formate. This enzyme was shown to be a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein (14Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Belanger C.

Among adult differentiated tissues, NAD-dependent 5,10-methylene-THF dehydrogenase activity is detectable only in rat adrenal tissue (16Smith G.K. Banks S.D. Monaco T.J. Rigual R. Duch D.S. Mullin R.J. Huber B.E. Arch. Biochem.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of the human gene encoding a functional mitochondrial C1-THF synthase. We show that it is expressed widely in adult human tissues and that the full-length cDNA encodes a protein that localizes to mitochondria when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. These data confirm the existence of C1-THF synthase in mammalian mitochondria, completing the folate-interconverting pathway shown in Fig. 1. Materials—All chemicals were of the highest available commercial quality. Difco media components were obtained from VWR (West Chester, PA). Restriction enzymes, shrimp alkaline phosphatase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Invitrogen. Primers for PCR and sequencing were made by IDT (Coralville, IA). [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Construction of Full-length cDNA—A partial cDNA clone (DKFZp586G1517) constructed by the German Genome Project (RZPD German Research Center for Genome Research) (20Wiemann S. Weil B. Wellenreuther R.

Wambutt R. Korn B. Klein M. Poustka A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was identified in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank (accession number AL117452) by a BLAST search using the cDNA sequence of the human cytoplasmic C1-THF synthase (21Hum D.W. Bell A.W. Rozen R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15946-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA contains 390 nucleotides (nt) of 3′-noncoding sequence and a poly(A) tail, but lacks a start codon, indicating that it is truncated at the 5′-end. The truncated cDNA clone was obtained from RZPD, and its sequence was confirmed by the DNA Analysis Facility of the University of Texas (Austin, TX). The Human Genome Database contains the entire gene corresponding to this cDNA and predicts an additional 5′-exon that encodes 60 additional N-terminal amino acids. The missing 5′-exon (exon 1) (see Fig. 4) was PCR-amplified from a genomic P1 artificial chromosome clone (dJ44A20) obtained from the Sanger Centre (Cambridge, UK). The PCR-amplified product was gel-purified using a QIAGEN gel extraction kit and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison WI), and its sequence was verified. It was necessary to use MasterAmp Tfl DNA polymerase (Epicentre Technologies Corp., Madison, WI) in the PCR due to the high GC content of exon 1 (see “Results”). The partial cDNA clone and the exon 1 clone were then used as templates in a splice overlap extension (SOE)-PCR (22Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) to produce the full-length cDNA. The exon 1 fragment (230 bp) was amplified using Tfl polymerase and primers TOPO5′ (5′-CACCATGGGCACGCGTCTGCCGCTC-3′, with the ATG start codon underlined) and humitoSOE3′ (5′-CTTCTCTGACGATGGAGTCCCG-3′). The 2719-bp cDNA fragment was PCR-amplified using Pfu polymerase and primers GS5′SOE (5′-GGGACTCCATCGTCAGAGAAG-3′) and TOPO3′ (5′-GAACAAGCCTTTAACTTGTTCTGTTTC-3′). Primer TOPO3′ is complementary to the last nine codons of the open reading frame before the stop codon. Both products were gel-purified using the QIAGEN gel extraction kit. The 230- and 2719-bp PCR products served as templates in the SOE-PCR using primers TOPO5′ and TOPO3′ and Tfl polymerase. The full-length cDNA product (2934 bp) was gel-purified and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) using directional TOPO cloning according to the manufacturer's instructions. The TOPO cloning reaction was transformed into One-Shot chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) by chemical transformation, and positive colonies were selected on YT (0.5% yeast extract, 0.8% Tryptone, and 0.5% NaCl) plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The colonies were screened by PCR with a vector primer and a gene-specific primer, and positive plasmids were prepared using a QIAGEN miniplasmid preparation kit. Sequence analysis revealed a base substitution in the full-length clone compared with the original cDNA and genomic sequences, presumably incorporated during the PCRs. (Tfl polymerase, which was chosen due to the high GC content of exon 1, lacks a 3′ → 5′ proofreading activity.) This substitution was repaired using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The repaired full-length cDNA clone, pcDNA3.1-humito, was sequenced completely, and the correct sequence was confirmed (GenBank™/EBI accession number AY374130). CHO Cell Transfection—CHO cells (1.5 × 105) were plated on 35-mm diameter dishes and cultured in α-minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Duplicate plates were then transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1-humito/plate using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent method (Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were cultured for an additional 48 h in regular medium before a G418-containing selective medium (0.8 mg/ml) was applied. The selective medium was applied for ∼1 week until antibiotic-resistant colonies developed. Resistant colonies were picked, replated, cultured, and collected. Preparation of Cell Homogenates and Subcellular Fractions—Transfected cells were cultured in two 150-cm2 T-flasks to yield 1–2 × 108 cells. The monolayer was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (4 × 5 ml) at 4 °C and then incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA (10 ml) at room temperature until the cells detached (5–10 min). The flasks were tapped gently to dislodge the cells, and the cells were transferred to a 50-ml plastic conical tube. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and the cell pellet was washed with 15 ml of homogenization solution (HMS; 250 mm sucrose and 1 mm EDTA (pH 6.9)) at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in HMS (2 ml) at 4 °C, transferred to a Kontes nitrogen cavitation device, and exposed to a pressure of 36 p.s.i. for 30 min at 4 °C. The suspension of disrupted cells was collected into a 3-ml conical ground-glass Duall tissue grinder and further disrupted with four strokes of the homogenizer (23Lin B.-F. Huang R.-F.S. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21674-21679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei and unbroken cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 900 × g for 6 min. The supernatant was removed carefully, transferred to another centrifuge tube, and stored on ice. The pellet was resuspended in HMS (1 ml) and further dispersed by four strokes in the grinder. After centrifugation at 900 × g for 6 min, the supernatant was combined with the first supernatant and stored on ice. The pellet was washed with HMS (3 × 1 ml), and the final viscous pellet (nuclear fraction) was resuspended in HMS (1 ml). The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min, and any pellet was discarded. The volume of the supernatant (total post-nuclear supernatant fraction) was increased to 5 ml by the addition of HMS. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was stored on ice. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to give a final supernatant (cytosolic fraction). The second pellet was combined with the first, washed with HMS (2 ml), and resuspended in HMS (1 ml) to give the mitochondrial fraction. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity (24Schmidt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Vol. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 650-656Crossref Google Scholar) was used as a mitochondrial marker, and lactate dehydrogenase activity (25Kornberg A. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 441-443Crossref Scopus (619) Google Scholar) was used as a cytoplasmic marker. Immunoblotting—The protein concentration of the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions was determined using the Bradford assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Eighty μg of cytosolic and mitochondrial protein from transfected and untransfected CHO cells were fractionated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for 50 min at 180 V. One-half of the gel was stained, and the proteins on the other half were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Midwest Scientific, Valley Park, MO) by electroblotting for 90 min at 250 mA. The membrane was then washed with distilled water (3 × 5 min each) and blocked in 2% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mm Tris base and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 8.0)) for 1 h at room temperature. The blocked membrane was incubated with mouse anti-V5 primary antibody (1:1000 dilution; Invitrogen) diluted in TBS and 1% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed with TBS containing 0.0025% Tween 20 (TBST; 3 × 5 min each) and incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was finally washed with TBST and TBS (2 × 5 min each) and rinsed with water before visualizing the bands. Reacting bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Bioscience). Expression in Yeast and Enzyme Assays—The full-length human cDNA was subcloned from pcDNA3.1-humito into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the yeast expression vector pVT103U (27Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In the resulting construct, pVT-humito, the entire human mitochondrial C1-THF synthase open reading frame, including the mitochondrial presequence, is expressed from the ADH promoter of the vector. Yeast strain DAY3 (ser1 ura3-52 trp1 leu2 ade3-130) (28West M.G. Horne D.W. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was transformed with pVT-humito or empty pVT103U vector using a lithium acetate method (29Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) modified as described. 2Details are available upon request from the corresponding author. Cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium, and extracts were prepared and assayed for NAD+- and NADP+-dependent methylene-THF dehydrogenase activity as described (30West M.G. Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 153-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10-Formyl-THF synthetase activity was determined according to Kirksey and Appling (31Kirksey T.J. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Northern Analysis—A FirstChoice Northern human blot I kit was obtained from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX), with poly(A)+ mRNA from the following adult human tissues: brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, pancreas, liver, lung, spleen, and thymus. Probes were synthesized by asymmetric PCR using reagents supplied in the kit and [α-32P]dATP according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. The two probes represented the 5′- and 3′-ends of the putative mitochondrial C1-THF synthase cDNA. The 5′-end probe was synthesized using primer GS5′SOE for the sense strand and primer GSI (5′-CCGCTCGAGCAAGGCATTGAGGACTTTGTTGCT-3′) for the antisense strand. This 304-bp probe covered nt +215 to +518. (The A of the ATG start codon is designated +1.) The 3′-end probe was synthesized using primer DRA3 (5′-GATGCAGTCCCCTGCTATCA-3′) for the sense strand and primer TOPO3′ for the antisense strand. This 465-bp probe covered nt +2469 to +2933, ending just before the stop codon. A probe was also synthesized for detection of the human cytoplasmic C1-THF synthase. The plasmid pUC13/HS230 (obtained from Dr. R. E. MacKenzie, McGill University), which contains a 230-bp fragment near the 3′-end of the human cytoplasmic C1-THF synthase cDNA (21Hum D.W. Bell A.W. Rozen R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15946-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was linearized by digestion with SacI. A linear PCR amplification method (following the kit manufacturer's instructions) was used to synthesize the probe. The antisense primer used was 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′, which is complementary to the vector sequences flanking the insert. The membrane was subjected to a 1-h prehybridization at 42 °C with Ultrahyb ultrasensitive hybridization buffer (Ambion Inc.). The probe was added at 106 cpm/ml of hybridization buffer and allowed to hybridize at 42 °C overnight in a roller bottle. The membrane was then washed twice with NorthernMax low stringency wash solution (equivalent to 2× SSC; Ambion Inc.) for 10 min at 42 °C and twice with NorthernMax high stringency wash solution (equivalent to 0.1 × SSC) for 30 min at 42 °C. The membrane was exposed to a storage phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) for 48 h and imaged using an Amersham Biosciences 445 SI PhosphorImager. The same blot was stripped and reconstituted for hybridization with each probe according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. Transcript Mapping—The 5′- and 3′-ends of the transcripts were mapped by RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit from Ambion Inc. Human placental total RNA (Ambion Inc.) was used to map the 5′-end of the transcript. Nested antisense primers specific to the cDNA were designed for use with the two nested 5′-RACE primers provided in the kit (see Fig. 6). The cDNA-specific inner primer (GSI2, 5′-CGCCTCGAGACGGCTGGTTCTCAGGGGACAC-3′, with the XhoI site underlined) was complementary to nt –9 to –30 in the 5′-untranslated region. The cDNA-specific outer primer (GSO2, 5′-AGCGCGACAGGGCACACGGAG-3′) was complementary to nt +93 to +73. The 5′-RACE inner primer and the cDNA-specific inner primer had BamHI and XhoI sites, respectively, at their 5′-ends to facilitate cloning. For mapping the 3′-end of the 1.1-kb transcript, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from human placental total RNA using the supplied 3′-RACE adapter. Nested sense primers specific to the cDNA were designed for use with the two nested 3′-RACE primers provided in the kit. The cDNA-specific inner primer (3′-RACE GSI, 5′-CGCCTCGAGGAACTTGTTTAGCAACAAAGTCCT-3′, with the XhoI site underlined) was equivalent to nt +485 to +508. The cDNA-specific outer primer (3′-RACE GSO, 5′-CGCCTCGAGCTCCCTCCAGATAGCAGTGAA-3′) was equivalent to nt +390 to +410. The 3′-RACE inner primer and the cDNA-specific inner primer had BamHI and XhoI sites, respectively, at their 5′-ends to facilitate cloning. PCR fragments generated in the “inner” PCRs of both 5′- and 3′-RACE were gel-purified, digested with BamHI and XhoI, and ligated separately into BamHI/XhoI-digested pBluescript II KS(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The ligation reactions were transformed into chemically competent XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene), and positive colonies were selected on YT/ampicillin plates. Colonies were screened by PCR using T7 reverse (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and T3 forward (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′) vector primers, and plasmids were prepared for sequence analysis. This 1.1-kb cDNA has been submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank under accession number AY374131. cDNA Identification and Cloning—A cDNA encoding an open reading frame with high similarity to human cytoplasmic C1-THF synthase was cloned from human uterine RNA by the German Genome Project (RZPD; GenBank™/EBI accession number AL117452). The homology extends the length of the proteins, suggesting that the cDNA encodes another trifunctional C1-THF synthase (Fig. 2). This cDNA encodes 917 amino acids plus 390 nt of 3′-noncoding sequence and a poly(A) tail, but lacks a start codon, suggesting that it is truncated at the 5′-end. Blasting this sequence against the Human Genome Database (NCBI Protein Database) revealed the corresponding gene on chromosome 6 at 6q25.2. This gene spans 236 kilobase pairs and encodes the entire cDNA sequence in 27 exons plus an additional 5′-exon that encodes 60 additional N-terminal amino acids. The predicted initiator codon sits within a near-perfect expanded Kozak consensus sequence (32Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The first half of this N-terminal extension has the characteristics of a mitochondrial leader sequence, including the potential to form a positively charged amphipathic α-helix. Truncation of the original cDNA clone was due to the presence of a NotI site near the 3′-end of the first exon; NotI was used in the cDNA cloning procedure (20Wiemann S. Weil B. Wellenreuther R. Gassenhuber J. Glassl S. Ansorge W. Bocher M. Blocker H. Bauersachs S. Blum H. Lauber J. Dusterhoft A. Beyer A. Kohrer K. Strack N. Mewes H.W. Ottenwalder B. Obermaier B. Tampe J. Heubner D. Wambutt R. Korn B. Klein M. Poustka A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the RIKEN Mouse Gene Encyclopedia Project (33Kawai J. Shinagawa A. Shibata K. Yoshino M. Itoh M. Ishii Y. Arakawa T. Hara A. Fukunishi Y. Konno H. Adachi J. Fukuda S. Aizawa K. Izawa M. Nishi K. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) identified a full-length mouse cDNA (ID22289) that predicts a protein with 88% identity to the human protein, including the N-terminal extension (Fig. 2). The mouse cDNA lacks the NotI site that caused truncation of the human cDNA. These data suggest that the gene on human chromosome 6 encodes a mitochondrial C1-THF synthase. Attempts to construct a full-length cDNA by RACE using human uterine RNA were unsuccessful, probably due to the extremely high GC content (>80%) of the first exon. Instead, a genomic P1 artificial chromosome clone (dJ44A20, Sanger Centre) was used to PCR-amplify the 5′-exon. This was then spliced to the remaining cDNA by SOE-PCR to construct a full-length cDNA encoding the human protein (GenBank™/EBI accession number AY374130). CHO Cell Expression and Subcellular Localization—To determine whether the protein encoded by this cDNA is, in fact, mitochondrial, we expressed the cDNA in CHO cells. The full-length cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO. This construct fused the 14-amino acid V5 epitope and a His6 tag to the C terminus of the 2934-bp coding region. Expression of the insert in mammalian cells is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resulting plasmid, pcDNA3.1-humito, was transfected into CHO cells, and G418-resistant colonies were selected and grown. The cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from transfected and untransfected (control) CHO cells were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each fraction was assayed for the mitochondrial marker enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase and the cytoplasmic marker enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity ranged from 68 to 95 μmol/min/mg of protein in the mitochondrial fractions, compared with 2.4–4 μmol/min/mg of protein in the cytoplasmic fractions. The lactate dehydrogenase activity of the mitochondrial fraction was only one-seventh that of the cytoplasmic fraction. These subcellular fractions were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against the V5 epitope (Fig. 3). A clear signal at ∼107 kDa was detected in the mitochondrial fraction of the transfected CHO cell line (lane 2), but not in the cytoplasmic fraction (lane 1). This mobility is consistent with the expected size of the epitope-tagged construct (∼1000 amino acids). No signal was seen in either fraction of the untransfected CHO cell line (lanes 3 and 4). These results confirm that this cDNA encodes a protein that localizes exclusively to mitochondria in a mammalian cell line. Expression in Yeast—The full-length human mitochondrial C1-THF synthase cDNA, including the 62-codon N-terminal extension, was subcloned into a yeast expression vector (pVT103U) and transformed into an ade3 deletion strain (DAY3). Disruption of the ADE3 gene, which encodes the cytoplasmic C1-THF synthase, results in yeast cells with very low 10-formyl-THF synthetase and 5,10-methylene-THF dehydrogenas"
https://openalex.org/W2135218162,"Many infants who undergo cardiac surgery have a congenital cyanotic defect where the heart is chronically perfused with hypoxemic blood. Infant hearts adapt to chronic hypoxemia by activation of intracellular protein kinase signal transduction pathways. However, the involvement of heat shock protein 70 in adaptation to chronic hypoxemia and its role in protein kinase signaling pathways is unknown. We determined expression of message and subcellular protein distribution for inducible (Hsp70i) and constitutive heat shock protein 70 (Hsc70) in chronically hypoxic and normoxic infant human and rabbit hearts and their relationship to protein kinases. In chronically hypoxic human and rabbit hearts message levels for Hsp70i were elevated 4- to 5-fold compared with normoxic hearts, Hsp70i protein was redistributed from the particulate to the cytosolic fraction. In normoxic infants Hsp70i protein was distributed almost equally between the cytosolic and particulate fractions. Hsc70 message and subcellular distribution of Hsc70 protein were unaffected by chronic hypoxia. We then determined if protein kinases influence Hsp70i protein subcellular distribution. In rabbit hearts SB203580 and chelerythrine reduced Hsp70i message levels, whereas SB203580, chelerythrine, and curcumin reversed the subcellular redistribution of Hsp70i protein caused by chronic hypoxia, with no effect in normoxic hearts, indicating regulation of Hsp70i message and subcellular distribution of Hsp70i protein in chronically hypoxic rabbit hearts is influenced by protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinases, specifically p38 MAPK and JNK. We conclude the Hsp70 signal transduction pathway plays an important role in adaptation of infant human and rabbit hearts to chronic hypoxemia."

The much higher number of putative flp- and nlp-encoded neuropeptides than the number of the predicted neuropeptides GPCRs implies that a single receptor might be activated by multiple peptides.

The DNA sequence of the final open reading frame was confirmed to be identical to the Wormpep-predicted C10C6.2 gene.Cell Cultures, Cell Transfection, and Membrane Preparation—CHO-10001A cells (referred to as CHO cells) were cultured and transfected essentially as described previously (18Larsen M.J.

The flp15-R1/pCR3.1 plasmid (2.5 μg DNA/10-cm plate) was used for transfections via the LipofectAMINE PLUS™ (Invitrogen) method. The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h post-transfection and then were moved to a humidified 28 °C/3% CO2 incubator for an additional 16–24 h before harvesting for membrane preparation. To test pertussis toxin (PTX) effects, the transfected cells were treated with PTX (100 ng/ml) 16–24 h prior to harvesting. Membranes were prepared as described previously (18Larsen M.J. Burton K.J.

In the 28 °C shift experiments, the transfected cells were split and plated in 96-well FLIPR plates 24 h post-transfection, followed by an additional 24-h incubation at 37 °C and then an additional 16–24-h incubation at 28 °C prior to peptide testing.Data Analysis—Dose-response curves for ligand-induced stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) based on specific binding (total minus nonspecific binding) expressed as mean counts/min values ± S.E. for each treatment run in triplicate. The calculated EC50 values were considered statistically different (p = 0.05) when their 95% confidence limits did not overlap.Bioinformatic Analyses—BLAST searches (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W.

The corresponding amino acid sequence of the FLP15-R protein is typical of a seven-transmembrane receptor in the class A rhodopsin-type family. When the C10C6.2 amino acid sequence was used to query the NCBI nonredundant protein data base using BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Following those, the highest scoring vertebrate sequences were neuropeptide Y receptors. The phylogenetic analysis depicted in Fig. 1 shows the most highly related C. elegans GPCRs. Most of these GPCRs have not yet been linked with their cognate ligands, with the protein encoded by C39E6.6 as the sole exception.

The cloned C10C6.2 (flp15-R gene) was transiently transfected into CHO cells, and a GTPγS assay was utilized as a read-out for detection of receptor function based on agonist-driven stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes prepared from the transfected cells. The routine [35S]GTPγS assays were run in a 96-well filter plate mode in the presence of 10 μm GDP and 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS (18Larsen M.J. Burton K.J. Zantello M.R. Smith V.G. Lowery D.E. Kubiak T.M.

However, when the cells were moved to 28 °C 24 h post transfection, and incubated at this lower temperature for an additional 16–24 h prior to cell harvesting for membrane preparation, distinct signals could be detected for several peptides as exemplified in Fig. 2 for GNSFLRF-NH2 (MasFLRF-amide II or F7G), a myotropic peptide, originally isolated from the tobacco hornworm M. sexta (36Kingan T.G. Zitnan D. Jaffe H. Beckage N.E. Mol. Cell. Enocrinol. 1997; 133: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The other actives, identified with the 28 °C membranes, were GGPQGPLRF-NH2, RGPSGPLRF-NH2, and GPSGPLRF-NH2. These peptides represent C. elegans FaRPs, which we designated FLP15-1, FLP15-2A, and FLP15-2B peptides, respectively, because their sequences are encoded on the C. elegans flp-15 precursor gene (10Nelson L.S. Kim K. Memmott J.E. Li C. Mol. Brain Res. 1988; 58: 103-111Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In subsequent experiments, the active peptide responses were found to be dose-dependent. As shown in Fig. 3A, in one of the representative transient transfection experiments with the 28 °C cooling step implemented, FLP15-2A was the most potent peptide in the series (EC50 162.4 nm), followed by FLP15-1 (EC50 250.6 nm), FLP15-2B (EC50 598.6 nm), and F7G (EC50 4.8 μm) (Table I). Without the temperature-lowering step, significantly lower [35S]GTPγS responses were recorded in cells from the same transfection but incubated only at 37 °C (Fig. 3B). At 37 °C, dose-response curves were poorly defined (r 2 0.569–0.794), and the maximal responses (E max) were only 20–25% of those observed at 28 °C Fig. 3B). This made the ligand-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding barely above the basal levels even at the highest peptide concentrations used (10 μm) and, therefore, difficult to positively identify the actives (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that the observed activity for the FLP15 peptides was receptor-specific since it was detected only in the FLP15-R/CHO membranes, while there was no response to the same peptides when membranes from the untransfected CHO cells or CHO cells transfected with an unrelated C. elegans (22Kubiak T.M.

https://openalex.org/W2020258031,"Chromatin structure plays an important role in DNA replication, repair, and transcription. p300 is a transcriptional coactivator with protein acetyltransferase activity, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) plays important roles in DNA replication and repair. It has been shown recently that p300 is necessary for DNA synthesis and repair. However, it is not known whether human PCNA, in a reciprocal manner, can regulate the enzymatic activity and transcriptional regulatory properties of p300. Here we show that human PCNA associates with p300 and potently inhibits the acetyltransferase activity and transcriptional activation properties of p300. Surprisingly, PCNA fails to inhibit p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferase function as well as PCAF-dependent transcription. Additionally, PCNA potently represses transcription when targeted to chromatin in vivo. Consistent with these observations, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that PCNA recruitment to promoters causes hypoacetylation of chromatin. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time a novel role for human PCNA in transcriptional repression and in modulating chromatin modification. The reciprocal modulation of p300 and PCNA activities by each other provides an example of integrative regulatory cross-talk among chromatin-based processes such as DNA transcription, repair, and synthesis.

In agreement with this observation, many transcription coactivators were shown to possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; Fen1, flap endonuclease 1; INHAT, inhibitor of acetyltransferases; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; DBD, DNA binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; ATRA, all-trans-retinoic acid; TDG, thymidine DNA glycosylase; a.a., amino acids; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TK, thymidine kinase; TDG, thymidine DNA glycosylase.1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; Fen1, flap endonuclease 1; INHAT, inhibitor of acetyltransferases; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; DBD, DNA binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; ATRA, all-trans-retinoic acid; TDG, thymidine DNA glycosylase; a.a., amino acids; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TK, thymidine kinase; TDG, thymidine DNA glycosylase. activity, providing a mechanism for transcriptional activation by these groups of coactivators. p300/CBP and PCAF represent two groups of extensively studied coactivators/HATs. p300 was first discovered as a protein that interacts with the adenoviral transforming protein E1A, whereas CBP was originally identified as a CREB-binding protein (3Eckner R.

Subsequently, p300/CBPα have been demonstrated to interact with a wide variety of proteins and to function as transcriptional scaffolds. They can facilitate transcriptional initiation by recruiting other coactivators such as p160 group of proteins, PCAF and RNA polymerase holoenzyme (6Hanstein B. Eckner R. DiRenzo J. Halachmi S.

Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). The importance of p300/CBPα is well illustrated by their roles in cell proliferation and differentiation (3Eckner R. Ewen M.E.

PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) is another coactivator with intrinsic HAT activity. It shares homology with GCN5-HAT in yeast and is required for nuclear receptor-mediated transcription, cell differentiation, as well as muscle differentiation (14Blanco J.C. Minucci S. Lu J.

In addition, studies have demonstrated that the HAT activity of p300/CBP and PCAF is necessary for their coactivator function in modifying chromatin structure during transcription and other cellular processes (13Polesskaya A. Naguibneva I. Fritsch L. Duquet A. Ait-Si-Ali S. Robin P. Vervisch A. Pritchard L.L. Cole P. Harel-Bellan A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6816-6825Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Korzus E.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a homologue of the β subunit of the prokaryotic DNA polymerase and well known as a processivity factor for the eukaryotic DNA polymerases δ and ϵ (17Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). PCNA clamps onto DNA and slides along it during replication (18Tsurimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As a highly conserved replication factor, PCNA interacts with a large number of proteins, most of which are involved in DNA biosynthesis processes such as replication and repair. For example, PCNA interacts with the flap endonuclease-1 (Fen1) and DNA ligase I, both of which function in processing the primer RNA and joining Okazaki fragments during DNA replication (19Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). PCNA also interacts with the components of DNA mismatch repair MLH1 and MSH2 (21Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) as well as those of nucleotide excision repair including DNA polymerase ϵ, replication factor C, and replication protein A (22Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 23Shivji M.K. Podust V.N. Hubscher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It also interacts with the DNA methyltransferase MCMT, marking newly replicated DNA (24Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). More recently, PCNA has been shown to bind to chromatin assembly factor CAF-1, facilitating the assembly of chromatin at the replication fork (25Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Other PCNA-interacting proteins play important roles in the regulation of the cell cycle. Among them are cdk/cyclins, a cdk/cyclin inhibitor p21 (26Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar), and several proteins induced by cell cycle arrest or DNA damage such as Gadd45 and MyD118 (27Hall P.A. Kearsey J.M. Coates P.J. Norman D.G. Warbrick E. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2427-2433PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA itself is a cyclin (29Mathews M.B. Bernstein R.M. Franza Jr., B.R. Garrels J.I. Nature. 1984; 309: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and is highly up-regulated in S-phase. These observations have been utilized in clinical diagnosis where PCNA serves as a biomarker for tissue malignancy or regeneration (30Elias J.M. Biotech. Histochem. 1997; 72: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Assy N. Minuk G.Y. J. Hepatol. 1997; 26: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, PCNA can function as a “bridging molecule” that targets proteins with distinct roles into DNA-based processes. Besides being a necessary factor for processes of DNA metabolism, PCNA has been implicated recently in epigenetic inheritance and transcription. For example, by recruiting CAF-1, PCNA marks the nascent DNA, providing a mechanism for imprinting (25Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 32Zhang Z. Shibahara K. Stillman B. Nature. 2000; 408: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PCNA is involved in gene silencing through CAF-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms (32Zhang Z. Shibahara K. Stillman B. Nature. 2000; 408: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, mutation of PCNA suppresses position effect variegation (33Henderson D.S. Banga S.S. Grigliatti T.A. Boyd J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), indicating its role in transcriptional repression and heterochromatin function. In mammals, PCNA was shown to interact with histone deacetylase 1(HDAC1), implying a role for histone hypo-acetylation in DNA replication (34Milutinovic S. Zhuang Q. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20974-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the function of PCNA expands beyond DNA replication and repair and may have a critical role in epigenetic events and transcription. However, little is known about transcriptional regulatory roles of human PCNA. Recently, Hasan et al. (35Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the transcriptional coactivator p300 might be involved in DNA repair synthesis through its interaction with PCNA, illustrating the coordination between these two versatile proteins. Consistent with this observation, p300 was shown to interact with PCNA, and the endogenous p300-PCNA complex promoted DNA synthesis in vitro. Moreover, p300 associated with newly synthesized DNA after UV irradiation. These results led the authors to suggest that the chromatin remodeling ability of p300 might facilitate PCNA function at DNA lesion sites, although a direct role for the HAT activity of p300 in DNA repair synthesis was not demonstrated. Another piece of evidence supporting the role of p300 in DNA metabolism is the discovery that p300 can form a complex with and acetylate Fen1. Acetylation of Fen1 by p300 impaired the DNA binding and nuclease activity of Fen1 (36Hasan S. Stucki M. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Gehrig P. Hunziker P. Hubscher U. Hottiger M.O. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1221-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Conversely, the above results raised an interesting possibility that PCNA might regulate the chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulatory properties of p300/CBP and/or other nuclear HATs/coactivators. Activities known to regulate HATs can be divided into two groups based on their targets. In one group, the acetylase enzymes are targeted by cellular or viral interacting proteins (e.g. inhibition of p300/CBP HAT activity by E1A and PU.1α (37Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 38Hong W. Kim A.Y. Ky S. Rakowski C. Seo S.B. Chakravarti D. Atchison M. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3729-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) or by post-translational modification (e.g. the stimulation of CBP-HAT activity by phosphorylation (39Ait-Si-Ali S. Carlisi D. Ramirez S. Upegui-Gonzalez L.C. Duquet A. Robin P. Rudkin B. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, the regulatory activity can target the substrate histones (40Zhang Q. Vo N. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4970-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 41Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 42Li F. Macfarlan T. Pittman R.N. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45004-45012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This is illustrated by the INHAT complex, which we recently purified and characterized. This complex binds to histones and plays a role in chromatin modification by blocking the access of HATs to their histone substrates, a mechanism referred to as histone masking (41Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The subunits of INHAT identified as TAFIα, TAFIβ/Set, and pp32 bind to histones in vitro and in vivo. Based on our results we proposed INHAT to be a component of the repressive state of chromatin (41Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 43Seo S.B. Macfarlan T. McNamara P. Hong R. Mukai Y. Heo S. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14005-14010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). During the initial purification of INHAT, we noticed that several proteins consistently copurified with INHAT. One of these proteins was identified as PCNA. The copurification of PCNA with INHAT as well as the involvement of the p300-PCNA complex in DNA repair prompted us to explore the potential role of human PCNA in the regulation of histone acetylation by p300/CBP and PCAF and subsequently its role in transcription. In this paper, we provide data from in vitro experiments and cell-based transfection studies, in which we examined the effect of PCNA on p300 or PCAF activity. Our results demonstrate that PCNA is a potent inhibitor of the HAT activity of p300 in vitro and of p300/CBP-dependent transcription including nuclear hormone receptor RAR function in vivo. Surprisingly, PCNA does not inhibit PCAF-HAT activity and fails to block PCAF-dependent transcription. Furthermore, in contrast to INHAT, which regulates histone acetylation by binding to histones, PCNA functions by associating with the enzyme p300 but not the HAT substrate histones in vitro. Consistent with these observations, we show that endogenous PCNA interacts with p300 but not PCAF in cells. Finally, when targeted to a promoter, PCNA can reduce the level of histone acetylation and repress transcription in vivo. While the physiological implications of this differential HAT inhibition by PCNA remain to be elucidated, our results implicate a novel regulatory role for human PCNA in chromatin modifications and in transcriptional regulation. Plasmids and Proteins—For bacterial and eukaryotic expression constructs of PCNA and its mutants, the appropriate PCR-amplified fragments were cloned into pGEX4T2, pCMX-PL1, pHRN-CMX-PL1, and pCMX-GAL4 vectors. Sequences of all constructs surrounding the cloning sites were verified by automated sequencing. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences). Baculovirus-expressed FLAG-tagged p300 and FLAG-tagged PCAF was obtained as described (44Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). INHAT complex was purified from HeLa nuclear extracts as described (41Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). HAT Assay—Histones were either purified (a kind gift of S. Kutney) or obtained commercially (Roche Applied Science). HAT assays were performed in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate as described (41Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by PhosphorImager. In Vitro Immunoprecipitation and Interaction Assays—[35S]Methionine-labeled PCNA and pp32 were synthesized by using their pCMX constructs in a coupled transcription-translation system (TnT, Promega) and incubated with approximately equal amounts of beads-bound p300, PCAF, or histones (immobilized onto beads by pan-histone antibodies) for 30 min at room temperature in buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After extensive wash, bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by PhosphorImager. Transfection Assay—NIH3T3 or 293T cells were seeded in a 48-well dish and transfected by liposome-mediated transfer (LipofectAMINE 2000, Invitrogen) with internal control plasmid pRLSV40 (5 ng), gal4-TK-luc reporter plasmid (100 ng), pCMX-GAL4-RARα (20 ng), or pCMX-GAL4-p300 plasmid (100 ng) in the absence or presence of the pCMX-PL1 constructs of PCNA where indicated (43Seo S.B. Macfarlan T. McNamara P. Hong R. Mukai Y. Heo S. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14005-14010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by addition of intact pcDNA3 vector. The media were replaced ∼6 h following transfection with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) where indicated. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed for dual luciferase assays (Promega). Transfection of 293T cells with chromosomally integrated gal4-TK-luc or gal4-SV40-luc reporters was carried out essentially as above except that only GAL4 constructs were transfected into cells and cells were only assayed for firefly luciferase activity. For all figures, each value is the mean of six replicates from a single assay. The results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Coimmunoprecipitation—Briefly, HeLa cell nuclear extract was precleared by incubating with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Pre-cleared extract was subsequently incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight with gentle agitation. Then protein A- or G-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed extensively with an IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Bound proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Antibodies used include anti-p300 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 05-267 or Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-585), anti-PCAF, anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-56), or control antibody mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories). Immunoblotting was performed with anti-TAFII15 (kindly provided by Dr. R. G. Roeder of Rockefeller University, New York), anti-PCNA, anti-p300, or anti-PCAF antibodies. Immunohistochemistry—Cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1 v/v) at room temperature for 2 min and rinsed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline. After a 30-min incubation in phosphate-buffered saline, 3% bovine serum albumin (blocking solution), cells were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution for 2 h. Cells were then washed with blocking solution three times for 5 min each and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing, cells were stained with 300 nm 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline before mounting. Images were captured utilizing a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. Primary antibodies include anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-56), anti-p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-585), and anti-PCAF (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Nakatani of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, or from Upstate Biotechnology 07-141). Secondary antibodies include cyanine Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch 715-165-150) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch 111-095-144). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was carried out as essentially described in the protocols from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (45Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 46Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA and harvested 48 h later. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in the medium at 37 °C for 10 min and then scraped into SDS lysis buffer. Samples were further sonicated and diluted for immunoprecipitation with antibodies as indicated. The immunoprecipitates were eluted and cross-link reversed. DNA fragments were purified using Qiagen PCR purification kit and then amplified by PCR for quantitation. Anti-acetylhistone H3 and anti-acetylhistone H4 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Primers utilized for gal4-TK promoter analysis are 5′-aggctttacactttatgcttccg-3′ and 5′-ctttatgtttttggcgtcttcca-3′. Primers used for gal4-SV40 promoter analysis are 5′-tgtactttatggtactgtaactg-3′ and 5′-ctttatgtttttggcgtcttcca-3′ (47Ishizuka T. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5122-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated at least twice with similar results. Results shown are representative of the data. PCNA Selectively Inhibits the HAT Activity of p300 in Vitro— Because PCNA partially copurified with INHAT, we decided to determine its role in p300-mediated histone acetylation. For that purpose, core histones were incubated with 14C-labeled acetyl-CoA and increasing amounts of purified GST-PCNA in a p300-mediated HAT assay system. As a control and as observed previously, INHAT blocked p300-mediated histone acetylation (Fig. 1A , lanes 3 and 4). A progressive inhibition of p300-mediated core histone acetylation was observed with increasing amounts of GST-PCNA (Fig. 1A , lanes 5–8). Purified GST alone even at the highest concentration tested had no effect on the assay (lane 2). No proteolytic degradation of histones in the presence of GST-PCNA or INHAT was observed (data not shown). In addition, the involvement of any deacetylases was excluded by the use of the HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate, as well as the bacterially and baculovirus expressed and purified recombinant proteins in these in vitro assays. The lysine residue specificity of this inhibition was examined with the available site-specific anti-acetylhistone antibodies. PCNA inhibited acetylation of histone H4 lysine 8, histone H4 lysine 12, and histone H3 lysine 14 at varying degrees, with the strongest inhibition on the acetylation of histone H4 lysine 8 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the acetylation of H4 lysine 8 is well known to be involved in transcriptional activation (48Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that the INHAT complex could block histone acetylation by p300/CBP as well as by PCAF. To explore whether PCNA regulates PCAF-mediated histone acetylation and also to determine the target specificity of PCNA, HAT assays were performed utilizing purified histone H3 and PCAF. PCAF prefers to acetylate histone H3 in vitro (Fig. 1C , lane 1) (49Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 50Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, GST-PCNA failed to inhibit histone H3 acetylation by PCAF (Fig. 1C) under the same conditions where the same amounts of GST-PCNA led to a dramatic inhibition of histone acetylation by p300 (compare Fig. 1A , lane 8, with Fig. 1C , lane 8). PCNA slightly stimulated PCAF-mediated histone acetylation. As a control and in agreement with published results, the INHAT complex inhibited PCAF-mediated histone H3 acetylation (lanes 3 and 4) (41Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). From these experiments, we conclude that PCNA can selectively inhibit histone acetylation by p300 but not by PCAF in vitro. PCNA Binds to p300 but Not to PCAF in Vitro and in Vivo— The selective inhibition of p300 activity by PCNA prompted us to explore whether a potential differential interaction between PCNA and p300 or PCAF exists. For that purpose, we first carried out in vitro binding assays utilizing PCNA and core histones, p300, or PCAF (Fig. 2A). 35S-Labeled PCNA was incubated with approximately equal amounts of beads-bound recombinant FLAG-tagged p300 or PCAF. PCNA was also incubated with histones and immunoprecipitated with pan-histone antibodies to determine whether PCNA may block p300 HAT activity by binding to histones. Bound proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by PhosphorImager. Little interaction was observed between PCNA and histones. As a control, the INHAT subunit pp32 bound strongly to histones but not to p300 or PCAF as observed previously (Fig. 2A, compare lane 7 with lane 8) (41Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Importantly, whereas PCNA bound p300 (Fig. 2A , lane 3), little or no interaction was observed with PCAF (lane 5). Therefore, PCNA selectively interacts with p300 but not PCAF or histones in vitro. The region of p300 that mediates the inter"

A recent theoretical study has overcome the problems associated with simulating the electron correlations in solid plutonium. The simulation shed light on the movement of atoms in the solid. Now, [ Wong et al .][2] report experimental results that agree extremely well with the simulations. Together, the two studies provide important insights into the elastic and thermodynamic properties of plutonium.

The first step in the cytochrome oxidase reaction is the bimolecular electron transfer from cytochrome c to the homobinuclear mixed-valence CuA center of subunit II. In Thermus thermophilus a soluble cytochrome c552 acts as the electron donor to ba3 cytochrome-c oxidase, an interaction believed to be mainly hydrophobic. In Paracoccus denitrificans, electrostatic interactions appear to play a major role in the electron transfer process from the membrane-spanning cytochrome c552. In the present study, soluble fragments of the CuA domains and their respective cytochrome c electron donors were analyzed by stopped-flow spectroscopy to further characterize the interaction modes. The forward and the reverse electron transfer reactions were studied as a function of ionic strength and temperature, in all cases yielding monoexponential time-dependent reaction profiles in either direction.

Overall the results indicate that the soluble CuA domains are excellent models for the initial electron transfer processes in cytochrome-c oxidases. The aerobic electron transport chain of Paracoccus denitrificans represents a model system for the mitochondrial respiratory chain, where the terminal reaction, the reduction of dioxygen to water, is mediated by cytochrome-c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1). The electrons for this reaction are donated by a c-type cytochrome (7Baker S.C. Ferguson S.J. Ludwig B. Page M.D. Richter O.M.H. van Spanning R.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1046-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enter the oxidase via the CuA center (for a recent review see Ref. 2Schultz B.E. Chan S.I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 23-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), a highly conserved motif in subunit II of cytochrome-c oxidases of eukaryotes, aerobic bacteria, and in the nitrous oxide reductase of denitrifying bacteria. The CuA center resides in a periplasmic, solvent-exposed domain of subunit II and contains two copper ions in a mixed valence state, which give rise to the typical purple color of the isolated domain (3Lappalainen P. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. Saraste M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26416-26421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two copper atoms are bound by two cysteine residues forming thiolate bridges, two histidine residues, and as further ligands a methionine sulfur and a glutamate peptide carbonyl. Soluble domains of several bacterial cytochrome-c oxidases have been prepared including P. denitrificans (3Lappalainen P. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. Saraste M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26416-26421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), T. thermophilus (4Slutter C.E. Sanders D. Wittung P. Malmström B.G. Aasa R. Richards J.H. Gray H.B. Fee J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), Paracoccus versutus (5Salgado J. Warmerdam G. Bubacco L. Canters G.W.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Following electron transfer to the CuA center from cytochrome c, electrons are further transferred to the low-spin heme a (or b) in subunit I, in a very fast μs time-scale process, and finally to the binuclear heme a3-CuB site (on a ms time scale), where dioxygen is reduced to water. In P. denitrificans two c-type cytochromes have been suggested to mediate the ET 1The abbreviations used are: ETelectron transferTEVtobacco etch virus. processes between the bc1 complex and the terminal electron accepting enzymes, the aa3- and the cbb3-type cytochrome-c oxidases, and the nitrite and the nitrous oxide reductases of the nitrate respiratory pathway. A soluble cytochrome c550 is believed to function as an electron donor in different respiratory pathways such as in methanol and methylamine oxidation or in denitrification (7Baker S.C. Ferguson S.J. Ludwig B. Page M.D. Richter O.M.H. van Spanning R.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1046-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of the electron transfer reaction between this cytochrome and a soluble CuA domain from P. denitrificans aa3 cytochrome-c oxidase have been studied (8Lappalainen P. Watmough N.J. Greenwood C. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5824-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, there is ample evidence that a different cytochrome, cytochrome c552, is the genuine mediator between the bc1 complex and aa3. This 18-kDa cytochrome (9Turba A. Jetzek M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 259-265PubMed Google Scholar) is composed of three functional domains: an N-terminal helical membrane anchor, a negatively charged spacer region, and a typical class I c-type heme domain. This cytochrome is believed to be the bona fide electron transfer shuttle protein between the bc1 complex and aa3, because (i) a ternary supercomplex consisting of these three components is isolated under certain detergent solubilization conditions from P. denitrificans membranes (10Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) electron transport from NADH to dioxygen in isolated membranes is blocked in deletion mutants lacking the c552-coding gene, but this inhibition may be overcome by mitochondrial cytochrome c (11Turba A. Molekularbiologische und biochemische Charakterisierung des Membran-gebundenen Cytochrom c552 aus Paracoccus denitrificans. Ph.D. thesis, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany1993Google Scholar), and (iii) specific antibodies directed against purified cytochrome c552 can block electron transport from NADH to oxygen in membrane activity assays (9Turba A. Jetzek M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 259-265PubMed Google Scholar). electron transfer tobacco etch virus. At low ionic strength (i.e. below 10 mm), the reaction between mitochondrial cytochrome c and cytochrome-c oxidase involves the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex, which may be isolated in vitro (12Dethmers J.K. Ferguson-Miller S. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11973-11981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, complex formation is believed to rate-limit the subsequent rapid intracomplex ET process (13Antalis T.M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6194-6206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the strong ionic strength dependence of the reaction and from mutagenesis studies (14Witt H. Malatesta F. Nicoletti F. Brunori M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Drosou V. Malatesta F. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2980-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) a two-step model has been proposed for the interaction of the proteins. Initially the orientation is mediated by long range electrostatic forces, followed by the fine-tuning of the interaction by hydrophobic patches within the docking site. In contrast to this, nearly no charged residues are found on the probable interaction interfaces of the corresponding proteins from T. thermophilus, as demonstrated by the recently solved crystal structures of the ba3 cytochrome-c oxidase (16Soulimane T. Buse G. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Than M.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1766-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and its substrate (17Than M.E. Hof P. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Buse G. Soulimane T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a soluble cytochrome spectroscopically identified as c552 (18Soulimane T. von Walter M. Hof P. Than M.E. Huber R. Buse G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). T. thermophilus is a Gram-negative, extremely thermophilic eubacterium found in hot springs with optimum growth temperature around 75 °C. Taking into consideration that the stability of electrostatic interactions is lower at higher temperatures, hydrophobic interactions become more favorable. Kinetic studies have shown that the turnover activity of cytochrome c552 with ba3 oxidase becomes faster as ionic strength is decreased (19Giuffrè A. Forte E. Antonini G. D'Itri E. Brunori M. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the contrary, P. denitrificans aa3 cytochrome-c oxidase shows very low turnover rates under low ionic strength conditions, most likely because of the formation of a high affinity electrostatic complex (15Drosou V. Malatesta F. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2980-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the cytochrome c-CuA electron transfer mechanism is complicated by the subsequent monomolecular ET events taking place along the reaction coordinate that complete the reduction of dioxygen to water. It was, therefore, of interest to isolate and compare both periplasmically oriented subunit II CuA domains from P. denitrificans and T. thermophilus and to study the electron transfer reactions with their cytochrome c552 electron donor counterparts. Differences between the two systems with respect to the relevant electron transfer reactions can be studied directly by stopped-flow spectroscopy without interference from heme a absorbance and by the subsequent electron transfer and energy transduction events. The results indicate that the expressed soluble CuA domains are excellent models for the initial electron transfer events in cytochrome-c oxidases. Expression and Purification Procedures—Expression of the CuA fragment of P. denitrificans subunit II, encoded by the ctaC gene (20Steinrücke P. Steffens G.C. Panskus G. Buse G. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was carried out in Escherichia coli JM 109. The region representing amino acid residues 130–280 of the CuA domain was amplified by PCR. The subunit II-BamHI-TEV primer with sequence actgggatccgaaaacctatacttccaaagccaggagatgccgaacg (BamHI site underlined, TEV site in italics) was used as forward primer, coding for the TEV-protease recognition site (ENLYFQS, with cleavage between Q and S). As a reverse primer an oligonucleotide was used according to Lappalainen et al. (3Lappalainen P. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. Saraste M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26416-26421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), introducing a HindIII site, to allow for cloning into the expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen). This construct provides considerably higher expression rates (up to 8 mg/liter) than the previous method (3Lappalainen P. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. Saraste M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26416-26421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the His tag (coded on the parent vector) is not used for purification, nor is its presence in the protein desirable, it was cleaved off in vivo by co-transforming pRK603 into this E. coli strain (21Kapust R.B. Waugh D.S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), thus providing constitutive expression of the TEV-protease. Cells were grown on minimal medium containing 40 g/liter glycerol, 7.5 g/liter K2HPO4, 5.3 g/liter NaH2PO4-H20, 2 g/liter NH4Cl, 1 g/liter glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 ml/liter trace element solution 1 (22Wingfield P.T. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar), 0.2 μm thiamin, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, in a 10-liter New Brunswick Microferm fermentor. Cells were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of ∼4.0. After 4 h cells were harvested, and preparation of inclusion bodies, protein refolding, copper insertion, and purification were carried out essentially as described previously (3Lappalainen P. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. Saraste M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26416-26421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel filtration was done on Sephacryl HR S200 (Amersham Biosciences), and an additional purification step on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) in 20 mm Bis-Tris buffer at pH 7.0 removed residual His-tagged material, as determined by SDS-PAGE (not shown). The CuA fragment of the T. thermophilus ba3 cytochrome-c oxidase was expressed and purified as described previously (4Slutter C.E. Sanders D. Wittung P. Malmström B.G. Aasa R. Richards J.H. Gray H.B. Fee J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The cytochrome c552 soluble domain of P. denitrificans was expressed in E. coli according to the published protocol (23Reincke B. Thöny-Meyer L. Dannehl C. Odenwald A. Aidim M. Witt H. Rüterjans H. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Following a similar approach, the T. thermophilus cytochrome c552 gene was cloned into pET22b, a vector providing the pelB leader, which directs the protein to the periplasm. Correct assembly and insertion of the cofactor into the apoprotein was achieved by cotransforming E. coli cells with the heme maturation plasmid pEC86 (24Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Künzler P. Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Purification was carried out according to Fee et al. (25Fee J.A. Chen Y. Todaro T.R. Bren K.L. Patel K.M. Hill M.G. Gomez-Moran E. Loehr T.M. Ai J. Thöny-Meyer L. Williams P.A. Stura E. Sridhar V. McRee D.E. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2074-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using the following extinction coefficients: Pd-c552 ΔϵRed-Ox, 552 nm = 19.4 mm–1 cm–1, Pd-CuA ϵ480 nm = 3.0 mm–1 cm–1, Tt-c552 ΔϵRed-Ox, 552 nm = 21.0 mm–1 cm–1, Tt-CuA ϵ530 nm = 3.1 mm–1 cm–1. Stopped-flow Spectroscopy and Experimental Protocol—Kinetic experiments were carried out by using a thermostatted Applied Photophysics stopped-flow apparatus (Leatherhead, United Kingdom) with a 1-cm observation chamber. The ET kinetics between the soluble CuA domains and cytochromes c were studied in both the forward (physiological) and reverse directions according to the following experimental protocol (Scheme 1), which was devised to (i) minimize the auto-oxidizability of the reduced proteins, and to (ii) better control the initial absolute concentration of the reduced proteins. According to Scheme 1,<INLINE-FIG><LINKLOCATOR=""46734S1""></INLINE-FIG>Scheme I one of the partner proteins is initially reduced anaerobically in the stopped-flow syringe by ascorbate (see vertical arrows), which at the chosen solution pH is a slow reductant (see below). Following complete reduction, the solution is mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with an anaerobic solution containing the oxidized ET acceptor protein, and the time-dependent extinction changes followed at 551 nm (P. denitrificans) or at 552 nm (T. thermophilus). Thus, in the forward direction cytochrome c is reduced by ascorbate and mixed with oxidized CuA, whereas in the reverse direction prereduced CuA is mixed with oxidized cytochrome c. In all experiments the buffer (20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, with ionic strength varied by appropriate amounts of KCl) was flushed with N2 in a glass gas-tight syringe (fitting the stopped-flow valve) for at least 15 min, and following addition of the protein of interest, the solution was flushed for an additional 15 min. Finally 0.5 mm sodium ascorbate was added from a 1.0 m stock solution. All experiments were performed at 8 °C. Complete reduction was achieved after several minutes, as determined separately in stopped-flow experiments in which sodium ascorbate, at varying pseudo-first order concentrations, was mixed with either oxidized protein (see Fig. 1 and “Results and Discussion”). The apparent bimolecular rate constants for reduction of the CuA domains both from P. denitrificans and T. thermophilus and the corresponding soluble cytochromes c552 were in the range of 60 to 330 m–1 s–1 (results not shown), 3–5 orders of magnitude smaller than the ET process of interest. Under all the experimental conditions tested (cytochrome c concentration, ionic strength, and temperature), the forward and reverse ET apparent bimolecular rate constants were determined by fitting the observed kinetic traces to a simple exponential relaxation process at different ferro- or ferricytochrome c concentrations (forward and reverse directions, respectively) followed by linear regression of the observed rate constants to the varied cytochrome c concentrations. Three or more kinetic traces were acquired for each specific experimental condition and averaged. True pseudo-first order conditions could not be completely achieved throughout the kinetic titration experiments because of the high cytochrome c (19.4–21.0 mm–1 cm–1) and low CuA (3–3.1 mm–1 cm–1) extinction coefficients on one hand, and to the relatively high reaction rates observed especially at low ionic strength for the P. denitrificans couple, which approached the time resolution of the stopped-flow apparatus (dead time of 1.3 ms, determined by using the myoglobin-carbon monoxide combination reaction) on the other. Apparent second-order rate constants were determined from the slopes of the linear portions of the pseudo-first order plots (see “Results and Discussion”). Data fitting was performed by using either the Matlab (The MathWorks Inc.) or Scientist (Micromath Scientific Software Inc.) softwares. The standard deviation of the fitted parameters never exceeded 10%. In the present investigation the kinetics of electron transfer between two genetically engineered ET couples from a mesophilic and a thermophilic species have been studied by stopped-flow spectroscopy. The experimental rationale has been to pre-reduce one protein of each ET couple with the kinetically sluggish reductant ascorbate and to subsequently mix the proteins and follow the interprotein ET events at a suitable wavelength (see “Experimental Procedures”). At pH 7 the concentration of the true reductant, i.e. the ascorbate dianion, is very low (26Al Ayash A.I. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Myer Y.P. Thallam K.K. Pande A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9666-9673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore not expected to interfere with the ET events taking place between the partners of interest. Fig. 1 depicts a typical example of the Paracoccus couple, studied in the forward, physiological direction (bottom panel, mixing of fully reduced Pd-c552 with oxidized Pd-CuA) and in the reverse direction (top panel, in which oxidized Pd-c552 is mixed with reduced Pd-CuA) followed at 551 nm, where the extinction of Pd-c552 is dominant. In either direction, absorbance changes take place on a short time scale (0.2 and 0.1 s) indicating partial oxidation (bottom panel) or reduction (top panel) of Pd-c552. These experiments were carried out by varying the ascorbate concentration from 0.25 to 1 mm to exclude any competition of the reductant with the interprotein ET reaction of interest. Indeed as ascorbate concentration is increased, no significant change in rate or amplitude is observed on the short time scale, and all time courses display a simple exponential behavior. On longer time scales (50 s), however, the time-dependent absorbance changes appear to be linearly correlated to ascorbate concentration (not shown). These observations suggest that in the fast phase (Fig. 1, left part of top and bottom panels) interprotein ET occurs, taking the proteins to a transient equilibrium state controlled by the protein-chemical structural details and driven by the redox potential of the two ET proteins. On longer time scales (Fig. 1, right part of top and bottom panels) the ascorbate reaction takes the partially oxidized equilibrium ET couple mixture to the fully reduced state as expected from the larger driving force of ascorbate. Similar results were obtained with the Thermus thermophilus ET couple (not shown). We have systematically studied the cytochrome c552 concentration dependence of the interprotein ET reaction with both couples as a function of ionic strength, using the ascorbate (0.25 mm after mixing) protocol described above. All observed fast phases could be fitted to a single exponential time course. The results of these experiments are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 (P. denitrificans couple) and Fig. 4 (T. thermophilus couple) in which the observed fitted rate constants are plotted as a function of cytochrome c552 concentration. The pseudo-first order plots were linear with respect to the varied cytochrome c552 concentration, although, especially at low cytochrome concentrations, there was some deviation from linear behavior. This is expected, because at low cytochrome c552 concentrations the reaction mixture is not under true pseudo-first order conditions. Nevertheless from the slope of the linear portion of the plots the apparent second-order rates for the interprotein ET reaction could be estimated and are given in Tables I and II for the P. denitrificans and T. thermophilus couple, respectively, at different ionic strength values. As can be seen from the reported data, the ET reaction of the P. denitrificans couple is strongly dependent on ionic strength with second-order rate constants ranging from ∼4*106 to 9*104m–1 s–1 and from 2*107 to 6*105m–1 s–1, for the forward and reverse ET reactions, respectively, as ionic strength is increased from 10 to 200 mm (see Table I). The apparent equilibrium constant for the physiological direction is thus about 0.2 for the P. denitrificans couple and does not appear to vary significantly with ionic strength. Although this result indicates a higher stability of reduced Pd-c552 over oxidized Pd-CuA, (i) this has also been observed previously (28Szundi I. Cappuccio J.A. Borovok N. Kotlyar A.B. Einarsdottir O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2186-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in the reaction between bovine heart cytochrome-c oxidase and yeast iso-1-cytochrome c, supporting our result; (ii) the reported redox potentials of the P. denitrificans couple are 270 and 240 mV for Pd-c552 and Pd-CuA, respectively (3Lappalainen P.

Zielgerichtete Mutagenese am Cytochrom C552 aus Paracoccus denitrificans. Diploma thesis, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany2000Google Scholar), which yields an equilibrium constant of about 0.3, in close agreement with our findings; and (iii) the ensuing exergonic ET reactions to the low spin heme a and the a3-CuB center that account for O2 reduction drive the thermodynamically unfavorable reaction in the physiological direction.Fig. 3The reverse electron transfer reaction between Paracoccus cytochrome c552 and the CuA fragment. The fast phase fitted rate constants of the ET reaction (see text and Fig. 1, top panel) between ferric Pd-c552 and reduced Pd-CuA (with concentrations in the range from 8.1 to 9.8 μm after mixing) at various ionic strength conditions (15 mm, ▴; 25 mm, ▾; 35 mm, ♦; 50 mm, +; 100 mm, ×; 200 mm, ▪) are plotted against the initial ferric Pd-c552 concentration.

Open table in a new tab In contrast to these findings the ionic strength dependence of the T. thermophilus ET couple is very modest with rates in excess of 106m–1 s–1 in either direction at the lowest ionic strength (see Fig. 4 and Table II). From these data an equilibrium constant of 4.8 was calculated for the Thermus protein pair, indicating that in this case the physiological direction is thermodynamically favored for the isolated domains. Several values of the redox potentials, depending strongly on the experimental conditions (temperature, ionic strength, pH), of the Thermus proteins have been reported (Th-CuA 240 mV up to 266 mV; see Refs. 4Slutter C.E.

https://openalex.org/W2043074370,"In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt an interaction that had been detected between ribosomal proteins S7 and S11 in the crystal structure of the bacterial 30 S subunit. This interaction, which is located in the E site, connects the head of the 30 S subunit to the platform and is involved in the formation of the exit channel through which passes the 30 S-bound messenger RNA. Neither mutations in S7 nor mutations in S11 prevented the incorporation of the proteins into the 30 S subunits but they perturbed the function of the ribosome. In vivo assays showed that ribosomes with either mutated S7 or S11 were altered in the control of translational fidelity, having an increased capacity for frameshifting, readthrough of a nonsense codon and codon misreading. Toeprinting and filter-binding assays showed that 30 S subunits with either mutated S7 or S11 have an enhanced capacity to bind mRNA. The effects of the S7 and S11 mutations can be related to an increased flexibility of the head of the 30 S, to an opening of the mRNA exit channel and to a perturbation of the proposed allosteric coupling between the A and E sites. Altogether, our results demonstrate that S7 and S11 interact in a functional manner and support the notion that protein-protein interactions contribute to the dynamics of the ribosome.

The ribosome is the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis in all living organisms. The elucidation of the crystal structure of the prokaryotic ribosome has led to a major progress in understanding its function (1Brimacombe R.

Analysis of the ribosome structure combined with a wealth of biochemical data clearly showed that ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the key player in the functions of the ribosome, and it is currently assumed that the main task of the ribosomal proteins is to help and stabilize rRNA folding and to facilitate conformational changes in rRNA (8Brodersen D.E.

However, a growing list of examples suggests that ribosomal proteins directly participate to protein synthesis. The x-ray structure of the ribosome reveals that S12 is part of the decoding site (Refs. 11Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V.

Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It also shows that the 30 S proteins S13, S15, and the 50S proteins L2, L5, L14, L19 are involved in intersubunit bridges, while the 30 S proteins S9, S13, and the 50 S proteins L1, L5, L33 interact with tRNAs, suggesting that they could participate in the translocation step (12Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). Studies in solution also point to a role for the ribosomal proteins, such as an involvement in mRNA binding for S1 (14Gualerzi C.O. Brandi L. Caserta E. La Teana A. Spurio R. Tomsic J. Pon C.L.

Biol. 2001; 309: 1029-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Several protein-protein interactions were identified in the crystal structure of the 30 S subunit (21Schluenzen F. Tocilj A.

Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) but, so far, only the interaction between proteins S4 and S5 has been directly related to a particular ribosome function, that is the control of translational fidelity. Indeed, mutations that disrupt the S4-S5 interaction decrease translational accuracy (23Carter A.P. Clemons W.M. Brodersen D.E. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 24Ogle J.M. Murphy F.V. Tarry M.J. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 2002; 111: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Among the other protein-protein interactions observed in the ribosome, one involves S7, a primary binding protein located in the head of the 30 S, which interacts with S11, a tertiary binding protein, positioned on the platform. This S7-S11 interaction encompasses S7 residues 148, 150, 152, 153, and 154 (in Escherichia coli numbering) in the 148–155 region following the C-terminal α-helix (helix 6), and S11 residues 55, 58, 59, 60, and 63 within the loop preceding the first α-helix (helix 1) (Fig. 1A). It is well documented that the 30 S head and platform undergo a series of conformational changes and move one relative to the other during protein synthesis. For example, x-ray and cryo-EM studies clearly showed that such changes occur upon subunit association, binding of aminoacyl-tRNA (aatRNA) or factors, and during translocation (5Noller H.F. Baucom A.

Thus, the S7-S11 interaction, which constitutes a contact between the 30 S head and platform, likely participates in the conformational changes undergone by the 30 S, breaking and re-forming during translation. The crystal structure of the 70 S ribosome complexed with tRNA and mRNA showed that the C-terminal α-helix of S7, close to the region of interaction with S11, contacts the anti-codon loop of the E-site-bound tRNA (5Noller H.F. Baucom A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 30: 1159-1161Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). In agreement with the x-ray studies, S7 and S11 were cross-linked to the anti-codon loop of the E-site bound tRNA (31Wower J. Scheffer P. Sylvers L.A. Wintermeyer W. Zimmermann R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Doring T. Mitchell P. Osswald M. Bochkariov D. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the 70 S ribosome also showed that the S7-S11 interaction contributes to the formation of the so-called exit channel, a narrow channel, through which passes the mRNA, upstream from the decoding site. The loop of S11 that interacts with S7 is positioned very close to the Shine-Dalgarno helix formed between the mRNA and the 3′-end of 16 S rRNA (Ref. 33Yusupova G.Z. Yusupov M.M. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Cell. 2001; 106: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 34Culver G.M. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 751-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Again, in agreement with the x-ray studies, it was observed that the C-terminal region of S7 could be cross-linked to the Shine-Dalgarno region of mRNA (35Greuer B. Thiede B. Brimacombe R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the effect of disrupting the interaction between E. coli S7 and S11 by mutating residues 148 to 155 of S7 and residues 55, 58, 59, 60, and 63 of S11. These mutations were shown not to interfere with the incorporation of the proteins into the 30 S subunit. We found, however, that disruption of the S7-S11 interaction makes the ribosome more error-prone. Also, with toeprinting and filter-binding assays, we observed an enhanced binding of mRNA to 30 S subunits containing mutated S7 or S11. Finally, we found that the mutations in S7 that disrupt the interaction with S11 impair subunit association, but, surprisingly, the corresponding mutations in S11 did not affect subunit association. Construction of Plasmids Used in This Study—All the enzymes used in this study were from Amersham Biosciences, unless otherwise specified. All the oligonucleotides were from Biocorp Inc. All PCR amplifications were carried out with the Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in a Robocycler™ 40 from Stratagene. Plasmid pET-21a(+)-S7, which codes for E. coli K12A19 S7 under control of a T7 promoter, and mutant pET-21a(+)-S7Δ148–178, with a deletion of the last 31 amino acids of S7, are derivatives of pET-21a(+) (Novagen) and were obtained as described (36Robert F. Gagnon M. Sans D. Michnick S. Brakier-Gingras L. RNA. 2000; 6: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), except that there was a histidine tag at the C terminus instead of the N terminus of the protein. Mutant pET-21a(+)-S7Δ156–178 was derived from pET-21a(+)-S7 by introducing a stop codon at position 156, using PCR. Mutant pET-21a(+)S7subs148–155, where the sequence corresponding to residues 148–155 of S7 was substituted with the sequence AGAGAAAA, was derived from pET-21a(+)-S7 by PCR, using the overlap extension procedure with four oligonucleotides (37Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). These two constructs also contain a sequence coding for a histidine tag at the C terminus of protein S7. Another construct that was identical to pET-21a(+)-S7Δ156–178 except that the histidine tag is at the N terminus of S7 was also made. The S11 gene was amplified by PCR from E. coli K12A19 genomic DNA obtained as described (38Davies C. Bussiere D.E. Golden B.L. Porter S.J. Ramakrishnan V. White S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 873-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with primers designed to introduce a histidine tag at the C terminus of protein S11. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified with the GFX™ PCR DNA and gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) and ligated into the appropriately digested pET-21a(+), generating pET-21a(+)-S11. This plasmid was subsequently used for the construction of the S11 substitution mutant with mutations R55A, T58A, P59G, F60A, and Q63A (pET-21a(+)-S11subs55–63), which was produced by overlap extension PCR. For the construction of the plasmids producing luciferase, we used as a starting point pSDLucNWT (39Brunelle M.N. Payant C. Lemay G. Brakier-Gingras L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4783-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a derivative of pBluescriptSK-, containing the luciferase gene with a Shine-Dalgarno sequence under control of a T7 promoter. The origin of replication of this plasmid was replaced by ligating the BglI-SmaI fragment containing the luciferase gene to the BglI-SmaI fragment of plasmid pACYC177 (New England Biolabs) containing the p15A origin of replication. This generated pACYpET-Luc, which is compatible with the pET-21a(+) plasmids, which have the pBR322 origin of replication. Different derivatives of pACY-pET-Luc were constructed to analyze the control of translation fidelity with ribosomes containing mutated S7 or S11. To this end, using PCR, the beginning of luciferase gene in pACYpET-Luc was replaced with that of the luciferase gene from plasmids pRNALuc2-FS-1, pRNALuc2-UGA or pRNALuc2 (40Bélanger F. Léger M. Saraiya A.A. Cunningham P.R. Brakier-Gingras L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) generating pACYpET-Luc-1, pACYpET-Luc-UGA and pACYpET-Luc-0, where production of luciferase is dependent upon a -1 frameshift, a stop codon readthrough and a conventional translation, respectively. The beginning of the luciferase genes from plasmids pRNALuc2-FS-1, pRNALuc2-UGA and pRNALuc2 was first amplified, using primers designed to revert the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which is mutated in these plasmids, to a wild-type sequence. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into the appropriately digested plasmid pACYpET-Luc. Plasmid pACYpETLuc-R218G has a substitution in the active site of luciferase, such that production of active luciferase requires a misincorporation at this site. It was derived from pACYpET-Luc-0 by PCR designed to mutate the first base of codon 218 from an A to a G (Arg to Gly), which impairs luciferase activity (41Viviani V.R. Uchida A. Viviani W. Ohmiya Y. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 76: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and Psp5II and ligated into the appropriately digested plasmid pACYpET-Luc-0. Plasmid pUC188G32 (42Wilson K.S. Ito K. Noller H.F. Nakamura Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and pLRCAT (43Pinard R. Payant C. Brakier-Gingras L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9611-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were used for the in vitro transcription of the T4 gene 32 and the gene coding for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), 1The abbreviations used are: CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; ram, ribosomal ambiguity. respectively, and the mRNAs produced were used for toeprinting and filter-binding studies. Fractionation of Cell Lysates and Assessment of the Incorporation of Plasmid-encoded Proteins S7 and S11 into 30 S Subunits, Ribosomes, and Polysomes—E. coli BLR(DE3)/pLysS cells transformed with plasmid pET-21a(+)-S7, pET-21a(+)-S11 or their mutant derivatives were grown in LB until an OD600 nm of 0.05 was reached. S7 or S11 overexpression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Bioshop Canada Inc.) at 1 mm for 90 min, followed by lysis of the cells according to a standard procedure (44Spedding G. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis; a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 1-29Google Scholar). The cell lysates were analyzed by centrifugation as described in the Fig. 3 legend. The detection of the plasmid-encoded protein into the free 30 S subunits, 70 S ribosomes, and polysomes was done by Western blot. Ribosomal subunits, 70 S ribosomes and polysomes (2.2 pmol) containing S7, S11 or their mutant derivatives were fractionated by a 12% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. For wild-type S7 and S7subs148–155, blots were probed with diluted polyclonal goat anti-S7 (1:1000) and were resolved with horseradish peroxidase conjugated rabbit-anti-goat antisera (diluted 1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by detection by chemiluminescence. To assess the incorporation of plasmid-encoded S7Δ148–178, S7Δ156–178, and wild-type or mutant S11, the intensity of the bands on a blot detected with an anti-histidine tag antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was compared with that of an identical blot probed with an anti-S7 or anti-S11 polyclonal goat antibody (diluted 1:1000). The intensity of the bands was measured using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. The sensitivity of the anti-histidine tag antibody relative to the anti-S7 or anti-S11 antibody was determined using plasmid-encoded S7 or S11 as a control. Subunit Association Experiments—The dissociated 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunits were obtained by centrifuging 40 units of A 260 nm of the cell lysate through a 15–40% sucrose gradient in a low magnesium buffer, according to standard procedures. Subunit association assays were done as described in the Fig. 5 legend. In Vitro Transcription, Toeprint Assays, and Filter-binding Assays—A fragment of the T4 gene 32 mRNA and the CAT mRNA were produced by run-off transcription by T7 RNA polymerase of plasmid pUC118G32 and pLRCAT, respectively, linearized with BamHI. Extension inhibition assays were performed as described (45Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Traut R. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), using primers complementary to bases +64 to +85 of T4 gene 32 mRNA and +57 to +73 of CAT mRNA, position 1 corresponding to the A of the initiator AUG. The reaction mixture (14 μl) contained 1.5 pmol of mRNA, 2 pmol of heat-reactivated 30 S subunits, and 20 pmol of uncharged E. coli tRNAfMet (Sigma). The primer extension was resolved on an 8% PAGE. The filter binding assays were performed as described (46Grill S. Gualerzi C.O. Londei P. Blasi U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4101-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), with a constant amount of mRNA (63 pmol) and increasing amounts of 30 S (1.4 to 72 pmol), in a reaction volume of 50 μl. Luciferase Assays—For the assays measuring luciferase activity, BLR(DE3) cells were co-transformed with a plasmid coding for luciferase (pACYpET-Luc-0, pACYpET-Luc-1, pACYpET-Luc-UGA or pACY-pET-Luc-R218G) and a plasmid coding for S7 or S11 (pET-21a(+)-S7, pET-21a(+)-S11 or their mutant derivatives). The expression of the ribosomal proteins and luciferase was induced with 1 mm IPTG at an A 600 nm of 0.1. The luciferase activity was measured after 60 and 120 min, and normalized for the increase in optical density of the cell culture. The luciferase assays were done as described (40Bélanger F.

This study focuses on ribosomal proteins S7 and S11 from E. coli. The interaction between the two proteins was observed in the crystal structure of the ribosome from a thermophilic bacterium (21Schluenzen F. Tocilj A. Zarivach R. Harms J. Gluehmann M. Janell D. Bashan A. Bartels H. Agmon I. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2000; 102: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 22Wimberly B.T. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Morgan-Warren R.J. Carter A.P. Vonrhein C. Hartsch T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). About 140 sequences of S7 and 90 sequences of S11 from different organisms in all three major evolutionary kingdoms were obtained, using the Swiss-Prot protein data base (us.expasy.org/sprot), and compared. Fig. 2 shows representative examples of S7 and S11 sequences illustrating this comparison. It can be seen that the region of interaction between S7 and S11 is extremely well conserved in bacteria. In eukaryotes and archaebacteria, the region corresponding to the 148–155 region of bacterial S7 is missing whereas region 55–63 of S11 is present although slightly less conserved. One can thus predict that the interaction between S7 and S11 observed within the ribosome of a thermophilic bacterium is maintained in E. coli. We, therefore, decided to investigate whether the disruption of this interaction affects the function of the E. coli ribosome. Plasmid pET-21a(+)-S7 and pET-21a(+)-S11, which contain, respectively, E. coli K S7 and S11 gene with a histidine tag at the C terminus under control of a T7 promoter, were used for the construction and expression of mutants of S7 and S11. In one S7 mutant, the sequence 148-KAFAHYRW-155 was substituted with the Gly-Ala-containing sequence 148-AGAGAAAA-155. We also investigated two S7 deletion mutants, mutant S7Δ148–178 where the sequence 148–178 is removed, thus lacking region 148–155, and mutant S7Δ156–178, where the sequence 156–178 is deleted. The E. coli K S7 contains an additional 23 amino acid extension at its C terminus, compared with the E. coli B S7, and mutant S7Δ156–178 thus corresponds to E. coli B S7 protein. One S11 substitution mutant was produced by making mutations in the loop that precedes the first α-helix and interacts with S7. To minimize any perturbation in the structure of this α-helix, only the residues in the 55–63 region that interact with S7 in the crystal structure of the 30 S subunit were mutated as follows: R55A, T58A, P59G, F60A, and Q63A, generating plasmid pET-21a(+)-S11subs55–63. The different mutant proteins used in this study are summarized in Fig. 1B. Effect of Mutating S7 and S11 on Their Incorporation into 30 S Subunits and on Ribosome Profiles—For the assays described below, we used E. coli BLR(DE3)/pLysS as a host cell for the pET-derived plasmids encoding S7 or S11 under control of the T7 promoter, except when otherwise mentioned. This strain carries the T7 RNA polymerase under control of the lac promoter in its genome and also contains plasmid pLysS, which allows a stringent control of the expression of the cloned genes with the T7 promoter (47Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar, 48Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The host cells were transformed with pET-21a(+)-S7 or pET-21a(+)-S11 or their mutant derivatives. Addition of IPTG to the cell culture induced transcription of the ribosomal protein genes. We first examined whether the overexpression of the wild-type and mutant proteins affects cell growth by measuring the optical density at 600 nm of the cell culture at different times (data not shown). As previously reported, overexpression of wild-type S7 leads to a major bacterial growth defect (49Fredrick K. Dunny G.M. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 379-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 50Robert F. Brakier-Gingras L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This effect results from the repression of translation of the polycistronic chromosomal str mRNA by S7. This mRNA encodes S12 and elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu in addition to S7, and repression of its translation likely reduces the number of ribosomes actively engaged in translation (51Saito K. Mattheakis L.C. Nomura M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Overexpression of mutant S7Δ156–178 and S7subs148–155 interfered with bacterial growth like wild-type S7, while overexpression of mutant S7Δ148–178, as previously observed, affected growth rate to a larger extent (50Robert F. Brakier-Gingras L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Neither overexpression of S11, which is not a repressor protein, nor that of its mutant affected the cell growth. The incorporation of the plasmid-encoded proteins into the 30 S, 70 S ribosomes and polysomes was investigated by Western blot after overexpressing S7, S11 or their derivatives for 90 min. First, a fractionation of the cell lysate by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient containing 10 mm magnesium was performed (Fig. 3). Overexpression of wild-type S7 and S7Δ156–178 were both seen to cause an increase in the amount of the ribosomal subunits relative to the ribosomes and polysomes (profiles 2 and 3, respectively), an effect related to the repression of the translation of the str mRNA, as explained above. Interestingly, when either S7Δ148–178 or S7subs148–155 was overexpressed, the relative increase in the amount of free ribosomal subunits was larger (profiles 4 and 5, respectively), suggesting that the 30 S subunits with S7 that lacks the region of interaction with S11 have an association defect. Contrasting with S7 and its derivatives, overexpression of S11 or its mutant did not affect the ribosome profile (profiles 6 and 7, respectively). Next, the incorporation of plasmid-encoded S7, S11, and their mutant derivatives in the subunit, ribosome and polysome fractions was analyzed by Western blot. To this end, we used an anti-S7 antibody for the wild-type and mutant S7subs148–155 (Fig. 4A), that are longer than the chromosome-encoded E. coli B S7 by 23 amino acids, which enables us to readily discriminate between plasmid-encoded and chromosome-encoded S7. The other S7 mutants (S7Δ156–178 and S7Δ148–178), and the plasmid-encoded wild-type and mutated S11 cannot be discriminated from the chromosome-encoded proteins on the basis of their size. The incorporation of plasmid-encoded versus chromosome-encoded protein was assessed by comparing the intensity of the bands detected with an anti-histidine tag antibody, which reveals exclusively the plasmid-encoded protein, to that of the bands detected with an anti-S7 or S11 antibody, which reveals both the plasmid-encoded and chromosome-encoded proteins. It was observed that about 80% of S7, S11 or their derivatives present in the 30 S subunits originate from the plasmid, indicating that neither the mutations nor the presence of the histidine tag prevent the incorporation of the proteins into the 30 S subunit. In the 70 S ribosomes and polysomes, the level of incorporation was about 75% for the plasmid-encoded wild-type S7 and S7Δ156–178, and for the plasmid-encoded wild-type or mutated S11. However, the proportion of S7Δ148–178 and S7subs148–155, which lack the sequence interacting with S11, decreased to about 40% in 70 S ribosomes and polysomes, indicating that the population of the mutated 30 S within the 70 S and within the polysomes is lower than in the free subunit pool (see Fig. 4B). In the results described above, S7 and its mutants had a histidine tag at the C terminus. Since the mutations in S7 are located in its C-terminal region, we also examined the results obtained with plasmids expressing S7, S7Δ156–178 and S7Δ148–178 but where the histidine tag was located at the N terminus. In all the assays car"
https://openalex.org/W2139731637,"The BRCA1 tumor-suppressor protein has been implicated in the regulation of transcription, DNA repair, proliferation, and apoptosis. BRCA1 is expressed in many proliferative tissues and this is at least in part due to E2F-dependent transcriptional control. In this study, inactivation of a conditional murine Brca1 allele was achieved in a variety of epithelial tissues via expression of the Cre recombinase under the control of a keratin 5 (K5) promoter. The K5 Cre:Brca1 conditional knockout mice exhibited modest epidermal hyperproliferation, increased apoptosis, and were predisposed to developing tumors in the skin, the inner ear canal, and the oral epithelium after 1 year of age. Overexpression of the E2F1 transcription factor in K5 Cre:Brca1 conditional knockout mice dramatically accelerated tumor development. In addition, Brca1 heterozygous female mice that had elevated E2F1 expression developed tumors of the reproductive tract at high incidence. These findings demonstrate that in mice Brca1 functions as a tumor suppressor in other epithelial tissues in addition to the mammary gland. Moreover, inactivation of Brca1 is shown to cooperate with deregulation of the Rb-E2F1 pathway to promote tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2023763994,"DNA damage induced by radiation or DNA-damaging agents leads to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, DNA damage-triggered signal transduction involved in these cellular responses is not well understood. We previously demonstrated an important role for SHP-2, a ubiquitously expressed SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase, in the DNA damage-induced apoptotic response. Here we report a potential role for SHP-2 in a DNA damage-activated cell cycle checkpoint. Cell cycle analysis and the mitotic index assay showed that following DNA damage induced by cisplatin or γ-irradiation, the G2 (but not S) arrest response was diminished in SV40 large T antigen-immortalized embryonic fibroblast cells lacking functional SHP-2. Notably, reintroduction of wild-type SHP-2 into the mutant cells fully restored the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest response, suggesting a direct role of SHP-2 in the G2/M checkpoint. Further biochemical analysis revealed that SHP-2 constitutively associated with 14-3-3β, and that Cdc25C cytoplasmic translocation induced by DNA damage was essentially blocked in SHP-2 mutant cells. Additionally, we showed that following DNA damage, activation of p38 kinase was significantly elevated, while Erk kinase activation was decreased in mutant cells, and treatment of SHP-2 mutant cells with SB203580, a selective inhibitor for p38 kinase, partially restored the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest response. These results together provide the first evidence that SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase enhances the DNA damage G2/M checkpoint in SV40 large T antigen immortalized murine embryonic fibroblast cells.

These results together provide the first evidence that SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase enhances the DNA damage G2/M checkpoint in SV40 large T antigen immortalized murine embryonic fibroblast cells. Genetic stability is maintained by cell cycle checkpoints (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar, 2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, mammalian cells arrest at certain points in the cell cycle. This regulatory mechanism inhibits cell cycle progression until the cell has adequately repaired the DNA damage. For instance, arrest in G1 and S phases prevents damaged DNA from replicating, and arrest in the G2 phase prevents segregation of damaged chromosomes. Failures in cell cycle checkpoints can lead to the acquisition and accumulation of genetic alterations. These changes may result in the activation of oncogenes and/or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, both of which can ultimately lead to tumorigenesis. However, the precise mechanisms of cell cycle checkpoints and the signaling components involved are not fully understood. In many cases, DNA damage-triggered signaling pathways induce cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the activities of the cyclin-dependent kinases that are required to drive cell cycle progression. The biochemical details of the G1 checkpoint are relatively well understood. A delay in the G1 phase results largely from the activation of p53 and consequent transcriptional induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 (3Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar, 4Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). By comparison, the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint is more complex. The G2/M transition is regulated by Cdc2 kinase and cyclin B1 as part of the maturation promoting factor that determines entry into mitosis. It has been demonstrated that the G2 arrest is largely dependent on inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 at tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) and threonine 14 (Thr14) and is therefore likely to result from changes in the activities of the opposing kinases and phosphatases that act on Cdc2. Among these upstream regulators, Cdc25C has been identified as crucial for the activation of Cdc2 by dephosphorylating its inhibitory tyrosine sites (5Strausfeld U. Labbe J.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Picard A. Sadhu K. Russell P. Doree M. Nature. 1991; 351: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 6Weinert T. Science. 1997; 277: 1450-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Cdc2 by Cdc25C and association with cyclin B1 results in rapid entry into mitosis whereas phosphorylation of negative regulatory sites on Cdc2 by Wee1/Myt1 kinases and cyclin B1 degradation or export to the cytoplasm block entry into mitosis. Following DNA damage, Cdc25C is phosphorylated by checkpoint kinases Chk1 and 2, which are activated by ATM and its related kinase ATR (7Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S.

Upon phosphorylation, Cdc25C binds to 14-3-3 adaptor proteins and is thereby sequestered in the cytoplasm (7Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar, 13Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Separation of Cdc25C from the nucleus then results in elevated Cdc2 phosphorylation and a reduced Cdc2 kinase activity. As a result, cells arrest in the G2 phase. However, in addition to the ATM/Chk1, 2/Cdc25C/Cdc2 pathway, other mechanisms contributing to the G2/M checkpoint also exist. p21Cip1, a major downstream effector of p53 and p73 transcription factors, contributes mainly to the G1 and S arrests (3Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar, 4Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar); however, its role in inducing the G2 arrest has also been reported, i.e. cells deficient in p21Cip1 are unable to maintain stable G2 arrest when exposed to DNA-damaging agents (14Taylor W.R.

More recently, several signaling enzymes important for growth factor and cytokine-induced signal transduction, such as Erk, 1The abbreviations used are: Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; WT, wild type; Ab, antibody; PI, propidium iodide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. p38, and Akt kinases, have also been found to be involved in the regulation of the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. For example, Erk kinases have been shown to be required for normal G2/M progression (16Guadagno T.M. Ferrell Jr., J.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12710-12717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). p38 kinase has also been shown to be involved in the G2/M DNA damage cell cycle checkpoint (19Bulavin D.V.

Therefore, it appears that multiple pathways contribute to the regulation of the G2/M checkpoint following genotoxic stress. SHP-2, a SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase, is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types, and has been demonstrated to be involved in diverse signaling pathways, including those initiated by growth factors, cytokines, and insulin (21Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 22Qu C.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In most circumstances, SHP-2 plays a positive role in transducing the signal relay from receptor tyrosine kinases, whereby its phosphatase activity has been shown to be required (23Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tang T.L. Freeman Jr., R.M. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Sokol S.Y.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), even though the biochemical significance of its catalytic activity remains ill-defined. The N-terminal SH2 domain (N-SH2) plays a critical role in mediating SHP-2 function. A targeted N-terminal deletion of SHP-2 (amino acids 46–110 including the N-SH2) results in a loss-of-function mutation for SHP-2. As a result of this mutation, homozygous mutant (SHP-2Δ/Δ) embryos die at midgestation with multiple developmental defects (26Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F.

Essential roles for SHP-2 in the regulation of a variety of signal transduction pathways and cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration have been characterized by using this SHP-2 gene knockout model and the mutant fibroblast cell lines derived from SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant embryos through SV40 large T antigen immortalization (27Qu C.K.

During the course of that work, we inadvertently noticed that the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest response was diminished in SHP-2 mutant cells. We therefore investigated the potential role of SHP-2 phosphatase in DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint. These results suggest that SHP-2 enhances the DNA damage G2/M checkpoint by modulating Cdc25C cytoplasmic translocation and the MAP kinase pathways. Cell Lines and Reagents—Wild-type (WT) and SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant embryonic fibroblast cell lines were derived from day 9.0–9.5 embryos through SV40 large T antigen immortalization (29Shi Z.Q. Lu W.

Rescued cell lines were generated by transduction of WT SHP-2 cDNA into SHP-2Δ/Δ cells through retroviral-mediated gene transfer. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cisplatin and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from Sigma. Nocodazole, caffeine, SB203580, and anti-Cdc2 antibody (Ab) were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Anti-SHP-2, -SV40 large T antigen, -Erk, -phospho-Erk, -Cdc25C, -14-3-3β, -histone H1, and -cyclin B1 Abs were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p38, -phospho-p38, -phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr15), and -phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) Abs were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The Cdc2 kinase assay kit, anti-phosphohistone H3, and anti-Chk1 Abs were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were treated with RNase A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then stained with PI (50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Cellular DNA content was analyzed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis using BD-LSR flowcytometry (BD Biosciences). The cell cycle profiles were determined with the CELLQuest™ software (BD Biosciences). Mitotic Index Assay—Cells grown in slide chambers were treated with cisplatin (5 μm) for various time periods. Treated cells were then fixed in methanol for 10 min and stained with 5% Giemsa. In some experiments, cells were stained by anti-phosphohistone H3 Ab that specifically detects mitotic nuclei. Mitotic cells in late prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase were identified under the fluorescence microscope and expressed as a fraction of the total cells counted. At least 3000 cells were counted in each preparation. Cell Synchronization—Fibroblast cells were synchronized in the G0/G1 phase by serum deprivation for 48 h before experiments. To synchronize cells at the G1/S boundary, asynchronously growing cells were treated with thymidine (2 mm) for 16 h, then thymidine (24 μm), and deoxycydine (24 μm) for 8 h, and finally thymidine (2 mm) for additional 16 h. Synchronized cells were released from the block for experiments by rinsing twice with phosphate-buffered saline and changing medium to complete growth medium. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Whole cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of purified Abs as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4) and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the indicated Abs. Cdc2 Kinase Assay—Cdc2 kinase activity was assessed by using the Cdc2 kinase assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology following the manufacturer's instruction. Cell lysates (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-cyclin B1 Ab. Immunoprecipitates were washed and assayed for the kinase activity by using histone H1 as the substrate. A mixture solution containing histone H1 (20 μg/reaction), 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and PCK, PKA, and PKI inhibitor mixture (1:5 dilution) in kinase assay buffer was added into each immunoprecipitation product and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. An aliquot of reaction mixture (25 μl) was spotted onto a piece of P81 filter paper. The filters were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. 32P incorporation into histone H1 was then measured by liquid scintillation counting. DNA Damage-induced Cell Cycle Response Is Decreased in SHP-2 Δ/Δ Murine Embryonic Fibroblast Cells—During the course of our previous studies defining the role of SHP-2 in DNA damage-induced apoptosis (32Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we noticed a difference in the cell cycle profiles between normally growing, SV40 large T antigen-immortalized, WT and mutant embryonic fibroblast cells carrying the amino acids 46–110 deletion of SHP-2 (SHP-2Δ/Δ). An increase in the percentage of mutant cells in the G2/M phase was observed (Fig. 1B). This change in the cell cycle of SHP-2 mutant cells does not appear to be due to a defect in cell cycle parameters, since reintroduction of WT SHP-2 into SHP-2Δ/Δ cells (rescued cells) completely corrected cell cycle profiles. As Erk kinase activity has been shown to be required for the G2/M transition of the cell cycle (16Guadagno T.M. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 1312-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Wright J.H. Munar E. Jameson D.R. Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11335-11340Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and SHP-2 plays a positive role in the growth factor and cytokine-induced Erk pathway (23Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tang T.L. Freeman Jr., R.M. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Sokol S.Y.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), the prolonged G2/M phase is presumably attributed to the decreased Erk kinase activity in the mutant cells under normal culture conditions. More interestingly, in response to the treatment of the DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin, the percentage of WT cells in the G2/M phase was significantly increased (G2/M arrest), suggesting activation of the cell cycle G2/M checkpoint. However, the DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest response in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells is diminished (Fig. 1B), indicating a defect in the G2/M checkpoint control in mutant cells. Notably, the G2/M arrest response to cisplatin treatment was fully restored in the rescued cell line (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the diminished cell cycle response to DNA damage in mutant cells is attributed directly to loss of SHP-2 function. It is noteworthy that the defect in DNA damage cell cycle control caused by the SHP-2 mutation appears to be specific for the G2/M but not S checkpoints, since the DNA damage-induced response of the arrest in the S phase is not altered in SHP-2 mutant cells (Fig. 1C). The above experiments were conducted with asynchronized cells. To better determine the role of SHP-2 in the cell cycle response to DNA damage, WT, SHP-2Δ/Δ, and rescued cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and cell cycle responses of the synchronized cells to DNA damage were then examined. Similar to the asynthronized cells, synchronized SHP-2Δ/Δ cells did not show a significant increase in the percentage of G2/M following DNA damage (Fig. 1D), further confirming the potential role of SHP-2 in DNA damage-induced cell cycle regulation. Remarkably, the role of SHP-2 in G2/M checkpoint control is not specific to cisplatin-induced DNA damage; the γ-irradiation-induced G2/M arrest response is also diminished in SHP-2 mutant cells (Fig. 2). Collectively, these results demonstrate an important role of SHP-2 phosphatase in the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint in SV40 large T antigen-immortalized murine embryonic fibroblast cells. Since SHP-2Δ/Δ cells showed a defect in the G2/M arrest response, we next wanted to determine whether this defect was specific to DNA damaging treatment. WT, SHP-2Δ/Δ, and rescued cells were treated with nocodazole, a compound that disrupts nuclear microtubules and arrests the cell cycle in mitosis (35Hayne C. Tzivion G. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31876-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, all cell types were efficiently blocked in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. To further validate the potential role of SHP-2 in the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint, we treated cells with cisplatin in conjunction with caffeine, a specific inhibitor of ATM/ATR kinase, which has been demonstrated to play an important role in the DNA damage G2/M checkpoint (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Cell cycle analyses showed that although caffeine treatment alone did not disturb cell cycle distribution, combined caffeine treatment abolished cisplatin-induced G2/M arrest in WT as well as rescued cells. However, this drug did not show any effect in SHP-2 mutant cells (Fig. 3B). To precisely determine whether the increase of G 2 /M cells observed in our cell cycle analyses resulted from a delay in G2 or M phases, the mitotic index assay (which directly determines the fraction of cells in mitosis) was conducted. In response to DNA damage, mitotic activity of WT cells was quickly and progressively decreased, indicating a G2 delay in the cell cycle. Although mitosis of SHP-2 mutant cells was also decreased shortly following DNA damage, this G2 delay could not be sustained, cells re-entered mitosis 2 h after DNA damage. Remarkably, rescued cells showed very similar changes in mitotic behavior as the WT control (Fig. 4A). This data suggests that in response to DNA damage, WT and rescued cells arrest in G2 phase and that without functional SHP-2 phosphatase, the G2 delay in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells was significantly decreased and shortened. To more rigorously examine the cell cycle response of SHP-2 mutant cells to DNA damage, we synchronized the cells in the G0/G1 phase or at the G1/S boundary by serum deprivation or thymidine treatment (see “Experimental Procedures”), respectively. Synchronized cells were released and treated with cisplatin for 4 and 8 h. Mitotic cells were counted and compared with the untreated cells that were released from synchronization for the same periods of time. Consistent with the data obtained from asynchronized cells (Fig. 4A), mitotic activity of synchronized WT cells was significantly decreased following DNA damage. By contrast, this response in synchronized SHP-2 mutant cells was diminished (Fig. 4, B and C), further confirming the role of SHP-2 in DNA damage cell cycle regulation. As the G2/M transition of the cell cycle is mainly controlled by Cdc2 kinase, and phosphorylation of Tyr15 and Thr14 in Cdc2 negatively regulates its kinase activity, we next examined the phosphorylation status of Tyr15 in Cdc2 in response to DNA damage by using a specific Ab. As shown in Fig. 5A, Cdc2 (Tyr15) phosphorylation was gradually induced in WT cells following DNA damage. By contrast, phosphorylation of this site in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells was slightly induced and then quickly decreased to the basal level. This observation is fully consistent with the mitotic index data (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we examined Cdc2 kinase activity by using histone H1 as the substrate. As demonstrated in Fig. 5B, after DNA damage (8 h), Cdc2 kinase activity was markedly decreased in WT as well as rescued cell lines. However, no appreciable change in Cdc2 kinase activity is detected in SHP-2 mutant cells. It is important to emphasize that re-introduction of WT SHP-2 in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells completely rescued the response of Cdc2 kinase activity to DNA damage, again suggesting a direct role for SHP-2 in DNA damage-induced cell cycle response, and that although the truncated SHP-2 with a low expression level exists in the mutant cells, the SHP-2 mutation appears to be a loss-of-function mutation rather than a gain-of-function mutation. Defective G2 /M Checkpoint in SHP-2 Mutant Cells—To elucidate why the G2 arrest response induced by DNA damage is attenuated in the mutant cells lacking functional SHP-2, we attempted to dissect the molecular mechanism by which SHP-2 modulates the G2/M checkpoint. Previous studies have demonstrated that several pathways contribute to the DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest, among which the ATM, ATR/Chk1, 2/Cdc25C/Cdc2 pathway is well characterized (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 14Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). To determine whether this pathway is targeted by the SHP-2Δ/Δ mutation, we examined the phosphorylation status of Chk1 kinase (Ser345) that has been shown to be critical for its kinase activity (10Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and thereby downstream signaling, by using a specific anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) Ab. As shown in Fig. 6A, phosphorylation of Chk1 is comparably induced by DNA damage in WT and SHP-2 mutant cells. This data, together with our previous observation that phosphorylation of p53Ser 15 by ATM/ATR kinase was not changed in SHP-2 mutant cells (32Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggest that Chk kinase activation is not affected by the SHP-2 mutation. We next examined the downstream processes of the ATM, ATR/Chk1, 2/Cdc25C/Cdc2 pathway. Previous studies have shown that Cdc2 phosphorylation and thereby kinase activity are regulated by Cdc25C, and that both phosphorylation (activation) induced by Chk kinases and cytoplasmic translocation by association with 14-3-3β are essential for Cdc25C activity on Cdc2 kinase (7Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar, 13Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Since Chk1 activation is not affected in SHP-2 mutant cells, we focused on the Cdc25C translocation response. Nuclear extracts were prepared from G0/G1 synchronized cells and subjected to quality control as we previously reported (32Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Anti-Cdc25C immunoblotting showed that in response to DNA damaging treatment, Cdc25C in the WT nucleus was decreased, suggesting its cytoplasmic translocation. By contrast, DNA damage-induced Cdc25C translocation was essentially blocked in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells. Remarkably, this response is efficiently restored in the rescued cells (Fig. 6B). It is important to mention that the Cdc25C level in the cytoplasm was not significantly changed in the three cell types following DNA damage (data not shown). This is because a large amount of the Cdc25C is localized in the cytoplasm of the cell lines; small amounts of translocated nuclear Cdc25C did not make a significant difference in the Cdc25C level in the cytoplasm. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism by which SHP-2 modulates DNA damage-induced Cdc25C translocation, we examined potential interactions between SHP-2 and 14-3-3/Cdc25C. As shown in Fig. 6C, 14-3-3β was constantly detected in the anti-SHP-2 immunocomplex, and reci"

We show how a sequence of scattering interactions progressively entangles two particles, giving rise to a robust state of well-defined separation and thus providing a natural description of relative position. We use two thought experiments to describe the localization process. The first is an interferometer with recoiling mirrors. The second, and more general, case considers photons scattering from a pair of particles and the resulting emergence of a Young's interference pattern.

https://openalex.org/W2132225804,"Our previous work with primary bovine fibroblasts demonstrated that quercetin, a potent mutagen found in high levels in bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), arrested cells in G1 and G2/M, in correlation with p53 activation. The expression of bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) E7 overcame this arrest and lead to the development of tumorigenic cells lines (Beniston et al., 2001). Given the possible link between papillomavirus infection, bracken fern in the diet and cancer of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract in humans, we investigated whether a similar situation would occur in human cells transformed by human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) oncoproteins. Quercetin arrested primary human foreskin keratinocytes in G1. Arrest was linked to an elevation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (cdki) p27(Kip1). Expression of the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins in transformed cells failed to abrogate cell cycle arrest. G1 arrest in the transformed cells was also linked to an increase of p27(Kip1) with a concomitant reduction of cyclin E-associated kinase activity. This elevation of p27(Kip1) was due not only to increased protein half-life, but also to increased mRNA transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1980364516,"Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most common genetic alteration in human cancer. p73, a member of the p53 family, has been found to exhibit activity similar to that of p53, including the ability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis. p53 and p73 have a high percentage of similarity at several domains, including the DNA binding domain. This domain in p53 is the location of missense mutations in many human cancers. Mutant p53, which cannot suppress cell proliferation, has been found to have a dominant-negative activity that inactivates wild-type p53. To determine the effects of mutant p53 on wild-type p73, we have established cell lines expressing both mutant p53 and wild-type p73 in a dual-inducible system. This system expresses mutant p53 in a tetracycline-repressible system and p73beta in an ecdysone-inducible system in a p53-null lung carcinoma parental cell line. We have found that wild-type p73beta, in the presence of mutant p53, retains the ability to transactivate p21 and suppresses cell growth through induction of both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, in cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and wild-type p73beta, we have found that these proteins cooperate to additively transactivate p21 and suppress cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2095512060,"Genes encoding polyadenylated mRNAs depend on their poly(A) signals for termination of transcription. An unsolved problem is how the poly(A) signal triggers the polymerase to terminate. A popular model is that this occurs during extrusion of the poly(A) signal, at which time it interacts with factors on the transcription complex. To test this idea we used cis-antisense inhibition in vivo to probe the temporal relationship between poly(A) signal extrusion and the commitment of the polymerase to terminate. Our rationale was to inactivate the poly(A) signal at increasing times post-extrusion to determine the point beyond which it is no longer required for termination. We found that communication with the polymerase is not temporally restricted to the time of poly(A) signal extrusion, but is ongoing and perhaps random. Some polymerases terminate almost immediately. Others have yet to receive their termination instructions from the poly(A) signal even 500 bp downstream, as indicated by the ability of an antisense at this distance to block termination. Thus, the poly(A) signal can functionally interact with the polymerase at considerable distances down the template. This is consistent with the emerging picture of a processing apparatus that assembles and matures while riding with the polymerase.

This is consistent with the emerging picture of a processing apparatus that assembles and matures while riding with the polymerase. Termination of transcription at the ends of genes by RNA polymerase II depends on pre-mRNA 3′-end processing signals (1Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Examples in vertebrates include all genes coding for polyadenylated mRNAs, as well as the U2 small nuclear RNA genes and the replication-dependent histone genes, whose RNAs are not polyadenylated. A major question is how a signal in the RNA, designed to process the transcript, also instructs the polymerase to terminate. In our work we have focused on mammalian poly(A)-dependent termination, for which a functional poly(A) signal is both necessary and sufficient to direct transcription termination in vivo (2Yeung G. Choi L.M. Chao L.C. Park N.J. Liu D. Jamil A. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 3Orozco I.J. Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42899-42911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mammalian poly(A) signal typically consists of a core sequence, about 45 nt long, that may be flanked by diverse auxiliary sequences that serve to enhance cleavage and polyadenylation efficiency (4Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core sequence consists of a highly conserved upstream element (AAUAAA), recognized by cleavage and polyadenylation-specificity factor (CPSF), 1The abbreviations used are: CPSF, cleavage-polyadenylation-specificity factor; CTD, C-terminal domain; PC4, positive cofactor 4; CstF, cleavage stimulation factor; L, SV40 late poly(A) signal; P, SV40 early poly(A) signal core; nt, nucleotide.1The abbreviations used are: CPSF, cleavage-polyadenylation-specificity factor; CTD, C-terminal domain; PC4, positive cofactor 4; CstF, cleavage stimulation factor; L, SV40 late poly(A) signal; P, SV40 early poly(A) signal core; nt, nucleotide. and a poorly defined downstream region (rich in Us or Gs and Us), bound by cleavage stimulation factor (CstF). The poly(A) cleavage site lies in between these two elements. Although cleavage at the poly(A) site has long been thought to be a key component of the termination mechanism (1Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 5Proudfoot N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Yonaha M. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3770-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), this appears increasingly unlikely for several reasons. First, signaling from the poly(A) site to the polymerase to stop transcription does not require cleavage at the poly(A) site either in HeLa extracts (7Tran D.P. Kim S.J. Park N.J. Jew T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7495-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or in Xenopus oocytes (8Osheim Y.N. Proudfoot N.J. Beyer A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Second, the mammalian histone genes, which have uniquely different pre-mRNA 3′-end processing signals and which require these signals for transcription termination, do not require processing itself as part of the mechanism (9Gu X. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3797-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 10Chodchoy N. Pandey N.B. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Third, the mammalian U2 small nuclear RNA genes, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase II but processed differently than mRNAs, also require the 3′-end processing signal— but not processing itself— for termination to occur (11Medlin J.E. Uguen P. Taylor A. Bentley D.L. Murphy S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fourth, in yeast, which exhibits poly(A)-dependent termination similar to mammals, cleavage at the poly(A) site is not required for termination (12Sadowski M. Dichtl B. Hubner W. Keller W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the mammalian poly(A) signal delivers its instructions to the polymerase and drives termination, as in these other cases, independent of the actual processing event itself. At what point, then, does the poly(A) signal make its presence known to the polymerase, and how does it trigger termination? There are three general possibilities. First, it is possible that recognition of the poly(A) signal by the transcription apparatus occurs intrinsically, and that the poly(A) signal acts to ensure termination even before it is extruded from the polymerase. Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and its associated factors are able to monitor DNA sequence throughout the 35-bp footprint of the polymerase to receive regulatory input for all aspects of elongation—pausing, termination, and anti-termination (13Mooney R.A. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 15Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Cell. 2002; 109: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For RNA polymerase II the DNA contacts are even more extensive (16Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Thus, recognition of the poly(A) signal could occur, in part, at the DNA level. Additional opportunities for intrinsic regulatory input come from interactions of the RNA polymerase with the DNA-RNA hybrid, and with the RNA itself in the exit tunnel (13Mooney R.A. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, many RNA processing factors, including those involved in termination, bind directly to RNA polymerase II (12Sadowski M. Dichtl B. Hubner W. Keller W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Fong N. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 18Barilla D. Lee B.A. Proudfoot N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 445-450PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dichtl B. Blank D. Sadowski M. Hubner W. Weiser S. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4125-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Aranda A. Proudfoot N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because these factors could alter the manner in which the polymerase interacts with the RNA, DNA, and hybrid components of the poly(A) signal within the ternary complex, their effects on termination could be more direct than merely via their role in processing. The ability of transcription factor IIS to alter fundamentally the way the polymerase interacts with its transcript while the transcript is still within the enzyme (21Fish R.N. Kane C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) illustrates how factors associated with the polymerase might communicate with the transcript prior to extrusion. This intrinsic model predicts that the poly(A) signal has already triggered the changes that lead to termination even before it has been extruded from the polymerase. A second possibility for triggering termination is that this occurs upon extrusion of the poly(A) signal, when it encounters factors riding with the elongation complex. One model of this type is the “anti-terminator” model (22Logan J. Falck-Pedersen E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8306-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 23McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which suggests that as the poly(A) signal emerges from the polymerase it triggers a response in the transcription complex that over-rides the effects of an associated anti-termination factor. Calvo and Manley (24Calvo O. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have suggested that one such anti-termination factor may be PC4 (positive cofactor 4). Human PC4 interacts with CstF, which, together with CPSF, forms the core of the cleavage and polyadenylation apparatus (4Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CstF also binds the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the polymerase large subunit (17Fong N. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Because CPSF has been shown to join the polymerase at the promoter in vitro (25Dantonel J.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Tora L. Nature. 1997; 389: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and CstF and CPSF are found complexed with each other (26Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and with RNA polymerase II (27Yankulov K. Todorov I. Romanowski P. Licatalosi D. Cilli K. McCracken S. Laskey R. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6154-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in nuclear extracts, it is widely believed that a CstF·CPSF complex rides down the template with the elongating polymerase (see “Discussion”). Based on studies with the yeast homologs of PC4 and CstF, Calvo and Manley (24Calvo O. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) suggested that PC4 interacts with CstF during elongation to suppress a termination activity triggered by CstF until the poly(A) signal emerges from the polymerase. The extruding poly(A) signal then binds to CstF (and CPSF) thereby triggering relief of the PC4-mediated suppression, which leads to termination (24Calvo O. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The idea that termination is triggered upon extrusion of the poly(A) signal is consistent with current thinking that processing factors ride with the polymerase for the purpose of facilitating rapid (zero order) interaction with the pre-mRNA processing signals as they emerge from the polymerase (28Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 29Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429PubMed Google Scholar). For 3′-end processing the case is most compelling for CPSF, which recognizes the conserved AAUAAA hexamer of the poly(A) signal. In both mammalian cells and yeast, CPSF or its homologs (but not CstF) are associated with the general transcription initiation factor TFIID (25Dantonel J.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Tora L. Nature. 1997; 389: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 30Sanders S.L. Jennings J. Canutescu A. Link A.J. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4723-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In an in vitro mammalian system the CPSF is transferred from TFIID to the elongating polymerase where it is thought to scan the RNA, awaiting the nascent poly(A) signal (25Dantonel J.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Tora L. Nature. 1997; 389: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Just such a scanning mechanism appears to be used by vaccinia virus in the termination of early gene transcription (31Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11794-11801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 33Condit R.C. Niles E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In vaccinia, termination is signaled by a UUUUUNU sequence in the nascent RNA. The scanning mechanism that recognizes this UUUUUNU signal is so efficient that the recognition event, as well as the trigger to terminate, and termination itself, all occur in less than 60 nt following extrusion of this signal in vivo (34Rohrmann G. Yuen L. Moss B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1029-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is likely that the cellular poly(A) signal is recognized with similar efficiency (28Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 29Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429PubMed Google Scholar). According to the anti-terminator model this recognition event, which is temporally linked to extrusion of the poly(A) signal, triggers a chain of events that culminates in termination of transcription. In the absence of special auxiliary elements designed to hasten termination, the process is gradual, and apparently first order (3Orozco I.J. Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42899-42911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Why is poly(A)-dependent termination first order? One possibility is that triggering occurs immediately (a zero order process) and that the termination-prone polymerases then dissociate from the template according to first order kinetics. Alternatively the zero-order process could correspond to the activation of an enzymatic activity, and this activity may then progressively modify the transcription complex as it travels down the template. Either of these possibilities would be consistent with the two triggering scenarios discussed above, in which the poly(A) signal triggers termination either from within the ternary complex or else immediately following extrusion. However, a third possibility is that the triggering event itself is generated according to first order kinetics. For example, the trigger to terminate could correspond to the pseudo-first order recruitment of a termination factor by the poly(A) signal. Alternatively, one or more factors engaged by the poly(A) signal following its extrusion may undergo a slow, poly(A)-dependent, conformational change. Thus, there are at least three scenarios for triggering termination that are consistent with existing data, triggering from within the transcription complex, triggering upon extrusion of the poly(A) signal from the transcription complex, and triggering pursuant to some additional first order process in which the poly(A) signal participates. These three possibilities predict different time intervals between the moment of poly(A) signal transcription and the point at which it triggers termination. The temporal relationships of these events can be explored by use of cis-antisense inhibition (35Chao L.C. Jamil A. Kim S.J. Huang L. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5588-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which involves placing an antisense sequence at various distances downstream of the poly(A) signal. Because transcription of the antisense leads to inactivation of the poly(A) signal by means of sense:antisense duplex formation (35Chao L.C. Jamil A. Kim S.J. Huang L. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5588-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this approach can be used to measure the window of opportunity (the time between transcription of the sense and antisense elements) available for the poly(A) signal to act (35Chao L.C. Jamil A. Kim S.J. Huang L. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5588-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported below we show that the ability of the poly(A) signal to drive termination in vivo can be blocked by a downstream antisense sequence. This vulnerability to antisense shows that the poly(A) signal does not act prior to extrusion. Moreover, an antisense sequence placed several hundred bp downstream of the poly(A) signal allows gradual termination of polymerases up to the position of the antisense, but blocks further termination downstream. For those polymerases whose termination is blocked, this indicates that events surrounding the extrusion of the poly(A) signal are not sufficient to trigger a loss of processivity in the polymerase. Instead, the gradual release of polymerases over time requires active communication of each polymerase with the poly(A) signal right up until the time the polymerase terminates transcription. Transfection and Nuclear Harvest—COS cells were transfected and harvested as described previously (3Orozco I.J. Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42899-42911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For some of the earlier assays, shown in Fig. 1, cells were harvested using 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) rather than IGEPAL (Sigma). G-less Run-on Transcription Assays—Run-on transcription, extraction of the RNA with TRIzol, and the detection of G-less cassettes was essentially as described previously (3Orozco I.J. Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42899-42911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with the correction that 20 units of anti-RNase (Ambion) was added to the run-on transcription reaction. For the assays shown in Fig. 1, 12 units of RNase inhibitor (Ambion) was used in place of anti-RNase, and the RNA was purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen), which was also described previously (3Orozco I.J. Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42899-42911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since the experiments reported here were carried out we have also begun to include 0.5 mg/ml of heparin in the run-on transcription reaction, which improves the signal to noise ratio (data not shown). The Trigger to Terminate Requires a Fully Extruded Poly(A) Signal in Vivo—To determine whether the poly(A) signal must leave the polymerase to trigger termination we set out to ask whether poly(A)-dependent termination would be affected if the poly(A) signal were inactivated following its extrusion from the polymerase. To measure poly(A)-dependent termination in vivo we employed nuclear run-on transcription to monitor polymerase density within G-less cassettes strategically placed along the transcription unit (2Yeung G. Choi L.M. Chao L.C. Park N.J. Liu D. Jamil A. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 3Orozco I.J. Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42899-42911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To inactivate the poly(A) signal following its extrusion from the polymerase in vivo we used the cis-antisense approach (35Chao L.C. Jamil A. Kim S.J. Huang L. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5588-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The G-less cassette/nuclear run-on method of quantitating poly(A)-dependent termination is illustrated by constructs 1 and 2 in Fig. 1, A and B. The top diagram in Fig. 1A shows the layout of these constructs with either the mutant or wild type SV40 late poly(A) signal, L, followed by a cassette window defined by two G-less cassettes 377 and 261 bp in length. Transfection of these plasmids into COS cells followed by nuclear isolation, run-on transcription, RNase T1 digestion, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave the results shown in lanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 1B. In lane 1 it is apparent that both cassettes downstream of the mutant poly(A) signal yielded strong bands. This indicates that there were elongating polymerases located within both of these cassettes at the time of nuclear isolation. In contrast, lane 2 of Fig. 1B shows that there were few polymerases within the distal cassette when a wild type poly(A) signal was located upstream. This reflects a stochastic, distance-dependent loss of polymerases in vivo due to poly(A)-dependent termination as described previously (3Orozco I.J. Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42899-42911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ratio of the polymerase density in the post-cassette relative to that in the pre-cassette (post/pre ratio in Fig. 1B) is a measure of the efficiency of elongation across the cassette window (3Orozco I.J. Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42899-42911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This elongation efficiency is clearly much lower downstream of the wild type poly(A) signal (0.14) than downstream of the mutant (0.96). We find it convenient to express the poly(A)-dependent decrease in elongation efficiency for the wild type as a percentage of that for the mutant (normalized post/pre ratio in Fig. 1B). Thus, of the polymerases entering the cassette window in this experiment, only 15% as many on the wild type template make it to the end of the window as on the mutant template (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). This is equivalent to 85% poly(A)-dependent termination across the cassette window.Table IPlasmid constructionsAP<cat>This plasmid has been described (2Yeung G. Choi L.M. Chao L.C. Park N.J. Liu D.

Calorimetric measurements indicated that the binding of these ligands to both the Y49F mutant and wild-type enzyme is enthalpically favorable and entropically unfavorable over the temperature range studied. The affinity of these ligands for the Y49F mutant is lower than those for the wild-type enzyme due mainly to an entropy change. Therefore, the thermodynamic effect of this mutation is to decrease the entropy loss due to binding. Calorimetric titrations in several buffers with different ionization heat amounts indicate a release of protons when the mutant binds GSH, whereas protons are taken up in binding S-hexylglutathione at pH 6.5. This suggests that the thiol group of GSH releases protons to buffer media during binding and a group with low pKa (such as Asp98) is responsible for the uptake of protons. The temperature dependence of the free energy of binding, ΔG0, is weak because of the enthalpy-entropy compensation caused by a large heat capacity change. The heat capacity change is –199.5 ± 26.9 cal K–1 mol–1 for GSH binding and –333.6 ± 28.8 cal K–1 mol–1 for S-hexylglutathione binding. The thermodynamic parameters are consistent with the mutation Tyr49 → Phe, producing a slight conformational change in the active site.

Molecular recognition phenomena are at the heart of biological reactions. A key to understanding molecular recognition is a comprehensive analysis of the thermodynamics of binding and the meaningful correlation of thermodynamics with the structure. A close insight into the thermodynamics of the binding process provides guide marks for structure-based molecular design strategies. The forces that govern a binding reaction are the free energy change, ΔG, the enthalpy change, ΔH, the entropy change, ΔS, and the heat capacity change, ΔCp. ΔCp is an approximate measure of the surface area buried in an association reaction and can be used to predict conformational rearrangements in associating protein molecules. An example of particular medical interest is human glutathione transferase P1-1 (hGST P1-1). The structure of this enzyme is known at high resolution in complex with a series of ligands, including its substrate glutathione (GSH) and numerous inhibitors (1Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R.

The mammalian cytosolic GSTs have been grouped into at least seven species-independent classes based on crystal structure and substrate specificity: Alpha, Pi, Mu, Theta, Kappa, Sigma, and Zeta (4Mannervik B.

Comparison of the primary structures among the different classes reveals a very low degree of sequence identity (∼25%). However, crystal structures of GSTs display a common three-dimensional fold and a dimeric organization. All of the cytosolic isozymes are either homoor heterodimers, whereas no interclass heterodimers have so far been observed (9Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Each monomer comprises two domains with one active site. The main structural differences among GST classes are in the GSH binding site (G-site) (in particular, the helix α2 region) and in the hydrophobic substrate binding site (H-site). The human Pi class GST (hGST P1-1) is the most widely distributed and the most abundant of the isoenzymes. Some studies have implicated this enzyme in the development and resistance of tumors toward commonly used anticancer drugs. Understanding the structure and kinetics of the human P1-1 isoenzyme is therefore of great interest (9Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies have revealed the importance of the helix α2 in the function of the enzyme (10Caccuri A.M. Ascenzi P. Antoninio G. Parker M.W. Oakley A.J. Chiessi E. Nuccetelli M. Battistoni A.

The crystal structures suggest that helix α2 and its flanking regions (residues 35–51) are a prime candidate for the flexible regions that are known to influence catalysis. A number of residues of from this region (Trp38, Lys44, and Gln51) participate in the binding of GSH (Fig. 1). Other studies indicate that several residues, such as Cys47 and Tyr49, which are located between helices α4 and α5 of the adjacent subunit (Fig. 1), could participate in intersubunit communication between active sites of the dimer (1Reinemer P.

Parker M.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9912-9917Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although some studies have already been performed with the mutant Y49F in the presence of co-substrate (13Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Ascenzi P. Nicotra M. Nuccetelli M Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19276-19280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), there has been no thermodynamic study carried out on this mutant in the absence of the co-substrate.We have initiated a study of each of these residues with the aim of understanding their relative roles in substrate binding of hGST P1-1. In this paper, we have focused our study on the binding of GSH and the inhibitor S-hexylglutathione (S-hexylGSH) to the Y49F mutant of hGST P1-1 using fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC). The results are compared with those obtained for the wild-type enzyme and discussed in terms of possible differences in their interaction with ligands.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—GSH, S-hexylGSH, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene were ultrapure grade from Sigma. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was from Amersham Biosciences. Phosphate, MOPS, MES, and ACES buffers were purchased from Merck and Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade of the highest purity available. All solutions were made with distilled and deionized (Milli Q) water. All solutions were degassed and filtered through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter before use.Protein Expression and Purification—The wild-type hGST P1-1 was obtained as previously reported (14Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Board P.G. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1249-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Y49F mutant was designed and produced by site-directed mutagenesis, carried out in a two-step polymerase chain reaction (15Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Details of this procedure have been reported elsewhere (13Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Ascenzi P. Nicotra M.

Finally, the Y49F mutant was expressed in TOP 10 Escherichia coli cells and purified as previously reported (14Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Board P.G. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1249-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Estimation of Protein Concentration—Solutions of wild-type and Y49F mutant were prepared by dialysis of the enzyme against several changes of buffer solution at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5.44·104m–1·cm–1 for the dimer. The extinction coefficient was calculated on the basis of the amino acid sequence as reported by Gill et al. (16Gill S.C. von Hippel P H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar) and confirmed by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Absorbance measurements were carried out using a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer with cells maintained at 25 °C.Crystallization—Crystallization was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method as described elsewhere (3Oakley A.J. Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Ricci G. Rossjohn J. Villar H.O. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2-μl drop of a protein solution containing Y49F in 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution, which consisted of 25% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 60 mm DTT, and 100 mm MES buffer (pH 5.8). The trials were carried out at a constant temperature of 22 °C. The drops were allowed to equilibrate for 1 day before they were streak-seeded with a cat's whisker from drops containing wild-type crystals grown under similar conditions. Crystals appeared in the shape of plates after 1 week and grew to maximal dimensions of 0.1 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm. The x-ray diffraction data were collected using a MARResearch area detector with CuKα X-rays generated by a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator. The data were collected at 100 K after cryoprotecting the crystals in 25% (v/v) glycerol. The diffraction data were processed and analyzed using programs in the HKL (17Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar) and CCP4 (18CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which had GSH and water molecules removed. Rigid body refinement in XPLOR (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) was used to compensate for any possible changes in crystal packing. Since the asymmetric unit of the crystal contained two GST monomers, use was made of the noncrystallographic symmetry restraints on all non-hydrogen atoms during the first few rounds of refinement. The starting model gave an R-factor of 34.0% (Rfree = 34.3%), which reduced to 32.5% (Rfree = 32.3%) after rigid body refinement. The mutation was clearly observed in an Fmutant – Fwild type electron density map with –5 σ peaks over the hydroxyl groups of Tyr49 in each monomer, and hence residue 49 was changed to phenylalanine. The model was then subjected to cycles of positional and isotropically restrained B-factor refinement and inclusion of water and buffer molecules. After application of a bulk solvent correction, the final R-factor was 20.6% (Rfree = 23.0%) for all data to 1.9-Å resolution. A stereochemical analysis of the refined structure with the program PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) gave values either similar to or better than expected for structures refined at similar resolution.

The excitation wavelength was 278 nm, and fluorescence was monitored at 339 nm. The temperature of the sample was controlled at 25.0 ± 0.2 °C using a thermostatted cuvette holder and a Frigiterm 6000382 Selecta refrigerated circulating water bath. A 2.0-ml protein solution in a 4.0-ml quartz fluorescence cell was stirred after each addition of ligand. The emission slit widths used for excitation and emission were 4 nm. The buffer used for fluorescence was 50 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT at pH 6.5. The fluorescence measurements were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects. The procedure and data analysis used were similar to that described elsewhere (21Ortiz-Salmerón E. Yassin Z. Clemente-Jiménez M.J. Las Heras-Vazquez F.J. Rodríguez-Vico F. Barón C. García-Fuentes L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4307-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry—ITC experiments were carried out using an MCS titration microcalorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) (22Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 17: 131-137Crossref Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). The reference cell was filled with Milli Q water, and the calorimeter was calibrated using standard electrical pulses, as recommended by the manufacturer. Prior to the titration experiments, both enzyme and ligand were degassed for 10 min under vacuum. Solutions of the proteins were filled in the sample cell (1.38-ml volume) and titrated with either GSH or S-hexylGSH. Ligand solutions were prepared in the buffer from the last change of dialysis. During the titration, the reaction mixture was continuously stirred at 400 rpm. A typical experiment consisted of a first control injection of 1 or 2 μl followed by successive injections, each of 5 μl of 20-s duration, with a 4-min interval between injections. The background titration profiles, under identical experimental conditions, were obtained by injecting the ligand into appropriate buffer solutions. The observed heat effects were concentration-independent and were identical to the heat signals detected after complete saturation of the protein. The raw experimental data was presented as the amount of heat produced per second following each injection of ligand into the enzyme solution (corrected for the ligand heats of dilution) as a function of time. The amount of heat produced per injection was calculated by integration of the area under individual peaks by the Origin software provided with the instrument.ITC measurements were routinely performed in 5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm of sodium phosphate at pH 6.5. Heat contributions due to coupled protonation events upon binding were evaluated by calorimetric experiments in various buffers, and their ionization enthalpies (in kcal mol–1 at 25 °C) were as follows: phosphate (1.22), MES (3.72), MOPS (5.27), and ACES (7.53) (23Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins. 1998; 33: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The pH of the buffer solutions was adjusted at the experimental temperature.RESULTSFluorescence Binding ExperimentsThe binding of S-hexylGSH and the GSH to the Y49F mutant of hGST P1-1 was observed by intrinsic fluorescence as a function of the ligand concentration at 25 °C and pH 6.5, following the procedure indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 depicts the titrations of this mutant with these ligands (i.e. GSH (A) and S-hexylGSH (B)). The titrations were displayed as a plot of the degree of binding, ν, versus log[ligand], with [ligand] being the ligand free concentration (GSH or S-hexylGSH). Extrapolation of the upper part of the plots leads to a value of 2 mol of ligand bound per mol of dimeric enzyme at saturation. A Scatchard plot of these values clearly extrapolates to ν = 2 (plots shown as an inset in Fig. 2), and no systematic deviations from linearity are detected. These results may be taken as evidence of the existence of two identical and independent binding sites. A Hill plot of these experimental values leads to Hill coefficients of 0.96 ± 0.06 and 0.98 ± 0.03 for the binding of GSH and S-hexylGSH, respectively, indicating that the binding of these ligands to Y49F mutant is noncooperative. The fitting of these experimental data to this model gives a value for the association constant, K, of (4.8 ± 0.3) × 103m–1 (Kd = 205 μm) and (2.7 ± 0.6) × 105m–1 (Kd = 3.7 μm) for the binding of GSH and S-hexylGSH, respectively. These values are ∼3-fold and 6-fold lower than those obtained for the wild-type enzyme: 7.7 × 103m–1 (Kd = 130 μm) (13Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Ascenzi P. Nicotra M. Nuccetelli M Mazzetti A.P.

The degree of binding, ν, is plotted versus log [ligand]. The dimeric enzyme concentrations were 8.32 μm (GSH binding) and 9.73 μm (S-hexylGSH binding), and the buffer solution was 50 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The solid line gives the best fit to the data for a noncooperative model. The plots displayed as inset in both panels represent the Scatchard plots for these associations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ITC ExperimentsDirect calorimetric measurements were performed in order to obtain independent estimates of the thermodynamic parameters governing binding of GSH and S-hexylGSH to the Y49F mutant and the wild-type enzyme. Figs. 3 and 4 show representative titrations of the Y49F mutant with GSH and S-hexylGSH, respectively. Representative titrations of wild-type with both ligands appear also as an inset plot in Figs. 3 and 4. The enthalpy change ΔH and binding constant K on enzymeligand interaction were directly obtainable from the experimental titration curves shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Moreover, the Gibbs energy change of binding (ΔG = –RTlnK) was calculated from the binding constant, and the entropy change (TΔS = –ΔG + ΔH) on the association was also estimated.Fig. 3A, representative isothermal titration calorimetry measurements of the binding of GSH to Y49F mutant of hGST P1-1.

For details, see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Change of Protonation State—Substrate or inhibitor binding may cause the enzyme to take up or release protons (e.g. through pKa changes of the side chains accompanying the binding reaction). This will contribute to the overall heat change, ΔHobs, measured in the ITC experiment. If ionizable groups undergo pKa changes on complex formation, protons will be exchanged with the buffer. The heat of protonation/deprotonation depends on the ionization enthalpy of the buffer to the following equation,ΔHobs=ΔHbind+nH-ΔHioniz(Eq. 1) where nH+ designates the number of protons that are taken up (nH+ > 0) or released (nH+ < 0) by the complex protein-ligand (24Cooper A. Johnson C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 22: 109-124PubMed Google Scholar). To study such protonation effects, calorimetric titration experiments were repeated in various buffers of different ΔHioniz (MOPS, MES, ACES, and phosphate) at pH 6.5 and 25 °C. The binding enthalpy, ΔHbind, was obtained from the intercept (ΔHioniz = 0) of a plot according to Equation 1. The results are shown in Table III and Fig. 5. A negative slope was obtained (nH+ < 0), with nH+ = –0.44 ± 0.08 and nH+ = –0.11 ± 0.01 for the binding of GSH to the wild type and the Y49F mutant, respectively (Table III). Hence, in the complex formation enzyme-GSH, the number of protons released for wild-type enzyme is higher than that for the Y49F mutant. This means that one or several pKa values, corresponding to some donor proton groups of the ligand and/or enzyme, decrease (i.e. become more acidic). Since ∼0.45 H+/monomer are released in the wild-type/GSH binding, few groups will be able to change their pKa value. In fact, a common feature of GSTs, which have very similar GSH binding sites (G-sites), is that they lower the apparent pKa value of the bound GSH from 9.1 to about 6.0–6.6. The hydroxyl group of a conserved tyrosine or serine (for instance, Tyr7 in this transferase; Tyr9 in the Alpha class GST A1–1; Tyr6 in Schistosoma japonicum GST), which hydrogen-bonds to the sulfur atom of GSH, probably stabilizes and orientates the thiolate in a productive fashion (25Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a kinetic analysis has been performed on this (26Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Nucetelli M. Nicotra M.

To be precise, the amount of protons released between pH 5.05 and 7.43 is stoichiometric to the amount of thiolate formed in the G-site, being the nH+ of ∼0.5 H+/subunit at pH 6.5 (26Caccuri A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2028070177,"The E7 oncoprotein encoded by high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a significant role in the development of HPV-related cancers. E7 is a potent stimulator of S phase and host DNA replication. These functions of E7 are linked to the deregulation of the Rb family of proteins. For example, E7 binds and induces proteolysis of Rb through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Despite advances in our understanding of E7, reagents that inhibit E7 with promise in therapy have not been developed or identified. Here, we provide evidence that the tumor suppressor ARF can inhibit E7. We show that the expression of ARF causes a relocalization of E7 from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus. Two distinct regions in ARF overlapping with the MDM2-binding sites are necessary for the relocalization of E7. Furthermore, we show that ARF blocks the proteolysis of Rb induced by E7. In addition, ARF expression inhibits DNA replication induced by E7. Although it is not known whether the endogenous ARF, which is expressed at a low level, interferes with E7, our results suggest that ARF is an effective inhibitor of E7. We speculate that ARF or an ARF-derived molecule might have a significant impact in therapy against HPV-related tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1993365592,"Brn-3a is a transcription factor belonging to the class IV of POU domain transcription factors. It is expressed throughout the peripheral nervous system but especially in postmitotic sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia. Brn-3a is known to regulate different genes involved in neuronal differentiation and survival. It has been shown that some of these genes require the N-terminal domain of Brn-3a in order to be activated and this effect is observed only in neurons suggesting that it may require a neuronal-specific cofactor. In order to identify this putative factor(s) we screened a cDNA library via a variant of the original yeast two-hybrid system. By using the N-terminal of Brn-3a as the bait, we have repeatedly isolated a protein named Rin, an incompletely characterized small GTP-binding protein expressed only in neurons. In this work, we describe the evidence for a functional interaction between Brn-3a and Rin and demonstrate the role of Rin in modulating the activation of the Brn-3a regulated egr-1 promoter by the N-terminal domain of Brn-3a."

In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of BPV-1 E7-induced cell proliferation. Our studies indicate that expression of BPV-1 E7 induces DNA synthesis and stimulates cells to enter S phase in quiescent cells. The induction of cell proliferation by BPV-1 E7 can occur in the retinoblastoma gene (Rb)-null cells, suggesting an Rb-independent mechanism. Consistent with this observation, BPV-1 E7 does not efficiently activate the transcription of the E2F family of transcription factors (E2F)-responsive promoters. Notably, c-Myc is able to induce cells to enter S phase in quiescent cells through an Rb/E2F-independent pathway. Significantly, c-Myc levels are increased in BPV-1 E7-expressing cells. Moreover, expression of a dominant negative c-Myc mutant inhibited BPV-1 E7-induced DNA synthesis. Consistent with the notion that c-Myc could down-regulate p27 and activate Cdk2, p27 level is decreased while both cyclin A and cyclin E-associated kinase activities are up-regulated in BPV-1 E7-expressing cells.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7888-7898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High risk HPV E7 induces DNA synthesis in quiescent or differentiated cells and transforms immortalized rodent cells (Refs. 4Morozov A.

Oncogene Res. 1988; 3: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The E7 proteins of both the low and high risk HPVs were able to activate the Ad E2 promoter (6Phelps W.C. Yee C.L.

HPV-16 E7 has the ability to overcome p21-, p27-, and p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and potentiates tumorigenesis in transgenic mice (reviewed in Ref. 3Munger K. Basile J.R. Duensing S. Eichten A. Gonzalez S.L. Grace M. Zacny V.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7888-7898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a role in maintenance of episomes during the viral life cycle and modulation of cellular response to apoptosis by HPV E7 has been reported (reviewed in Ref. 3Munger K. Basile J.R. Duensing S. Eichten A. Gonzalez S.L. Grace M. Zacny V.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7888-7898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of E7 protein to associate with and destabilize the cellular tumor suppressor pRB has been suggested as a mechanism by which the viral protein promotes cell proliferation (Ref. 9Berezutskaya E. Yu B. Morozov A. Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1277-1286PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Inactivation of pRB leads to activation of cellular genes driven by the E2F transcription factor that are important for S phase entry in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 10Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). However, pRB-independent biological activities of E7 have been observed and multiple additional cellular interactors of the viral proteins have been identified (for review, see Ref. 3Munger K. Basile J.R. Duensing S. Eichten A. Gonzalez S.L. Grace M. Zacny V.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7888-7898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major transforming proteins encoded by BPV-1 are E5 and E6. Each of these proteins is sufficient to induce transformation of murine C127 cells (11Schiller J.T. Vass W.C. Lowy D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1986; 233: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although no independent oncogenic activity has been detected for BPV-1 E7, it was shown to be required for efficient transformation of C127 by BPV-1 (16Neary K. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 259-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the transforming capability of BPV-1 E7 was repressed by other viral genes in the context of BPV-1 genome (17Vande Pol S.B. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 395-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that expression of BPV-1 E7 sensitizes cells to tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis in the absence of Rb (18Liu Y. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30894-30900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, conflicting data have been published on the role of BPV-1 E7 in BPV-1 genome copy number regulation (Ref. 19Jareborg N. Alderborn A. Burnett S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4957-4965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). With the exception of the Cys-X-X-Cys motifs, the E7 proteins of the BPV-1 and the HPVs are quite different in their amino acid composition (<20% identity). BPV-1 E7 lacks the sequence motif (LXCXE) present in the HPV E7 proteins, which is critical for efficient binding to the Rb family proteins (20Chellappan S. Kraus V.B. Kroger B. Munger K. Howley P.M. Phelps W.C. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4549-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 21Dyson N. Guida P. Munger K. Harlow E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6893-6902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the sequences in the C-terminal half of E7 proteins are well conserved between BPV-1 and HPVs. A low affinity pRB-binding site has been identified from the C terminus of HPV-16 E7 (22Patrick D.R. Oliff A. Heimbrook D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6842-6850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated a low affinity association of BPV-1 E7 protein with pRB but not p107 (18Liu Y. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30894-30900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of BPV-1 E7 in cell proliferation. Our results indicate that BPV-1 E7 can stimulate cells to enter S phase in the absence of Rb. Furthermore, c-Myc plays an important role in the ability of BPV-1 E7 to activate cyclin A- and cyclin E-associated kinases. Plasmids and Cell Culture—The Ad E2 reporter pAdE2luc contains the Ad E2 promoter followed by the sequences encoding luciferase (23Hiraiwa A. Kiyono T. Suzuki S. Ohashi M. Ishibashi M. Virus Genes. 1996; 12: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The phRL-CMV reporter contains the CMV immediate-early enhancer/promoter region followed by a synthetic Renilla gene sequence (Promega). The dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-luciferase contains murine DHFR promoter followed by the luciferase cDNA (24Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). pLTRE7 encodes HPV-16 E7 downstream of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus LTR (25Sedman S.A. Hubbert N.L. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4201-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, pLTRBE7 encodes BPV-1 E7 downstream of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus LTR. pCMVMadMyc encodes a dominant negative mutant of c-Myc (26Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). pDsRed1-N1 (Clontech, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) encodes a red fluorescent protein (RFP). pEGFPF encodes a farnesylated GFP (27Jiang W. Hunter T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24 (352, 354): 349-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PBE7N cells were established by infection of NIH3T3 cells with pBabe Puro-based retroviruses encoding BPV-1 E7 (18Liu Y. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30894-30900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Control PURON cells contains the pBabe Puro vector. Similarly, PBE7RB–/– and PURORB–/– cells were established by infection of Rb–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast from embryo taken at gestational day 12 (28Lee E.Y. Chang C.Y. Hu N. Wang Y.C. Lai C.C. Herrup K. Lee W.H. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) with pBabe Puro-based retroviruses encoding BPV-1 E7 and the retrovirus vector, respectively. RT-PCR—Reverse transcriptase reaction was performed with 1 μgof total cellular RNA isolated from various cell lines used as a template to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). The PCR reaction was carried out with TaqDNA polymerase (Promega). BPV-1 E7-specific primers (sense, nucleotides 3–20 (5′-GGTTCAAGGTCCAAATACCC-3′); antisense, nucleotides 171–152 (5′-TAGTGGGACCTCGCTTCCTA-3′)) were used to amplify a 171-nucleotide fragment from the E7 cDNA. HPV-16 E7-specific primers (sense, nucleotides 3–20 (5′-CCGCATGGAGATACACCTAC-3′); antisense, nucleotides 122–102 (5′-GGACCATCTATTTCATCCTCC-3′)) were used to amplify a 124-nucleotide fragment from the HPV-16 E7 cDNA. c-Myc-specific primers (sense, nucleotides 906–930 (5′-CTCCACTCACCAGCACAACT-3′); antisense, nucleotides 1295–1271 (5′-CGTCGTTTTCCTCAATAAGTCC-3′)) were used to amplify a 390-nucleotide fragment from the c-Myc cDNA. For β-actin, the sense primer 5′-TGGCATTGCCGACAGGATGCAGAA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CTCGTCATACTCCTGCTGAT-3′ were used to amplify a 172-nucleotide fragment. Flow Cytometry—Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes with Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal calf serum at 2 × 105 cells/dish. The following day, the DMEM was changed to medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum (serum-starved) and incubated for 48 h. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. Cells were then stained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 2 h and analyzed for DNA content on a FACScan flow cytometer on linear scale (BD Biosciences). Debris and aggregates were gated out during data acquisition, and 10,000 gated events were collected for each sample. Cell cycle analyses were performed for duplicate samples using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Luciferase Assay—For luciferase assay, NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105/well 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected using the Pfx-5 kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell extracts were collected 40–48 h posttransfection. Of the 500-μl extract collected from each well, 20 μl were mixed with 100 μl of Luciferase Assay Reagent II (Promega) and measured for firefly luciferase activity in a luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc.). This step was followed by the addition of 100 μl of Stop & Glo reagent for analyzing the Renilla luciferase activity. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Labeling—The rate of DNA synthesis was detected by the BrdUrd cell proliferation assay kit (Oncogene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were seeded in 96-well plate at a concentration of 4 × 103 cells/well. The following day, the medium was changed from DMEM 10% fetal calf serum to 0.5% fetal calf serum and the cells were incubated for 72 h. During the final 24 h of culture, BrdUrd was added to wells. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized, and the DNA was denatured by treatment with fixative/denaturing solution. Detector anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody and horseradish-conjugated anti-mouse antibody were then used, and the color reaction was developed by using the chromogenic substrate tetramethylbenzidine. The product was quantified using a spectrophotometric plate reader at dual wavelength of 450–595 nm. For co-transfection experiments, cells grown on coverslips were cotransfected at a ratio of 1:10 with plasmid-expressing RFP and MadMyc using FuGENE 6. At 12 h post-transfection, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 48 h. BrdUrd was added to the culture to a final concentration of 100 μm for the final 8 h. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and permeabilized in ice-cold 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Cells were then stained for BrdUrd with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (CALTAG MD5401). The cells were examined under a Nikon fluorescence microscope. Transfected cells were identified as RFP-positive. BrdUrd incorporation was measured by immunostaining. Immunoblot Analysis and Kinase Assay—Proteins were extracted from the cells in RIPA buffer (20 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors including aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentration was measured by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining. For nuclear extract preparation, cells were lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, the pellet was lysed in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) to get the nuclear extract. Approximately 50 μg of protein extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and incubated with specific primary antibodies. This was followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies and analyzed with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). The antibodies used in this study were against Cdc25 A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7389), Cdk2 (sc-6248), c-Myc (sc-764), cyclin A (sc-751), cyclin D1 (sc-8396), cyclin E (sc-481), p27 (sc-1641), and tubulin-β (Sigma T4026). The kinase assay was performed essentially as described previously (29Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors mixture of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 100 hundred μgof total protein extract were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibody and protein A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Assays were performed in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 20 μm cold ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. 2 μg of histone H1 (Sigma) was used as the substrate in the kinase assays. Following the kinase reaction, samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Expression of BPV-1 E7 Induces Cells to Enter S Phase—To study the biological activities of BPV-1 E7, mouse NIH 3T3 cells expressing BPV-1 E7 and control vectors named PBE7N and PURON, respectively, were established. For this study, NIH3T3 cells were infected with amphotrophic retrovirus-expressing BPV-1 E7. After puromycin selection, populations of infected cells were pooled. Similarly, the Rb–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast-expressing BPV-1 E7 (PBE7RB–/–) and control cells containing the retrovirus vector (PURORB–/–) were also established. BPV-1 E7 gene expression was confirmed by PCR amplification of the cDNA after reverse transcription of cellular mRNA (Fig. 1). Morphologically, there are no significance differences between cells expressing BPV-1 E7 and the vector control (data not shown). To avoid the possibility of chromosomal instability due to the expression of BPV-1 E7, all of the experiments were performed using cells within three passages. To investigate the effect of BPV-1 E7 on cell cycle progression, PBE7N and control PURON cells were serum-starved and analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry. The result of a representative experiment is shown in Fig. 1B. Clearly, a significant proportion of the E7-expressing cells entered S phase, whereas control cells largely remained arrested in the G1 phase under serum starvation. No significant difference in percentage of S phase between PBE7N and PURON cells was observed when they were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum. Increased S phase of unsynchronized cells by BPV-1 E7 could be the result of its induction of cells to enter S phase or prevention of cell cycle arrest from occurring. To demonstrate that BPV-1 E7 indeed has the ability to promote quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle, we treated PBE7N cells with the potassium/sodium channel blocker quinidine to arrest cells in G1 (30Wang S. Melkoumian Z. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and asked whether cells expressing BPV-1 E7 can enter the cell cycle when they were released into low serum medium lacking quinidine. Flow cytometry analysis showed that although control PURON cells that were released from a quinidine block into low serum media for 24 h failed to enter S phase, PBE7N cells did enter S phase (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that BPV-1 E7 can induce S phase entry, although we could not rule out the possibility that it may also have the ability to prevent cell cycle arrest from occurring. This function of BPV-1 E7 probably mimics its role to induce DNA synthesis in terminally differentiated cells. The ability of BPV-1 E7 to promote cell cycle progression was further analyzed by measuring BrdUrd incorporation. BrdUrd incorporates into newly synthesized DNA strands of actively proliferating cells. After serum starvation of PBE7N and PURON cells, BrdUrd was added to the culture and was detected immunochemically. As shown in Fig. 2A, cells expressing BPV-1 E7 had significantly higher BrdUrd incorporation (∼2-fold higher) than the control cells. No significant difference in BrdUrd incorporation between PBE7N and PURON cells was observed when they were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum (data not shown). Induction of Cell Proliferation by BPV-1 E7 Can Occur in the Absence of Rb—Although our previous study showed that BPV-1 E7 did not bind pRB efficiently in vitro or promoted its degradation in vivo (18Liu Y. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30894-30900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it remains possible that inactivation of Rb is required for BPV-1 E7 to induce cell proliferation. To assess the role of Rb in this process, PBE7RB–/– and control cells were examined for BrdUrd incorporation after serum starvation. As shown in Fig. 2B, significantly elevated BrdUrd incorporation was observed in cells expressing BPV-1 E7 as compared with the control cells. These data indicate that BPV-1 E7-induced cell proliferation can occur in the absence of Rb, although it does not rule out the possibility that some of the activities seen in PBE7N cells involve Rb inactivation. The E7 proteins of both the low and high risk HPVs were found to be able to activate the E2F-responsive Ad E2 promoter (6Phelps W.C. Yee C.L. Munger K. Howley P.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 539-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 7Storey A. Osborn K. Crawford L. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Munger K. Yee C.L. Phelps W.C. Pietenpol J.A. Moses H.L. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3943-3948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Armstrong D.J. Roman A. Virology. 1997; 239: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In some cells, however, the ability of HPV E7 to activate the Ad E2 promoter correlated with its binding efficiency to pRB (31Armstrong D.J. Roman A. Virology. 1997; 239: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This promoter contains E2F-binding sites whose activation relies on functional inactivation of Rb and Rb family members. Therefore, we assessed the ability of BPV-1 E7 to activate the transcription of Ad E2 promoter. Plasmid expressing BPV-1 E7 was co-transfected with an Ad E2 luciferase reporter plasmid (23Hiraiwa A. Kiyono T. Suzuki S. Ohashi M. Ishibashi M. Virus Genes. 1996; 12: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) into NIH3T3 cells, and luciferase activities were determined. Although our positive control HPV-16 E7 activated the Ad E2 promoter for nearly 4-fold, BPV-1 E7 did not efficiently increase the transcription of the reporter (<0.2-fold increase, see Fig. 3). The control assay with the CMV-Renilla luciferase reporter demonstrated that the failure of stimulation by BPV-1 E7 is not because of a lack of efficient transfection. RT-PCR analysis indicated similar levels of HPV-16 E7 and BPV-1 E7 mRNAs (data not shown). Therefore, defective Ad E2 promoter activation by BPV-1 E7 cannot be attributed to the level of its expression. To ascertain that the lack of efficient activation of E2F-responsive promoter by BPV-1 E7 is not restricted to Ad E2, we examined the ability of BPV-1 E7 to activate another E2F-responsive promoter, the DHFR promoter. It was shown that E2F binding is required to activate the DHFR promoter (32Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33Wade M. Kowalik T.F. Mudryj M. Huang E.S. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 4364-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Accordingly, plasmids encoding E7 were co-transfected with a DHFR luciferase reporter plasmid into NIH3T3 and luciferase activities were determined. While HPV-16 E7 activated DHFR reporter for severalfold, BPV-1 E7 did not alter the reporter activity (data not shown). Taken together, results from our studies indicate that Rb is not a major target for BPV-1 E7. Our studies with the E2F-responsive promoters also suggest that the Rb family members p107 and p130 may not play an important role in BPV-1 E7-induced cell proliferation as they also repress E2F-regulated promoters (34Classon M. Dyson N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Myc Contributes to BPV-1 E7-induced Cell Proliferation—Because BPV-1 E7 could induce cell cycle progression in the absence of Rb, we began to investigate Rb-independent pathways by which BPV-1 E7 performs its functions. It was shown that ectopic expression of c-Myc was able to induce cells to enter S phase in quiescent cells (reviewed in Ref. 35Bartek J. Lukas J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Myc activity was shown to be involved in a G1/S-promoting mechanism by regulating cyclin E-Cdk2 function that is independent of E2F and parallel to the Rb/E2F pathway (36Santoni-Rugiu E. Falck J. Mailand N. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3497-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The pRB-independent induction of cell proliferation by BPV-1 E7 raises the possibility that E7 activates c-Myc. Therefore, we investigated whether BPV-1 E7 could induce c-Myc expression. Accordingly, extracts were prepared from PBE7N and control cells and levels of c-Myc were examined by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4A, cells expressing BPV-1 E7 exhibited a significantly increased level of c-Myc (>4-fold) in NIH3T3 cells after serum starvation. Furthermore, BPV-1 E7 expression also increased c-Myc level to a less extent under normal culture conditions (i.e. DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum) where no difference in cell proliferation was observed between BPV-1 E7 and control cells. These data suggest that the elevated levels of c-Myc in E7-expressing cells are not simply a result of increased cell proliferation. Up-regulation of c-Myc in RB–/– cells expressing BPV-1 E7 was also observed (data not shown). To determine whether BPV-1 E7 induces c-Myc by increasing its mRNA, we performed RT-PCR assays. As shown in Fig. 4B, c-Myc mRNA is increased for >3-fold in PBE7N cells as compared with PURON cells. Similarly, c-Myc mRNA is also increased in PBE7RB–/– cells. Although this result does not rule out the possibility that BPV-1 E7 may also regulate c-Myc by post-transcriptional mechanism, it suggests that BPV-1 E7 could activate the transcription of the c-myc gene. To further establish the role of c-Myc in BPV-1 E7-induced cell proliferation, we expressed a dominant negative mutant of c-Myc (MadMyc) in PBE7N cells and cellular DNA replication was assessed by BrdUrd incorporation. MadMyc is a chimeric protein that contains the DNA binding/dimerization domains of c-Myc and transcriptional repression domain of Mad (26Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is believed to cause repression of c-Myc-responsive genes by binding to the c-Myc-binding elements. Transient expression of MadMyc induced G1 arrest independent of functional Rb (26Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Berns K. Martins C. Dannenberg J.H. Berns A. te Riele H. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4822-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Accordingly, an RFP-expressing vector was co-transfected with MadMyc or vector control to PBE7N cells. After transfection, cells were serum-starved and BrdUrd was added to the culture for the final 8 h. Cells were then immunostained for BrdUrd and scored for BrdUrd incorporation. Fig. 4C shows that MadMyc expression inhibited BPV-1 E7-induced DNA synthesis. In MadMyc-expressing PBE7N cells, the number of BrdUrd-positive cells was reduced by >50%. These results indicate an important role of c-Myc in the induction of cell proliferation by BPV-1 E7. Down-regulation of p27 and Up-regulation of Cyclin A and Cyclin E-associated Kinase Activities in BPV-1 E7-expressing Cells—The mechanism of c-Myc-induced cell proliferation is complex including the up-regulation of Cdc25A, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and down-regulation of p27 (reviewed in Ref. 35Bartek J. Lukas J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). These pathways converge on the control of Cdk2 activity, which is rate-limiting and essential for DNA replication. To investigate which of these protein levels altered in BPV-1 E7-expressing cells, we performed Western blot analysis. Accordingly, extracts were prepared from PBE7N and control PURON cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, cells expressing BPV-1 E7 exhibited a decreased level of p27 (1.4-fold) under serum starvation. This result is consistent with the observation that p27 is a critical G1 phase cell cycle target of c-Myc (38Yang W. Shen J. Wu M. Arsura M. FitzGerald M. Suldan Z. Kim D.W. Hofmann C.S. Pianetti S. Romieu-Mourez R. Freedman L.P. Sonenshein G.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In contrast, no significant difference was observed for Cdc25A, Cdk2, cyclin A, cyclin D1, and cyclin E protein levels between PBE7N and control PURON cells. We next examined Cdk2 kinase activities in BPV-1 E7-expressing cells. For this goal, cyclin A, cyclin D, and cyclin E were immunoprecipitated from PBE7N, PBE7RB–/–, and control cell extracts with specific antibodies and the respective kinase activities with histone H1 were determined. As shown in Fig. 5B, PBE7N cells showed a significant increase in cyclin E-associated kinase activity (2.5-fold). Cyclin A-associated kinase activity was also increased in PBE7N cells (1-fold). Similar increased cyclin A and cyclin E-associated kinase activities were also observed in Rb–/– cells expressing BPV-1 E7 (data not shown). In contrast, the cyclin D-associated kinase activity in PBE7N cells was decreased (2-fold). The reason for the reduced cyclin D-associated kinase activity in PBE7N cells is not known. Nevertheless, cyclin E can induce S phase entry without activation of E2F-dependent transcription or pRB phosphorylation (39Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5322-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and ectopic expression of cyclin A also allows S phase entry of rodent fibroblasts (43Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the tumor suppressor pRB by the HPV E7 is a mechanism by which HPV promotes cell growth. pRB-independent biological activities of E7 have been observed, but the precise mechanism for these E7 functions are not well understood. The BPV-1 E7 does not bind pRB efficiently yet is required for full transformation of murine cells by BPV-1. The BPV-1 E7 thus provides a good model to explore Rb-independent activities of E7. In this study, we provided evidence that BPV-1 E7-induced cell proliferation can occur in the absence of Rb. Our studies demonstrate that activation of c-Myc contributes to BPV-1 E7-induced cell proliferation. Furthermore, down-regulation of p27 by c-Myc resulted in the activation of cyclin A and cyclin E-associated kinases. These studies indicated an important role of c-Myc in BPV-1 E7-induced cell proliferation. c-Myc is involved in many biological activities including induction of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 44Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2967-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that expression of BPV-1 E7 sensitized cells to tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis in an Rb-independent manner (18Liu Y. Hong Y. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30894-30900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine whether activation of c-Myc contributes to BPV-1 E7-induced cell sensitization to apoptosis. Notably, HPV-16 E7 could also induce c-Myc (45Gewin L. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7198-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, this activity of E7 has been attributed to the release of E2F as a result of its binding with pRB (45Gewin L. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7198-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Some recent observations suggest an additional role of c-Myc in HPV-16 E7-induced cell proliferation. For example, both HPV-16 E7 and c-Myc activate cdc25 (46Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 47Katich S.C. Zerfass-Thome K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5321-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Although p27 was reduced in BPV-1 E7-expressing cells, cdc25A level did not change significantly in our study. Although it is well established that c-Myc down-regulates p27, a recent study suggests that p27 could also inhibit c-Myc expression and cyclin E-Cdk2 activity (52McArthur G.A. Foley K.P. Fero M.L. Walkley C.R. Deans A.J. Roberts J.M. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3014-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This observation raises the possibility that BPV-1 E7 may down-regulate p27 to activate c-Myc. However, our data that c-Myc protein level is increased in both serum-starved and non-starved cells while down-regulation of p27 only occurs in serum-starved BPV-1 E7-expressing cells suggest that p27 is downstream of c-Myc in the activation of Cdk2 activities in these cells. Notably, although cyclin D level was slightly increased, the cyclin D-associated kinase activity in PBV-1 E7-expressing cells was decreased. A likely explanation for this observation is the sequestration of p27 into cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes away from cyclin E-Cdk2 by c-Myc (53Perez-Roger I. Kim S.H. Griffiths B. Sewing A. Land H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5310-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, this process is complex as one study found that p27 acted as an activator of cyclin D-dependent kinase activity (54Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to understand the mechanism and significance of cyclin D-dependent kinase down-regulation in BPV-1 E7-expressing cells. We thank Elliot J.

https://openalex.org/W2075014349,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene belongs to a multigene family that includes two paralogues, p63 and p73. p73alpha has common activities with p53, such as DNA binding and transactivation, and can thus activate the transcription of p53-responsive genes. Using the adenoviral system, we report that an overexpression of either wt-p73alpha or one of the two transcriptional inactive mutants, deltaNp73alpha or p73alphaR292H, induces an accumulation of the endogenous wt-p53 expressed in the three transformed cell lines, SK-N-SH, MCF-7 and U-2OS, without stimulating the p53 gene transcription. p73-mediated accumulation of p53 protein coincides with an increase of p53-target gene expression in cells expressing either wt-p73alpha or the transcriptional inactive mutant p73alphaR292H, but not deltaNp73alpha that encodes a dominant-negative mutant of both p73 and p53. The fact that an ectopic expression of p73alphaR292H leads to both accumulation of p53 and stimulation of p53 target gene expression strongly suggests that p73alpha is able to induce activation of p53. This was confirmed by showing that p73alphaR292H no longer stimulated Waf1/p21 expression in MCF7/R-A1 cells that expressed a transcriptional inactive mutant of p53. We thus conclude that p73alpha protein was able to both stabilize and activate wt-p53 protein, independent of the p73alpha transcriptional activity."

In her Perspective, Wyse reviews recent studies of collisions between the Milky Way and smaller satellite galaxies. There is evidence for minor collisions with satellites such as the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. But the Milky Way does not seem to have suffered any major collisions over the past 10,000 million years, making our galaxy unusual according to galaxy-formation models. Andromeda, another large galaxy in the Local Group, conforms better with expectation, showing evidence for significant recent accretion and/or disruption events."
