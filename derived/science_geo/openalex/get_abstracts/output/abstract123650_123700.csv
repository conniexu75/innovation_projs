https://openalex.org/W2048121649,"A signaling pathway was delineated by which insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) promotes the survival of cerebellar neurons. IGF-1 activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) triggered the activation of two protein kinases, the serine-threonine kinase Akt and the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70(S6K)). Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors, as well as expression of wild-type and dominant-inhibitory forms of Akt, demonstrated that Akt but not p70(S6K) mediates PI3-K-dependent survival. These findings suggest that in the developing nervous system, Akt is a critical mediator of growth factor-induced neuronal survival."
https://openalex.org/W2094068658,"The regulation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt by lipid products of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) was investigated. Akt activity was found to correlate with the amount of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4-P2) in vivo, and synthetic PtdIns-3,4-P2 activated Akt both in vitro and in vivo. Binding of PtdIns-3,4-P2 occurred within the Akt pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and facilitated dimerization of Akt. Akt mutated in the PH domain was not activated by PI 3-kinase in vivo or by PtdIns-3, 4-P2 in vitro, and it was impaired in binding to PtdIns-3,4-P2. Examination of the binding to other phosphoinositides revealed that they bound to the Akt PH domain with much lower affinity than did PtdIns-3,4-P2 and failed to increase Akt activity. Thus, Akt is apparently regulated by the direct interaction of PtdIns-3,4-P2 with the Akt PH domain."

Analyses of sequence tagged site (STS) content and haplotype sharing between families affected with chromosome 1q-linked open angle glaucoma (GLC1A) were used to prioritize candidate genes for mutation screening. A gene encoding a trabecular meshwork protein (TIGR) mapped to the narrowest disease interval by STS content and radiation hybrid mapping. Thirteen glaucoma patients were found to have one of three mutations in this gene (3.9 percent of the population studied). One of these mutations was also found in a control individual (0.2 percent). Identification of these mutations will aid in early diagnosis, which is essential for optimal application of existing therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1984057909,"The N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediates synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS) and is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. In membrane patches excised from mammalian central neurons, the endogenous tyrosine kinase Src was shown to regulate the activity of NMDA channels. The action of Src required a sequence [Src(40–58)] within the noncatalytic, unique domain of Src. In addition, Src coprecipitated with NMDA receptor proteins. Finally, endogenous Src regulated the function of NMDA receptors at synapses. Thus, NMDA receptor regulation by Src may be important in development, plasticity, and pathology in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2041653006,"Lithographically patterned grids of photoresist, aluminum oxide, or gold on oxidized silicon substrates were used to partition supported lipid bilayers into micrometer-scale arrays of isolated fluid membrane corrals. Fluorescently labeled lipids were observed to diffuse freely within each membrane corral but were confined by the micropatterned barriers. The concentrations of fluorescent probe molecules in individual corrals were altered by selective photobleaching to create arrays of fluid membrane patches with differing compositions. Application of an electric field parallel to the surface induced steady-state concentration gradients of charged membrane components in the corrals. In addition to producing patches of membrane with continuously varying composition, these gradients provide an intrinsically parallel means of acquiring information about molecular properties such as the diffusion coefficient in individual corrals."
https://openalex.org/W1986756585,"A single-electron memory, in which a bit of information is stored by one electron, is demonstrated at room temperature. The memory is a floating gate metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor in silicon with a channel width (∼10 nanometers) smaller than the Debye screening length of a single electron and a nanoscale polysilicon dot (∼7 nanometers by 7 nanometers) as the floating gate embedded between the channel and the control gate. Storing one electron on the floating gate screens the entire channel from the potential on the control gate and leads to (i) a discrete shift in the threshold voltage, (ii) a staircase relation between the charging voltage and the shift, and (iii) a self-limiting charging process. The structure and fabrication of the memory should be compatible with future ultralarge-scale integrated circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2020675675,"E-selectin expression by endothelium is crucial for leukocyte recruitment during inflammatory responses. Transcriptional regulation of the E-selectin promoter by tumor necrosis factor ä (TNFä) requires multiple nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) binding sites and a cAMP-responsive element/activating transcription factor-like binding site designated positive domain II (PDII). Here we characterize the role of the stress-activated family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in induced expression of this adhesion molecule. By UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that a heterodimer of transcription factors ATF-2 and c-JUN is constitutively bound to the PDII site. TNFä stimulation of endothelial cells induces transient phosphorylation of both ATF-2 and c-JUN and induces marked activation of the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK1) and p38 but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1). JNK and p38 are constitutively present in the nucleus, and DNA-bound c-JUN and ATF-2 are stably contacted by JNK and p38, respectively. MAP/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), an upstream activator of MAP kinases, increases E-selectin promoter transcription and requires an intact PDII site for maximal induction. MEKK1 can also activate NF-κB -dependent gene expression. The effects of dominant interfering forms of the JNK/p38 signaling pathway demonstrate that activation of these kinases is critical for cytokine-induced E-selectin gene expression. Thus, TNFä activates two signaling pathways, NF-κB and JNK/p38, which are both required for maximal expression of E-selectin. E-selectin expression by endothelium is crucial for leukocyte recruitment during inflammatory responses. Transcriptional regulation of the E-selectin promoter by tumor necrosis factor ä (TNFä) requires multiple nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) binding sites and a cAMP-responsive element/activating transcription factor-like binding site designated positive domain II (PDII).

Thus, TNFä activates two signaling pathways, NF-κB and JNK/p38, which are both required for maximal expression of E-selectin. The recruitment of leukocytes from the circulation into the extravascular space is critical for inflammatory responses and repair of tissue injury. The process of leukocyte emigration involves several steps (reviewed in Refs. 1Carlos T.M. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2068-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). The initial interaction between leukocytes and endothelium appears to be transient, resulting in the rolling of leukocytes along the vessel wall. The rolling leukocytes then become activated by local factors generated by the endothelium, resulting in their arrest and firm adhesion to the vessel wall. Finally, the leukocyte transmigrates the endothelium. These complex processes are regulated in part by specific endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecules. The initial rolling interactions are mediated by the selectins, while firm adhesion and diapedesis appear to be mediated by the interaction of integrins on the surface of leukocytes with immunoglobulin gene superfamily members expressed by endothelial cells. Expression of some of the endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecules is dynamically regulated at sites of leukocyte recruitment. These changes in surface proteins provide the endothelial cell with a mechanism of regulating cell-cell interactions during recruitment of specific types of leukocytes. For example, endothelial expression of E-selectin is dramatically induced at sites of inflammation. The E-selectin gene is transcriptionally silent in quiescent endothelial cells and is rapidly and transiently transcribed when endothelial cells are activated with tumor necrosis factor ä (TNFä) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFätumor necrosis factor-äBAECbovine aortic endothelial cellsHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellJNKc-JUN N-terminal kinase, IκBä, inhibitor κB-äMAPmitogen activated protein kinaseMEKKMAP kinase-kinase-kinase, MKK, MAP kinase-kinaseMKPMAP kinase phosphataseNF-κBnuclear factor-κBPDpositive regulatory domainPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolCRE/ATFcAMP response element/activating transcription factor elementPP2Aprotein phosphatase 2A. or interleukin-1β (3Whelan J.

Transcription of E-selectin peaks in 1-2 h and returns to base-line levels by 12 h post-induction. Previous studies of the E-selectin promoter identified several promoter elements or positive regulatory domains (PDs) necessary for TNFä responsiveness (4Whitley M. Thanos D. Read M. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). DNA binding studies reveal a requirement for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and a small group of other transcriptional activators (reviewed in Ref. 5Collins T. Read M. Neish A. Whitley M. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Three of the elements (PDI, -III, and -IV) contain NF-κB recognition sequences. One of these, PDI, is a consensus NF-κB site and has been shown to bind p50/p65 heterodimers (6Read M. Whitley M. Williams A. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The other two κB elements (PDIII and PDIV) are immediately adjacent to each other, and at least one, and perhaps both, are also occupied by the p50/p65 heterodimer (4Whitley M. Thanos D. Read M. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell.

The fourth required region, PDII, contains an element similar to the cAMP response element/activating transcription factor element (CRE/ATF). The sequence, TGACATCA, varies at one site (underlined) from the consensus CRE/ATF sequence (TGACGTCA) and is identical to a functional site in the c-JUN promoter (9van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R.

Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Previous studies using recombinant proteins have shown that the PDII element can be occupied by a variety of members of the ATF family of transcription factors, including ATF-2, ATF-a, ATF-3, and c-JUN (11Kaszubska W. van Huijsduijnen R.

Although the nature of the ATF family members bound to this element in TNFä-activated endothelial cells is uncertain, ATF-2 appears to be essential for E-selectin expression in that ATF-2 homozygous null mice are defective in E-selectin induction (13Reimold A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W.U. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Collins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition to the transcriptional activators, cytokine-induced E-selectin expression depends upon the chromatin architectural protein, high mobility group protein I(Y) (HMGI(Y)), which binds specifically to several sites in the promoter and potentiates binding of NF-κB to either PDIII or PDIV and binding of ATF-2 to PDII (4Whitley M.

The best-studied signaling pathway involved in TNFä activation of E-selectin gene transcription is the NF-κB/IκBä system (reviewed in Refs. 14Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S.

Constitutively present in all cells, the p50/p65 subunits of NF-κB are held in the cytoplasm by one or more members of a family of inhibitors, including p100, p105, IκBä, and IκBβ. In endothelial cells, TNFä stimulation results in phosphorylation of IκBä, which targets the inhibitor for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (18Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L.

Loss of IκBä results in nuclear translocation of the p50/p65 heterodimer, where it binds its recognition sequences and activates transcription. In contrast to the NF-κB/Rel family of proteins, other classes of transcription factors reside constitutively in the nucleus but require an activation signal. The family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are important mediators of signals transduced from the cell surface to transcription factors in the nucleus (for review see Ref. 21Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Multiple MAP kinases with different substrate specificities are activated by distinct extracellular stimuli. Recent studies revealed two novel subgroups, the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein kinases (also called stress-activated protein kinases) and p38 kinases which are activated in response to TNFä, interleukin-1β, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and UV light (22Sluss H.

Activation of the JNK/p38 protein kinases involves a kinase cascade in which the upstream activator MAP kinase kinase kinase (MEKK) phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase kinase 3, 4, and 6 (MKK 3, 4 and 6), which in turn phosphorylate and activate JNK and p38 MAP kinases (34Derijard B.

To further understand how transcription of the E-selectin gene is induced in response to cytokines, we examined the role of the PDII element and its associated transcriptional activators to act as a signaling target for the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway. Herein we show that c-JUN/ATF-2 heterodimers are the preferred complex bound at the E-selectin PDII site. TNFä stimulation of endothelial cells results in transient enhanced phosphorylation of both c-JUN and ATF-2, and concomitant activation of JNK and p38 kinases. Moreover, an upstream activator of the JNK signaling pathway, MEKK1 (42Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1723-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 43Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), can activate E-selectin as efficiently as TNFä, and activation requires that the PDII element be intact. Overexpression of phosphorylation-defective ATF-2 or kinase-inactive JNK can block TNFä and MEKK1 activation of the E-selectin promoter. Additionally, overexpression of MEKK1 activates κB-dependent reporter gene expression, an effect which is decreased by a dominant negative form of a member of the JNK signaling pathway and by MAP kinase phosphatase. Thus, TNFä and MEKK1 activate at least two signaling pathways, NF-κB/IκBä and JNK/p38 MAP kinases, which converge on the E-selectin promoter and confer maximal cytokine responsiveness to the gene. Human endothelial cells obtained from collagenase-digested umbilical veins (HUVEC) (44Gimbrone M. Spaet T. Progress in Hemostasis and Thrombosis. Vol. 3.

For experimental cytokine induction, confluent monolayers of endothelial cells were exposed to recombinant human TNFä (Genentech, San Francisco, CA) at a final concentration of 100 units/ml in complete media. Following experimental treatment of HUVECs, nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (20Read M. Neish A. Luscinskas F. Palombella V. Maniatis T. Collins T.

(Lake Placid, NY), and JNK antisera was as described (31Raingeaud J.S. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 MAP kinases were expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris using vectors purchased from Invitrogen Corp. JNK1 and p38 MAP kinase expression were induced with methanol using procedures recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). A biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Coralville, IA) spanning the cytokine response region of the E-selectin promoter (-156 to -78) was coupled to Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal, Lake Success, NY) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The E-selectin-coupled matrix (250 μg) was incubated with 25 μl of endothelial nuclear extract in binding buffer (50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 μg/ml poly[dI·;dC], and 5% glycerol) for 20 min at room temperature with mixing every 5 min to keep the Dynabeads in suspension. The non-bound or flow-through fractions were collected, and the Dynabeads with bound extract proteins were washed four times in 1 x binding buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml poly[dI·;dC]. Proteins bound to the Dynabeads were solubilized in 1 x Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with antisera to Sp1, p65, ATF-2, c-JUN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and p50 (provided by Nancy Rice, NCI, Frederick, MD) at dilutions ranging from 1:2500-1:10,000, followed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection as described below. Extracts were prepared from control and TNFä-treated HUVECs in which the media were replaced with media containing 1% fetal calf serum for 1 h prior to stimulation. Cells were solubilized with Triton lysis buffer (TLB, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM pyrophosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. The JNK, p38, or ERK protein kinases were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 1 h at 4°C with specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies bound to Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The rabbit polyclonal JNK and p38 antibodies have been described (31Raingeaud J.S. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar) The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with TLB and twice with kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate). The kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of substrate protein and 50 μM ([γ-32P]ATP) (10 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 22 μl. The reactions were terminated after 15 min at 30°C by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Control experiments demonstrated that the phosphorylation reaction was linear with time for at least 30 min under these conditions. The phosphorylation of the substrate proteins was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. HUVECs (approximately 1.5 x 106) were untreated or treated with TNFä for 15 min, rinsed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested in RIPA lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM DTT, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM each sodium vanadate and sodium fluoride). Both samples were divided equally to three tubes, and 5 μl of ATF-2 rabbit antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was added to each. The samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with rocking and precipitated with 50 μl of Protein A slurry for 4 h, and then washed three times in RIPA buffer. The pellets were then washed an additional two times in phosphatase buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin) to remove the phosphatase inhibitors. The Protein A pellet was resuspended in 50 μl phosphatase buffer, and 10 mM NaF was added to one tube to provide a negative control. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A, 0.5 units; UBI) or calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (1 unit; Boehringer Mannheim) were then added, and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. After incubation the samples were washed once in RIPA buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled, and fractionated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with ATF-2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) as described below. Nuclear extracts from TNFä-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 5% methanol at 100 V for 1 h. ATF-2 and c-JUN rabbit antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used at 1:5,000 dilution. Antiserum specific for the phosphorylated form of c-JUN (Ser63) was obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA) and used at 1:1000 dilution. Polyclonal antisera to MKK3 and MKK4 (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz, CA) were used at 1:1000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected according to the enhanced chemiluminescent protocol (Amersham Corp.) using 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit secondary antiserum. Blots were exposed to film for 1-10 min. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were transfected, harvested, and assayed for reporter proteins as described previously (4Whitley M. Thanos D. Read M. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Relative transfection efficiency was determined by cotransfection with pTK-GH (Promega) (4 μg). For experimental cytokine induction, confluent monolayers of endothelial cells were exposed to recombinant human TNFä (Genentech, San Francisco, CA) at a final concentration of 200 units/ml in complete media. A fragment containing the region -578 to +35 of the E-selectin promoter was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification as described previously (4Whitley M. Thanos D. Read M. Maniatis T.

Magnetic collapse would lead to marked changes in geophysically important properties, such as elasticity and conductivity, and also to different geochemical behavior, such as element partitioning, than estimated by extrapolating low-pressure data, and thus change the understanding of Earth's structure and evolution. Magnetic collapse results from band widening rather than from changes in crystal field splitting under pressure. Seismic anomalies in the outer core and the lowermost mantle may be due to magnetic collapse of ferrous iron, dissolved in iron liquid in the outer core, and in solution in magnesiowustite in the lowermost mantle."

Explanations for extinction have invoked deficits in initial processes that operate before the focusing of visual attention or in later attentive stages of vision. Preattentive vision was preserved in a parietally damaged patient, whose extinction was less severe when bilateral stimuli formed a common surface, even if this required visual filling-in to yield illusory Kanizsa figures or completion of partially occluded figures.

At experimental temperatures the open end of single-walled nanotubes closed spontaneously into a graphitic dome, which may explain why these nanotubes do not grow in the absence of transition metal catalysts. On the other hand, chemical bonding between the edges of adjacent coaxial tubes (“lip-lip” interactions) trapped the end of a double-walled nanotube in a metastable energy minimum, thus preventing dome closure.

ABP-280-deficient cells show an activation of SAPK in response to most stimuli that is comparable to that seen in ABP-280-replete cells; ABP-280-deficient cells, however, fail to show the brisk tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activation of SAPK seen in ABP-replete cells and have an 80% reduction in SAPK activation by lysophosphatidic acid.

Several of these stimuli, e.g. anisomycin and TNF-α, have been shown to also activate SEK-1; however, it is not known whether all of the SAPK agonists activate SEK-1 or recruit SAPK kinases differentially. stress-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase lysophosphatidic acid epidermal growth factor tumor necrosis factor-α actin-binding protein glutathione S-transferase mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid MAP kinase kinase MAP kinase and/or ERK kinase MAP kinase and/or ERK kinase kinase mixed lineage kinase. An interesting question in the operation of these protein kinase cascades is how the signal is conveyed from each receptor and multiple upstream stimuli to the appropriate MEK. A classical view is that the specificity is inherent in the sequential interaction of each element with its upstream and downstream partners, i.e. the MEKK interacts with the MEK, which in turn interacts with the ERK. Stable, relatively high affinity interactions of this kind have been documented (9Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) (e.g. Raf-MEK-1). Recent work, however, has emphasized an important contribution by “targeting” proteins in signal transmission, i.e. noncatalytic polypeptides whose main function is to provide a binding site for one or more catalytic elements, which positions them proximate to their upstream regulators and/or substrates, so as to facilitate or perhaps enable a speedy, localized and productive interaction. Examples include the targeting subunits for protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit and the A kinase binding protein AKAP 79, which appears to bind simultaneously kinase A (through its RII regulatory subunit), the Ca2+-activated protein (Ser/Thr) phosphatase calcineurin and protein kinase C (10Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 11Faux M.D. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More relevant to the ERK-based kinase cascades is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Ste5p, a noncatalytic 90-kDa LIM domain polypeptide that binds the MEKK (Ste11), the MEK (Ste7), and the ERKs (Fus3/KSS1) that constitute the core kinase cassette in the pheromone signal transduction pathway of haploid S. cerevisiae (12Choi K-Y. Satterer B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Each kinase is bound to Ste5p at a different site, concomitantly. Although direct interactions between the kinase/substrate pairs in this cassette also can be demonstrated, both in vitro and by two-hybrid methods, selective ablation of the Ste5 gene abolishes the pheromone response in situ. The kinases Ste11 and Ste7 are necessary for the response of haploid cells to nutrient deprivation (called the “invasive response”) as well as to pheromone, and deletion of either kinase abrogates both responses (13Liu H. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In contrast, abolition of Ste5 has no effect on the response to nutrient deprivation (14Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Thus, the noncatalytic function of Ste5p is indispensable for coupling the pheromone receptor to the kinase cascade but is unnecessary for signal transmission to the same kinases by the upstream elements involved in the invasive response. Although it seems likely that signal transmission in the invasive response employs a protein analogous in function to Ste5, proteins homologous in structure or function to the Ste5p have not been identified in yeast or mammalian systems. Herein we present evidence that the actin binding protein-280 (ABP-280, non-muscle filamin) (15Hartwig J. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 739-746Google Scholar) provides a function analogous to yeast Ste5p (16Elion E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 322-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in at least some mammalian cells by functionally coupling TNF-α and perhaps lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors to the activation of the mammalian SAPK pathway, concomitant with binding selectively the SAPK activator, SEK-1. Two-hybrid expression cloning was carried out as described by Durfee et al. (17Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The SEK-1 cDNA sequence starting at amino acid 40 was inserted into the pAS1-CYH2A plasmid at SalI site downstream of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Human B cell and murine T cell cDNA libraries, inserted downstream of the Gal4 activation domain in the vector pACTII were screened by co-expression in S. cerevisiae strain Y190. The latter contains two reporter genes, HIS3 and LacZ, which allow selection of cDNAs encoding proteins that interact with the product of the gene of interest based on growth and LacZ activity. Yeast transformed by the method of Geitz et al. (18Geitz D. St. Jean A.R.A. Schiestl R.H.

EGF, anisomycin, TNF-α were obtained from Cell Biology Boehringer Mannheim. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B and protein G were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. Anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST), anti-SEK-1, and anti-ERK-1,2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Technologies. Goat anti-TNF receptor 1 antibody was purchased from R&D Systems, Minneapolis.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) catalytic domain (carboxyl-terminal 320 amino acids), and c-Jun (1-135) were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusion protein using the p-GEXkg vector (22Guan K.-L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The free p54β SAPK or MEKK1 polypeptides were obtained after thrombin cleavage. The GST-SEK-1 polypeptide containing a hexahistidine tag at its carboxyl terminus was purified by sequential chromatography glutathione-Sepharose and nickel chelate resin. Binding in vitro of various polypeptides to GST or GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was carried out at 4°C for 2 h in binding buffer containing 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors. The beads were washed in excess binding buffer five times and the retained polypeptides were eluted directly into SDS-containing buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred into a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by immunoblot. The association of polypeptides in situ was assessed during transient expression in COS M7 cells, transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 756Google Scholar). GST was expressed using the vector pEBG(1); GST-SEK was expressed by insertion of the cDNA encoding SEK-1 inframe downstream of the GST coding sequence. The EE-tagged MEKK was expressed using the vector pCMV5, as before (4Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Subfragments derived from ABP carboxyl-terminal 411 amino acid fragment were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction and were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus FLAG vector. All transfections utilized a total of 20 μg of DNA; 48 h after transfections, cells were extracted into a homogenization buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors. Extracts were equalized for protein prior to immunoprecipitation. After addition of antibody (monoclonal antibody anti-ABP-280 or monoclonal antibody for the EE-epitope) incubation was carried out for 2-4 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were harvested with protein G-Sepharose, collected by centrifugation and washed four times with homogenization buffer. Bound protein was released from the particles by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. GST fusion protein were recovered using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Immunoblots were carried our using the ECL method (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturers' directions. Human melanoma cell lines (parental line M2, ABP−, i.e. lacking ABP-280 expression; M2A7, ABP+, stably transfected with full-length ABP-280; or M2 1.5, ABPΔCT109 stably transfected with truncated ABPΔCT109) were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 8% newborn calf serum as described previously (24Cunninghan C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 25Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Confluent melanoma cells were deprived of serum overnight, and treated at 37°C with anisomycin (50 μg/ml, 40 min), EGF (50 ng/ml, 20 min), TNF-α (50 ng/ml, 20 min), LPA (10 μg/ml, 10 min), or serum (20%, 20 min). Cells were rinsed and extracted into homogenization buffer as above; cleared lysates were incubated with antisera for 4 h at 4°C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by adsorption to Sepharose-protein-G; the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with lysis buffer containing 500 mM LiCl, and three washes with kinase reaction buffer (20 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). Aliquots of beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP per reaction and 20 μM of unlabeled ATP. Substrates used were 5 μg of purified GST-c-Jun(1-135) for SAPK (19Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) and 3 μg of myelin basic protein for MAPK and p38 kinase activity. The reactions were terminated after 20 min at 30°C by addition of 10 μl of 5 times concentrated SDS gel sample buffer. One unit of activity represents transfer of 1 pmol of phosphate min−1 from ATP to protein substrate. Seeking proteins that interact with the SEK-1 protein kinase, we used the SEK-1 coding region, starting at amino acid 40, to screen a human B cell cDNA library constructed in the two-hybrid system described by Durfee et al. (17Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Thirteen LacZ+ His+ clones were isolated from 6.6 × 106 transformants; 10 gave very rapid complementation of LacZ+ activity and each encoded isoforms of the SAPKs. Among the remaining cDNA, one encoded polypeptide sequences identical to a carboxyl-terminal segment of actin-binding protein-280 (20Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), starting at amino acid residue 2236 of this 2647-amino acid polypeptide (see Fig. 2A). In a separate screen of a mouse T cell library, a cDNA encoding a carboxyl-terminal fragment of ABP-280 was isolated independently. The specificity of the SEK-1 interaction with ABP-280 was evaluated by examining the ability of other protein kinases to bind to the carboxyl-terminal fragment of ABP-280 in the two-hybrid assay. No evidence of binding of ABP-280 to MKK-3, p54 and p46 SAPK α/β, Raf, or p70 S6 kinase was detected. Weak but definite complementation was observed consistently with MEK-1, MEK-2, and p38 (Table I).Table I.Two hybrid analysis of the interaction between ABP (2236-2647) and various protein (Ser/Thr) kinases.DNA binding domain fusionTransactivation domain fusionABPp54 SAPKαp44 MAPKSEK-1BlueBlueWhiteMEK-1Light blueWhiteBlueMEK-2Light blueWhiteBlueMKK-3WhiteWhiteWhitep54 SAPKαWhiteNDaND, not done.Whitep38Light blueLight blueWhiteRafWhiteNDNDp70 S6WhiteNDNDa ND, not done. Open table in a new tab We attempted to verify the apparent interaction between SEK-1 and the carboxyl-terminal region of ABP-280, and to examine its functional significance. ABP-280 is an abundant cytoplasmic protein that contains an amino-terminal actin binding domain of approximately 275 amino acids, followed by an extended, rodlike structure created by 24 repeats of a segment that is approximately 96 amino acids in length. Each of these segments contains eight short β sheet structures (A to H) interrupted by turns. Sequence insertions of 23 and 35 amino acids, probable hinge regions, precede repeats 16 and 24, respectively. The carboxyl-terminal repeat (number 24) comprises a homodimerization domain (15Hartwig J. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 739-746Google Scholar, 20Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). ABP-280 efficiently cross-links actin filaments into orthogonal arrays. ABP-280 has also been shown to bind to the von Willebrand factor (GPIbα/βIX) (26Andrews R.K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7144-7147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the high affinity Fc (FcγR1) (27Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 225-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) receptors through its carboxyl-terminal rod domain. The selective binding of SEK-1 to ABP-280 as measured by the two-hybrid method was verified by examining the ability of a prokaryotic recombinant GST-SEK to bind in vitro to full-length ABP-280 polypeptide, either in a biochemically pure form, or in cytoplasmic extracts of 293 cells, where ABP-280 is bound to endogenous actin. ABP-280, purified to homogeneity, was incubated with purified immobilized prokaryotic recombinant GST and comparable amounts of GST-SEK, GST-SAPK, and GST-ERK-1 fusion proteins; only GST-SEK bound ABP-280 (Fig. 1A). ABP-280 also bound specifically to GST-MEK-1, although weakly as compared to GST-SEK-1; in the experiment shown in Fig. 1B, GST SEK-1 retained about 90% of the input ABP-280 and GST-MEK-1 approximately 6% (Fig. 1B). GST-SEK-1 also bound ABP-280 endogenous to an extract of HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1C), wherein ABP-280 is bound to actin and perhaps other cytosolic components. Neither GST-ERK-1 nor GST-SAPK bound ABP-280, whether the latter was presented as a purified polypeptide or in an extract of 293 cells (Fig. 1C). Specific binding in situ of recombinant GST-SEK to a carboxyl-terminal fragment of ABP-280 tagged with a FLAG epitope, was demonstrable by co-precipitation after transient expression in COS cells (Fig. 2). Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal 193 amino acid from the 365 amino acid carboxyl-terminal ABP-280 fragment did not impair its association with GST-SEK in situ (Fig. 2B); shorter fragments of ABP-280 were poorly expressed. Thus GST-SEK binds to ABP-280 between amino acids 2282 and 2454 (repeat 21 to 23C); by comparison, the von Willebrand factor receptor binds to a fragment of ABP-280 containing repeats 16-23. Whereas the von Willebrand factor receptor appears to bind constitutively to ABP-280, ligand engagement of the FcγR1 results in its dissociation from ABP-280 (27Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 225-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of SEK activation on the association of SEK with ABP-280. MEKK-1 directly phosphorylates and activates SEK-1 in vitro; when overexpressed in situ, MEKK-1 activates SEK-1 and produces a marked and preferential activation of SAPK (3Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 4Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 5Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Vectors encoding GST-SEK or GST were cotransfected in COS cells with an EE epitope-tagged, constitutively active MEKK-1 carboxyl-terminal catalytic fragment. Purification of cell extracts on GSH-Sepharose yielded ABP-280 from cells expressing GST-SEK-1, but not GST (Fig. 3A). Despite substantial overall activation of GST-SEK (not shown), coexpression of MEKK-1 with GST-SEK did not alter the amount of ABP-280 polypeptide associated with GST-SEK-1 (Fig. 3A). The SAPK kinase activity of an ABP-280 immunoprecipitate prepared from extracts of cells expressing GST-SEK was greatly increased by coexpression of MEKK with GST-SEK (Fig. 3B). Thus MEKK-1 activates the SAPK kinase activity bound to ABP-280 (Fig. 3B) without altering the amount of associated GST-SEK-1 protein (Fig. 3A). The MEKK catalytic fragment does not associate directly with ABP-280 but can form a ternary complex with SEK and ABP-280. Thus, a catalytically active prokaryotic GST-MEKK-1 fusion protein does not bind pure ABP-280 in vitro (Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, immobilized GST-SEK-1, bound to an essentially stoichiometric amount of prokaryotic recombinant MEKK-1, still binds ABP-280 as efficiently as in the absence of MEKK-1 (Fig. 3D). Moreover, immunoprecipitates of the EE-tagged MEKK-1 catalytic fragment, expressed (singly) in COS cells, are enriched in endogenous ABP-280 as well as endogenous SEK (Fig. 3B). Thus it is likely that the MEKK-1 catalytic fragment is able to bind to, and activate, SEK-1 while the latter is bound to ABP-280, without displacement of the activated SEK-1 from ABP-280 (e.g. see Fig. 3). By contrast, SAPK immunoreactivity was not detected in association with ABP-280 (not shown). Finally, immunoprecipitation of ABP-280 from 293 cells results in the specific coprecipitation of a portion of the immunoreactive SEK-1 endogenous to these cells; activation of SEK-1 by treatment of the cells with anisomycin, prior to harvest, does not alter the amount of endogenous SEK-1 polypeptide recovered with ABP-280 (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous SEK-1 with ABP-280 from 293 cell extracts. 293 cells were treated with anisomycin (lane 2) or carrier (lanes 1 and 3). Extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” normalized for protein content, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti ABP-280 (lanes 2 and 3) or anti-Flag (control, lane 1) monoclonal antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with anti SEK-1 antibody (lower panel). A Coomassie Blue stain of a portion of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane is shown in the upperpanel. *IgG (heavy chain).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next attempted to evaluate the biologic significance of the ABP-280/SEK association. The SAPK cascade might regulate the functions of ABP-280 through phosphorylation of ABP-280 itself or of one or more of the proteins to which it is bound or closely apposed. Although ABP-280 can be phosphorylated in vitro by numerous protein kinases (18Geitz D. St. Jean A.R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar), neither SEK (Fig. 5, lane 6) nor SAPK (Fig. 5, lane 5) phosphorylate ABP-280 in vitro under conditions wherein ABP-280 is well phosphorylated by kinase A (Fig. 5, lane 7). Nevertheless, it remains possible that as yet unidentified kinases downstream of SEK-1 other than SAPKs are responsible for a portion of ABP-280 phosphorylation in situ. Another possibility is that ABP-280, rather than serving as a substrate or positioning SEK near its substrates, is involved in the upstream regulation of the SAPK pathway. Overexpression of the ABP-280 carboxyl-terminal 365 amino acid fragment does not abrogate activation of a cotransfected SAPK reporter induced by MEKK-1 or V12 Rac, or by treatment of cells with EGF, TNF-α, or LPA (not shown). This negative result, however, is tempered by the knowledge that multiple, perhaps redundant, SAPK activators in addition to SEK-1 have been demonstrated in other systems (7Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); their expression in COS cells and the ability of ABP-280 to bind these elements is unknown. Another approach to the role of ABP-280 in SEK-1 function is enabled by the availability of human melanoma cell lines that have spontaneously lost expression of ABP-280 (24Cunninghan C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 25Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These cells show prolonged membrane blebbing after plating, poor spreading in cell culture, and a deficit in directed cell movement. Stable expression of recombinant ABP-280 in these cells such that the ratio of ABP-280 to endogenous actin (1:160) is comparable to that found in motile cells, such as macrophages, corrects these defects (24Cunninghan C.C.

Optical absorption and EPR spectroscopies indicate that KatG is similar to a growing class of bacterial catalase-peroxidases. Optical and EPR spectra of KatG in the presence of either a strong field or weak field ligand suggest that, like horseradish peroxidase and metmyoglobin, KatG is likely to have a histidine as a proximal ligand. The wild-type enzyme functions as a highly active catalase as well as a broad specificity peroxidase.

The reduced tripeptide was quantitatively recovered in the culture medium of the cells. Since the GSH loss in infected cells was not blocked by methionine, a known inhibitor of hepatocyte GSH transport, a nonspecific leakage through the plasma membrane is proposed. UV-irradiated Sendai virus gave the same results, confirming that the major loss of GSH was due to membrane perturbation upon virus fusion. Consequent to the loss of the tripeptide, an intracellular pH decrease occurred, which was due to a reversible impairment of the Na+/H+ antiporter, the main system responsible for maintaining unaltered pHi in those cells. At the end of the infection period, a rise in both pHi value and GSH content was observed, with a complete recovery in the activity of the antiporter. However, a secondary set up of oxidative stress was observed after 24 h from infection, which is the time necessary for virus budding from cells. In this case, the GSH decrease was partly due to preferential incorporation of the cysteine residue in the viral proteins and partly engaged in mixed disulfides with intracellular proteins. In conclusion, under our conditions of viral infection, oxidative stress is imposed by GSH depletion, occurring in two steps and following direct virus challenge of the cell membrane without the intervention of reactive oxygen species.

An experimental system was devised to address this issue in vivo-mice expressing neopeptides in thymic stromal cells after adenovirus-mediated delivery of invariant chain-peptide fusion proteins. In this system, selection of T cells capable of responding to a given antigenic peptide could be promoted by the peptide itself, by closely related analogs lacking agonist and antagonist activity, or by ostensibly unrelated peptides. However, the precise repertoire of T cells selected was dictated by the particular neopeptide expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2002468770,"Excitation-secretion uncoupling peptides (ESUPs) are inhibitors of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in neural and endocrine cells. Their mechanism of action, however, remains elusive. We report that ESUP-A, a 20-mer peptide patterned after the C terminus of SNAP-25 (synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa) and containing the cleavage sequence for botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT A), abrogates the slow, ATP-dependent component of the exocytotic pathway, without affecting the fast, ATP-independent, Ca2+-mediated fusion event. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that ESUP-A induces a drastic accumulation of dense-core vesicles near the plasma membrane, mimicking the effect of BoNT A. Together, these findings argue in favor of the notion that ESUP-A inhibits ATP-primed exocytosis by blocking vesicle docking. Identification of blocking peptides which mimic sequences that bind to complementary partner domains on interacting proteins of the exocytotic machinery provides new pharmacological tools to dissect the molecular and mechanistic details of neurosecretion. Our findings may assist in developing ESUPs as substitute drugs to BoNTs for the treatment of spasmodic disorders.

https://openalex.org/W1977894125,"Saturn's giant moon Titan has a thick (1.5 bar) nitrogen atmosphere, which has a temperature structure that is controlled by the absorption of solar and thermal radiation by methane, hydrogen, and organic aerosols into which methane is irreversibly converted by photolysis. Previous studies of Titan's climate evolution have been done with the assumption that the methane abundance was maintained against photolytic depletion throughout Titan's history, either by continuous supply from the interior or by buffering by a surface or near surface reservoir. Radiative-convective and radiative-saturated equilibrium models of Titan's atmosphere show that methane depletion may have allowed Titan's atmosphere to cool so that nitrogen, its main constituent, condenses onto the surface, collapsing Titan into a Triton-like frozen state with a thin atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2015333209,"We have previously found that theSignal transducer and activator of Transcription (Stat) 3 is constitutively activated in cells stably transformed by the v-Src oncoprotein. While activation of Stat proteins has also been observed following epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor stimulation, Stat3 activation is more commonly associated with signaling through cytokine receptors and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 or JAK2. We therefore investigated whether JAK1 or JAK2 were activated in Src-transformed cells. In three v-Src-transformed fibroblast cell lines (NIH3T3, Balb/c, and 3Y1), JAK1 displayed increased tyrosyl phosphorylation compared to non-transformed cells. The level of tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK1 was significantly greater in NIH3T3 cells transformed by expression of v-Src or high levels of a constitutively active mutant of c-Src (Y527F) than in cells overexpressing the less transforming normal c-Src. Enzymatic activity of JAK1 was assessed using autophosphorylation assays. In anti-JAK1 immunoprecipitates from v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells, a protein with the same migration as JAK1 showed substantially increased levels of 32P incorporation compared to immunoprecipitates from non-transformed cells. Similar results were obtained using anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates; however, the level of JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and 32P incorporation in anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates were markedly lower than in anti-JAK1 immunoprecipitates. We conclude that JAK1, and possibly JAK2, are constitutively activated in Src-transformed cells, raising the possibility that Janus family kinases contribute to the constitutive activation of Stat3 previously observed in these cells and/or other properties of Src-transformed cells.

Internalization of both Δ and μ ligands occurred from a single large cap at one pole of the cell, indicating that polymerization of ligand-receptor complexes preceeded internalization.

Organisms respond to a variety of chemical and physiological stresses by rapidly synthesizing a group of conserved polypeptides known as heat shock or stress proteins. The induction of these stress proteins is a defense against proteotoxicity, a term used to describe damage to proteins caused by diverse stressors (1Hightower L.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to their function in stressed cells, some members of these stress protein families are normally abundant in nonstressed cells, such as the constitutively expressed 70-kilodalton (kDa) heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70). 1The abbreviations used are: Hsc7070-kDa heat shock cognate proteinNDPnucleoside diphosphatePcpigeon cytochrome c peptideCMF-PBScalcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisapo capocytochrome cTLCthin layer chromatography.

For example, the accessory proteins DnaJ and GrpE cooperate with DnaK in Escherichia coli in the replication of λ phage (33Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopolous C.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). These two accessory proteins have different actions on DnaK. DnaJ can present certain substrates to DnaK and stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK while GrpE seems to act as a nucleotide exchange factor (34Wickner S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. Mckenney K. Proc.

Hoogenraad N.J. Hoj P.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a family of DnaJ homologs has been discovered based on the similarity of their N-terminal J-domains (1-70 amino acid residues; see Ref. 44Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, their limited sequence similarity besides the J-domain suggests that the function of each DnaJ homolog may have become specialized (45Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For example, in yeast, the cytosolic DnaJ homolog Sis1 binds to Hsc70 during translation while Ydj1, another DnaJ homolog, is thought to target Hsc70 bound substrates to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticula (46Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 47Atencio D. Yaffe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Ydj1 cannot rescue Sis1 deletion phenotypes, suggesting that Sis1 has a more specialized function (48Luke M.M. Sutton A. Arndt K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition to DnaJ and GrpE homologs, there appear to be a number of other cofactors that are involved in specific Hsc70 chaperone functions. For example, a 100-kDa protein, auxilin, is required for Hsc70 to uncoat clathrin-coated vesicles (49Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L. Eisenberg E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 95aGoogle Scholar, 50Prasad K. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23758-23761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Prasad K. Barouch W. Greene L.

Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) isolated a 41-kDa Hsc70-interacting protein, Hip, using the yeast two-hybrid system. Hip may modulate the interaction of Hsc70 with different substrates through the stabilization of the ADP-bound state of Hsc70. In further support of the hypothesis that multiple accessory proteins are required for diverse chaperoning functions of Hsc70, we report here the isolation of a new cytosolic accessory protein for eukaryotic Hsc70. This 16-kDa protein (p16) monomerizes Hsc70 and dissociates Hsc70 from peptide substrate; it is a member of Nm23/nucleoside diphosphate kinase family. Poeciliopsis lucida hepatocellular carcinoma (PLHC-1) cells were isolated from a 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced hepatocellular carcinoma of a desert topminnow P. lucida (53Schultz M.E.

PLHC-1 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.2, supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum (J. R. H. BioSci) and 4 mM L-glutamine in a 30°C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. No antibiotics were used. Cultures were mycoplasma-free, as determined using a DNA fluorochrome-staining technique (55Chen T.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 104: 255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 cells, ATCC HB 8065) were grown in CO2-independent medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) at 37°C. Confluent PLHC-1 cells or HepG2 cells were dissociated with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA in calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS), and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 100 × g for 5 min. Harvested cells were washed once in serum-containing medium to inactivate the trypsin and then three times in CMF-PBS. Then the cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. Usually four 225-cm2 confluent PLHC-1 cultures yielded 1 g of cells. Bovine Hsc70 was purified according to Sadis and Hightower (56Sadis S. Raghavendra K. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). p16 was purified by lysing PLHC-1 cells in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (11 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton N-101, 150 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min. Then the cell lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 70,000 × g for 1.5 h and dialyzed overnight against 40-50 volumes of buffer C (20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 25 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol) without magnesium acetate. After dialysis, the cell lysate was adjusted to 2 mM magnesium acetate and subjected to ATP-agarose chromatography (linked through C-8, Sigma). The ATP-agarose was washed with 0.5 M KCl to remove nonspecific binding proteins, and then the bound proteins were eluted with 1 bed volume of 1 mM ATP (to remove the majority of actin) followed by 3 bed volumes of 5 mM ATP. The pH of the ATP stock solution was adjusted to 7.0 using KOH. p16 enriched fractions, identified by 11.5% SDS-PAGE and silver staining (56Sadis S. Raghavendra K. Hightower L.E.

The column was washed with 5 ml of 0.05 M KCl in buffer A, and then the bound proteins were fractionated with a 30-ml linear gradient of 0.05-0.15 M KCl in buffer A. p16-enriched fractions were dialyzed overnight against buffer C and then concentrated to 1 mg/ml with a Centricon 3 ultrafiltration unit (Amicon, Danvers, MA). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Approximately 600 μg of p16 were obtained from 20 g of a PLHC-1 cell pellet. The purified protein was stored at −70°C in 10% glycerol. Assays were assembled on ice in a final volume of 10 μl using 2 μg of bovine Hsc70 or 0.5 μg of p16 in buffer C. Incubations were carried out at 37°C at the indicated times. For p16 and Hsc70 interactions, Hsc70 was incubated with or without p16 for 30 min (p16 by itself as control). For p16, Hsc70, and peptide interactions, either 35 μM of pigeon cytochrome c peptide (Pc, residues 81-104, IFAGIKKKAERADLIAYLKQATAK) or 10 μM of FYQLALT (the minimal peptide concentrations necessary to completely shift 2 μg of Hsc70 in a nondenaturing gel) was used to form Hsc70·;peptide complexes for 30 min, and then the complexes were incubated in the presence or absence of p16 for another 30 min (p16 with Hsc70, Pc, or FYQLALT as control). The effect of ATP or NDP kinase purified from bovine liver (Sigma N2635) on the Hsc70·;Pc complex was assayed as described above by replacing p16 with either 1 mM ATP or 0.5 μg of NDP kinase (Hsc70 or NDP kinase by itself as control). After incubation, all the samples were immediately placed on ice. Then gel loading buffer was added to the samples to give a final concentration of 50 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol. Half of the protein sample from each assay was analyzed in a 6% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.16% (w/v) bisacrylamide mini-slab gel (nondenaturing gel) that was subjected to electrophoresis for 1.5 h at constant voltage (200 V) in 50 mM Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, at 4°C. Compared to a commonly used basic nondenaturing gel method (31Takenaka I.M. Leung S.-M. McAndrew S.J. Brown J.P. Hightower L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19839-19844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), this neutral nondenaturing gel method not only gives a better separation of Hsc70 and p16, but also allows proteins to be analyzed under conditions closer to their physiological pH. The gels were then fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid and silver stained. 1 μg of p16 was added to 2.5 μg of Hsc70, and its intrinsic and apocytochrome c (apo c, 200 μg/ml)-stimulated ATPase activity was determined by measuring the release of radioactive inorganic phosphate (32Pi) from [γ-32P]ATP (57Sadis S. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9406-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Purified p16 was cleaved by endoproteinase-Arg-C to generate peptide fragments for internal amino acid sequencing. Two of the HPLC-purified peptide fragments were sequenced (Protein Structural Laboratory, University of California at Davis). The resulting sequences were used to search for similarity in the GenBank and SwissProt data bases. NDP kinase activity of purified p16 was determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC) as follows. 1 μg of purified p16 was incubated with 1.8 mM ATP and 1.8 mM GDP in buffer C at 30°C for 5 min either in the presence or absence of 75 mM EDTA. An aliquot from each reaction was spotted onto a 20 × 20 cm polyethyleneimine-cellulose-F TLC plate (Sigma), and the nucleotides were resolved by capillary action in a saturated tank of 0.75 M KH2PO4, pH 3.6. The TLC plate was then air dried, and the nucleotides were visualized under ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 254 nm. Protein samples were analyzed in 11.5% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then dried overnight to maximize protein binding. Nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked using 5% FBS, 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at 37°C, and then the membrane was incubated with primary antibody. An affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human NDP kinase-A (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) was used to identify p16. Hsc70 and Hsp70 were detected by using a monoclonal antibody (clone 3a3) raised against human Hsp70 (Affinity BioReagents, Neshantic Station, NJ). Antibody binding was visualized by a colorimetric method using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium as the substrate. The color development was stopped by adding 20 mM EDTA. All procedures were performed at 4°C. PLHC-1 cells, HepG2 cells, or P. lucida liver tissue were resuspended in 3 volumes of cold hypotonic buffer (1.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per gram of cell/tissue for 10 min. PLHC-1 and HepG2 cells were lysed by passing them through a 27 gauge needle 15-16 times. P. lucida liver tissue was homogenized by a hand-operated glass homogenizer. Cell lysis was monitored using the vital stain trypan blue (0.05% (w/v) in CMF-PBS). The cell lysate was then clarified three times by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min in a microcentrifuge, and the final supernatant was adjusted to the concentration of buffer C. To facilitate the formation of the immune complex, magnesium acetate was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. To prevent nonspecific binding, buffer C containing 1% (w/v) ovalbumin was used to coat the tubes and to swell the protein A-sepharose CL-4B (Sigma). All incubations for immunoprecipitation were performed in a rotatory shaker to facilitate mixing. An affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes a different protein (transforming growth factor-β, R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was used as a positive control. Cell lysate (0.5-1 ml) was incubated with anti-NDP kinase-A antibody or control antibody for 2 h, and then protein A-sepharose was added and incubation continued for another 45 min. The captured immune complex was then recovered by centrifugation at 200 × g for 1 min and washed 4 times with buffer C containing 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin and once with buffer C containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. After adding 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min, the immune complex was separated from the Protein A-sepharose by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5-10 s in a microcentrifuge. An aliquot from the supernatant was analyzed by 11.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The blot was then cut in half, and the presence of Hsc70 in the top half and p16 in the bottom half were detected by 3a3 and anti-NDP kinase-A antibodies, respectively. Confluent PLHC-1 cells were exposed to 0, 0.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg/liter heavy metal cadmium ions (CdCl2) for 72 h to maximize protein accumulation, and then the cells were solubilized in 200 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Actin was used as an internal control for equal amounts of protein loading on SDS-PAGE. The changes in Hsc70 and Hsp70 combined (Hsp70s) and p16 protein levels were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using 3a3 and anti-NDP kinase-A antibody, respectively. Our initial goal was to isolate Hsc70 from PLHC-1 cells using conventional chromatography. However, a 16-kDa protein, as determined by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (data not shown), co-purified with Hsc70 using three different types of chromatography, ATP-agarose, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1). p16 and actin (identified by molecular mass and binding to DNA-Sepharose) were co-eluted with Hsc70 from the ATP-agarose column (Fig. 1A) using 5 mM ATP.

Because of the differences in their polypeptide molecular weights, we attempted to separate Hsc70 and p16 using Superose-12 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1C). Fractions 11-12 represented the protein peak of Hsc70 monomer, determined using molecular weight standards. Interestingly, p16 (fractions 12-14) still partially overlapped with Hsc70 monomer. Because this small protein co-purified with Hsc70, we decided to investigate the possibility that p16 is an Hsc70-associated protein. To purify p16, a narrow salt gradient (0.05-0.15 M KCl) was used to separate a portion of p16 from Hsc70 in the Mono Q column. These fractions containing only p16 were used for assays. If the co-purification of p16 and Hsc70 is not a coincidence, then p16 could either be an accessory protein or protein substrate of Hsc70. Since protein substrates form complexes with Hsc70 and stimulate Hsc70 intrinsic ATPase activity and since accessory proteins, such as DnaJ and GrpE, modulate Hsc70 peptide/protein substrate binding and ATPase activity, functional assays were used to address whether p16 can affect 1) nondenaturing gel mobility, 2) peptide substrate binding, and 3) ATPase activity of Hsc70. In the presence of p16, the relative amount of Hsc70 dimers and trimers decreased and the amount of Hsc70 monomer increased (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric Hsc70 protein bands in nondenaturing gel were estimated to be 70-, 140-, and 210-kDa proteins, respectively, using Superose-12 gel filtration (data not shown). In addition, the p16 protein band was more intensely stained by silver after incubation with Hsc70 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). There are two possible explanations for this effect. First, p16 may exist as high molecular weight oligomers that cannot migrate into the gel. In the presence of Hsc70, these oligomers may break down allowing more p16 to migrate into the gel. Second, p16 may undergo a conformational change in the presence of Hsc70 resulting in more intense silver staining. Next we used synthetic peptides to investigate whether p16 can affect Hsc70-substrate interaction. Both Pc and FYQLALT (30Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol.

These features are indicative of carrier-mediated transport and suggest that a P. falciparum-encoded protein facilitates chloroquine import. Although both chloroquine-resistant and susceptible parasite isolates exhibit facilitated chloroquine uptake, the kinetics differ. Chloroquine-resistant parasite isolates consistently have an import mechanism with a lower transport activity and a reduced affinity for chloroquine. These differences in uptake kinetics are linked with chloroquine resistance in a genetic cross. These data suggest that changes in chloroquine import kinetics constitute a minimal and necessary event in the generation of the resistant phenotype. Competitive inhibition of chloroquine uptake by amiloride derivatives further suggests that chloroquine import is mediated by a plasmodial Na+/H+ exchanger.

The emergence and spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains has turned hopes of radical malaria control into despair. When the affordable antimalarial drug chloroquine lost its efficacy, malaria resurged in many developing nations. Chloroquine acts against the intraerythrocytic P. falciparum stages that are responsible for the clinical manifestation of the disease. These stages feed on the erythrocyte's hemoglobin, which is digested in acidic vacuoles (lysosomes). The toxic by-product heme is polymerized into non-toxic hemozoin. In vitro experiments demonstrated that chloroquine at millimolar concentrations inhibits heme polymerization in extracts prepared from both chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) 1The abbreviations used are: CQSchloroquine-sensitiveCQRchloroquine-resistantmdrmulti-drug resistanceEIPA5-(N-ethylN-isopropyl)amiloride. and chloroquine-resistant (CQR) parasite isolates (1Slater A.F.G.

In vivo, however, inhibitive levels of chloroquine are only achieved in the vacuoles of CQS parasite isolates, whereas CQR parasite isolates accumulate significantly less chloroquine (3Fitch C.D.

The reduced accumulation of chloroquine is thought to provide the basis of resistance, suggesting that CQR parasite isolates lower their lysosomal chloroquine concentration below that necessary to inhibit heme polymerization. chloroquine-sensitive chloroquine-resistant multi-drug resistance 5-(N-ethylN-isopropyl)amiloride. Two alternative models have been formulated to attempt to explain the differences in chloroquine accumulation. The first model is based on the observations that the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil reverses chloroquine resistance by preventing chloroquine efflux from resistant cells (6Martin S.K. Oduola A.M.J. Milhous W.K. Science. 1987; 235: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 7Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Kyle D.E. Oduola A.M.J. Martin S.K. Milhous W.K. Schlesinger P.H. Science. 1987; 238: 1283-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). This is phenotypically reminiscent of multi-drug resistance (mdr) in cancer cells, in which an overexpressed P-glycoprotein functions as an ATP-dependent pump, expelling a wide range of anticancer drugs (8Cornwell M.M.

It has been suggested that CQR parasites have acquired a chloroquine efflux mechanism by mutating or amplifying mdr-like genes (10Wilson C.M. Serrano A.E. Wasley A. Bogenschutz M.P. Shankar A.H. Wirth D.F. Science. 1989; 244: 1184-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 11Foote S.J. Thompson J.K. Cowman A.F. Kemp D.J.

Nature. 1990; 345: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). However, no linkage between the chloroquine-resistant phenotype and known P. falciparum mdr genes was found in a genetic cross (13Wellems T.E. Paton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. Rosario do V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The second model proposes that CQR parasite isolates have a weakened vacuolar proton pump (14Ginsburg H. Stein W.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Chloroquine, which is acidotropic due to its chemical properties as a diprotic weak base, would not accumulate as efficiently in the vacuoles of resistant parasite isolates. This so called weak base hypothesis is contradicted by the absence of detectable pH differences in the vacuoles of CQR and CQS parasite isolates (15Krogstad D.J. Schlesinger P.H. Gluzman I.Y. J. Cell. Bio. 1985; 101: 2302-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Herwaldt B.L. Schlesinger P.H. Wellems T.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both of these models rely on the assumption that chloroquine only enters the parasite by simple diffusion and do not consider the possibility of a chloroquine import mechanism. While several studies have speculated on the existence of such a chloroquine concentrating mechanism (16Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Herwaldt B.L. Schlesinger P.H. Wellems T.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Ferrari V. Cutler D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: S167-S179Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Bray P.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22393-22398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), conclusive experimental evidence in support of this proposition has yet to be presented. Investigating the mode of chloroquine uptake is of fundamental importance in understanding the mechanism of chloroquine resistance. If a parasite-encoded transporter mediates chloroquine uptake, then loss or reduction of this function would account for differences in chloroquine accumulation. We have examined the mechanism of chloroquine uptake by P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and found that this process is carrier-mediated. Furthermore, changes in chloroquine uptake kinetics segregate with the chloroquine-resistant phenotype in a genetic cross. Competitive inhibition studies with amiloride derivatives suggest that chloroquine import is mediated by a P. falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger. [3H]Chloroquine diphosphate (18.8 Ci/mmol) and NCS-II tissue solubilizer were supplied by Amersham International and [methoxy-3H]inulin (305 mCi/g) by DuPont NEN. Chloroquine, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride and amiloride were purchased from Sigma. EIPA (5-(N-eythyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride) was a gift from Dr. H. J. Lang, Hoechst AG. The P. falciparum clones HB3, Dd2, and the progeny from the HB3xDd2 cross were cultured as described (20Traeger W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6254) Google Scholar) and synchronized using the sorbitol method (21Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P.J. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar). The hematocrit and parasitemia were accurately determined using a Neubauer counting chamber and microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears, respectively. In all experiments, parasite cultures at a 5% hematocrit containing 4% trophozoites were used. The kinetic studies on chloroquine uptake by P. falciparum were conducted using a modification of a previously described transport assay (22Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 138: 709-715Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Synchronized parasite cultures containing 4% trophozoites were collected and washed twice in reaction buffer (25 mM Na-HEPES, 122.5 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 5.5 mM glucose, pH 7.3). Cells were resuspended in reaction buffer at a concentration of 2.7 × 108 erythrocytes/ml and aliquoted into 200-μl samples. [3H]Chloroquine was added at the appropriate concentrations and the samples were incubated at 37°C. After 5 min duplicative 75-μl aliquots were removed from each sample and diluted with an equal volume of ice-cold reaction buffer containing an 100-fold excess of nonradioactive chloroquine. These aliquots were immediately spun through a layer of melting point bath oil (15,000 × g, 5 s) to separate the cells from the aqueous medium, which contained the unincorporated [3H]chloroquine. The aqueous phase was removed from each sample and its radioactivity was determined to obtain an accurate measurement of the [3H]chloroquine concentration in each reaction. The cell pellets were recovered by cutting the reaction tubes through the melting point bath oil layer (16Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Herwaldt B.L. Schlesinger P.H. Wellems T.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The tips of the tubes containing the cell pellets were placed in a larger 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and incubated with 50 μl of ethanol and 25 μl of tissue solubilizer overnight at 55°C. The lysates were decolorized by the addition of 25 μl of 30% H2O2 and acidified by the addition of 25 μl of 1 N HCl. The lysates were transferred to scintillation vials and the radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (TRI-CARB 2100 TR, Packard). Each experiment was repeated on ice (4°C) to determine the extent of the nonspecific interaction with [3H]chloroquine. Typically this value was 0-10% of that measured at 37°C. This value was subtracted from that obtained at 37°C. The intercellular space of the pellets was determined using [methoxy-3H]inulin, as described (23Kirk K. Horner H.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Chloroquine uptake was calculated as femtomoles of [3H]chloroquine incorporation per 1 × 106 trophozoites/min (fmol/1 × 106 parasites/min), using the formulas developed for the analysis of transport kinetics (22Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 138: 709-715Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, [Sm] = concentration of chloroquine in the reaction medium (nM) = (cpm/ml of chloroquine in the aqueous medium)/(specific activity of [3H]chloroquine expressed as cpm/pmol). St = amount of chloroquine in the cell pellet expressed in fmol/2 × 107 erythrocytes = (total soluble radioactivity associated with the pellet, expressed as cpm/2 × 107 erythrocytes)/(specific activity of [3H]chloroquine, expressed as cpm/fmol). Vo = intracellular space of the pellet (μl/2 × 107 erythrocytes) = (cpm/2 × 107 erythrocytes in the pellet for inulin)/(cpm/μl of aqueous medium for inulin). So = chloroquine which is outside cells in pellet (fmol/2 × 107 erythrocytes) = Vo (μl/2 × 107 erythrocytes) × [Sm](fmol/μl). Si = chloroquine inside cells in the pellet (fmol/2 × 107 erythrocytes)= St− So. The Si values were normalized to 1 × 106 parasites based on the hematocrit and the parasitemia. Apparent Km and Jmax values were calculated using computerized least squares fit methods (Sigma Plot, Jandel Corp.). Dd2 and HB3 cell suspensions containing 2.7 × 108 erythrocytes per milliliter with a parasitemia of 4% trophozoites were prepared as described above and incubated at 37°C in reaction buffer containing 50 nM [3H]chloroquine. Duplicative aliquots were withdrawn at the time points indicated and processed as described above. HB3 and Dd2 cell suspensions were prepared as described above, and resuspended in reaction buffer containing 50 nM [3H]chloroquine. Aliquots were incubated at different temperatures. The pH of the reaction buffer at different temperatures was maintained at 7.3 using 1 N NaOH. From each sample duplicative aliquots were withdrawn after 5 min and analyzed as described above. Uninfected erythrocytes were analyzed accordingly. [3H]Chloroquine incorporation was calculated as femtomoles per 2 × 107 erythrocytes/min to compare infected with uninfected erythrocytes. HB3 and Dd2 cell suspensions were prepared as described above. Reaction tubes were preloaded with 50 nM [3H]chloroquine and the appropriate concentrations of nonradioactive chloroquine or EIPA, respectively. Reactions were started by the addition of the cell suspension. Duplicative aliquots were removed from each sample after an incubation of 5 min at 37°C and analyzed as described above. Uninfected erythrocytes were analyzed accordingly. For competitive inhibition studies, reaction tubes were preloaded with the appropriate concentrations of [3H]chloroquine and EIPA before the cell suspensions were added. HB3 and Dd2 cell suspensions (see above) were incubated in reaction buffer containing 50 nM [3H]chloroquine and 25 nM to 50 μM nonradioactive chloroquine in a final volume of 200 μl at 4°C. After 30 min duplicative aliquots were removed from each sample and processed as described above. The radioactivity in each sample was determined and corrected for nonspecific binding of chloroquine, which was obtained in the presence of 50 μM nonradioactive chloroquine. These values were divided by the specific activity of chloroquine in each reaction (cpm/fmol). The resulting values correspond to the amount of specifically bound chloroquine, which was expressed as femtomoles/1 × 106 parasites. The kinetics of chloroquine uptake was investigated to determine if chloroquine enters P. falciparum by carrier-mediated transport or simple diffusion. Both processes are readily distinguishable, as, in contrast to simple diffusion, carrier-mediated transport would be temperature-dependent and saturable. Two P. falciparum clones were investigated: Dd2, a CQR parasite from Indochina (IC50 = 124 nM) (13Wellems T.E. Paton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. Rosario do V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar); and HB3, a fully chloroquine susceptible clone from Honduras (IC50 = 15 nM) (13Wellems T.E. Paton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. Rosario do V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Uninfected erythrocytes were examined in parallel. All kinetic measurements were conducted with synchronized parasite cultures, containing trophozoites at a parasitemia of 4%. Chloroquine uptake was monitored using a [3H]chloroquine concentration of 50 nM, which inhibits growth of HB3 but not Dd2. Under these conditions, the time course of chloroquine incorporation differs profoundly between the two parasite clones investigated (Fig. 1). In the CQS parasite clone HB3, the amount of internalized chloroquine increased with time until reaching saturation after 30 min. By contrast, the CQR parasite clone Dd2 indicated a complex biphasic relationship between [3H]chloroquine incorporation and time. After an initial uptake phase of about 15 min, a temporal decline in the internalized chloroquine was observed, consistent with the previously described efflux mechanism (7Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Kyle D.E. Oduola A.M.J. Martin S.K. Milhous W.K. Schlesinger P.H. Science. 1987; 238: 1283-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 13Wellems T.E. Paton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. Rosario do V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To obtain reliable and accurate kinetic data on chloroquine uptake, all the following studies were conducted in the initial linear phase, i.e. reactions were terminated after 5 min. We then determined whether or not chloroquine uptake is temperature-dependent. To ensure an equal number of parasites in each experiment, synchronized cultures of both HB3 and Dd2 were aliquoted and the uptake of [3H]chloroquine was monitored in both parasite clones at different temperatures. Chloroquine uptake revealed a profound temperature dependence in HB3, with an optimum at 40°C (Fig. 2). A similar temperature dependence was observed for Dd2, although less chloroquine was taken up (Fig. 2). These data provide the first experimental evidence for a transport mechanism responsible for chloroquine uptake in P. falciparum. To confirm this conclusion, it was tested if the chloroquine uptake is saturable. Aliquots of HB3 and Dd2 cell suspensions were mixed with different concentrations of nonradioactive chloroquine and 10 nM [3H]chloroquine to achieve a final chloroquine concentration of 10 nM to 500 μM. It was found that the chloroquine uptake is saturable, as indicated by the reduction of internalized [3H]chloroquine in the presence of an excess of nonradioactive chloroquine (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that chloroquine uptake by P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes is temperature-dependent and saturable. Both properties are indicative of carrier-mediated transport and suggest the existence of a specific parasite-encoded protein that facilitates chloroquine uptake. By contrast, no evidence for a chloroquine import mechanism was found in uninfected erythrocytes, confirming previous reports (24Ferrari V. Cutler D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Ferrari V. Cutler D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Chloroquine uptake by erythrocytes is temperature-insensitive and unsaturable, consistent with a diffusion-controlled process (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Although both HB3 and Dd2 seem to possess a chloroquine importer, quantitative differences in the transport capacity are apparent from the studies described above. This would imply that the kinetic properties of the transporter differ between the CQR and CQS parasite clones investigated. To test this hypothesis, the initial velocity of chloroquine uptake was measured over a range of chloroquine concentrations. Aliquots of an HB3 or Dd2 cell suspension were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]chloroquine for 5 min at 37°C. The amount of parasite-associated [3H]chloroquine was determined and normalized to 1 × 106 parasites, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The kinetics of initial chloroquine uptake can be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation in both HB3 and Dd2 (Fig. 4). Yet the kinetic parameters are unique to each of the two parasite clones (Fig. 4a). The maximal apparent transport rates (Jmax) are 186 ± 20 fmol/1 × 106 parasites/min for HB3, and 150 ± 20 fmol/1 × 106 parasites/min for Dd2 (Fig. 4, a and c). Furthermore, the apparent Michalis-Menten constants (Km) differ by nearly 1 order of magnitude, 16.5 ± 1.4 nM (n = 7) for HB3 versus 107.7 ± 17.6 nM (n = 7) for Dd2 (Fig. 4, a and c). Analysis of the data using a Hill plot revealed a Hill coefficient of one for both HB3 and Dd2, indicating a transporter with a single binding site for chloroquine (Fig. 4b). In contrast to Km values, transport rates are dependent on the concentration of the transporter. To determine if the differences in Jmax values observed are due to a change in the chloroquine transporter or its concentration, we measured the number of chloroquine-binding sites in HB3 and Dd2 using a competitive equilibrium binding assay. Cell suspensions of HB3 and Dd2 were incubated with 50 nM [3H]chloroquine and 25 nM to 50 μM nonradioactive chloroquine. The reactions were incubated at 4°C, at which temperature chloroquine would bind to the transporter without being translocated (see Fig. 2). The amount of specifically bound chloroquine was determined and analyzed in a Woolf-Augustinsson-Hofstee plot. Linear regressions were observed for both HB3 and Dd2 (Fig. 5). The intercept on the y axis gives the number of chloroquine-binding sites, which was found to be the same for both HB3 and Dd2. The gradients, however, differ, indicating that HB3 and Dd2 have different binding constants for chloroquine, consistent with the data shown in Fig. 4. These data suggest that chloroquine resistance is correlated with kinetic changes in chloroquine uptake. The differences in Km and Jmax observed for Dd2 appear to result from an altered importer as opposed to a reduction in the number of facilitator molecules. To date only two genetic crosses have been made with P. falciparum, of which one has used Dd2 and HB3 as parental clones (13Wellems T.E. Paton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. Rosario do V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The analysis of the progeny from the HB3xDd2 cross provides us with an opportunity to investigate the possibility of a genetic linkage between the chloroquine-resistant phenotype and kinetic changes in chloroquine import. From this cross 16 independent progeny were investigated; 8 are CQS and 8 CQR. Apparent Km and apparent Jmax values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Only two kinetic phenotypes were exhibited by the progeny (Fig. 6). For all 8 CQS progeny, the kinetics of chloroquine import were the same as those of the HB3 parental clone. Likewise, chloroquine import kinetics for the 8 CQR progeny were the same as those of the Dd2 parental clone. Thus, differences in the chloroquine import kinetics, indicated by altered apparent Km and apparent Jmax values, segregate with the chloroquine-resistant phenotype in a genetic cross. It has recently been shown in a bacterial system that chloroquine interacts with cation transporting systems (26Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We explored this possibility in P. falciparum by examining the effect of substances inhibiting cation exchange on chloroquine uptake (data not shown). Compounds known to inhibit plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchangers reversibly, such as amiloride and amiloride derivatives including 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride and EIPA, reduced chloroquine uptake (data not shown). EIPA was chosen for further studies, due to its selective inhibition of eukaryotic Na+/H+ exchangers (27Vigne P. Frelin C. Cragoe E.J. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Kleyman T.R. Cragoe E.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 191: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Tse C.M. Levine S. Yun C. Brant S. Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), including that of P. falciparum (30Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In both HB3 and Dd2, EIPA inhibits initial chloroquine uptake in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7a). Half-maximal inhibition is achieved at an EIPA concentration of about 6.2 ± 4.0 μM for HB3 and 62 ± 20 μM for Dd2. The fact that chloroquine uptake is inhibitable in infected but not uninfected erythrocytes provides further evidence for a P. falciparum-encoded protein that mediates chloroquine import. While it is possible that chloroquine import is mediated by a plasmodial Na+/H+ exchanger, which is directly inhibited by EIPA, the data thus far presented cannot exclude the possibility of a secondary effect of EIPA on chloroquine uptake. To prove direct competition of EIPA and chloroquine for the same protein, more detailed inhibition studies were conducted. The initial velocity of chloroquine uptake by HB3 was monitored in the presence of three different EIPA concentrations. The data obtained were analyzed using a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 7b). This analysis showed that inhibition of the initial chloroquine uptake by EIPA is strictly competitive. The apparent Ki is 6.6 μM, as determined by plotting the slopes of the lines from Fig. 7b versus the EIPA concentration (data not shown). Thus, EIPA and chloroquine bind not only to the same protein but also seem to compete for the same binding site. Given the high specificity of EIPA, a plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger appears to be responsible for chloroquine import in P. falciparum. Chloroquine is directed against the intra-erythrocytic P. falciparum stages and at concentrations exceeding 0.1 mM inhibits the conversion of toxic heme into inert hemozoin (1Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Nature. 1992; 355: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 2Dorn A. Stoffel R. Matile H. Bubendorf A. Ridley R.G. Nature. 1995; 374: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Chloroquine resistance does not seem to involve changes in hemoglobin degradation, heme detoxification, or drug metabolism, but appears to be associated with the reduction of the intracellular chloroquine concentration below biologically effective levels (3Fitch C.D. Science. 1970; 169: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Fitch C.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1973; 3: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The observation that CQR parasite isolates accumulate significantly less chloroquine than do CQS parasite isolates has aroused many speculations as to the molecular basis of this phenotype. Three different mechanisms are currently being considered: (i) the acquisition of a rapid chloroquine efflux mechanism (6Martin S.K. Oduola A.M.J. Milhous W.K. Science. 1987; 235: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 7Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Kyle D.E. Oduola A.M.J. Martin S.K. Milhous W.K. Schlesinger P.H. Science. 1987; 238: 1283-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 13Wellems T.E. Paton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. Rosario do V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar); (ii) a rise in the lysosomal pH which would reduce acidotropic accumulation of chloroquine (14Ginsburg H. Stein W.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Yayon A. Cabantchik Z.I. Ginsburg H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar); and (iii) the loss or reduction of a chloroquine influx mechanism (17Ferrari V. Cutler D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: S167-S179Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown here, changes in the chloroquine import kinetics play a pivotal role in constituting the resistant phenotype. We have demonstrated that the initial chloroquine uptake is temperature-dependent, saturable, and inhibitable. These features are indicative of carrier-mediated transport and clearly demonstrate the existence of a chloroquine import mechanism in P. falciparum. No evidence for such a chloroquine concentrating mechanism was found in uninfected erythrocytes, conforming to previous reports (24Ferrari V. Cutler D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Ferrari V. Cutler D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This suggests that the factor mediating chloroquine import is encoded by P. falciparum. Facilitated chloroquine import exists in both CQS and CQR parasite isolates, as shown for HB3 and Dd2, but has also been observed using other geographically dispersed CQS and CQR parasite isolates (data not shown). The kinetics of chloroquine import can be described using the Michaelis-Menten equation, as indicated by the hyperbolic relationship between the initial velocity of chloroquine uptake and the chloroquine concentration (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The kinetic parameters of this reaction were determined for both the CQS parasite clone HB3 and the CQR parasite clone Dd2 and found to differ. In HB3 the chloroquine import kinetics are defined by an apparent Km of 16 ± 1.4 nM and a Jmax of 186 ± 20 fmol/1 × 106 parasites/min. In comparison, the CQR parasite clone Dd2 has a chloroquine transporter with an apparent Km of 107 ± 17.6 nM and a Jmax of 150 ± 20 fmol/1 × 106 parasites/min. Chloroquine binding assays confirmed the notion that Dd2 binds chloroquine with a lower affinity (Fig. 5). Since a Km value is an intrinsic property of a protein, the change in Km for chloroquine suggests that the chloroquine importer is altered in Dd2. The number of chloroquine importers appears to be the same for both HB3 and Dd2. The 6.5-fold difference in affinity of the transporters for chloroquine can almost account for the 8-fold difference in chloroquine susceptibility observed between the two P. falciparum clones (13Wellems T.E. Paton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. Rosario do V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Investigation of chloroquine uptake by several other P. falciparum isolates confirmed the association of chloroquine resistance with changes in chloroquine import kinetics. CQR parasite isolates consistently have a transporter with a reduced transport rate and lower affinity for chloroquine (data not shown). Since sensitivity to chloroquine is clone-dependent, ranging from between 11 and 608 nM (12Foote S.J. Kyle D.E. Martin R.K. Oduola A.M.J. Forsyth K. Kemp D.J. Cowman A.F. Nature. 1990; 345: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the apparent Km and Jmax values of the chloroquine importer determine the degree of resistance. Contrasting our findings, other studies have concluded that chloroquine uptake kinetics are identical in both CQR and CQS parasite isolates (7Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Kyle D.E. Oduola A.M.J. Martin S.K. Milhous W.K. Schlesinger P.H. Science. 1987; 238: 1283-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, these studies were conducted with chloroquine concentrations ranging from between 0.1 and 1 nM, which is several orders of magnitude below the apparent Km values of the chloroquine importer, as determined in this study. Under these conditions chloroquine is quickly depleted from the media and becomes limiting, which results in a slow down of the rate of chloroquine import, complicating the interpretation of the kinetic data obtained. Another important factor that had to be considered was the dependence of the chloroquine import rates on the proton gradient across the parasite membrane, as discussed below. It proved necessary to keep the buffer pH constant at all times to maintain comparable reaction conditions. Further support for a functional relationship between chloroquine resistance and changes in chloroquine uptake came from the analysis of a genetic cross between HB3 and Dd2. From this cross, 16 independent recombinant progeny are available (13Wellems T.E. Paton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. Rosario do V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). By analyzing all 16 progeny it was found that the chloroquine-resistant phenotype is genetically linked with changes in chloroquine import kinetics. The apparent Km and Jmax values determined for the 16 progeny were comparable to those of either parental clone. The 8 CQS progeny have apparent Km and Jmax values comparable to those of HB3, whereas all 8 CQR progeny have a transporter with a lower affinity for chloroquine and a reduced maximal transport rate, like Dd2. These data are consistent with monogenic inheritance of the chloroquine import phenotype. Furthermore, the genetic linkage observed provides compelling evidence that changes in the chloroquine import kinetics constitute a minimal necessary event for creating the chloroquine resistant phenotype. Analyzing the same progeny from the HB3xDd2 cross, Wellems et al. (13Wellems T.E. Paton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. Rosario do V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) observed a genetic linkage between chloroquine resistance and rapid chloroquine efflux. Taken together, genetic data suggest that chloroquine resistance is a complex phenotype, resulting from at least two functionally independent events: changes in the chloroquine import kinetics and the acquisition of a chloroquine efflux mechanism. Both events contribute to a reduction in the cytoplasmic chloroquine concentration. A possible consequence would be that the chloroquine entry into the lysosomes is prevented or at least slowed down. First clues about the identity of the chloroquine importer came from inhibition studies with amiloride and its derivatives, such as 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride and EIPA, which reduced chloroquine uptake in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). Inhibition of chloroquine import by EIPA is strictly competitive, indicating that both EIPA and chloroquine bind to the same protein and compete for the same binding site. In other systems, the pharmacological action of EIPA has been demonstrated to be highly specific (27Vigne P. Frelin C. Cragoe E.J. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Kleyman T.R. Cragoe E.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 191: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Tse C.M. Levine S. Yun C. Brant S. Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). At micromolar concentrations, EIPA inhibits the activity of eukaryotic Na+/H+ exchangers by competitively binding to, and blocking, the Na+-binding site (32Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Benos D. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C131-C145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 268: C283-C296Crossref Google Scholar). Binding of EIPA interferes with the biological function of a Na+/H+ exchanger in its role in the regulation of cytoplasmic pH and cellular volume (34Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 268: C283-C296Crossref Google Scholar). Bosia et al. (30Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the presence of an EIPA inhibitable Na+/H+ exchanger in P. falciparum, which resides within the parasite plasma membrane, relieving the cell of a surplus of protons generated during glycolysis. Inhibition of the plasmodial Na+/H+ exchanger by EIPA resulted in an intracellular acidification (30Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we conclude that chloroquine import is mediated by a P. falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger. Since both EIPA and chloroquine compete for the same binding site, it is plausible that chloroquine import occurs via the Na+-binding domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger, instead of sodium and in exchange of protons. Electrophysiological studies strengthen this proposal by demonstrating that chloroquine import is associated with an EIPA inhibitable cytoplasmic alkalization. 2S. Wünsch, C. P. Sanchez, M. Gekle, and M. Lanzer, manuscript in preparation. If chloroquine is transported in exchange of protons then one would expect to find a dependence of chloroquine resistance on the pH gradient across the parasite membrane. This is indeed found. Several studies have reported that changes in the transmembrane pH gradient provoke a change in the susceptibility of the parasite to chloroquine (18Bray P.G. Boulter M.K. Ritchie G.Y. Howells R.E. Ward S.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Martiney J.A. Cerami A. Slater A.F.G. J. Biol.

A. 1985; 82: 2784-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The activity of a Na+/H+ exchanger can be modulated by a broad range of factors, as shown in other systems (34Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 268: C283-C296Crossref Google Scholar). These include phosphorylation, hormone and growth factor induced binding of accessory proteins, and the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin (34Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 268: C283-C296Crossref Google Scholar). Several of these modulators not only affect the transport rate of a Na+/H+ exchanger but also its affinity for protons and possibly sodium (34Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 268: C283-C296Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, changes in the P. falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger's affinity for chloroquine could result from several alternative scenarios: (i) a mutation of the active chloroquine-binding site; (ii) a conformational mutation elsewhere in the Na+/H+ exchanger; or (iii) a mutation of a factor regulating Na+/H+ exchanger activity. Consistent with the proposal that either a Na+/H+ exchanger or a modulating factor is mutated in response to chloroquine selection, electrophysiological studies revealed differences in cytoplasmic pH regulation of CQR and CQS parasite isolates.2 Interestingly, Martiney et al. (19Martiney J.A. Cerami A. Slater A.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22393-22398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil increased net chloroquine uptake in both CQS and CQR parasite isolates. According to our proposal, we predict that verapamil acts on chloroquine transport by modulating the Na+/H+ exchanger activity through the Ca2+/calmodulin regulatory pathway. We postulate that either a P. falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger or a factor regulating Na+/H+ exchanger activity resides within the chloroquine resistance locus, defined by the genetic cross between HB3 and Dd2 (36Wellems T.E.

https://openalex.org/W2030310467,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix family. Although physiological ligands for the AhR have not been identified, carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) are high affinity AhR ligands that induce nuclear translocation and sequence-specific DNA binding of the AhR. AhR-regulated genes include members of the cytochrome P-450 family that are known to oxidize B[a]P to form genotoxic (DNA-damaging) metabolites. Murine Swiss 3T3 cells express high levels of AhR. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with B[a]P during the G1 phase of the cell cycle resulted in growth arrest, as shown by inhibition of growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis. By contrast, other murine 3T3 fibroblasts not expressing detectable levels of AhR did not undergo growth arrest in response to B[a]P. The AhR antagonist ä-naphthoflavone prevented B[a]P-induced growth arrest, further demonstrating that cessation of cell growth was mediated by the activated AhR. A nongenotoxic AhR ligand (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) did not elicit growth arrest, showing that ligand activation of the AhR alone was insufficient to block cell cycle progression. However, genomic DNA from B[a]P-treated Swiss 3T3 cells contained covalent adducts, whereas that from 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-treated cells did not, showing that G1 arrest correlated with DNA damage resulting from genotoxic B[a]P metabolites. B[a]P-induced DNA damage and growth arrest was coincident with elevated levels of nuclear p53 protein and induction of the p53-regulated mdm-2 proto-oncogene. However, Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts expressing “dominant negative” mutant p53, as well as primary fibroblasts from p53-/-“knockout” mice, also underwent growth arrest in response to B[a]P. Therefore, B[a]P-induced growth arrest occurs via p53-independent mechanisms. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix family. Although physiological ligands for the AhR have not been identified, carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) are high affinity AhR ligands that induce nuclear translocation and sequence-specific DNA binding of the AhR. AhR-regulated genes include members of the cytochrome P-450 family that are known to oxidize B[a]P to form genotoxic (DNA-damaging) metabolites. Murine Swiss 3T3 cells express high levels of AhR.

The apparent affinity of the nonphosphorylated enzyme for ATP showed a Kd of ~3 μM in the absence of cyclopiazonic acid and ~28 μM in the presence of the drug. Fractional saturation of the enzyme by cyclopiazonic acid was accompanied by the appearance of two ATP-binding populations (enzyme with and without drug) and a progressive increase in the half-maximal concentration for saturating the ATP-binding sites. Enzyme turnover in the presence of stoichiometric concentrations of cyclopiazonic acid displayed lower apparent affinity for ATP and lower maximal hydrolytic activity than in the absence of the drug. When cyclopiazonic acid is in the substoichiometric range, the observed kinetic parameters will correspond to the simultaneous contribution of two different reaction cycles sustained by the enzyme with and without drug. The inhibition could be elicited by adding ATP to allow the enzyme turnover when cyclopiazonic acid was preincubated with the enzyme in the presence of Ca2+. The onset of inhibition during enzyme cycling was observed over a period of seconds, revealing the existence of a low inhibition rate constant. It is concluded that cyclopiazonic acid decreases enzyme affinity for ATP in non-turnover conditions by approximately one order of magnitude.

Thus, we investigated the regulation of the activity of integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 with regard to their role in vitronectin internalization in U-251MG astrocytoma cell monolayers adherent to fibronectin, collagen, or laminin in serum-free conditions. Binding of [125I]vitronectin occurred in a specific, saturable manner that was partially inhibitable by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for integrins αvβ3 or αvβ5. Specific, lysosomally-mediated degradation of [125I]vitronectin was detectable at 1 h and increased over the 24-h assay period. The cell substrate affected the rate of turnover of [125I]vitronectin, which was 3.0 ng/min for cells plated on fibronectin but 0.35 ng/min for cells plated on collagen. Furthermore, although mAbs specific for either integrin αvβ3 or αvβ5 inhibited degradation (30%; combined effect 70%) of [125I]vitronectin by cells plated on fibronectin, only mAb anti-αvβ5 inhibited degradation (70-90%) by cells plated on collagen or laminin.

INTRODUCTIONDopamine is a widespread modulatory neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous system of vertebrates. The physiological roles of dopamine range from the sensorimotor control, thermoregulation, and modulation of appetite to the regulation of reproductive and maternal behavior. At the cellular level, the pleiotropic effects of dopamine are mediated by two specific classes of dopamine receptors, termed D1 and D2, distinguishable by their ability to activate (D1 class) or to inhibit (D2 class) the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (1Kebabian J.W. Calne D.B. Nature. 1979; 277: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar). More recently, molecular studies have revealed that D1 and D2 receptors are composed of several membrane proteins, each belonging to the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors defined by their shared overall topology and common signal transduction mechanism, which triggers GDP/GTP exchange on heterotrimeric G proteins (2Oliveira L. Paiva A.C. Sander C. Vriend G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 170-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Two D1-like receptors (D1 and D5, more precisely named D1A and D1B, respectively) and three D2-like receptor subtypes (D2, D3, and D4), each encoded by distinct genes, have been isolated in mammals (3Civelli O. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 281-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis and gene organization, D1 and D2 dopamine receptor classes appear not to be more closely related to each other than to other catecholamine receptor families (4Fryxell K.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Vernier P. Cardinaud B. Valdenaire O. Philippe H. Vincent J.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 375-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As with other members of the monoamine receptor family, D1-like and D2-like receptors are probably of independent origin and have acquired separately and convergently the ability to bind their endogenous ligand (5Vernier P. Cardinaud B. Valdenaire O. Philippe H. Vincent J.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 375-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).In contrast with dopamine D2-like receptor genes, which have only been extensively characterized in mammals, D1-like receptor gene diversity has been recently examined in a small set of other vertebrate species. Besides D1A and D1B receptors, additional D1-like receptor genes have been isolated from amphibians (Xenopus D1C receptor (6Sugamori K.S. Demchyshyn L.L. Chung M. Niznik H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10536-10540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) and birds (chicken D1D receptor (7Demchyshyn L.L. Sugamori K.S. Lee F.J.S. Hamadanizadeh S.A. Niznik H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4005-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). Similarly, D1-like receptor sequences not classified as either D1A or D1B have been described in fish (Ref. 8Macrae A.D. Brenner S. Genomics. 1995; 25: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and GenBank™ sequence X81969). Although Xenopus D1C and chicken D1D receptors significantly differ from both vertebrate and mammalian D1A and D1B receptors on the basis of their amino acid sequence and distinct pharmacological profiles, it is unclear whether they are truly reflective of distinct D1 receptor subtypes or if their presence is merely associated with and restricted to these particular species.As with other members of the catecholamine receptor gene family, the molecular diversity of D1-like receptors appears to be the product of gene duplication events occurring during the evolutionary history of a particular species (9Ohta T. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 33: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since the multiplicity of D1-like receptors is a common characteristic of amphibian, avian, and mammalian genomes, the gene duplication events that underlie the origin of these receptor subtypes must have occurred significantly before or close to the emergence of tetrapods. In order to gain insights into the nature and temporal occurrence of these important genetic events, it is necessary to ascertain the genetic diversity of the D1 receptor family in a species belonging to a phylum that diverged before the emergence of tetrapods. Ray-finned fish (actinopterygians) diverged ~420 million years ago from flesh-finned fish (sarcopterygians) from which the tetrapod ancestor descended. Therefore, we searched for the full complement of D1-like receptor diversity in a modern representative of actinopterygians, the European eel Anguilla anguilla (a teleost). We report here that (a) eel dopamine D1 receptors are comprised of three distinct D1 receptor subtypes, which express molecular, pharmacological, and functional signatures that define unequivocally the characteristics of vertebrate D1A, D1B, and D1C receptors; (b) the diversity of the vertebrate D1 receptor gene family occurred and was clearly established before the divergence of actinopterygians from sarcopterygians.DISCUSSIONFour D1 dopamine receptors have been isolated by molecular cloning in the teleost fish A. anguilla (European eel). All these receptors are expressed in the brain and have been pharmacologicaly and functionally characterized.The assignment of each of the eel sequences to a particular subtype of D1 receptor was important in order to analyze, through an evolutionary perspective, the functional significance of the dopamine D1 receptor genetic diversity observed in modern vertebrates. The major interest of a comparative approach is to point out the parameters that are really conserved and specific of each of the receptor subtypes and therefore relevant to the physiological role of each of these subtypes. In principle, several different criteria may be used to classify the various molecular forms of G protein-coupled receptors, which include the relative affinity and activity of ligands, the modulation of particular intracellular signaling pathways, the specific tissue distribution, and finally the sequence similarities analyzed by molecular phylogeny methods (5Vernier P. Cardinaud B. Valdenaire O. Philippe H. Vincent J.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 375-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 30Kenakin T.P. Bond R.A. Bonner T.I. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 351-362PubMed Google Scholar). The convergence of these criteria is probably the best way to provide a robust definition and classification of each of the receptor subtypes isolated from different animal species.One major criterion of receptor classification into distinct receptor subtypes depends on sequence identities. In this respect, we have recently emphasized that molecular phylogeny methods are very useful to unravel the relationships of the various monoamine receptors and, in particular, to identify orthologous versus paralogous receptors (5Vernier P.

Indeed, the “characters” represented by nucleotides or amino acids at each position in the sequence alignments constitute objective information that can be used for the classification of these molecules on the basis of their shared similarities and differences. Despite the limitations represented by high divergence rates, saturation of sequence similarities, or gene homogenization, the phylogenetic trees constructed from sequence alignments also provide valuable information regarding evolutionary relationships among corresponding molecules and, therefore, on gene duplication events giving rise to the molecular diversity currently observed. We document here one such example for members of the dopamine D1-like receptor family, which is so far the receptor class most largely analyzed in a wide range of vertebrate species.As illustrated in Fig. 2, molecular phylogeny unambiguously assigns the four eel D1-like receptors to three D1 receptor subtypes named D1A, D1B, and D1C. As such, it provides strong support for the view that the D1C receptor reflects a true receptor subtype, common to most of the vertebrate species. Indeed, Macrae and Brenner (8Macrae A.D. Brenner S. Genomics. 1995; 25: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) recently isolated two D1-like receptors from another teleost fish, the puffer fish Fugu rubripes. The phylogenetic tree clearly shows that these two receptor sequences are, respectively, orthologous to the D1A and D1C subtypes. We can now conclude that D1A and D1B orthologous receptors are found in all the vertebrate species analyzed to date, whereas D1C orthologues are up to now found only in fish and amphibians, challenging the presence of this subtype in mammals.The presence of two distinct D1A receptors in the eel is also an intriguing feature brought to light by this study. We have accumulated evidence to show that D1A1 and D1A2 receptors are not simply different polymorphic alleles; their sequences are too different to correspond to polymorphic variations, since they are found in 12 different individuals fished from different parts of France and their mRNAs are differentially transcribed in the eel brain. These data imply that an ancestor D1A gene duplicated either recently in the eel lineage or more precociously in an ancestor of modern teleosts, although this assumption awaits the demonstration of the presence of two D1A receptors in other fishes. The duplication of the ancestor of the eel D1A receptor genes is probably not the consequence of genome tetraploidization, as is the case for the toad Xenopus laevis or salmons, since European eels as well as their Japanese relatives are not tetraploids (31Park E.H. Kang Y.S. Science. 1976; 193: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Finally, the chicken D1D sequence (7Demchyshyn L.L. Sugamori K.S. Lee F.J.S. Hamadanizadeh S.A. Niznik H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4005-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although too divergent from the other vertebrate D1-like sequences to be unambiguously assigned to one of the three D1 subtypes, shares impressive synapomorphies with the D1C receptor subtype. As such, it is still unclear whether the chicken D1D receptor represents a fast diverging D1C sequence or if it corresponds to a new paralogous subtype of the D1 receptor appearing late in the vertebrate phylum, perhaps specifically in the Thecodontia (birds and crocodiles) lineage.The most commonly used criterion of receptor classification is based on the rank order of potency and relative binding affinity of various dopaminergic agonists and antagonists in vitro. Since this pharmacological parameter basically results from the ligand interactions with a small number of amino acid residues in the binding pocket of the receptors, the classification obtained by this criterion should closely resemble that obtained on the basis of sequence comparison. It is indeed the case for the eel D1 receptors that display pharmacological profiles that closely conform to those previously observed for each of the three D1 receptor subtypes (6Sugamori K.S. Demchyshyn L.L. Chung M. Niznik H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10536-10540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Demchyshyn L.L. Sugamori K.S. Lee F.J.S. Hamadanizadeh S.A. Niznik H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4005-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In particular, the two eel D1A receptors (D1A1 and D1A2) have very similar binding abilities.Comparison of the binding properties of the eel D1 receptors with those of the other vertebrate D1 receptors delineates salient conserved characteristics for each of the D1 receptor subtypes. Most importantly, a higher affinity of the D1B subtype for the endogenous ligand dopamine, as compared with D1A and D1C, is a distinguishing property of the D1B receptor subtype in all of the vertebrate receptors analyzed so far. In this respect, the D1C receptor displays an intermediate affinity for dopamine in both Xenopus and eel. Most antagonists bind the eel D1C receptor with estimated affinity values very close to that of D1A2. One interesting conserved discriminating feature, however, is the rank order of affinity for NPA (D1A > D1C > D1B), 6,7-ADTN (D1B > D1C > D1A), haloperidol (D1A > D1C > D1B), and spiperone (D1A > D1C > D1B). In contrast, the benzazepine SCH-23390, the canonical D1 receptor ligand, does not discriminate between the various receptor subtypes in all of the vertebrate species tested and should be considered indeed as a generic marker of the the D1 receptor family in vertebrates. Whether the newly described D1C receptor subtype can be further discriminated from D1A or D1B receptors to display exquisite sensitivity for other dopaminergic compounds or “second generation” D1-like agonists and antagonists is currently under investigation.It is worth mentioning that drug-based discrimination of the various subtypes of vertebrate dopamine D1 receptors is better described by a “profile” of binding affinities for several drugs that can be readily compared in different species than by the particular properties of single “specific” ligands. Indeed, confusion in receptor classification may occur when minor sequence differences between orthologous receptors (species homologues) are recognized by specific ligands or, on the contrary, when paralogous receptors (true subtypes) are not distinguished by different ligands (32Hall J.M. Caulfield M.P. Watson S.P. Guard S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 376-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Examples of such heterodox behavior are also observed in the D1 receptor family, where flupentixol displayed ~7-fold higher affinity for the chicken than for the Xenopus D1B receptor (7Demchyshyn L.L. Sugamori K.S. Lee F.J.S. Hamadanizadeh S.A. Niznik H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4005-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).The third classification criterion is provided by the differential coupling of the receptors to intracellular signaling molecules via direct interactions with ä and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. This criterion is difficult to fully apply in the case of cloned receptors, since their activity is evaluated by introducing them in cell lines where the full range of “natural” intracellular pathway activation may not always be obtained (33Keen M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 371-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the four eel D1-like receptors are able to significantly activate adenylyl cyclase in COS-7 cells. This property, which historically led to the definition of the D1 receptor class, remains the key parameter of D1 receptor characterization. From an evolutionary point of view, this plesiomorphic property was acquired by the common ancestor of all of the D1 receptors and should be found even in early diverging species. This statement is supported by the fact that the Drosophila dopamine D1 receptor mediates dopamine activation of adenylyl cyclase, although this molecule retains little of the pharmacological profile that defines vertebrate D1 receptors (25Sugamori K.S. Demchyshyn L.L. McConkey F. Forte M.A. Niznik H.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Interestingly, cells transfected with the eel D1B receptors consistently exhibit a higher basal cAMP level than control, D1A-transfected, or D1C-transfected cells, as found in other species. It suggests that one functional differentiating characteristic of the D1B receptor is its constitutive activity, a property inherent in the mammalian D5/D1B receptor (34Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jarvie K.R. Tiberi M. Silvia C. Gingrich J.A. Caron M.G. J. Receptor Res. 1993; 13: 573-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and which appears to have been absolutely conserved throughout the evolutionary course of the D1B receptor subfamily. As such, constitutive activation of adenylate cyclase by the D1B receptor system appears fundamental to this receptor subtype and functionally relevant to the physiology of dopamine in the vertebrate nervous system. At present, it is difficult to ascertain whether all vertebrate D1C receptors share, at a somewhat attenuated level, the ability to display constitutive activity (see Fig. 5) and whether this property is common throughout the evolutionary history of the D1C receptor subtype. In this regard, the Xenopus D1C receptor does not appear to be constitutively active (6Sugamori K.S. Demchyshyn L.L. Chung M. Niznik H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10536-10540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although direct comparison with the eel D1C receptor is difficult due to the widely disparate levels of receptor expression. The precise determination of D1C subtype characteristics regarding adenylyl cyclase modulation will require analysis in a larger set of animal species in order to determine whether its relatively high intrinsic activity is indeed conserved.The fourth criterion that may identify receptor subtypes expressed in a single animal species is its tissue specific distribution profile. Although, as of yet, we were not able to provide a precise and complete description of the tissue distribution of the four eel D1 receptor mRNAs, the semiquantitative PCR analysis suggested that the various eel D1 receptor subtypes are differentially transcribed in various segments of the eel brain. Differential distribution of receptor mRNAs also characterizes mammalian D1A and D1B receptors. D1A receptors are present at very high levels in the striatal and olfactory regions, whereas D1B receptors are expressed mainly in the hippocampus and cortex in the human and also in the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus in rat (29Mansour A. Meador-Woodruff J.H. Zhou Q.Y. Civelli O. Akil H. Watson S.J. Neuroscience. 1991; 45: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Meador-Woodruff J.H. Mansour A. Grandy D.K. Damask S.P. Civelli O. Watson S.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 145: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 37Beischlag T.V. Marchese A. Meador-Woodruff J.H. Damask S.P. O'Dowd B.F. Tyndale R.F. van Tol H.H. Seeman P. Niznik H.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5960-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The localization of the D1A and D1B receptors seems to be essentially nonoverlapping in mammals. This characteristic could be extended to the other vertebrate species and may render the multiplicity of D1 receptors essentially nonredundant. The physiological consequence for the expression of four dopamine D1 receptors in a teleost fish can be only hypothetical at present, but it probably relates to dopamine functions (not only cellular effects) selected for eel adaptation to a changing milieu. European eels, like their American and Asian relatives, have a very complex physiology in which dopamine is thought to contribute significantly to the sensorimotor, feeding, and reproductive behavior during its whole life cycle. The role of dopamine in such a life cycle could have driven the conservation of more dopamine receptor subtypes than found in other vertebrates living in more constant environments. Be that as it may, the acquisition of differential expression territories by the various duplicated genes during evolution would be a mechanism of utmost importance for the conservation of paralogous genes.In summary, the comparison of the the eel D1 receptor sequences as well as of some of their pharmacological and functional characteristics with those of the other D1 vertebrate subtypes, although still incomplete, pinpoints defining characteristics and features specific for each of the D1A, D1B, and D1C receptor subtypes found in vertebrates. Understanding the physiological relevance of these defined functional homologies will now require an appreciation of the relationship between the differential localization of the various D1 receptor subtypes within the brains of the main groups of vertebrates and the synaptic organization of dopaminergic pathways in these species. INTRODUCTIONDopamine is a widespread modulatory neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous system of vertebrates. The physiological roles of dopamine range from the sensorimotor control, thermoregulation, and modulation of appetite to the regulation of reproductive and maternal behavior. At the cellular level, the pleiotropic effects of dopamine are mediated by two specific classes of dopamine receptors, termed D1 and D2, distinguishable by their ability to activate (D1 class) or to inhibit (D2 class) the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (1Kebabian J.W. Calne D.B. Nature. 1979; 277: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar). More recently, molecular studies have revealed that D1 and D2 receptors are composed of several membrane proteins, each belonging to the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors defined by their shared overall topology and common signal transduction mechanism, which triggers GDP/GTP exchange on heterotrimeric G proteins (2Oliveira L. Paiva A.C. Sander C. Vriend G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 170-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Two D1-like receptors (D1 and D5, more precisely named D1A and D1B, respectively) and three D2-like receptor subtypes (D2, D3, and D4), each encoded by distinct genes, have been isolated in mammals (3Civelli O. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 281-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis and gene organization, D1 and D2 dopamine receptor classes appear not to be more closely related to each other than to other catecholamine receptor families (4Fryxell K.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Vernier P. Cardinaud B. Valdenaire O. Philippe H. Vincent J.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 375-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As with other members of the monoamine receptor family, D1-like and D2-like receptors are probably of independent origin and have acquired separately and convergently the ability to bind their endogenous ligand (5Vernier P. Cardinaud B. Valdenaire O. Philippe H. Vincent J.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 375-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).In contrast with dopamine D2-like receptor genes, which have only been extensively characterized in mammals, D1-like receptor gene diversity has been recently examined in a small set of other vertebrate species. Besides D1A and D1B receptors, additional D1-like receptor genes have been isolated from amphibians (Xenopus D1C receptor (6Sugamori K.S. Demchyshyn L.L. Chung M. Niznik H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10536-10540Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) and birds (chicken D1D receptor (7Demchyshyn L.L. Sugamori K.S. Lee F.J.S. Hamadanizadeh S.A. Niznik H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4005-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). Similarly, D1-like receptor sequences not classified as either D1A or D1B have been described in fish (Ref. 8Macrae A.D. Brenner S. Genomics. 1995; 25: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and GenBank™ sequence X81969). Although Xenopus D1C and chicken D1D receptors significantly differ from both vertebrate and mammalian D1A and D1B receptors on the basis of their amino acid sequence and distinct pharmacological profiles, it is unclear whether they are truly reflective of distinct D1 receptor subtypes or if their presence is merely associated with and restricted to these particular species.As with other members of the catecholamine receptor gene family, the molecular diversity of D1-like receptors appears to be the product of gene duplication events occurring during the evolutionary history of a particular species (9Ohta T. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 33: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since the multiplicity of D1-like receptors is a common characteristic of amphibian, avian, and mammalian genomes, the gene duplication events that underlie the origin of these receptor subtypes must have occurred significantly before or close to the emergence of tetrapods. In order to gain insights into the nature and temporal occurrence of these important genetic events, it is necessary to ascertain the genetic diversity of the D1 receptor family in a species belonging to a phylum that diverged before the emergence of tetrapods. Ray-finned fish (actinopterygians) diverged ~420 million years ago from flesh-finned fish (sarcopterygians) from which the tetrapod ancestor descended. Therefore, we searched for the full complement of D1-like receptor diversity in a modern representative of actinopterygians, the European eel Anguilla anguilla (a teleost). We report here that (a) eel dopamine D1 receptors are comprised of three distinct D1 receptor subtypes, which express molecular, pharmacological, and functional signatures that define unequivocally the characteristics of vertebrate D1A, D1B, and D1C receptors; (b) the diversity of the vertebrate D1 receptor gene family occurred and was clearly established before the divergence of actinopterygians from sarcopterygians."

Nck is believed to act as an adaptor protein mediating signal transduction initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Through its SH2 domain, Nck recognizes a specific phosphotyrosine residue on RTKs or on protein substrates of RTKs like insulin receptor substrate-1, the major substrate of the insulin receptor, and through its SH3 domains it interacts with poorly characterized effector molecules. To identify novel proteins that might interact with Nck, we have used the amino-terminal segment of Nck encompassing its three SH3 domains in the yeast two-hybrid system. Among the polypeptides that associate with Nck, we have identified the γ2 isoform of the serine/threonine casein kinase I (CKI-γ2). In transformed rat hepatocytes overexpressing the insulin receptor (HTC-IR cells), serine/threonine protein kinase activity coimmunoprecipitates with Nck, an interaction mediated mainly by the third SH3 domain of Nck. This kinase activity is not apparently modulated by insulin, nor is it sensitive to staurosporine or heparin, and it does not use GTP as a phosphate donor. However the kinase activity coimmunoprecipitated with Nck is completely abolished by N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide, a specific inhibitor of casein kinase I. In an in vitro renaturation gel kinase assay, a protein kinase of 70-75 kDa was detected associated with the SH3 domains of Nck. Far Western analysis demonstrated that the SH3 domains of Nck bound directly to a cytosolic protein of 70-75 kDa. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal region of CKI-γ2 protein kinase immunoprecipitated a single specific protein of 70-75 kDa from HTC-IR cell lysates and detected CKI-γ2 among the proteins coimmunoprecipitated with Nck. These results support an in vivo interaction between Nck and CKI-γ2 and suggest that CKI-γ2 could be involved in signaling pathways downstream of RTKs.

The sequence predicts a core protein of 442 amino acids with six structural domains: an NH2-terminal signal peptide, a membrane distal glycosaminoglycan attachment domain, a mucin homology domain, a membrane proximal glycosaminoglycan attachment domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a noncatalytic COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Transfection of human 293 cells resulted in the expression of N-syndecan that was modified by heparan sulfate chain addition.

INTRODUCTIONThe syndecans are a gene family of transmembrane cell surface proteoglycans (reviewed in Refs. 1Bernfield M. Hinkes M. Gallo R. Development (Camb.). 1993; : 205-212Google Scholar and 2Elenius K. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2975-2982PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecans play an important role in tissue morphogenesis and differentiation by virtue of their ability to bind a number of extracellular adhesive proteins and growth factors. Four different syndecan core proteins that are the products of different genes are synthesized by mammalian cells. Syndecan synthesis is highly regulated (3Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Syndecan core proteins are characterized by highly conserved transmembrane and noncatalytic COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains but structurally distinct extracellular domains. This modular structural design suggests that individual mammalian syndecans have evolved to carry out specific functions within the tissues where they are expressed, probably related to the binding of specific extracellular ligands, but that these may be linked to common intracellular activities.We reported the cloning of a partial cDNA sequence from neonatal rat Schwann cells that coded for the syndecan core protein, which we called N-syndecan (9Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This proteoglycan is also expressed in the central nervous system. A highly homologous cDNA was cloned from chick embryo limb buds (10Gould S.E. Upholt W.B. Kosher R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3271-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Gould S.E. Upholt W.B. Kosher R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 438-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The chick proteoglycan, which appears to be the homologue of rat N-syndecan, was named syndecan-3.N-syndecan purified from neonatal rat brain has been used to study the ligand binding properties of the proteoglycan. In contrast to what has been reported for syndecan-1, brain N-syndecan binds poorly in solid-phase assays to most extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, laminin, and collagens I, III, IV, and V. The proteoglycan does bind with high affinity (KD = 5 x 10-10M) to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 1The abbreviations used are: bFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorHB-GAMheparin binding growth-associated moleculekbkilobase(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered saline.(12). N-syndecan has been proposed to be an endogenous heparin-like cofactor for bFGF in the developing brain. bFGF has been postulated to have a number of effects during development of the central nervous system, e.g. regulation of oligodendrocyte terminal differentiation (13Gard A.L. Pfeiffer S.E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 618-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 14Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). N-syndecan also binds to heparin binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM)(15), an extracellular matrix-associated adhesive protein that is expressed in the developing brain (16Merenmies J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and may function as a receptor for HB-GAM in neonatal brain tissue. Recently, we reported the purification of a novel, peripheral nerve-specific, extracellular matrix protein, p200, that binds N-syndecan (17Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). p200 is expressed in peripheral nerves during early postnatal development. Purified p200 promotes adhesion and spreading of Schwann cells.A determination of the biological function of N-syndecan would be facilitated by knowledge of the primary structure of the core protein and its expression in recombinant form, as well as information on the patterns of expression of N-syndecan in vivo. In this study, we report the complete amino acid sequence and expression of rat N-syndecan, the cloning and characterization of the rat N-syndecan gene, and an analysis of the tissue- and development-specific expression of N-syndecan.DISCUSSIONThe sequence of the rat N-syndecan core protein deduced from the cDNA sequence reveals several features of the core protein structure that are similar to other syndecans, as well as some distinct features. These similarities and differences most likely reflect common functional roles, such as extracellular ligand binding, that are carried out within the context of cell type-specific differences in function. It is presumably the latter that dictates the need for multiple forms of syndecans in mammalian cells. Syndecans show the greatest amino acid sequence homology in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The details and possible functional consequences of the high degree of structural conservation in these domains have been discussed previously (9Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is a relatively low level of sequence homology among the ectodomains. On the basis of sequence homology, the syndecans can be divided into syndecan-1/N-syndecan and syndecan-2/syndecan-4 subfamilies. Although the amino acid sequences of the ectodomains of N-syndecan and syndecan-1 are not strikingly similar, the two core proteins appear to reflect a common structural organization, with membrane proximal and membrane distal glycosaminoglycan attachment domains separated by a proline-rich spacer domain. This similarity in overall structural organization is reflected in the exon structure of the corresponding genes (23Hinkes M.T. Goldberger O.A. Neumann P.E. Kokenyesi R. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11440-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vihinen T. Auvinen P. Alanen-Kurki L. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17261-17269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both genes, each protein domain is encoded by a separate exon, with the exception of exon 5, which encodes both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains as well as the relatively long 3′-untranslated sequences. Also conserved is the unusual length of the first intron. These striking similarities in gene organization and protein structure provide strong support for the suggestion that the syndecans arose by gene duplication during mammalian evolution.The deduced amino acid sequence of N-syndecan predicts a polypeptide with a relative molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa. This is considerably lower than the observed mass of native heparitinase treated N-syndecan of 120 kDa. This discrepancy could result from a combination of anomalous migration of the polypeptide on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which is a hallmark of syndecan core proteins, as well as the presence of an unidentified posttranslational modification. Interpretation of the migration on SDS gels is also complicated by the fact that N-syndecan core protein forms SDS-resistant dimers and tetramers (18Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of native N-syndecan with heparitinase, nitrous acid, or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid all yield a product with a relative molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa. Digestion with chondroitinase has no effect on N-syndecan electrophoretic mobility (9Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16810-16814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The band that is observed following digestion of N-syndecan with these reagents is diffuse, however, suggesting the possible presence of additional modifications. The presence of the mucin homology domain in the N-syndecan core protein suggests the possibility of mucin-type oligosaccharides, but no additional data to support this conclusion have been obtained. Digestion of N-syndecan with neuraminidase has no effect on the core protein migration (data not shown). The cDNA sequence reported here contains sufficient coding information to direct the synthesis of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is indistinguishable in overall size and sensitivity to heparitinase from native N-syndecan extracted from neonatal rat brain tissue or Schwann cells.Immunoblot analysis of proteoglycan steady-state levels and Northern blot analysis of mRNA levels in rat tissues revealed that the highest levels of N-syndecan expression were restricted to cells of the central and peripheral nervous system of neonatal rats. These results do not rule out lower levels of synthesis by other tissues. We have found, for example, that rat heart and arterial tissue contain N-syndecan mRNA. In the heart, N-syndecan mRNA increases dramatically at birth and, in contrast to what was observed in the nervous system, persists in adult animals. 2V. K. Asundi, B. F. Keister, R. C. Stahl, and D. J. Cavey, submitted for publication.In spite of this, however, we were unable to detect N-syndecan in heart tissue.The cell types in the neonatal brain that are responsible for high levels of N-syndecan expression are not known. Temporally, the period of highest expression correlates well with the period of oligodendrocyte differentiation, which in rats begins at the time of birth and persists for the first three weeks of postnatal life (13Gard A.L. Pfeiffer S.E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 618-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these cells express FGF receptors. Administration of exogenous bFGF in culture results in cell proliferation and inhibition of terminal differentiation (13Gard A.L. Pfeiffer S.E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 618-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These effects are prevented when the cells are grown in the presence of sodium chlorate, and the chlorate inhibition can be reversed by exogenous heparin (14Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Brain N-syndecan binds bFGF with high affinity (12Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16810-16814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is, thus, a good candidate for the endogenous heparan sulfate molecules that function as co-receptors for bFGF activation.Additional functions for N-syndecan in the developing nervous system are suggested by other findings. Brain N-syndecan binds with high affinity (KD = 5 x 10-10M) to HB-GAM (15Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an 18-kDa secreted protein expressed in early postnatal brain and other tissues. Affinity chromatography experiments have shown that N-syndecan is the major protein in brain with HB-GAM binding activity. Although the exact function of HB-GAM is not known, it has been shown to have neurite outgrowth activity in vitro (27Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity and selectivity of N-syndecan binding to HB-GAM and the striking correspondence of their temporal patterns of expression in brain strongly suggest that these two proteins together carry out an important adhesion-dependent activity during early postnatal development of the brain.Another interesting question is the physiological function of membrane shedding of N-syndecan. Evidence was presented for a large amount of N-syndecan in brain tissue that was not attached to membranes, consistent with the shedding of syndecans that has been observed with cultured cells. Membrane shedding would provide a mechanism for terminating functional activity that is dependent on attachment to the plasma membrane. This could include cell-cell adhesion activity or binding events that were dependent on cytoskeletal attachment, or generated intracellular signals through the cytoplasmic domain. There is evidence that syndecan cytoplasmic domains can interact with actin filaments (28Rapraeger A. Jalkanen M. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2683-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 29Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Tucker B. Bendt K.A. Cizmeci-Smith G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and syndecan expression has been shown to alter the morphology and cytoskeletal organization of epithelial cells (30Kato M. Saunders S. Nguyen H. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 559-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and Schwann cells (31Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).N-syndecan that is released by shedding could also become incorporated into the brain extracellular matrix. Although biochemically and ultrastructurally distinct from collagen-rich fibrous extracellular matrices present in peripheral tissue, there is increasing evidence for the existence of an extracellular matrix in the brain. In adult brain tissue, a prominent component of this matrix appears to be large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (32Grumet M. Milev P. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Bourdon M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12142-12146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association with an extracellular matrix is suggested by the identification of a PBS- and Triton X-100-insoluble pool of N-syndecan in brain tissue. Matrix-associated N-syndecan could provide sites for cell adhesion or pathways for cell migration for cells that express N-syndecan binding proteins on their surface. Alternatively, it could provide a reservoir of heparin-binding growth factors. INTRODUCTIONThe syndecans are a gene family of transmembrane cell surface proteoglycans (reviewed in Refs. 1Bernfield M. Hinkes M. Gallo R. Development (Camb.). 1993; : 205-212Google Scholar and 2Elenius K. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2975-2982PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecans play an important role in tissue morphogenesis and differentiation by virtue of their ability to bind a number of extracellular adhesive proteins and growth factors. Four different syndecan core proteins that are the products of different genes are synthesized by mammalian cells. Syndecan synthesis is highly regulated (3Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M.

Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18740-18747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is dependent on both cell type and developmental state (8Kim C. Goldberger O. Gallo R. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Syndecan core proteins are characterized by highly conserved transmembrane and noncatalytic COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains but structurally distinct extracellular domains. This modular structural design suggests that individual mammalian syndecans have evolved to carry out specific functions within the tissues where they are expressed, probably related to the binding of specific extracellular ligands, but that these may be linked to common intracellular activities.We reported the cloning of a partial cDNA sequence from neonatal rat Schwann cells that coded for the syndecan core protein, which we called N-syndecan (9Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This proteoglycan is also expressed in the central nervous system. A highly homologous cDNA was cloned from chick embryo limb buds (10Gould S.E. Upholt W.B. Kosher R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3271-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Gould S.E. Upholt W.B. Kosher R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 438-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The chick proteoglycan, which appears to be the homologue of rat N-syndecan, was named syndecan-3.N-syndecan purified from neonatal rat brain has been used to study the ligand binding properties of the proteoglycan. In contrast to what has been reported for syndecan-1, brain N-syndecan binds poorly in solid-phase assays to most extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, laminin, and collagens I, III, IV, and V. The proteoglycan does bind with high affinity (KD = 5 x 10-10M) to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 1The abbreviations used are: bFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorHB-GAMheparin binding growth-associated moleculekbkilobase(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered saline.(12). N-syndecan has been proposed to be an endogenous heparin-like cofactor for bFGF in the developing brain. bFGF has been postulated to have a number of effects during development of the central nervous system, e.g. regulation of oligodendrocyte terminal differentiation (13Gard A.L. Pfeiffer S.E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 618-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 14Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). N-syndecan also binds to heparin binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM)(15), an extracellular matrix-associated adhesive protein that is expressed in the developing brain (16Merenmies J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and may function as a receptor for HB-GAM in neonatal brain tissue. Recently, we reported the purification of a novel, peripheral nerve-specific, extracellular matrix protein, p200, that binds N-syndecan (17Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). p200 is expressed in peripheral nerves during early postnatal development. Purified p200 promotes adhesion and spreading of Schwann cells.A determination of the biological function of N-syndecan would be facilitated by knowledge of the primary structure of the core protein and its expression in recombinant form, as well as information on the patterns of expression of N-syndecan in vivo. In this study, we report the complete amino acid sequence and expression of rat N-syndecan, the cloning and characterization of the rat N-syndecan gene, and an analysis of the tissue- and development-specific expression of N-syndecan."

We have tested this model by examining how Tax affects transcriptional activation mediated by the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) modulator (CREM). The CREM proteins are highly homologous to CREB, particularly in their DNA-binding domains and the kinase-inducible domain (KID), a region that interacts with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.

GlcA- and GalNAc-transferase activities from the bacterial membrane were assayed with acceptors derived from the capsule polysaccharide and radiolabeled UDP-[14C]GlcA and UDP-[3H]GalNAc, respectively. It was shown that defructosylated oligosaccharides (chondroitin) could serve as substrates for both the GlcA- and the GalNAc-transferases. The radiolabeled products were completely degraded with chondroitinase AC; the [14C]GlcA unit could be removed by β-D-glucuronidase, and the [3H]GalNAc could be removed by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. A fructosylated oligosaccharide acceptor tested for GlcA-transferase activity was found to be inactive. These results indicate that the chain elongation reaction of the K4 polysaccharide proceeds in the same way as the polymerization of the chondroitin chain, by the addition of the monosaccharide units one by one to the nonreducing end of the polymer. This makes the biosynthesis of the K4 polysaccharide an interesting parallel system for studies of chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis.

In contrast, chain elongation of hyaluronan (GlcAβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-4)n is claimed to occur at the reducing end (Prehm, P. (1983) Biochem. J. 211, 181-189).

The biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate polysaccharides has been intensively studied. These glycosaminoglycan chains are synthesized as proteoglycans. The chains are attached to serine units in the core protein via a tetrasaccharide linkage, and the polysaccharides are formed by the addition of monosaccharide units, one by one, from the corresponding UDP sugars to the nonreducing end of the growing chain (1Silbert J.E.

One very interesting finding from these studies is that the two glycosyl transferase activities seem to be catalyzed by one single protein with two catalytic sites. The glycosyltransferases involved in chain elongation of chondroitin sulfate, GalNAc- and GlcA-transferase, have so far not been purified, although their activities have been studied (7Gundlach M.W.

Two bacterial strains, Escherichia coli K5 and E. coli K4, synthesize polysaccharide capsules with the same backbone structures as heparin/heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, respectively (Fig. 1). The K5 bacteria produce a (GlcA-GlcNAc)n polymer (12Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J.

We have previously studied the biosynthesis of the K5 polysaccharide and found that chain elongation occurs in the same way as heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis. We have also demonstrated that the bacterial enzymes have the same substrate specificity regarding N-sulfate groups on the oligosaccharide acceptor as the mammalian ones (14Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. Jann K. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the K5 bacteria produce a nonsulfated polymer, the bacterial GlcA-transferase, like its mammalian equivalent, preferred oligosaccharides with an N-sulfate group on the penultimate GlcNAc unit from the reducing end (14Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. Jann K. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). fructose. The structure of E. coli K4 capsule polysaccharide has been characterized by Rodriguez et al. (13Rodriguez M.-L. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but the biosynthesis of the polymer has not been investigated. There are so far no reports of assays for the corresponding glycosyl transferases using endogenous primers or exogenous oligosaccharide acceptors. The aim of this study was to clarify whether polymerization of K4 polysaccharide occurred in the same way as that of the chondroitin polysaccharide. With bacterial K4 membranes as the enzyme source, we were able to assay the transfer of both [14C]GlcA and [3H]GalNAc to defructosylated K4 oligosaccharides (chondroitin oligosaccharides). The radiolabeled oligosaccharide products were identified by enzyme digestions. Both [14C]GlcA- and [3H]GalNAc-labeled products could be degraded by chondroitinase AC, the [14C]GlcA could be removed by β-glucuronidase, and the [3H]GalNAc could be removed by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. These results show that the radiolabeled monosaccharide units are added to the nonreducing end of a chondroitin oligosaccharide. On the other hand, when fructosylated K4 oligosaccharides (with a GalNAc unit at the nonreducing end) were tested as acceptors for the GlcA-transferase, no transfer of [14C]GlcA could be detected. Taken together, these findings show that K4 polysaccharide polymerization is analogous to that of chondroitin and that information about biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharide, both on protein and genetic levels, could be useful for understanding of chain elongation reaction in mammalian systems. Membranes from E. coli wild-type 05:K4:H4 (13Rodriguez M.-L. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were obtained as described (15Finke A. Bronner D. Nikolaev A.V. Jann B. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, bacteria were grown to late logarithmic phase and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C). The sediment was suspended in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 30 mM magnesium acetate, and 1.5 mM dithioerythritol and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C). The sediment was resuspended in the same buffer, and the bacteria were disrupted by three passages of the suspension through a French pressure cell. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to remove large bacterial fragments and then for 60 min at 100,000 × g at 4°C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in the same buffer. UDP-[14C]GlcA was prepared enzymatically from D-[14C]glucose (uniformly labeled, 321 mCi/mmol; The Radiochemical Center) as described (16Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Höök M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmström A. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and UDP-[1-3H]GalNAc (6.3 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear. UDP-GlcA, UDP-GalNAc, and bovine liver β-D-glucuronidase (type B-10) were from Sigma, and chondroitinase AC I (Flavobacterium heparinum) and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Jack Bean) were from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. Oligosaccharides of the type (GlcA-GalNAc)n-GlcA-2,5-anhydro-D-talose (n ≥ 8) with alternating sugar residues as exist in chondroitin were derived from the E. coli K4 polysaccharide (13Rodriguez M.-L. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (provided by Italfarmaco S.p.A., Milan, Italy). The K4 polysaccharide was first hydrolyzed by acid treatment at pH 1.5 at 80°C for 30 min to remove the fructose unit from the chondroitin backbone. For the cleavage of the polysaccharide and the separation of the oligosaccharide substrates, a similar method was used as for the K5 polysaccharide (5Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 289: 21-29Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In short, partial N-deacetylation (hydrazinolysis) of the K4 polysaccharide followed by deaminative cleavage at the resulting N-unsubstituted galactosamine units by treatment with nitrous acid at pH 3.9, gave a mixture of even numbered oligosaccharides. These were separated by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50, and fractions larger than octasaccharides were recovered and desalted. These oligosaccharides have a GlcA unit at the nonreducing end and can serve as substrates for the GalNAc-transferase. Substrates for the GlcA-transferase were created by β-glucuronidase digestion of the oligosaccharides. An alternative method used to make substrates for the GlcA-transferase was also applied: K4 polysaccharide (10 mg) with fructose units still retained in the polymer were digested with chondroitinase AC I, 0.75 units in Tris-HAc buffer, pH 7.3, in a final volume of 2.5 ml for 20 h. The polysaccharide chains were cleaved at positions lacking fructose units, and oligosaccharides with an unsaturated uronic acid at the nonreducing end, β-D-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid-GalNAc-(GlcA(Fru)-GalNAc)n (n ≥ 0) were recovered. Unsaturated uronic acid was removed by treatment with 10 mM mercuric acetate for 30 min. These odd numbered oligosaccharides, still containing the fructose GalNAc(GlcA(Fru)-GalNAc)n, were desalted on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) and tested as substrates for the GlcA-transferase. As a control, the Fru units were then removed by acid hydrolysis at pH 1.5 at 80°C for 30 min. The defructosylated oligosaccharides GalNAc-(GlcA-GalNAc)n were then desalted on a PD 10 column and used as substrates for the GlcA-transferase. Enzymatic transfer of GalNAc and GlcA units were studied by incubating acceptor oligosaccharides (0.5 mM corresponding to 90 μg of GlcA assay, as determined by the carbazole reaction), 2 μCi of UDP-[3H]GalNAc (0.5 mM UDP-GalNAc) or 1.35 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcA (0.5 mM UDP-GlcA), and 400 μg of bacterial membrane protein in a total volume of 100 μl of 10 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, and 1% Triton X-100. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the mixtures were centrifuged. The supernatants were neutralized with 50 μl of 1 M NaOH, mixed with 0.5 mg of carrier chondroitin sulfate, recentrifuged, and finally applied to gel filtration on a high pressure liquid chromatography (1.6 × 60 cm) Superdex 30 column, (Pharmacia) and eluted with 1 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a rate of 60 ml/h, and fractions of 1 ml were collected. For quantification of the radioactive product, the samples were applied to gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (1 × 100 cm) (Pharmacia) and eluted with 1 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a rate of 20 ml/h, and fractions of ∼1 ml were collected. Appropriate controls without added oligosaccharide acceptors were done in parallel for all incubations. Hexuronic acid was determined by the carbazole method (17Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5177) Google Scholar) using D-glucuronolactone as a standard. The concentrations of the defructosylated K4-derived oligosaccharides were estimated, assuming that GlcA accounted for half of the weight. Protein quantifications were made by BCA reagent (Pierce). Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry using a Beckman Model LS 6000IC apparatus. The K4 polysaccharide was subjected to acidic hydrolysis, which removed the fructose units from the polymer. These polysaccharide products were then partially N-deacetylated with hydrazine and cleaved at the resulting free amino groups with nitrous acid, pH 3.9 (18Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The resulting oligosaccharides, which have a GlcA unit at the nonreducing end, were separated by gel filtration. Oligosaccharides with ≥8 monosaccharide units were collected and used as acceptor oligosaccharides for the GalNAc-transferase. Oligosaccharide substrates for the GlcA-transferase were created in two different ways. 1) The oligosaccharides used for the assay of the GalNAc-transferase were treated with β-D-glucuronidase, which removes the GlcA unit at the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide, converting the oligosaccharides to a GlcA acceptor substrate. 2) In an alternative approach, where the purpose was to create a substrate in which fructose units were retained, the fructosylated K4 polysaccharide was digested with chondroitinase AC. The polysaccharide was partially degraded (Fig. 2), probably due to random loss of fructose units. Chondroitinase AC degrades chondroitin, but it does not degrade the fructosylated K4 polysaccharide. The unsaturated hexuronic acid that appears at the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharides after the digestion was removed by mercuric acetate, and the remaining fructosylated oligosaccharides of GalNAc(GlcA(Fru)-GalNAc)n type could be tested as acceptors for the GlcA-transferase. These oligosaccharides were then defructosylated by acidic hydrolysis, and substrates with the structure GalNAc-(GlcA-GalNAc)n were recovered (defructosylation of the polymer has been investigated in an earlier paper (13Rodriguez M.-L. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After digestion with chondroitinase AC, these defructosylated oligosaccharides appeared as disaccharides on the gel filtration Superdex 30 column (Fig. 2). On this occasion the enzyme completely degraded the oligosaccharides, showing that the fructose units were removed from the chains. The experimental conditions were chosen to optimize the incorporation of radioactive sugar to oligosaccharide substrates in order to get a sufficient amount of radiolabeled product for further analysis and were based on earlier experiences of chain elongation reactions in E. coli K5 (14Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. Jann K. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) membranes and microsomal membranes from mouse mastocytomas (5Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 289: 21-29Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because the incorporation of both [3H]GalNAc and [3H]GlcA to their specific substrates when incubated with E. coli K4 membranes solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 increased with incubation times of up to 30 min, this time was selected for the experiments described below. The effect of enzyme concentration was tested. It was found that in 15-min incubations transfer of both [3H]GalNAc and [3H]GlcA was linear with protein concentrations up to 4 mg/ml (data not shown). The membrane concentration was thus set to 4 mg of membrane protein/ml of incubation volume. The reactions above were carried out in a buffer containing 5 mM Ca2+, 10 mM Mn2+, and 10 mM Mg 2+, as used for studies of chain elongation of the E. coli K5 polysaccharide. The requirement for metal ions in the E. coli K4 system was tested in both glycosyltransferase reactions (Fig. 3), and a mixture of all three metal ions showed the highest activity. These conditions were thus maintained in the following experiments. Oligosaccharides with ≥8 monosaccharide units with a GlcA at the nonreducing end were tested as substrates for the bacterial GalNAc-transferase. Incubations with UDP-[3H]GalNAc, oligosaccharides, and bacterial K4 membranes solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 resulted in a radiolabeled product that was not found in control incubations without the addition of oligosaccharides (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the labeled product was completely degraded by chondroitinase AC, and after digestion, the label eluted as a monosaccharide on the gel filtration chromatogram (Fig. 4B). The released monosaccharide confirms that a single monosaccharide unit has been added to the nonreducing end of the chondroitin oligosaccharide (Fig. 1C). The main part of the incorporated [3H]GalNAc could also be removed by treatment with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Fig. 4B), an exo enzyme that removes β-linked GalNAc from the nonreducing end (Fig. 1C). The addition of UDP-GlcA, the other nucleotide sugar, to these assays had no influence on the amount of incorporated radioactivity, and we could only detect the transfer of one GalNAc unit to the exogenous oligosaccharide acceptors (data not shown). The incubations were also carried out with intact bacterial membranes, without the addition of Triton X-100. No polymerization was detected in any of these incubations in terms of higher incorporation of radioactivity or changed profiles in the gel chromatograms, but transfer of one GalNAc unit could be assayed in the same way as for the solubilized system (data not shown). No differences could be seen between solubilized and intact membranes regarding GalNAc transfer. GlcA-transferase activity was tested essentially as described for GalNAc-transferase, by the incubation of bacterial membrane with oligosaccharide acceptors with a terminal GalNAc (nonreducing end) and UDP-[14C]GlcA in 1% Triton X-100. Two different oligosaccharide substrates were tested (preparation method 2), one defructosylated chondroitin acceptor and one acceptor containing fructose units in the chain. A striking difference in the GlcA-transferase activity was noticed between the two different oligosaccharide substrates (Fig. 5A). The GlcA was readily transferred to the defructosylated acceptor, whereas the fructosylated acceptor did not incorporate GlcA at all (Fig. 5). From the elution profile of the product derived from the defructosylated substrate, it can also be shown that a heptasaccharide is large enough to serve as a substrate for the bacterial enzymes. The differences in the size of the substrate seen in Fig. 2 and in the product in Fig. 5 are mainly due to the detection method used. The gel filtration pattern of the substrate (Fig. 2) illustrates the content of hexuronic acid, whereas only the radiolabeled nonreducing ends are detected in the product. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that the difference might partly be due to GlcA-transferase having a preference for shorter oligosaccharide substrates. Digestion of the radiolabeled product by β-glucuronidase yielded labeled monosaccharides (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that the GlcA unit is added with a β-linkage to the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, when the oligosaccharide products were treated with chondroitinase AC, only labeled disaccharides could be detected (Fig. 5B), showing that the cleavage site of the enzyme is a disaccharide unit from the nonreducing end (Fig. 1D). The GlcA-transferase activity was also tested in incubations with the addition of UDP-GalNAc. No change in incorporated radioactivity could be seen due to this addition, and no polymerization was detected in the gel chromatograms (data not shown). Intact membrane fractions, assayed in the absence of Triton X-100, showed the same GlcA-transferase activity as did solubilized systems (data not shown). In order to test endogenous activity of polysaccharide degrading enzymes, oligosaccharides enzymatically labeled with [3H]GalNAc were recovered and incubated with fresh membrane enzymes. The radiolabeled product was recovered after separation from the UDP-[3H]GalNAc on a G-25 Sephadex gel filtration column (Fig. 6A). Four fractions, as indicated in the chromatogram, were pooled, concentrated, desalted on PD-10, evaporated, and added back to a membrane incubation with the same buffer used in the previous incubations. After 30 min at 37°C, the sample was applied to the same gel filtration column (Fig. 6B). No degradation could be detected. The mechanisms regarding polysaccharide biosynthesis has earlier been investigated for mammalian heparin/heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronan synthesis. The hyaluronan polysaccharide, which does not form proteoglycans and is synthesized at the cell membrane (19Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), is claimed to elongate at the reducing end (20Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For the hyaluronan producing bacterium Streptococcus pyogenenes, the mechanism for chain elongation has so far not been studied. The biosynthesis of polysialic acid from capsule-producing E. coli bacteria has been intensively investigated, and Rohr and Troy (21Rohr T.E. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2332-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the polymer, although its polymerization only involves one sugar unit, is elongated at the nonreducing end. The biosynthesis of the K4 polymer has not previously been studied, and it is not clear what primes the polysaccharide or how it is anchored to the membrane, and it is not obvious that it proceeds in the same way as chondroitin biosynthesis. In the biosynthesis of mammalian chondroitin, the polysaccharide is attached to a core protein, and chain elongation of the polysaccharides occurs in the Golgi vesicles. In E. coli bacteria, polymerization of the K5 and K4 polysaccharides occurs at the cytoplasmic membrane, and the polysaccharides are then translocated through the bacterial membranes and transported out of the organism (22Jann B. Jann K. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 19-42PubMed Google Scholar). The attachment site of the reducing end of the bacterial polysaccharide is not known. K5 polysaccharides isolated from the bacterial capsule have been shown to contain 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate and phosphatidic acid at the reducing end (15Finke A. Bronner D. Nikolaev A.V. Jann B. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but polysaccharides isolated from mutated K5 bacteria deficient in the transportation/translation mechanisms with the polysaccharide appearing inside the cell lack phosphatidyl-2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (23Bronner D. Siebert V. Pazzani C. Roberts I.S. Boulnois G.J. Jann B. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5984-5992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the reducing 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate is added to the polymer after synthesis during transportation and translocation of the polysaccharide out of the cell. We have previously studied the glycosyltransferase activities in the bacterial membranes from K5 bacteria and have found that chain elongation of the K5 polysaccharide behaves in much the same way as the mammalian enzymes involved in heparin biosynthesis (14Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. Jann K. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The sugar units are added one by one from the corresponding UDP sugars to the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide, and like the mammalian enzyme, the GlcA-transferase also has preferences for specific N-sulfated oligosaccharides (5Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 289: 21-29Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. Jann K. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). E. coli K5 bacteria are thus a good parallel system for studies of the polymerization reaction in heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis. The study of polymerization of the K4 polysaccharide is rather ambiguous, because the role of the fructose units in the polymer is obscure. The sugar donor for the fructose units is still unknown, and it is not clear how fructoses are added to the polymer during biosynthesis. The results of this study show that both the GlcA and the GalNAc units can be added to exogenous chondroitin oligosaccharides that lack fructose (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). We have also used bacterial-derived chondroitin oligosaccharides in assays with mammalian enzymes, and we have found that these oligosaccharides work as well as chondroitin oligosaccharides derived from other sources (data not shown). Similar oligosaccharide substrates have previously been used in studies of chondroitin polymerization using enzymes from chick embryo chondrocytes (7Gundlach M.W. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) where these oligosaccharides were shown to be acceptors for the transfer GalNAc and GlcA units. Bacterial glycosyltransferases seem to have similar requirements for the acceptor substrates as for chondroitin sulfate-forming enzymes. The fact that fructosylated oligosaccharides were not acceptors for the GlcA-transferase (Fig. 5) strongly indicates that fructose units are added to the polymer either after the formation of the chondroitin backbone or as a second step after the addition of GlcA and of the GalNAc units further downstream in the polymer. Digestion of the radiolabeled products with β-D-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase proves that the GlcA and the GalNAc monosaccharides were added to the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharides, because radiolabeled monosaccharides were released from the enzymatically labeled product (Figs. 4B and 5B). The complete degradation of the [14C]GlcA- and [3H]GalNAc-labeled products with chondroitinase AC shows that the products are chondroitin (Figs. 4B and 5B). These results suggest that bacterial biosynthesis of K4 polysaccharide proceeds in the same way as chondroitin biosynthesis and that the addition of fructose units is not critical for chain elongation. This makes the E. coli K4 bacterium a suitable parallel system for studies of chondroitin biosynthesis in the same way as E. coli K5 polysaccharide biosynthesis is a parallel system for studies of heparin biosynthesis. We are grateful to Dr. Klaus Jann for support by providing us with E. coli K4 bacteria."

We found that forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, markedly enhanced GnT-III at the transcriptional level in various hepatoma cells and hepatocytes, resulting in an increase of bisecting GlcNAc residues in various glycoproteins, as judged from the lectin binding to erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA).

Iron is essential for most metabolic processes in living cells but is also potentially cytotoxic due to its ability to promote the formation of toxic oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). Consequently, nearly all cellular systems have evolved mechanisms that allow them to tightly regulate their intracellular concentrations of this metal (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Arch. Biochem.

Acquisition of iron bound to transferrin via receptor-mediated endocytosis has been the mechanism of iron acquisition most extensively studied in macrophages and other cell types (2De Jong G.

However, macrophages and other myeloid cells possess a high capacity transferrin-independent mechanism for iron acquisition from a variety of low molecular weight iron chelates (11Hamazaki S. Glass J. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 436-441PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chitambar C.R. Sax D. Blood. 1992; 80: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Byrd T.F. Horwitz M.A. J. Clin.

The exact mechanism is not yet known, but does not involve endocytosis or pinocytosis (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this system can acquire iron at a rate far in excess of transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). One important additional feature of the macrophage transferrin-independent iron acquisition mechanism is that iron markedly stimulates the rate of its own acquisition (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a previous report with the HL-60 myeloid cell line (12Chitambar C.R. Sax D. Blood. 1992; 80: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the trivalent metals gallium and aluminum also exhibited the capacity to markedly induce the rate of iron acquisition from nitrilotriacetate (NTA) 1The abbreviations used are: NTAnitrilotriacetateGHLglycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysineMEM-αminimal essental medium-αBPSbathophenanthroline sulfateFZFerrozine. by macrophages and other myeloid cells (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of induction of increased iron uptake resulting from exposure to these trivalent metals remained undefined. nitrilotriacetate glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine minimal essental medium-α bathophenanthroline sulfate Ferrozine. Under conditions of iron overload, transferrin becomes saturated, and its capacity to remove extracellular iron is overwhelmed (15Bonkovsky H.L. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1991; 301: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 16Bacon B.R. Britton R.S. Hepatology. 1990; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, the concentration of small molecular weight iron chelates may increase. Thus, increased iron uptake by the transferrin-independent mechanism of macrophages may be an important means of rapid clearance of cytotoxic iron and protection against potential for iron-mediated tissue injury. Given the potential importance of this second mechanism of iron acquisition by myeloid cells, we performed a series of experiments designed to further characterize and define the mechanism and metal-mediated regulation of transferrin-independent iron acquisition by myeloid cells. The human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line was cultured in RPMI (University of Iowa Cancer Center, Iowa City, IA) containing 10% serum plus glutamine (2 mM, Sigma), penicillin, and streptomycin (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, [59Fe]Cl3 (Amersham Corp., 100 μCi/ml) was added in a 1:1 molar ratio to the desired low molecular weight chelator. [67Ga]Citrate was obtained from Mallinkrodt Chemical Works and diluted to the desired concentration prior to use. Chelates employed included NTA (Sigma), EDTA (Mallinkrodt), citrate (Fisher), ascorbate (Sigma), ADP (Sigma), glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine (GHL, Aldrich), diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (Sigma), and deferoxamine (Sigma). Cells were washed three times in MEM-α (University of Iowa Cancer Center, Iowa City, IA), resuspended in the same medium at 5 × 106/ml, and then placed in a 96-well plate at 100 μl/well for 15 min (5% CO2, 37°C). The desired 59Fe or 67Ga chelate (740 nM) was then added. After the desired period of 59Fe or 67Ga exposure, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min (4°C) and the medium was carefully aspirated. At this temperature, cellular iron acquisition is negligible (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). The cell pellet in each well was washed three times in the same volume of MEM-α and the amount of cell-associated 59Fe or 67Ga was determined by gamma counter. Parallel experiments were performed each day in the absence of cells to control for possible 59Fe binding to the plate or formation of non-cell associated iron or gallium aggregates which might have co-sedimented with the cells. These values, usually between 0.05 and 0.2% of total counts/min added, were subtracted from corresponding experimental samples for each time interval. In some experiments cells were incubated with gallium or other metals for defined time periods (usually 30 min) at 37°C prior to measurement of 59Fe or 67Ga acquisition. In other studies cells were incubated with various metabolic pathway inhibitors (NaCN (1 mM) and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (50 mM)) for 1 h at 37°C. The medium was removed and the cells resuspended in fresh medium containing the inhibitors. After 15 min of incubation at the same temperature, iron or gallium acquisition was measured as above. Cells (2 × 106/ml) were washed as described above and then incubated with a combination of NaCN (1 mM) and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (50 mM) for 1 h (37°C). At the end of incubation period the cells were centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min, 4°C). Six percent cold perchloric acid was added to the cell pellets (2 × 106/ml), which were then allowed to stand for 15 min at 4°C. The suspension was centrifuged (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4°C). The supernatant was withdrawn into an Eppendorf tube and the acid was neutralized with 4 M KOH and 0.5 M imidazole. The solution was kept frozen at −80°C until analyzed. The cell pellets were solubilized with 0.2% SDS in 1 N NaOH (pH 11.2) for protein determination. Cellular ATP was measured by the luciferin-luciferase method with use of a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, San Diego, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. ATP content was expressed as nanomoles of ATP per milligram of protein, with protein content being determined by the method of Avruch and Wallach (17Avruch J. Wallach D.F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Assessment of cellular reduction of ferricyanide was carried out in Hanks' balanced salt saline according to the method of Inman et al. (18Inman R.S. Coughlan M.M. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11850-11857Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells (4 × 107/ml) were incubated with 1 mM ferricyanide in the presence or absence of the desired trivalent metal, at 37°C with agitation. At specific time intervals, 1 ml of the cell suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged. The optical density of the spent medium was obtained at 420 nm. In other experiments, reduction of ferric iron chelated to NTA was measured in the presence of 1 mM bathophenanthroline sulfate (BPS) or Ferrozine (FZ), and the formation of the [Fe2+]BPS or [Fe2+]FZ complex was measured spectrophotometrically (3Olakanmi O. McGowan S.E. Hayek M.B. Britigan B.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Coffman T.J. Cox C.D. Edeker B.L. Britigan B.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107/ml) were desialated by incubation with neuraminidase (0.25 unit/ml, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany) at 37°C for 1 h. The cells were washed three times and then exposed to the trivalent metal of interest before the measurement of iron acquisition. The activity of neuraminidase was assessed with thiobarbituric acid assay of released sialic acids (20Warren L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1971-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, sulfhydryl groups on the cell membrane were modified by incubation with 5 mM solution of either iodoacetic acid, N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, or 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 37°C for 15 min. The cells were washed twice prior to induction, and measurement of cellular iron acquisition was subsequently determined. Cells were incubated in 740 nM [59Fe]NTA or [59Fe]GHL in the presence or absence of 1 mM Ga(NO3)3 for 1 h at 37°C. The cells were washed free of non-cell-associated 59Fe. The cells were then cavitated and fractionated into membrane and cytosolic components as described previously (3Olakanmi O. McGowan S.E. Hayek M.B. Britigan B.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) following which 59Fe associated with each fraction was determined by gamma counter. We (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar) and other laboratories (12Chitambar C.R. Sax D. Blood. 1992; 80: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kaplan J. Jordan I. Sturrock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Richardson D. Baker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13972-13979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that, prior exposure to iron, gallium or aluminum increases the rate of the acquisition of iron from low molecular weight chelating agents by HL-60 and other myeloid cells (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism responsible for the ability of these trivalent metals to mediate this induction process is not known. Although iron is the most physiologically relevant of these metals, it is technically difficult to assess if a compound induces its own rate of acquisition. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism of gallium-induced iron acquisition by HL-60 cells as a model for the iron-induced process in these and other myeloid cells. First, we determined the optimal experimental conditions for gallium-induced iron acquisition from NTA by HL-60 cells. Dose response studies showed that exposure of HL-60 cells to a gallium concentration of 1 mM for 30 min leads to maximal induction of iron acquisition (Fig. 1A). Shorter incubation times led to lesser induction even at gallium concentrations in excess of 1 mM (Fig. 1B). Preincubation for longer time periods with lower gallium concentrations produced less than maximal induction (Fig. 1B). We next examined the effect of the chelate to which 59Fe was complexed on the ability of gallium to increase the rate of HL-60 acquisition of iron. As shown in Fig. 2, 1 mM gallium increased the rate of iron acquisition from each chelating agent examined. However, the magnitude of the rate of iron acquisition varied with the iron chelate used, just as we had previously observed in the basal (uninduced) state (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). With each of the iron chelates examined a plateau of cell-associated iron was seen after 40-60 min (Fig. 2). This plateau was not the result of depletion of 59Fe from the system as the amount of 59Fe initially added was always considerably greater than that which became cell-associated. If gallium exposure truly increases cellular iron acquisition, the iron should remain cell-associated. To determine the extent to which acquired 59Fe could be dissociated from the gallium-induced HL-60 cells, wash out experiments were conducted. Cells were incubated with [59Fe]NTA in the presence or absence of 1 mM gallium for 30 min. Non-cell-associated 59Fe was removed by repetitive washing (three washes, 4 min/wash, 4°C), and the cells were resuspended in iron-free medium at 37°C. At various time intervals, aliquots were removed and both cell-associated and medium-containing 59Fe were determined. As shown in Fig. 3, cell-associated 59Fe remained stable over 2 h of incubation at 37°C after an initial release of approximately 20% in the first 10 min. Although much greater amounts of iron were associated initially with gallium-induced cells, both induced and noninduced cells retained similar percentages of initial cell-associated 59Fe. These studies thus indicate that iron acquired by HL-60 cells after gallium induction does not readily dissociate from the cell. We next examined the cellular location of newly acquired iron. Control and gallium-induced HL-60 cells were incubated with [59Fe]NTA or [59Fe]GHL following which they were washed and subjected to subcellular fractionation. As shown in Table I, both the absolute amount and the proportion of 59Fe associated with the membrane-containing subcellular fractions was greater in gallium-induced cells than in the control cells. However, consistent with our previous data (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar), a high percentage of newly acquired iron was associated with the membrane-containing compartment even in the control cells.Table I.Location of 59Fe acquired by HL-60 cellsChelates59Fe acquired11,000 × g pellet100,000 × g pellet100,000 × g supernatant[59Fe]NTA (uninduced)23.6 (1.17)aNumbers in parentheses are the actual amount of 59Fe (pmol 59Fe) measured in each fraction per 106 cell equivalence.8.3 (0.41)33.6 (1.67)[59Fe]NTA (Ga-induced)70.9 (26.9)1.1 (0.42)1.9 (0.72)[59Fe]GHL (uninduced)22.0 (6.6)8.7 (2.61)10.3 (3.09)[59Fe]GHL (Ga-induced)72.9 (37.13)1.2 (0.62)1.7 (0.89)a Numbers in parentheses are the actual amount of 59Fe (pmol 59Fe) measured in each fraction per 106 cell equivalence. Open table in a new tab Basal (uninduced) iron acquisition from NTA by myeloid cells is independent of the level of cellular ATP and active protein synthesis (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether the gallium-mediated induction process was also energy independent. When cells were treated with 1 mM NaCN and 50 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (dual inhibition of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation), there was a 98% decrease in cellular levels of ATP (Fig. 4). However, depletion of ATP had no effect on the ability of gallium to induce iron acquisition from NTA or citrate (Fig. 4). Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide (1 mM for 60 min.) also had no effect on the ability of gallium to increase the rate of iron acquisition from NTA (not shown). Having shown that the HL-60 cell iron acquisition rate dramatically increases in the presence of gallium, the extent to which extracellular gallium needed to be present for the maintenance of the induced state was assessed. HL-60 cells were incubated in 1 mM Ga(NO3)3 for 30 min following which extracellular gallium was removed. The cells were suspended in gallium-free medium, and their ability to acquire 59Fe from NTA was measured at defined time points. Cells freshly removed from Ga(NO3)3 exhibited identical iron acquisition kinetics relative to those in which extracellular gallium was maintained (Fig. 5). Over the next 4 h, a slow decrease in the rate of iron acquisition was noted. However, even 4 h after gallium removal, acquisition of 59Fe from NTA remained about 60% of that of the cells which were continually exposed to Ga(NO3)3 (Fig. 5). Thus, once the iron acquisition system is induced, it is maintained in this state for several hours unless removed by chelators. In previous work, low concentrations of the trivalent metals gallium, aluminum, and iron, but none of a variety of divalent metals (zinc, cadmium, copper, and manganese) increased the rate of macrophage iron acquisition (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike iron, aluminum and gallium are not reducible under physiologic conditions. These data suggested that induction of myeloid cell iron acquisition may be a function of the valence of the metal to which the cells are exposed. Extending our earlier data (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar), pre-exposure (30 min) of HL-60 cells with a 1 mM concentration of divalent metal salts (copper, cadmium, manganese, and zinc) was associated with only a modest (less than 2-fold) increase in iron acquisition from NTA or citrate (data not shown). In contrast, cells preexposed to a 1 mM concentration of the trivalent metals iron, aluminum, lanthanum, or gadolinium each induced iron acquisition from NTA by HL-60 cells to a similar or greater extent than that observed with gallium (Fig. 6). Following cell exposure to lanthanum and gadolinium, iron acquisition was 1.6-1.8 as great as with gallium. The concentration of each metal required for maximum induction was similar to that with gallium (1 mM). Tetravalent metals (tin or zirconium, 1 mM) induced iron acquisition at least as well if not better than lanthanum or gadolinium (Fig. 6). In order to assess whether induction of iron acquisition resulted from exposure to any multivalent cation, HL-60 cells were preincubated with the polyvalent cation, polylysine. This treatment had no effect on iron uptake whatsoever (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the ability to markedly increase the rate of iron acquisition by HL-60 cells is limited to trivalent and tetravalent metal salts. In both gallium-induced and control cells, iron acquisition by myeloid cells is dependent on the agent to which iron is chelated (14Olakanmi O. Stokes J.B. Britigan B.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2691-2703PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Therefore, we examined the extent to which the chelating agent influenced a metal's capacity to induce the rate of HL-60 cell iron acquisition. Like the rate of iron acquisition from these same chelates, the potency of individual iron chelates to increase the rate of HL-60 cell acquisition of 59Fe from NTA is also chelate dependent (Fig. 7). Cells exposed to some ferric iron chelates (Fe-GHL, Fe-ADP) resulted in higher rates of iron acquisition from NTA than those treated with Ga(NO3)3, Other iron chelates (e.g. Fe-EDTA or Fe-deferoxamine) appeared to be very poor inducers of the iron acquisition mechanism. In contrast to the iron results, if HL-60 cells were exposed to gallium, aluminum, gadolinium, or lanthanum which was first chelated by NTA or citrate, no induction of iron acquisition was observed (not shown). In fact, additional studies with gallium indicated that many chelates prevented gallium induction. We next asked whether these chelating agents could reverse the induction resulting from previous exposure of the cells to Ga(NO3)3. HL-60 were exposed to gallium (NO3)3 (1 mM× 30 min) following which 0.5 mM NTA, citrate, ascorbate, or ADP were added for 10 min and then removed by washing. Analysis of the observed rate of subsequent acquisition of 59Fe from NTA by these cells indicated the gallium-mediated induction of iron acquisition was rapidly reversed by exposure to each of the metal chelators employed. Iron acquisition was decreased to 25, 18, 48, and 60% of the gallium-treated control by NTA, citrate, ascorbate, and ADP, respectively. The extent of the reversal process was dependent on the concentration of the chelator employed with the threshold for the effect with NTA in the range of 100 μM. It seemed most likely that the ability of these various metal chelating agents to reverse gallium-mediated induction of iron acquisition is that they remove gallium from a critical cellular site necessary to maintain the “induced” phenotype. Subsequent analysis supported this hypothesis. HL-60 cells were incubated with 740 nM [67Ga]citrate for 60 min following which the cells were repetitively washed and then resuspended in the presence or absence of 100 μM NTA or citrate. Incubation of these cells with NTA or citrate resulted in a rapid (10 min) loss of nearly 50% of cell-associated 67Ga with a slower decrease over 2 h (Fig. 8). In the absence of exposure to the chelating agent, cell-associated 67Ga was unchanged over 2 h (Fig. 8). These data suggest that various metal-chelating agents are capable of removing gallium from a cellular compartment necessary to maintain the cell at its maximum capacity for iron acquisition. Previous work by Chitambar and Sax (12Chitambar C.R. Sax D. Blood. 1992; 80: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested an interrelationship between gallium and iron acquisition by HL-60 cells. Consistent with their observations, we found that the kinetics of HL-60 acquisition of 67Ga from citrate was similar to that observed for 59Fe if the cells were not previously induced (Fig. 9). Furthermore, preincubation of HL-60 cells for 30 min with 1 mM Ga(NO3)3 greatly increased uptake of 67Ga by these cells (Fig. 9). The kinetics of this induced state for gallium acquisition is also similar to that for iron acquisition after gallium induction (compare Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9). Several reports using other cellular systems, have suggested that acquisition of ferric iron (Fe3+) from non-transferrin chelates is coupled to its reduction to ferrous iron (Fe2+) (18Inman R.S. Coughlan M.M. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11850-11857Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Oshiro S. Nakajima H. Markello T. Krasnewich D. Bernadini I. Gahl W.A. J. Biol.

This was based on the findings that iron uptake by these cells was inhibited by the presence of ferrous iron chelators such as BPS or FZ. Consistent with these studies we found that 59Fe acquisition from NTA by HL-60 was inhibited by 90% in the presence of BPS and by 40% in the presence of FZ (Fig. 10). This inhibition of iron acquisition was observed with both gallium-induced and control cells. Inhibition of iron acquisition was observed in the presence of as little as 0.5 mM BPS with maximum inhibition seen at 1.5 mM BPS. The inhibitory effect of BPS on gallium-induced iron acquisition does not relate to the removal of cell-associated gallium. Cell-associated 67Ga is virtually unaffected by subsequent incubation with 1 mM BPS over 2 h (data not shown). In contrast to iron, gallium cannot be reduced to Ga2+ under physiologic conditions. Since BPS selectively chelates divalent metals, if the effect of BPS is mediated by its chelation of reduced iron, we hypothesized that acquisition of gallium by HL-60 cells should not be altered by this compound. HL-60 cells were pre-exposed to nonradioactive 1 mM Ga(NO3)3 for 30 min. Acquisition of 67Ga by HL-60 cell was then measured in the presence of BPS or FZ. Acquisition was not significantly affected by the presence of FZ. However, BPS caused a 60% decrease in 67Ga acquisition by induced cells (Fig. 11). This result implies that BPS interferes at least in part with iron acquisition by a mechanism which does not involve its interaction with reduced forms of iron. As an alternative means of assessing the role of cellular reductase activity on iron acquisition by HL-60 cells, we examined the effect of potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6), a competitive substrate of membrane reductases (18Inman R.S. Coughlan M.M. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11850-11857Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), on the rate of iron acquisition. If iron reduction were critical to the iron acquisition process, ferricyanide might compete with the 59Fe chelate for the critical reductase (24Randell E.W. Parkes J.G. Olivieri N.F. Templeton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16046-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we observed no inhibition of iron acquisition either when K3Fe(CN)6 was co-incubated with [59Fe]NTA or with a pre-exposure of cells to K3Fe(CN)6 prior to measurement of iron acquisition (not shown). In addition, we preincubated HL-60 cells with N-ethylmaleimide or p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, known chemical inactivators of membrane reductases. Neither of these reagents had any effect on iron acquisition or gallium induction. Together, these data along with the BPS/FZ effects raise substantial questions about the role of iron reduction in this acquisition process. Given the ability of gallium to increase HL-60 cell iron acquisition from various chelates and some partial evidence (see above) that iron reduction could be involved in the iron acquisition process, we investigated the effect of gallium exposure on cellular reductase activity.

Upon binding to YsT9, the fluorescence of FL1 and FL2 was quenched 45-57% with no shift in the excitation and emission spectra, and polarization of fluorescence increased by 300-335%. With fluorescence quenching and polarization as sensitive signals for antibody-bound labeled O-chains, the equilibrium constants for binding of FL1, FL2, and unlabeled O-chain to YsT9 were determined to be within a similar order (1.5 x 107 to 2.0 x 107M-1) using a nonlinear curve fitting approach rather than Scatchard analysis. These results indicated that covalent attachment of fluorescein groups to the O-chain did not influence the recognition of the YsT9-defined epitope by the antibody. The reversibility of the O-chain-antibody reaction was also demonstrated by showing a rapid depolarization of the labeled O-chain-antibody complex in the presence of unlabeled O-chain, suggesting that this displacement experiment could be exploited to quantify the Brucella polysaccharide antigen. The study described here provides a useful model for characterization of the complex formation between a carbohydrate-binding protein and a carbohydrate ligand and also for the design of a homogeneous assay system to quantitate antigens or antibodies of clinical interest.

Upon binding to YsT9, the fluorescence of FL1 and FL2 was quenched 45-57% with no shift in the excitation and emission spectra, and polarization of fluorescence increased by 300-335%. With fluorescence quenching and polarization as sensitive signals for antibody-bound labeled O-chains, the equilibrium constants for binding of FL1, FL2, and unlabeled O-chain to YsT9 were determined to be within a similar order (1.5 x 107 to 2.0 x 107M-1) using a nonlinear curve fitting approach rather than Scatchard analysis. These results indicated that covalent attachment of fluorescein groups to the O-chain did not influence the recognition of the YsT9-defined epitope by the antibody. The reversibility of the O-chain-antibody reaction was also demonstrated by showing a rapid depolarization of the labeled O-chain-antibody complex in the presence of unlabeled O-chain, suggesting that this displacement experiment could be exploited to quantify the Brucella polysaccharide antigen.

Brucella abortus, a Gram-negative bacterium of the genus Brucella, is pathogenic for animals, causing abortions in cattle and a debilitating fever (undulant fever) in humans. The smooth-type lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: S-LPSsmooth-type lipopolysaccharideLPSlipopolysaccharideFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographymAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline. of B. abortus is recognized as an immunodominant cell surface molecule involved in the antibody response to the infection (1Diaz R.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 19-64Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the B. abortus S-LPS with mild acid yields a specific polysaccharide fragment constituted by an O-chain linear homopolymer of 1,2-linked 4,6-dideoxy-4-formamido-ä-D-mannopyranosyl units (2Cherwonogrodzky J.W.

The O-chain polysaccharide (designated the O-chain) is linked via a core oligosaccharide to lipid A, which anchors the LPS molecule to the outer membrane (2Cherwonogrodzky J.W. Dubray G. Moreno E. Mayer H. Nielsen K. Duncan J.R. Animal Brucellosis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 19-64Google Scholar). Structural studies revealed that B. abortus and Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:9 share a common O-chain polysaccharide (3Caroff M. Bundle D.R. Perry M.B. Cherwonogrodzky J.W. Duncan J.R. Infect.

It has been demonstrated with murine monoclonal antibodies that antibodies specific for the O-chain or S-LPS are protective in passive immunity to B. abortus infection (7Montaraz J.A. Winter A.J.

Pasteur Immunol. 1987; 138: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The humoral immune response to LPS in B. abortus-infected cattle was previously monitored for antibody titer and content of immunoglobulin subclass (9Nielsen K. Cherwonogrodzky J.W. Duncan J.R. Bundle D.R. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1989; 50: 5-9PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nielsen K. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1990; 24: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but characterization of an anti-B. abortus antiserum in terms of antibody affinity had not been described. Antibody affinity has been recognized as an important factor in the immune response in terms of clearance of pathogens, response to vaccination, or pathogenesis of infectious diseases (11Steward M.W.

It has become clear that the antibody affinity is very likely to influence the efficiency of the assay employed for its quantification (11Steward M.W. Steensgaard J.

Because of the importance of B. abortus in animal and human infections and the great value of the O-chain in the diagnosis of brucellosis (2Cherwonogrodzky J.W. Dubray G. Moreno E. Mayer H. Nielsen K. Duncan J.R. Animal Brucellosis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 19-64Google Scholar, 15Nielsen K. Gall D. Genet. Eng. Biotech. 1994; 14: 25-39Google Scholar), it was considered that characterization of the complex formation between the O-chain and a specific monoclonal antibody in terms of affinity would provide a useful analysis model that could be exploited to assess the antibody response to infection or vaccination and could assist in the design of a more efficient assay system where the O-chain and a monoclonal antibody are employed for the diagnosis of brucellosis. This paper reports purification of B. abortus O-chain and modification of it with fluorescein isothiocyanate for use in measurement of the equilibrium (affinity) constant for binding of the O-chain to a specific murine antibody YsT9 by fluorescence quenching and polarization. The antibody YsT9 was characterized as binding to a linear ä-1,2-linked tetrasaccharide determinant that was common to the Brucella A and M, and Y. enterocolitica O:9 polysaccharide antigens (16Meikle P.J. Perry M.B. Cherwonogrodzky J.W. Bundle D.R. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2820-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bundle D.R. Cherwonogrodzky J.W. Gidney M.A.J. Meikle P.J. Perry M.B. Peters T. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2829-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reversibility of the O-chain-antibody reaction was also examined by displacement experiments using the labeled O-chain probe. This is the first application of such techniques to the investigation of binding of a bacterial polysaccharide fragment to the corresponding monoclonal antibody on a quantitative basis. The study described here demonstrated that the chemical linkage of fluorescein groups to a bacterial carbohydrate antigen provides a probe suitable for quantitation of the complex formation between a carbohydrate-binding antibody and a carbohydrate. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) isomer I was purchased from Sigma; Affi-Prep Polymyxin gel, from Bio-Rad; HPLC columns of TSK G2000 SWG (21.5 x 600 mm) and TSK G2000 SW (7.5 x 600 mm), from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) YsT9 (IgG3) specific for the B. abortus O-chain, originally developed by Bundle et al. (18Bundle D.R. Gidney M.A.J. Perry M.B. Duncan J.R. Cherwonogrodzky J.W. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 389-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was purified from ascitic fluid through a column of Protein G-Sepharose (1 x 6.4 cm). A mAb, M178, which reacts with Salmonella typhimurium and isolates of most Salmonella O serogroups, was obtained from the Animal Diseases Research Institute (Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Freeze-dried B. abortus S1119-3 cells (10 g) were suspended in 400 ml of 2% (v/v) acetic acid and autoclaved for 15 min at 121°C. After the suspension was cooled on ice and neutralized to pH 7.0 with NaOH, trichloroacetic acid (20 g) was added with stirring for 40 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 6,000 x g for 1 h. The supernatant (designated the crude extract) was collected, dialyzed against H2O overnight, and lyophilized. The dry crude extract was divided into three aliquots. Each aliquot was dissolved in 15 ml of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 100 mM NaCl (Buffer A) and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C to remove the insoluble material. The supernatant was then applied, at 0.5 ml/min, to a column of Affi-Prep Polymyxin gel (25 x 110 mm) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. Fractions of 8 ml were collected and monitored for absorption at 200 nm. Fractions of unbound material (designated the crude polysaccharide fraction) were collected, dialyzed against H2O, and lyophilized. The crude polysaccharide fraction (250 μl, 4 mg/ml) in 0.1 M Na2HPO-NaH2PO4 (Buffer B, pH 7.0) was applied, at 1 ml/min, to a column of TSK G2000 SW (7.5 x 600 mm), which had been connected to a LKB HPLC system and pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and monitored for absorption at 200 nm or assayed for total sugar according to the colorimetric method (19Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40882) Google Scholar). For large scale preparation of the O-chain, the crude polysaccharide fraction (1.3 ml, 20 mg/ml) was loaded, at 1 ml/min, onto a column of TSK G2000 SWG (21.5 x 600 mm). The elution profile on TSK G2000 SW (7.5 x 600 mm) was shown in Fig. 1. Fractions of peak 1 and peak 2 were pooled separately, dialyzed against H2O, and lyophilized. SDS-PAGE of the O-chain preparation (prior to labeling) with both Coomassie Blue and silver staining procedures showed that the preparation did not contain any protein components. Lyophilized O-chain polysaccharide (3 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. FITC (1.5 or 30 mg) was then added to react with the O-chain in the dark for 1 h at 37°C. Following incubation, the reaction mixture was immediately applied, at 0.5 ml/min, to a column of Sephadex G-25 (1 x 23 cm) pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and monitored for absorption at 495 nm. The elution profile showed two well separated peaks. Fractions of the first peak, which contained the fluorescein-labeled O-chain, was pooled and stored at 4°C in the presence of 0.01% NaN3. FL1 and FL2 were used to designate the labeled O-chain preparations at 0.5:1 and 10:1 starting ratios (w/w) of FITC to O-chain, respectively. The degree of incorporation of FITC into the O-chain was determined by independent measurements of the concentrations of FITC and O-chain in a given sample. The FITC concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically, taking the molar absorption coefficient to be 7.45 x 1 04M-1 cm-1 (20Bernhardt R. Ngoc Dao N.T. Stiel H. Schwarze W. Friedrich J. Janig G.-R. Ruckpaul K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 745: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The concentration of O-chain in this sample was determined by the colorimetric method (19Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40882) Google Scholar) using the unlabeled O-chain as standard. PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) with 4% stacking gels and 15% resolving gels using a Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus. Sodium dodecyl sulfate was omitted in all the buffers. The polysaccharide samples were mixed with an equal volume of the sample buffer and loaded onto a gel without heat treatment. Dot immunoblots were carried out basically as described for Western blotting (22Lin M. Turpin D.H. Plaxton W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with the exception that samples were applied directly to a nitrocellulose membrane. A Pharmacia LKB Ultrospec Plus spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech, Baie D'Urfe, Quebec, Canada) was used to measure the absorbance. A SLM-Aminco model 8000C spectrofluorometer equipped with an IBM microcomputer and a circulating water bath was used for determination of fluorescence excitation and emission spectra. Excitation and emission bandpasses were 8 and 16 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 nm and 520 nm, respectively. Spectra were smoothed using the SLM data manipulation software. Fluorescence intensity of a given sample was determined at optimal excitation (495 nm) and emission (517 nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence polarization was measured using a FPM-1 fluorescence polarization analyzer (Jolley Consulting and Research, Inc., Round Lake, IL). A solution of fluorescein-labeled O-chain at 9 x 10-5 g/liter for FL1 or 3 x 10-5 g/liter for FL2 was prepared in 2 ml of PBS and titrated with 5-μl aliquots of a specific or control antibody solution. The steady-state fluorescence intensity or polarization was measured after incubation for 10 min. The values of fluorescence intensity or polarization were corrected for background readings. The accumulative titrating volume was kept less than 4% of the initial volume of the antigen solution. In these titration experiments, the labeled O-chain was used at a considerably low concentration (at least 100-fold lower than that of total antibody), so that the difference between the concentrations of free and total antibody was negligible at reaction equilibrium. Displacement of the fluorescein-labeled O-chain from the antibody with the unlabeled O-chain was performed in PBS (2 ml) containing FL1 (9 x 10-5 g/liter) and antibody (5 x 10-8M) or FL2 (3 x 10-5 g/liter) and antibody (3.3 x 10-8M). After reaching the steady-state polarization, the labeled antigen/antibody mixture was titrated with 5-μl aliquots of an unlabeled B. abortus O-chain or S. typhimurium LPS stock solution. Steady-state fluorescence polarization was measured after incubation for 10 min. The accumulative titrating volume was kept below 4% of the initial volume of the labeled antigen/antibody solution. All titration experiments were performed at 25°C. The fluorescence of fluorescein-labeled O-chain was effectively quenched, upon binding to the antibody YsT9. The quenching value, Q, as defined in Equation 1, was used to estimate the equilibrium (affinity) constant for the antigen-antibody reaction. Q=F0-FF0(Eq. 1) and F are the fluorescence intensities of the labeled antigen in the absence and presence of antibody, respectively. The labeled and unlabeled O-chain were designated Ag* and Ag, respectively. According to the law of mass action, the equilibrium constant, K, for binding of the labeled O-chain to antibody is described by Equation 2. K=[Ab−Ag*][Ab][Ag*]=[Ag*]b[Ab][Ag*]0−[Ag*]b(Eq. 2) [Ab-Ag*], [Ab], [Ag*], [Ag*]b and [Ag*]o are the concentrations of antigen-antibody complex, free antigen binding site, free antigen, bound antigen, and total antigen, respectively. Equation 2 can be rewritten as shown below. [Ag*]b[Ag*]o=K[Ab]1+K[Ab](Eq. 3) [Ag*]b/[Ag*]o is the mole fraction (fb) of bound labeled antigen, which can be replaced by Q/Qm. Qm is the maximal fluorescence quenching. Thus, we obtain Equation 4. Q=QmK[Ab]1+K[Ab](Eq. 4) [Ab] is approximately equal to the total concentration of antigen binding sites, [Ab]o, under the conditions employed. Nonlinear curve fitting through the data points in a plot of Q versus [Ab]o according to Equation 4 gives the values of K and Qm. Fluorescence polarization (P) and anisotropy (A) are two interrelated parameters that describe the same phenomenon and are related by the equation shown below. A=2P3-p(Eq. 5) However, only fluorescence anisotropy was used in the data analysis because, unlike polarization, the anisotropy of a fluorescent solution is the arithmetic average of component fluorescence anisotropies in the solution (23Herron J.N. Voss Jr., E.W. Fluorescein Hapten: An Immunological Probe. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 49-76Google Scholar). The fraction of fluorescence intensity due to bound labeled antigen, Fb, is determined from the fluorescence anisotropy as outlined below. Fb=A-AfAb-Af(Eq. 6) Af is the fluorescence anisotropy of the labeled antigen alone, and Ab is the limiting anisotropy of bound labeled antigen. The values of Fb are related to fluorescence quenching (Q) by the formula (23Herron J.N. Voss Jr., E.W. Fluorescein Hapten: An Immunological Probe. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 49-76Google Scholar) shown in Equation 7. Q=QmFb1-Qm(1-Fb)(Eq. 7) By substituting Equation 7 into Equation 4, Fb is expressed as shown below. Fb=K[Ab]1-Qm1+K[Ab]1-Qm(Eq. 8) The value of K can be derived by nonlinear curve fitting through the data points in a plot of Fb versus [Ab]o according to Equation 8. The fluorescein-labeled O-chain can be displaced from the antibody by the unlabeled antigen, which may be described by the following equilibrium reaction (Reaction R1). K1Ag*+[Ab]⇄⇄Ag*−Ab[Ag]1LK2[Ag−Ab] REACTION 1 [Ag*-Ab], [Ag*], [Ab], [Ag], and [Ag-Ab] are the equilibrium concentrations of labeled antigen-antibody complex, labeled antigen, antigen binding sites, unlabeled antigen, and unlabeled antigen-antibody complex. The equilibrium constants for the labeled antigen-antibody and unlabeled antigen-antibody reactions, K1 and K2, respectively, were defined by Equations 9 and 10. K1=Ag*−AbAg*[Ab](Eq. 9) K2=Ag-AbAg[Ab](Eq. 10) The total concentration of antigen binding sites, [Ab]o, can be calculated from the following formula. [Ab]=[Ab]0−Ag*−Ab1+K2[Ag](Eq. 11) From Equations 10 and 11, [Ab] is solved as follows. K1=Ag*−Ab[Ab]0−Ag*−Ab1+K2[Ag]Ag*=Ag*b[Ab]0−[Ab]b1+K2[Ag]Ag*0−Ag*b(Eq. 12) By substituting Equation 12 into Equation 9, K1 can be expressed as shown by Equation 13. fb=K1(Ab]−[Ab]b1+K2[Ag]+K1(Ab]o−[Ab]b(Eq. 13) [Ag*]b is the concentration of antibody-bound labeled antigen, and [Ab]b is the concentration of binding sites occupied by the labeled antigen. By introducing the mole fraction of bound labeled antigen (fb = [Ag*]b/[Ag*]o) into Equation 13, the value of fb can be calculated as shown below. fb=K1[Ab]01+K2[Ag]0+K1[Ab]0(Eq. 14) The present experimental conditions employed the labeled O-chain concentration considerably lower than that of antibody and the unlabeled O-chain concentration considerably higher than that of antibody, so that [Ab]o- [Ab]b≈ [Ab]o and [Ag] ≈ [Ag]o. Thus, we obtain Equation 15. fb=K1[Ab]01+K2[Ag]0+K1[Ab]0(Eq. 15) The values of fb can be calculated by the ratio of Q to Qm according to Equation 7. K1 and K2 can be derived by fitting a nonlinear curve through the data points in a plot of fb versus [Ag]o according to Equation 15. As shown in Fig. 1, three A200 peaks were resolved on a HPLC size-exclusion column with distribution coefficient Kav values of 0.32 (peak 1), 0.69 (peak 2), and 1.0 (peak 3), respectively (each number represents the mean of duplicate determinations). The peak 1 and peak 2 materials, after modification with fluorescein and prior to being purified on a Sephadex G-25 column, were analyzed by the anti-O-chain mAb YsT9 on dot blots and by PAGE. Only peak 1 reacts with YsT9 (Fig. 1, inset b), indicating that it contains the O-chain. A photograph of PAGE analysis of the peak 1-FITC reaction mixture taken under UV illumination (Fig. 1, inset c) shows a fluorescent band of the O-chain (top) and a smeared region of free FITC (bottom). Reaction of the O-chain with FITC resulted in incorporation of 14.8 ± 1.8 (n = 5) and 52.3 ± 2.4 (n = 3) μmol of fluorescein/g of polysaccharide at 0.5:1 and 10:1 starting ratios (w/w) of FITC to O-chain, respectively. The resultant labeled O-chain preparations were highly fluorescent, exhibiting a single emission band with a maximum in intensity near 517 nm. The excitation and emission spectra of both fluorescein-labeled O-chain preparations (i.e. FL1 and FL2) were determined in the absence and presence of the antibody YsT9. Reaction of either FL1 (9 x 10-5 g/liter) or FL2 (3 x 10-5 g/liter) with YsT9 (5 x 10-8M) caused no shift in their excitation and emission spectra but a strong decline in the fluorescence maximum (Fig. 2). When either FL1 or FL2 was mixed with the control antibody M178, no fluorescence quenching was observed (Fig. 2), indicating the quenching was specific to the anti-O-chain antibody. This quenching signal can be employed to measure the antibody-bound labeled O-chain in the binding equilibrium study. Binding of FL1 to the antibody YsT9 was investigated by measuring the fluorescence quenching of the labeled O-chain when titrated with the antibody. Fig. 3a showed that quenching of fluorescence of FL1 increased as the concentration of antibody was increased, approaching a plateau value. The equilibrium constant (K) and the maximal fluorescence quenching (Qm) were calculated to be 1.79 x 107M-1 and 0.45, respectively, by fitting a nonlinear curve through the data points of a plot of Q versus [Ab]o (Fig. 3a) according to Equation 4. The binding of FL1 to the antibody YsT9 was also studied by a second approach: fluorescence polarization, which would increase as a consequence of the effective increase in molecular volume when the labeled O-chain binds to the large antibody molecule. The fluorescence anisotropy, calculated from the polarization data according to Equation 5, was applied to the data analysis. Fig. 4a showed that the fluorescence anisotropy of FL1 increased as the concentration of YsT9 was increased, approaching the limiting anisotropy. The value of limiting anisotropy was determined to be 0.216 by linear extrapolation through the data points of a double reciprocal plot of 1/A versus 1/[Ab]o (Fig. 4a, inset). In contrast, when FL1 was incubated with the control antibody M178, no change in fluorescence anisotropy was observed (Fig. 4a), indicating that the increase in the anisotropy of FL1 was specific to the interaction with the anti-O-chain antibody. The values of Fb, calculated according to Equation 6, were plotted against the antibody concentration (Fig. 4b). By fitting a nonlinear line through the data points in Fig. 4b according to Equation 8 with a Qm of 0.45, a K of 1.50 x 107M-1 was obtained for FL1. To determine whether the extent of fluorescein labeling affects the binding of O-chain to antibody, a second labeled O-chain preparation (FL2) with a degree of modification 3.5-fold higher than that of FL1 was employed in the binding study. Fluorescence quenching and anisotropy of FL2 as a function of antibody concentration were shown in Figs. 3b and 4c, respectively. As found with FL1, both fluorescence quenching and anisotropy of FL2 approached a limiting value as the concentration of YsT9 was increased (Figs. 3b and 4c). By performing a nonlinear curve fitting according to Equation 4, a K of 2.04 x 107M-1 and a Qm of 0.57 were derived from the FL2 fluorescence quenching data (Fig. 3b). Analysis of the FL2 polarization data yields a limiting anisotropy of 0.219 by linear extrapolation (Fig. 4c, inset) and a K of 1.80 x 107M-1 by nonlinear curve fitting (Fig. 4d) according to Equation 8 with a Qm of 0.57. The reversibility of binding of the O-chain to antibody was tested by displacing the fluorescein-labeled antigen from the antibody with the unlabeled O-chain. A mixture of FL1 (9 x 10-5 g/liter) and YsT9 (5 x 10-8M) or FL2 (3 x 10-5 g/liter) and YsT9 (3.3 x 10-8M) was prepared to give the steady-state anisotropy values of 0.159 ± 0.002 (n = 6) and 0.162 ± 0.001 (n = 6), respectively. This corresponded to approximately 80% bound labeled O-chain in each case. Displacement experiments were performed by adding aliquots of the unlabeled O-chain to the labeled O-chain/antibody solution. As shown in Fig. 5, the fluorescence anisotropy decreased for both FL1 and FL2 as the unlabeled O-chain concentration was increased, approaching that of the labeled O-chain alone. When S. typhimurium LPS was added in a separate titration, no depolarization was observed (Fig. 5), indicating that displacement was specific to the O-chain. The relationship of fb with the unlabeled O-chain concentration was shown in the insets of Fig. 5. Taking an average value of K1 for FL1 to be 1.65 x 107M-1 (Table I), a K2 of 1.49 x 103 liter/g for the unlabeled O-chain was obtained by nonlinear curve fitting through the data points in a plot of fb versus [Ag]o (Fig. 5a, inset) according to Equation 15. Using an average value of K1 for FL2 (1.90 x 107M-1, Table I), a K2 of 1.48 x 103 liter/g for the unlabeled O-chain was derived from the data in Fig. 5b. Taking the molecular mass of O-chain to be 13 kDa (24Aragon V. Diaz R. Moreno E. Moriyon I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the equilibrium constant (K) in terms of M-1 for the unlabeled O-chain was calculated to be 1.93 x 107M-1 from the data in Fig. 5a and 1.82 x 107M-1 from the data in Fig. 5b.Table I.Comparison of equilibrium binding parameters determined by three procedures for the binding of B. abortus O-chain to a monoclonal antibody YsT9Antigen preparationaFL1 and FL2 are the labeled O-chains with substitutions of 14.8 ± 1.8 (n = 5) and 52.3 ± 2.4 (n = 3) μmol of fluorescein/g of polysaccharide, respectively.Fluorescence quenchingFluorescence polarizationDisplacement experimentm-1m-1m-1FL11.79 x 1071.50 x 107FL22.04 x 1071.80 x 107Unlabeled O-chain1.93 x 1071.82 x 107a FL1 and FL2 are the labeled O-chains with substitutions of 14.8 ± 1.8 (n = 5) and 52.3 ± 2.4 (n = 3) μmol of fluorescein/g of polysaccharide, respectively. Open table in a new tab The B. abortus O-chain polysaccharide fragment (O-chain) has been successfully labeled with fluorescein for use in a homogeneous assay strategy to characterize the binding of a carbohydrate antigen to its antibody on a quantitative basis. Covalent attachment of fluorescein groups to the O-chain, presumably via reacting with hydroxyl groups on the polysaccharide antigen (25De Belder A.N. Granath K. Carbohydr. Res. 1973; 30: 375-378Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar), has provided a sensitive and reliable signal for bound antigen. Surprisingly, there have been few reports on labeling of carbohydrate molecules with a fluorescent probe available in the literature (25De Belder A.N. Granath K. Carbohydr. Res. 1973; 30: 375-378Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first use of a fluorescently labeled O-chain derived from the outer membrane LPS of a pathogenic bacterium for the determination of carbohydrate-binding antibody affinity by fluorescence quenching and polarization techniques. These techniques have been a powerful tool in the study of molecular interactions in a variety of biological systems including the antigen-antibody reaction (23Herron J.N. Voss Jr., E.W. Fluorescein Hapten: An Immunological Probe. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 49-76Google Scholar, 26Watt R.M. Voss Jr., E.W.

Burke T. Nature. 1995; 375: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The previous study of antigen-antibody reaction using the fluorescence quenching and polarization techniques mainly focused on a system with an antigen either being a fluorescent hapten or a fluorescently labeled protein. The present study has extended the application of such techniques to characterization of the complex formation between a carbohydrate antigen and its antibody. Carbohydrate antigens labeled with a radioactive isotope (30Young Jr., W.W. Johnson H.S. Tamura Y. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. Parker J.M.R. Khare D.P. Spohr U. Baker D.A. Hindsgaul O. Lemieux R.U. J.

Pure Appl. Chem. 1989; 61: 1171-1180Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Vorberg E. Bundle D.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 132: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have been employed for the measurement of antibody specificity and affinity. This is time-consuming due to separation of free antigen from bound antigen and/or is potentially hazardous due to the radioactive material. Moreover, covalent attachment of enzyme to polysaccharides resulted in a significant loss of enzyme activity (33Vorberg E. Bundle D.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 132: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As demonstrated here, labeling of a carbohydrate antigen with fluorescein groups is an alternative approach to determine the affinity constant for a carbohydrate-binding antibody and avoids some difficulties associated with other immunoassays. Analysis of molecular interactions could become complicated due to the multivalency of interacting molecules. In the present study, two antigen binding sites per antibody molecule were taken into consideration for the data analysis. As a linear homopolymer, the O-chain possibly has multiple YsT9-defined epitopes. This multivalency should not affect the results of the data analysis, because it does not alter the molar ratio of bound antigen to total antigen (i.e. the mole fraction of bound O-chain) in the binding assays, which is a variable of the binding equations derived in this study. The B. abortus O-chain has a molecular mass of 13 kDa (24Aragon V. Diaz R. Moreno E. Moriyon I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is considerably lower than that of an antibody IgG molecule (150 kDa). Based on this fact, an assumption has been made to facilitate the data analysis; the O-chain was small enough so that the binding of the O-chain molecule to each antigen binding site is independent. The fact that plots of 1/A versus [Ab]o (inset of Fig. 4a) or 1/Q versus [Ab]o (data not shown) are linear suggests that the O-chain-antibody interaction has the characteristics of a hapten-antibody system (34Wei A.-P. Herron J.N. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 3372-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the O-chain exhibiting such characteristics is that binding of a large antibody molecule to an epitope on a small O-chain fragment may prevent more antibodies from binding to other possible epitopes on the same O-chain molecule due to steric hindrances. The present study has applied the nonlinear curve fitting approach rather than the Scatchard plot for the data analysis because, as addressed by Wei and Herron (34Wei A.-P. Herron J.N. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 3372-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), (i) the latter approach was thought to violate the assumptions of the least-squares method and (ii) the linearized variables used in Scatchard analysis tend to have higher uncertainties due to error propagation than the directly measured variables. It may be noted covalent linkage of fluorescein to the O-chain provided an extremely sensitive signal for bound antigen and the labeled O-chain was used at a concentration considerably lower than the total antibody concentration in the assay. Under such conditions, the latter may be regarded as approximately constant and equal to the equilibrium concentration. This approximation treatment has simplified the data analysis and appears to be valid as judged by the fact that three independent analysis procedures derived a similar order of equilibrium constants for the labeled O-chain preparations either with a low or a high degree of modification, and the unlabeled O-chain (Table I). Modification of the O-chain with fluorescein did not affect the antibody affinity constant, indicating that the intrinsic affinity had been measured. Therefore, the affinity of various antisera for B. abortus O-chain as measured by the fluorescein derivative of O-chain can be compared. Although used here to characterize the binding of B. abortus O-chain to antibody, the carbohydrate-fluorescein conjugate approach has the potential application in any bacterial LPS-binding antibody or carbohydrate-binding receptor systems. The practical implication of this study is that the fluorescence quenching or the increase in polarization of the labeled O-chain due to the formation of antigen-antibody complex may be exploited to yield a new diagnostic tool for brucellosis. In fact, a fluorescence polarization assay for detection of antibody to B. abortus has been developed in our laboratory (35Nielsen K. Gall D. Jolley M. Leishman G. Balsevicius S. Smith P. Nicoletti P. Thomas F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 195: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Another interesting result of this study is that addition of the unlabeled antigen resulted in fluorescence depolarization of the labeled O-chain-antibody complex. This result indicates that the labeled O-chain is released from the antibody in the presence of the unlabeled O-chain and that the O-chain-antibody reaction is in dynamic equilibrium. The specific displacement of this type can be used to quantitate the bacterial polysaccharide antigen. One of the advantages with the displacement assay system is that the polysaccharide antigen to be quantitated is not necessarily in a purified form because the displacement was highly specific (Fig. 5). In summary, fluorescein labeling of the B. abortus O-chain has provided a probe suitable for characterization of the binding of O-chain to antibody and a useful model system for the study of the complex formation between a carbohydrate-binding protein and a carbohydrate ligand.

The synthesis of a bifunctionalized tetrasaccharide substrate suitable for measuring cellulase activity by resonance energy transfer is described. The substrate, which carries a 5-(2-aminoethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonate group on the non-reducing end and an indolethyl group on the reducing end, was prepared from β-lactosyl fluoride and indolethyl β-cellobioside by a chemoenzymatic approach using the transglycosylating activity of endoglucanase I of Humicola insolens as the key step. The bifunctionalized substrate has been used for the determination of the catalytic constants of H. insolens endoglucanase I and cellobiohydrolases I and II; this substrate could be of general use to measure the kinetic constants of cellulases able to act on oligomers of degree of polymerization"
https://openalex.org/W2071581987,"GM2 activator protein is a protein cofactor that has been shown to stimulate the enzymatic hydrolysis of both GalNAc and NeuAc from GM2 (Wu, Y. Y., Lockyer, J. M., Sugiyama, E., Pavlova, N.V., Li, Y.-T., and Li, S.-C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16276-16283). To understand the mechanism by which GM2 activator stimulates the hydrolysis of GM2, we examined the interaction of this activator protein with GM2 as well as with other glycosphingolipids by TLC overlay and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. The TLC overlay analysis unveiled the binding specificity of GM2 activator, which was not previously revealed. Under the conditions optimal for the activator protein to stimulate the hydrolysis of GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A, GM2 activator was found to bind avidly to acidic glycosphingolipids, including gangliosides and sulfated glycosphingolipids, but not to neutral glycosphingolipids. The gangliosides devoid of sialic acids, such as asialo-GM1 and asialo-GM2, and the GM2 derivatives whose carboxyl function in the NeuAc had been modified by methyl esterification or reduction, were only very weakly bound to GM2 activator. These results indicate that the negatively charged sugar residue or sulfate group in gangliosides is one of the important sites recognized by GM2 activator. For comparison, we also studied in parallel the complex formation between glycosphingolipids and saposin B, a separate activator protein with broad specificity to stimulate the hydrolysis of various glycosphingolipids. We found that saposin B bound to neutral glycosphingolipids and gangliosides equally well, and there was an exceptionally strong binding to sulfatide. In contrast to previous reports, we found that GM2 activator formed complexes with GM2 and other gangliosides in different proportions depending on the ratio between the activator protein and the ganglioside in the incubation mixture prior to gel filtration. We were not able to detect the specific binding of GM2 activator to GM2 when GM2 was mixed with GM1 or GM3. Thus, the specificity or the mode of action of GM2 activator cannot be simply explained by its interaction with glycosphingolipids based on complex formation. The binding of GM2 activator to a wide variety of negatively charged glycosphingolipids may indicate that this activator protein has functions other than assisting the enzymatic hydrolysis of GM2. GM2 activator protein is a protein cofactor that has been shown to stimulate the enzymatic hydrolysis of both GalNAc and NeuAc from GM2 (Wu, Y. Y., Lockyer, J.

In higher animals, the sugar chains of glycosphingolipids are catabolized by the sequential action of lysosomal exoglycosidases (1Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Dingle J.T. Dean R.T. Sly W.

This activator protein was also shown to assist the hydrolysis of NeuAc from GM2 by clostridial sialidase (8Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to recognize the branched trisaccharide (GM2-epitope) in GM2 (9Li S.-C. Wu Y.-Y. Sugiyama E. Taki T. Kasama T.

This activator, however, is not required for the hydrolysis of water-soluble synthetic substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-GlcNAc or p-nitrophenyl-β-GlcNAc by β-hexosaminidase A. The mode of action of GM2 activator is still not well understood. Through the studies of complex formation between GM2 activator and glycosphingolipids using electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and ultracentrifugation (4Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Conzelmann E. Burg J. Stephan G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J.

Chem. 1979; 360: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) postulated that the action of GM2 activator is to extract a single GM2 molecule from its micelles to form a water-soluble protein-lipid complex (1:1 ratio), which serves as the true substrate for β-hexosaminidase A. This hypothesis, however, is not supported by two simple facts: (a) The water-soluble tetrasaccharide derived from GM2 cannot be hydrolyzed by β-hexosaminidase A in the presence or absence of the activator (8Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (b) saposin B, another activator protein whose action is to solubilize glycosphingolipids, does not stimulate the hydrolysis of GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A. The results of previous studies on the interaction between glycosphingolipids and the activator proteins isolated from human tissues might have been complicated by the possible presence of contaminated proteins. Recently, we have cloned the cDNA encoding human GM2 activator (11Nagarajan S. Chen H.-C. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Lockyer J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and also expressed the cDNA in Escherichia coli (8Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of pure recombinant human GM2 activator in large quantities made the re-examination of the interactions between GM2 activator and glycosphingolipids possible. To understand the mode of action of GM2 activator, we have studied the interaction of GM2 activator with various glycosphingolipids by TLC overlay and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. For comparison, we have also studied in parallel the interaction of glycosphingolipids with saposin B, a nonspecific activator protein that has been reported to stimulate the enzymatic hydrolysis of a wide variety of glycosphingolipids (12Li S.-C. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6588-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that in aqueous medium, such as gel filtration, one molecule of GM2 activator was able to associate with multiple molecules of gangliosides. By TLC overlay, GM2 activator was found to bind to various negatively charged glycosphingolipids without showing preference to any particular sugar chain. GM2 was prepared from the brain of a Tay-Sachs patient (13Svennerholm L. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1972; 6: 464-474Google Scholar). GA1 and GA2 were prepared from GM1 and GM2, respectively, by mild acid hydrolysis (14Svennerholm L. Månsson J.-E. Li Y.-T. J. Biol.

Sonnino (University of Milan, Milan, Italy); the chemically modified Me-GM2 (the carboxyl group of NeuAc in GM2 was methyl esterified) and HO-GM2 (the carboxyl group of NeuAc in GM2 was reduced to alcohol) (16Li S.-C.

Ishizuka (Teikyo University, Tokyo); and the chemically synthesized gangliosides, KDN-GM3, IV6KDNLnOse4Cer, and IV6KDNLcOse4Cer, from Dr. A. Hasegawa (Gifu University, Gifu, Japan). Oligo-GM2 was prepared from GM2 using ceramide glycanase (18Zhou B. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Huang R.T.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12272-12277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PE-GM2, the neoglycolipid, was prepared by conjugating II3NeuAcGgOse3 that was derived from GM2 to dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine by reductive amination (19Tang P.W. Gooi H.C. Hardy M. Lee Y.C.

The following were purchased from commercial sources: GD2, GM4, GM3, and LacCer, Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA); GalCer, GlcCer, sulfatide, primulin, polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), and bovine serum albumin, Sigma; [14C]formaldehyde (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol), American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO); Polygram SIL G TLC plate, Macherey-Nagel (Duren, Germany); dimethylamine borane complex, ammonium acetate, Aldrich; Sephacryl S-200 (super fine), Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden); polyvinylpyrrolidone, Fisher; Bio Gel P-6, Bio-Rad; X-OMAT AR film, Kodak; Silica gel 60 TLC plate, Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); and Universol (scintillation mixture), ICN (Irvine, CA). 14C-Labeled GM2 activator and saposin B were prepared by reductive methylation of amino groups with 14C-labeled formaldehyde (23Geoghegan K.F. Cabacungan J.C. Dixon H.B.F. Feeney R.E. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1981; 17: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Soeda S. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18519-18523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μg of GM2 activator or saposin B were dissolved in 85 μl of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. To this solution, 88.4 μg of dimethylamine borane complex, which had been dissolved in 10 μl of methanol, was added. After addition of 5 μl (2.2 μmol) of aqueous [14C]formaldehyde, the mixture was left at room temperature for 6 h. Then, the resulting 14C-labeled protein was separated from the reagents by gel filtration on a Bio Gel P-6 column (0.9 x 10 cm) using water as an eluant, followed by dialysis against 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.8, and lyophilized. The stimulatory activities of the 14C-labeled GM2 activator and saposin B on the hydrolyses of GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A and GM1 by β-galactosidase, respectively, were confirmed by the methods described previously (8Wu Y.Y.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6588-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three buffer solutions used for studying the interactions between the activator proteins and glycosphingolipids on TLC plates were (a) 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, a low ionic strength acidic buffer providing the optimal condition for assaying the hydrolysis of GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A; (b) 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.8, a low ionic strength neutral buffer; and (c) 250 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, a high ionic strength acidic buffer. Each glycosphingolipid sample (10-15 nmol) in chloroform:methanol (2/1 v/v) was first applied onto a Polygram SIL G TLC plate, and the plate was developed with chloroform:methanol:water (60/35/8, v/v/v). The dried plate was then immersed and kept at 37°C for 30 min in one of the above mentioned buffer solutions, which contained 1% each of polyvinylpyrrolidone and bovine serum albumin. The plate was then incubated in 5 ml of the same buffer solution containing 50 μg of the 14C-labeled activator protein (250,000 cpm) and 3% polyvinylpyrrolidone at 37°C for 1 h and washed three times with the buffer solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then air dried. Finally, the protein-lipid complexes were detected by placing the TLC plate onto an x-ray film to obtain a radioautogram. After obtaining the radioautogram, the same TLC plate was sprayed with diphenylamine reagent (25Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. Lond. 1954; : 249Google Scholar) and heated at 110-120°C for 15-20 min to reveal the glycosphingolipids on the plate. For studying the complex formation between GM2 activator and the micellar form of glycosphingolipids using Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration, 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, was used as the incubation buffer and also to equilibrate and elute the column. GM2 activator (25 μg, 1.34 nmol) in 100 μl of the buffer solution was mixed with a given amount of a ganglioside or oligo-GM2 and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The entire mixture was subsequently applied onto a Sephacryl S-200 column (0.6 x 30 cm) connected to an HPLC system (Waters 600E, Millipore). The column was then eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, and the effluent was monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm (Waters 490E UV-VIS detector). Fractions of 0.5 ml (2 min) were collected through the entire run, and each fraction was analyzed for the content of the activator protein and the glycosphingolipid. The fractions that contained the protein-lipid complex eluted from the Sephacryl S-200 column were incubated with 0.5 units of β-hexosaminidase A at 37°C for 3 h. Each incubated fraction was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform:methanol (2/1, v/v), and analyzed by Silica gel 60 TLC plate using chloroform:methanol:water (60/35/8, v/v/v) as the developing solvent. Gangliosides were visualized by spraying the plate with diphenylamine reagent (25Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. Lond. 1954; : 249Google Scholar) followed by heating at 110-120°C for 15-20 min. When the activator protein was incubated with only [3H]GM1 or [3H]GM2, the amount of the [3H]GM1 or [3H]GM2 in the protein-lipid complex was determined as follows: a 50-μl aliquot of each fraction obtained from the Sephacryl S-200 column was mixed with 5 ml of Universol, and the radioactivity was measured by a Tri-Carb model 1600 CA liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co., IL). When the activator protein was incubated with GM3, which was not radiolabeled, the amounts of GM3 in the protein-lipid complexes were determined by TLC analysis using the resorcinol spray (26Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 601-611Crossref Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) and then quantitated by Scan Jett II CX (Hewlett Packard, Boise, ID) and NIH image 1.55. When the activator protein was incubated with both [3H]GM1 and [3H]GM2, the two gangliosides in the protein-lipid complex were first separated from each other by TLC using chloroform:methanol:water (60/35/8, v/v/v) as the developing solvent. The [3H]GM1 and [3H]GM2 on the plate were first revealed by primulin reagent (27Skipski V.P. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 396-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and then individually scraped off the plate and mixed with Universol; the radioactivity was then measured by a scintillation counter. When the activator protein was incubated with both GM2 and GM3, the amounts of GM2 and GM3 in the protein-lipid complex were determined as follows: an aliquot of each fraction was evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 20 μl of chloroform:methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied onto a TLC plate. The plate was developed with the solvent system as described above for separating GM1 and GM2, and the gangliosides were visualized with the diphenylamine reagent (25Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. Lond. 1954; : 249Google Scholar). The amounts of GM2 and GM3 were quantitated by scanning the TLC plate with a Scan Jet IICX and analyzed by NIH Image 1.55. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The interactions between GM2 activator and glycosphingolipids were examined by TLC overlay on which glycosphingolipids were associated with silica gel. Fig. 1A shows the representative common acidic and neutral glycosphingolipids on the plate that were stained by the diphenylamine reagent (25Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. Lond. 1954; : 249Google Scholar). While the same amount (15 nmol) of each glycosphingolipid was applied on the plate, GlcCer and GalCer showed weaker staining than GM1, since the color intensity produced by the diphenylamine reagent depends on the sugar content of the glycosphingolipids. The same TLC plate prior to the chemical staining was overlaid with the radiolabeled GM2 activator as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the results are shown in Fig. 1B. The conditions for the overlay were first chosen to use the low ionic strength acidic buffer (25 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0), which is the optimal condition for GM2 activator to stimulate the hydrolysis of GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A. Under this condition, GM2 activator protein binds avidly to gangliosides GM1, GM2, and GM3 (lanes 1, 2, and 3, respectively) but very weakly to the neutral glycosphingolipids, LacCer, GalCer, and GlcCer (lanes 4, 5, and 6, respectively). The bindings of GM2 activator to 14 other glycosphingolipids were further examined under the same conditions. As summarized in Table I, GM2 activator binds to several other acidic glycolipids such as GM4, the synthesized PE-GM2 (8Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which contains the oligosaccharide of GM2 linked to phosphatidylethanolamine instead of ceramide, NeuGc-GM1, KDN-GM3 and two chemically synthesized gangliosides, IV6 KDNLcOse4Cer and IV6KDNLnOse4Cer, whose KDN residues are linked through ä2→6Gal. These results indicate that the interactions between GM2 activator and glycosphingolipids require the presence of an acidic moiety on the glycosphingolipid, and the binding is not significantly affected by the sugar chain backbones, the position (ä2→3Gal versus ä2→6Gal), and the nature of sialic acid (NeuAc versus NeuGc or KDN) in the glycosphingolipids. Furthermore, GM2 activator also binds to the sulfated glycosphingolipids, such as sulfatide and SM3, but not to the asialogangliosides, such as GA1 and GA2. These results strongly suggest that the recognition sites on the glycosphingolipids for the binding by GM2 activator are the anionic residues. These observations were further supported by studying the bindings between GM2 activator and the two chemically modified GM2. As shown in Fig. 2, conversion of the carboxylic function of NeuAc in GM2 to a methyl ester (Me-GM2) (Fig. 2, lane 3) or to an alcohol (HO-GM2) (Fig. 2, lane 4) abolishes the ability of the two modified GM2 derivatives to interact with GM2 activator. The results of this binding study explain our previous observation that Me-GM2 and HO-GM2 were not hydrolyzed by β-hexosaminidase A in the presence of GM2 activator but could be hydrolyzed in the presence of sodium taurodeoxycholate (16Li S.-C. Serizawa S. Li Y.-T. Nakamura K. Handa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5409-5410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 also shows that sulfatide (lane 1) is very weakly stained by diphenylamine (25Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. Lond. 1954; : 249Google Scholar) due to its highly acidic sulfate residue. However, this acidic glycosphingolipid binds strongly to GM2 activator.Table IBinding of glycosphinglipids to GM2 activatorPositiveGalβ1→3GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcä2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (GM1)GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcä2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (GM2)NeuAcä2→3Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (GM3)NeuAcä2→3Galβ1→1′Cer (GM4)GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcä2→3)Galβ1→3GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcä2→3) Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (GalNAc-GDla)GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcä2→8NeuAcä2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (GD2)HSO3-3Galβ1→1′Cer (sulfatide)HSO3-3Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (SM3)Galβ1→3GalNAcβ1→4(NeuGcä2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (NeuGc-GM1)KDNä2→3Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (KDN-GM3)KDNä2→6Galβ1→3GlcNAcβ1→4Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (IV6KDNLcOse4Cer)KDNä2→6Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→4Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (IV6KDNLnOse4Cer)GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcä2→3)Galβ1→4Glc-PE (PE-GM2)NegativeGalβ1→3GalNAcβ1→4Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (GA1)GalNAcβ1→4Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (GA2)GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAc-olä2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (HO-GM2)GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAc-Meä2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (Me-GM2)Galβ1→1′Cer (GalCer)Glcβ1→1′Cer (GlcCer)Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1′Cer (LacCer) Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Effect of the modification of carboxyl group of NeuAc in GM2 on the interaction with GM2 activator.

When the binding assay was carried out in a low ionic strength neutral pH buffer (pH 6.8), almost no bindngs between GM2 activator and glycosphingolipids were detected (Fig. 3, A and A′). Even sulfatide, which usually binds strongly to GM2 activator, was only very weakly bound to the activator protein under the neutral pH (lane 5). The binding detected in a high ionic strength acidic buffer (250 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.0) was also considerably reduced (Fig. 3B′). GA2 (lane 6) showed no bindings with GM2 activator under all conditions tested. These results corroborated our previous observation that the conversion of GA2 to LacCer was not effectively stimulated by GM2 activator (8Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the hydrolysis of the GalNAc from GM2 was greatly inhibited by the high ionic strength of the buffer solution; however, no such effect was observed for the hydrolysis of the GalNAc from GA2 (asialo-GM2). Saposin B is a nonspecific activator protein that stimulates the enzymatic hydrolysis of a number of glycosphingolipids catalyzed by different glycosidases (12Li S.-C. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6588-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activator protein was reported to bind glycosphingolipids to form lipid-protein complexes (29Kishimoto Y. Hiraiwa M O'Brien J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interactions between saposin B and glycosphingolipids were also examined in the same manner for comparison. As shown in Fig. 4, saposin B was found to bind not only to gangliosides and sulfatide but also to GA2 and LacCer. Compared with GM2 activator, saposin B bound to glycosphingolipids better at the neutral pH (pH 6.8) (Fig. 4B′), and the general behavior of binding was not greatly affected by the acidic pH (Fig. 4A′) or the high ionic strength of the buffer solution (Fig. 4C′). Since the results of the TLC overlay experiment showed the preferential binding of GM2 activator to the anionic glycosphingolipids, we subsequently examined the interactions between the GM2 activator and the the gangliosides in aqueous medium using Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration to separate the protein-lipid complexes. Sephacryl S-200 column offers a special advantage for this analysis because this column adsorbs the free gangliosides but not the protein-lipid complexes. This enabled us to isolate and analyze the content in the complexes. When GM2 activator was applied alone to the column, the protein was not adsorbed and eluted from the column at the retention time of 28 min (Fig. 5A), whereas applying [3H]GM2 alone, the ganglioside was retained by the Sephacryl S-200 gel. When an incubation mixture containing [3H]GM2 and GM2 activator in a molar ratio of 1:1 or 50:1 was applied to the column, a peak containing both GM2 activator and [3H]GM2 was eluted (Fig. 5, B and C). This peak was confirmed to be the protein-lipid complex by two separate analyses: (a) rechromatography of this complex did not result in the separation of the activator protein from [3H]GM2 and (b) incubation of the complex with β-hexosaminidase A resulted the conversion of [3H]GM2 into [3H]GM3 (Fig. 6). In these experiments, the recoveries of the activator protein and the gangliosides were determined to be in the range of 57-72% and 69-87%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, the complex derived from the incubation mixture that contained [3H]GM2 and GM2 activator in a molar ratio of 50:1 (Fig. 5C) had a slightly shorter retention time and a broader peak area than that derived from the mixture that contained [3H]GM2 and GM2 activator in an equimolar ratio (Fig. 5B). Similar chromatographic profiles were obtained when GM2 activator was incubated with either GM1 or GM3. However, no complex formation was detected when GM2 activator was incubated with oligo-GM2 (data not shown) indicating that, in addition to the negative charge, the lipid moiety of the glycolipid is also essential for binding.Fig. 6TLC analysis showing the conversion of GM2 into GM3 by β-hexosaminidase A in the GM2 ganglioside·;GM2 activator complex. GM2 activator (1.34 nmol) was preincubated with 50 molar excess of GM2, and the entire mixture was subjected to gel filtration through a Sephacryl S-200 column. The complex was isolated and incubated with β-hexosaminidase A and analyzed by TLC as described in the text. Lane l, the complex was incubated without β-hexosaminidase A; lane 2, the complex was incubated with β-hexosaminidase A; lane 3, the standard GM2 was incubated with β-hexosaminidase A but without the activator protein; lane 4, GM2 standard; and lane 5, GM3 standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The complexes formed between GM2 activator and the different molar ratios of gangliosides were individually isolated from the Sephacryl S-200 column and analyzed for the ratio between the ganglioside and the activator protein. As shown in Table II, when GM2 activator was incubated with an equimolar ratio of either GM1 or GM2, the molar ratio between GM2 activator and the respective ganglioside in the complex was found to be approximately 1:1. However, when the activator protein was incubated with 50 molar excess of either GM1 or GM2, the molar ratio between the ganglioside and GM2 activator in the complex was found to be about 50:1 in both cases. When the bindings between GM2 activator and a 50-fold molar excess of GM3 was examined, we found that the ratio of GM3 to the activator protein was about 80:1. It is well documented that in an aqueous medium GM3 exists as vesicles that are larger than micelles (31Sonnino S. Cantu L. Acuotti D. Corti M. Tettamanti G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 52: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising to find that the ratio of GM3/activator protein to be larger than that of GM2/activator protein or GM1/activator protein. As also shown in Table II, the association of saposin B to GM2 was very similar to that of GM2 activator protein. Thus, the interactions between the activator and the gangliosides detected in aqueous medium are similar for saposin B and GM2 activator. Whereas, the bindings on TLC overlay showed that saposin B bound to all glycosphingolipids, and GM2 activator bound preferentially to the anionic glycosphingolipids.Table II.Ratio between the ganglioside and GM2 activator in the lipid-protein complexMixture (mol:mol)Ganglioside/GM2-ActaGM2-Act, GM2 activator protein. found in the complexGM1:GM2-Act1:11.0850:148.2GM2:GM2-Act1:11.0350:151.0GM3:GM2-Act50:183.9GM2:Saposin B50:146.6a GM2-Act, GM2 activator protein. Open table in a new tab We have reported that GM2 activator was able to recognize the branched trisaccharide epitope of GM2 (8Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol.

We, therefore, examined whether GM2 activator can specifically bind only to GM2 when GM2 was mixed with GM1 or GM3. GM2 was first mixed with GM1 or GM3 in chloroform:methanol (2/1, v/v), dried, and redispersed in an aqueous buffer solution. The aqueous ganglioside mixture was then incubated with GM2 activator and subjected to Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complexes were isolated, and the amounts of GM2, GM1, and the activator protein (or GM2, GM3, and the activator protein) were determined. As shown in Table III, GM2 activator did not appear to bind preferentially to GM2 to form the activator protein·;GM2 complex in 1:1 ratio. Rather, it associated with the mixture of gangliosides in the proportion similar to that in the original ganglioside mixture. For example, when GM2 activator was incubated with a mixture containing an equimolar ratio of GM1 and GM2, the molar ratio of GM2 activator, GM1, and GM2 in the complex was found to be close to 1:1:1. However, when GM2 activator was incubated with a mixture containing 25-fold excess of GM1 and GM2, the detected ratio of the activator protein to GM1 and GM2 in the complex was 1:17.3:17.0. No preferential extraction of GM2 from the two ganglioside mixtures was observed. A similar result was obtained from the incubation of GM2 activator with a mixture of GM2 and GM3. These results indicate that the composition of the complexes formed under the micellar form of ganglioside was determined by the pre-existing status of the ganglioside micelles.Table III.Analysis of the lipid-protein complex formed between GM2 activator and the mixed gangliosidesMixture (mol:mol)Determined ratio of ganglioside/GM2-ActaGM2-Act, GM2 activator protein. in the complexGM1GM2GM3GM2-Actmol/molGM1:GM2:GM2-Act1:1:10.810.841.025:25:117.317.01.0GM2:GM3:GM2-Act25:25:123.225.81.0a GM2-Act, GM2 activator protein. Open table in a new tab Among the five activator proteins that stimulate the enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids, saposin B and GM2 activator have been shown to interact and affect the glycosphingolipid substrates (29Kishimoto Y. Hiraiwa M O'Brien J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Several methods have been used to demonstrate the complex formation between the activator proteins and glycosphingolipids, and in some studies the molar ratios between the protein and the lipid were also determined. For example, Fischer and Jatzkewitz (32Fischer G. Jatzkewitz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 481: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) studied the complex formation between saposin B and sulfatide using electrophoresis and reported that the ratio of these two components in the complex was 1:1. Also using electrophoresis, Wenger and Inui (33Wenger D.A. Inui K. Brady R.O. Barranger J. Molecular Basis of Lysosomal Storage Disorders. Academic Press, New York1984: 1-18Google Scholar) reported the ratio of the two compounds in the saposin B·;GM1 and saposin B·;sulfatide complexes to be 1:4 and 1:2.6, respectively. Vogel et al. (34Vogel A. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) studied the binding of saposin B to the individual gangliosides, such as GM1, GM2, GM3, and GD1a, as well as sulfatide by centrifugation and determined the molar ratios between saposin B and each of these gangliosides in the protein-lipid complexes to be almost 1:1. For GM2 activator, Conzelmann et al. (4Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Conzelmann E. Burg J. Stephan G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) concluded from their studies using ultracentrifugation, isoelectric focusing, and electrophoresis that GM2 activator can form the activator protein·;GM2 complex in 1:1 ratio. These experiments were carried out under the conditions required for the specific methodology used (for example, high sucrose density for ultracentrifugation and high pH for electrophoresis). Using TLC overlay, we have shown clearly that the high ionic strength or high pH of the buffer solution inhibited the interactions between GM2 activator and the glycosphingolipid substrates. Therefore, we chose to analyze the complex formation between GM2 activator and gangliosides using 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, which is optimal for the enzymatic hydrolysis of GM2 in the presence of GM2 activator. By TLC overlay, GM2 activator was found to bind to various anionic glycosphingolipids without showing preference to any particular sugar chain. Thus, GM2 activator does not behave like lectins, which display the recognition of specific saccharide structure. The involvement of an anionic residue of a glycosphingolipid in the complex formation with an activator protein has been suggested. We have reported that the carboxylic function of the NeuAc in GM2 was important for the action of GM2 activator (16Li S.-C. Serizawa S. Li Y.-T. Nakamura K. Handa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5409-5410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Mitsuyama et al. (35Mitsuyama T. Gasa S. Nojima T. Taniguchi N Makita A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 98: 605-613Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have reported the binding of saposin B to the affinity column packed with the immobilized sulfatide or its derivatives as ligands. In the present studies using TLC overlay, we have clearly demonstrated that the anionic group in glycosphingolipids is vital for the complex formation with GM2 activator but not with saposin B. While the bindings of GM2 activator to gangliosides and sulfatides are greatly affected by the assay conditions, such as the pH and the ionic strength of the buffer solutions (Figs. 1, 3, and 4), no such effects were found for saposin B. These results, again, support the importance of the negative charge in a glycosphingolipid to form the glycolipid·;GM2 activator complex. Wynn (36Wynn C.H. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) proposed the triple binding domain theory of a glycosphingolipid to saposin B based on the conformational studies of the glycosphingolipids. He predicted that there are three possible interactions between a glycosphingolipid and the protein: (a) the hydrophobic interaction of the hydrocarbon chains of the ceramide moiety and a complementary hydrophobic domain in the protein molecule; (b) the electrostatic interaction between sialic acid or sulfate group and a positively charged group of the protein; and (c) the hydrophilic interaction between a hydroxyl group in a sugar moiety and a complementary plane of the protein. Wynn (36Wynn C.H. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) also pointed out that the glycolipid which has at least two of these structural features will strongly bind to saposin B. Our results on the binding behavior of both saposin B and GM2 activator toward glycosphingolipids agree well with this model, since we have shown that GM2 activator was not able to distinguish the saccharide backbone, the number of sugar residues, and the position or the nature of sialic acid (Table I). It is evident that GM2 activator is not specific to bind only GM2. As both saposin B and GM2 activator were shown to be able to transport glycosphingolipids from the donor to the acceptor liposomes (10Conzelmann E. Burg J. Stephan G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), GM2 activator may have a specific role in vivo to transport the acidic glycosphingolipids. Our results on the complex formation between GM2 activator and the micellar forms of gangliosides agree well with the studies of Cantu et al. (37Cantu L. Corti M. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1992; 55: 223-229Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). They studied the micelle formation in mixed gangliosides using light scattering and neutron scattering and reported that when GM2 and GT1b were mixed in different molar ratios in aqueous solution, the two gangliosides formed a single family of mixed micelles rather than that of two families of unmixed micelles, and the ratio of each ganglioside in the mixed micelles depended on the molar concentration of each ganglioside (37Cantu L. Corti M. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1992; 55: 223-229Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast to previous reports (4Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Conzelmann E. Burg J. Stephan G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we were not able to explain the mode of action of GM2 activator based on our studies on the complex formation between this activator protein and glycosphingolipids, especially GM2. The fact that GM2 activator interacts with a wide variety of anionic glycosphingolipids indicates that this activator protein may have functions other than assisting the enzymatic hydrolysis of GM2."
https://openalex.org/W2048992167,"To investigate the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional control of retinoid X receptor (RXR) gene expression, the 5′-flanking region of the human RXRγ2 isoform was characterized. An imperfect hexamer repeat (γ retinoid X response element; γRXRE) with a single nucleotide spacer (GGTTGAaAGGTCA) was identified immediately upstream of the RXRγ2 gene transcription start site. Cotransfection studies in CV-1 cells with expression vectors for the retinoid receptors RXRα and retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) demonstrated that the γRXRE confers retinoid-mediated transcriptional activation with preferential activation by RXR in the presence of its cognate ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that RXR homodimer binding to γRXRE is markedly enhanced by 9-cis-RA, whereas RAR·;RXR heterodimer binding is ligand-independent. DNA binding studies and cell cotransfection experiments also demonstrated that the nuclear receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), repressed transcription via the γRXRE. Cotransfection experiments revealed that COUP-TF and RXRα compete at the γRXRE to modulate transcription bidirectionally over a wide range. These results demonstrate that the human RXRγ2 gene promoter contains a novel imperfect repeat element capable of mediating RXR-dependent transcriptional autoactivation and COUP-TF-dependent repression.

DNA binding studies and cell cotransfection experiments also demonstrated that the nuclear receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), repressed transcription via the γRXRE. Cotransfection experiments revealed that COUP-TF and RXRα compete at the γRXRE to modulate transcription bidirectionally over a wide range. These results demonstrate that the human RXRγ2 gene promoter contains a novel imperfect repeat element capable of mediating RXR-dependent transcriptional autoactivation and COUP-TF-dependent repression. The retinoid derivatives of vitamin A regulate a wide variety of biological processes, including development, differentiation, and cellular metabolism. The retinoids exert influence at the level of gene transcription by serving as ligands for the retinoid receptor families of transcription factors.

In contrast, RXRγ expression is restricted both in fetal and adult tissues (8Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro E.A. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M.

The mouse RXRγ gene has two known mRNA isoforms (RXRγ1 and RXRγ2), produced via alternative exon splicing and differential promoter utilization (10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). The RXRγ isoforms exhibit a distinct tissue-restricted expression pattern; RXRγ1 is enriched in neural tissue, whereas RXRγ2 is cardiac enriched (9Dolle P. Fraulob V. Kastner P. Chambon P. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). Both transcripts are relatively abundant in skeletal muscle (9Dolle P. Fraulob V. Kastner P. Chambon P. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol.

The RXRγ gene is therefore unique among the RXR gene family members in that its expression is spatially and temporally restricted, suggesting the possibility that the function of this nuclear receptor is distinct from the other RXRs. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in the control of RXR gene expression or if cross-signaling occurs between members of the RXR gene family. As an initial step in the investigation of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in the restricted pattern of expression of RXRγ isoforms, we have cloned the 5′-flanking region of the human RXRγ2 gene. In this report, we describe a novel autoregulatory retinoid X response element (γRXRE) located within this promoter and present evidence that this element is capable of conferring transcriptional activation via retinoid pathways and transcriptional repression via the orphan receptor COUP-TF. Human RXRγ cDNA fragments were produced via polymerase chain reaction from a human heart cDNA library template (Clontech) using oligonucleotide primers that were designed based on cross-species homology between mouse (8Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro E.A. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol.

Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Bittner D.A. Evans R.M. De Robertis E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2321-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) RXRγ cDNA sequences. Several overlapping human RXRγ partial cDNA clones were obtained, encompassing sequences representing most of the coding region and having an overall nucleotide identity of greater than 90% with the mouse RXRγ cDNA. 2P. M. Barger and D. P. Kelly, unpublished results. One partial human cDNA clone (hRX45), representing a fragment colinear with bp 451-669 relative to the published mouse RXRγ1 sequence (10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar), was generated by primers rx4 (5′-ATCAggatccCTTCTGCCATGGGTCCACCCTCA-3′) and rx5 (5′-TCTGggatccTCCCCACAGATGGCACAGATGTG-3′). hRX45 was used as a probe to screen a human genomic EMBL3 phage library (Clontech). Three genomic clones were isolated, two of which were characterized (G1SH10 and G2SH1). Restriction endonuclease and Southern blot analysis confirmed that these genomic clones were overlapping and contained sequences recognized by the hRX45 probe. Additional Southern blot analysis using a polymerase chain reaction-generated mouse RXRγ exon 1b probe (corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region of the RXRγ2 cDNA sequence (10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar)) identified overlapping genomic DNA restriction fragments containing the putative human homolog of exon 1b. Primer extension analysis using total human heart RNA and 32P-end-labeled rx20 (5′-AATCTGCCCATGCGATCCAGAGTC-3′) and rx15 (5′-GCCTTTTTTCCAGTGTCATC-3′) primers from within the putative human exon 1b mapped the transcription start site to 322 bp upstream of the ATG start codon located in exon 3. To compare the genomic sequence with cDNA sequence, 5′-RACE was performed using a human heart 5′-RACE-Ready cDNA library (Clontech) and primers from within the putative human exons 3 (rx5) and 1b (rx16, 5′- ATCGggatccCATGGGCAGATTATTCC-3′, rx20, and rx15). Comparison of the DNA sequence of G1SH10 and G2SH1 confirmed (i) there was 100% nucleotide identity in the 5′-untranslated region region between the 5′-RACE clones and genomic clones G1SH10 and G2SH1, (ii) the human RXRγ exon 1b was spliced to human exon 3 in a manner identical to that found in mice (10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar), and (iii) no intervening sequences existed between exon 1b and the transcription start site. hRXRγ2.luc.−1140 was constructed by cloning a BamHI-PstI fragment of the hRXRγ2 5′-flanking region from −1140 bp upstream to +71 bp downstream of the transcription start site into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2 basic (Promega). The mutated human RXRγ2 promoter reporter plasmid (hRXRγ2.luc.−1140.m1) was constructed by replacing the native sequence from −121 to +71 (an NdeI-PstI fragment) with a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment containing point mutations in the γRXRE (GCTTGAAACGTCA; underlined nucleotides represent substitution mutations, compared with Fig. 1). The construction of pTKLuc has been described (14Carter M.E. Gulick T.G. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). γRXRE.TKluc and γRXREm2.TKluc were each constructed by ligating two copies of the corresponding double-stranded oligonucleotide fragments in sense orientation into the BamHI site of pTKLuc (5′-gatccTGGGGTTGAAAGGTCAGATGGAtc-3′ for γRXRE.TKluc and 5′-gatccTGGGCTTGAAACGTCAGATGGAtc-3′ for γRXREm2.TKluc (underlined nucleotides represent mutations)). Dideoxy DNA sequencing confirmed the location and orientation of the inserts. The construction of eukaryotic expression vectors for use in cell culture transfection experiments (pCDMRXRα, pCDMRARβ, and pCDMCOUP) have been described (14Carter M.E. Gulick T.G. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were the generous gifts of Drs. Tod Gulick and David Moore (Harvard University). The murine expression vectors pSG5RXRα, -β, and -γ were generously provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France. Simian CV-1 cells were employed for all transfection experiments. Cells were maintained and transient cotransfections performed as described (15Raisher B.D. Gulick T. Zhang Z. Strauss A.W. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20264-20269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method in 12-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) with 4 μg of reporter construct and 1 μg of receptor expression plasmid (as indicated in the figure legends) or an equivalent amount of pCDM without insert (pCDM(−)). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. One μg of a Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase expression vector (RSVβgal) was included to correct for transfection efficiency with the exception of experiments involving pCDMCOUP. pCDMCOUP was noted to exert a modest repressive effect on the transcriptional activity of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. Accordingly, activities were adjusted to the effect of COUP-TF on the TK promoter based on the results of parallel experiments using pTKLuc without insert. In experiments involving the addition of ligand, 9-cis-RA or all-trans-RA was added 48 h prior to harvest, and vehicle was added at the same concentration to control wells. Luciferase activity was measured using the standard luciferin-ATP assay (16de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. Helinski D.R. DeLuca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7870-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescence assay (Tropix) in an Analytical Luminescence Monolight 2010 luminometer. EMSAs were performed as described (14Carter M.E. Gulick T.G. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Revzin A. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 346-355PubMed Google Scholar). The pT7lac-RXRα and pT7lac-myc-COUP-TF bacterial expression vectors (14Carter M.E. Gulick T.G. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Tod Gulick. The nuclear receptors were overproduced in bacterial cells and partially purified as described previously (14Carter M.E. Gulick T.G. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody supershift experiments were performed with monoclonal antibodies to RXR (4RX1D12, directed against the D or E domain of all three murine RXRs; a generous gift of Dr. Pierre Chambon) and a monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope in the c-Myc protein (9E10, Oncogene Science). A human EMBL phage genomic library was screened with a partial human RXRγ cDNA probe (hRX45; see “Materials and Methods”) encoding a portion of human RXRγ gene exon 2 and all of exon 3 (nucleotides 451-669 relative to the published mouse RXRγ1 cDNA sequence (10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar)). The human RXRγ gene exon 3 was identified by the high degree of cross-species nucleotide identity with the murine exon 3 (>90%) (10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the 5′-flanking region of the human RXRγ2 gene was contained within either of two genomic clones, Southern blot analysis was performed with a polymerase chain reaction-generated murine RXRγ2-specific cDNA probe containing only the 5′-untranslated region sequence encoded by the murine exon 1b (10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). A single 4.0-kilobase pair BamHI restriction fragment was identified with this exon 1b probe and DNA sequence analysis defined a 250-bp region with over 70% nucleotide identity with the murine RXRγ exon 1b sequence. 5′-RACE clones from a human heart library confirmed that, as in mouse, the human exon 1b sequence is spliced to exon 3 (10Liu Q. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 651-658PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the genomic DNA sequence with that of multiple 5′-RACE clones revealed 100% nucleotide identity, confirming that no intervening sequences existed between exon 1b and the transcription start site. The 5′-RACE sequence data and primer extension analysis with human heart total RNA using two different antisense oligonucleotides from within the human exon 1b sequence (data not shown) localized the transcription start site to 322 bp upstream of the start codon. Of note, in addition to a high degree of identity, the human and mouse exon 1b nucleotide sequences are nearly colinear, diverging by no more than 4 consecutive nucleotides over the entire length of both sequences (data not shown). These results confirmed that the 4-kilobase pair BamHI genomic fragment contained 1.14 kilobase pairs of RXRγ2 gene 5′-flanking sequence, the 250 bp of 5′-untranslated region sequence encoded by the human homolog of murine RXRγ exon 1b, and approximately 2.5 kilobase pairs of downstream sequence (Fig. 1). Analysis of the DNA sequence of the RXRγ2 5′-flanking region revealed a putative TATA sequence (TATATTA) at bp −16 (relative to the transcription start site, +1), numerous potential E boxes (18Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar), and several putative CArG sites (19Minty A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2121-2136Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), consistent with the muscle- and cardiac enriched expression of RXRγ2. An imperfect repeat sequence located at −100 to −86 conformed to the binding consensus for class II and class III nuclear receptors (Fig. 1). This sequence contains two potential hexamer binding sites separated by a single nucleotide and thus conforms to the direct repeat-1 (DR-1) group of elements known to confer transcriptional regulation by retinoid receptors (20Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the putative nuclear receptor response element was retinoid-responsive and to characterize the transcriptional activity of the RXRγ2 gene 5′-flanking region from −1140 to +71, transient cell transfection studies were performed with this DNA fragment fused to a luciferase reporter (hRXRγ2.luc.−1140). A series of cotransfection studies was performed in simian CV-1 cells with eukaryotic expression vectors for human RXRα (pCDMRXRα) and human RARβ (pCDMRARβ) in the presence and absence of the retinoid ligands 9-cis-RA and all-trans-RA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the transcriptional activity of hRXRγ2.luc.−1140 was minimally increased in the presence of 9-cis-RA or RXRα alone but was induced 7-13-fold upon the addition of both 9-cis-RA and RXRα, indicating that this promoter fragment was activated by RXRα in a ligand-dependent manner. In contrast, hRXRγ2.luc.−1140 transcription was only minimally activated by all-trans-RA or 9-cis-RA in the presence of RXRα and RARβ (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the RXRγ2 promoter is preferentially activated by RXR homodimers rather than RXR·;RAR heterodimers. To localize the region of retinoid responsiveness and to determine whether the imperfect repeat sequence located at −100 bp was indeed an RXR-responsive element, cotransfections were repeated with a 5′-deletion series of hRXRγ2.luc constructs. The results of these experiments (data not shown) revealed that the sequences conferring 9-cis-RA-mediated response resided primarily within the fragment flanked by NdeI (−121 bp) and PstI (+71 bp) sites (see Fig. 1), which contained the putative RXR response element. Cotransfection studies were repeated with a mutated hRXRγ2.luc.−1140 construct containing cytidine substitutions for the invariant second position guanine within each hexameric half-site of the imperfect repeat sequence (hRXRγ2.luc.−1140.m1; Fig. 2B). The 9-cis-RA/RXRα-mediated activation of hRXRγ2.luc.−1140.m1 was markedly lower (>75%) than that of hRXRγ2.luc.−1140, confirming that the imperfect repeat conferred the majority of the 9-cis-RA/RXR-mediated response (Fig. 2B). This retinoid-responsive element is here referred to as the γRXRE. To test whether the γRXRE could confer retinoid responsiveness to a heterologous promoter and to examine its transcriptional regulatory properties further, including its potential to interact with other class II and class III nuclear receptors, two copies of the γRXRE were cloned upstream of the herpes simplex TK promoter fused to a luciferase reporter (γRXRE.TKluc). Cotransfection studies showed that γRXRE.TKluc was activated 8-10-fold by 9-cis-RA in the presence of RXRα (Fig. 3A). Significant RXR-mediated activation of γRXRE.TKluc occurred only in the presence of its ligand, 9-cis-RA, as was observed with the homologous promoter (hRXRγ2.luc.−1140). When point mutations identical to those present in hRXRγ2.luc.−1140.m1 were introduced into both copies of the γRXRE in the context of TKluc (γRXREm2.TKluc), 9-cis-RA-mediated responsiveness was abolished (Fig. 3A). The cotransfection experiments were repeated with expression vectors for murine RXRα, -β, and -γ to determine whether the γRXRE was capable of conferring 9-cis-RA-mediated transcriptional activation via all known RXRs. All three RXRs mediated 9-cis-RA-dependent activation to a similar level (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that RXR·;RAR heterodimers may confer transcriptional activation via DR-1 elements in the presence of either 9-cis-RA or all-trans-RA (21Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 22Durand B. Saunders M. Leroy P. Leid M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 71: 73-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In contrast to RXR homodimer-mediated activation, the ligand-mediated activation of RXR·;RAR heterodimers on a DR-1 element occurs mainly or solely via RAR (23Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 24Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Accordingly, RXR·;RAR heterodimers may function as transcriptional inhibitors of RXR homodimer activation on DR-1 elements. In fact, the transfection studies shown above (Fig. 2A) revealed that, in the context of the homologous promoter, RXRα-mediated activation of γRXRE was reduced by the presence of RARβ. To explore the activation of γRXRE in the context of a heterologous promoter, cotransfection studies were performed with γRXRE.TKluc and pCDMRXRα and/or pCDMRARβ in the presence and absence of either 9-cis-RA (a potential ligand for either RXR or RAR) or all-trans-RA (an RAR ligand) (Fig. 3B). Cotransfection of pCDMRARβ alone or pCDMRARβ plus pCDMRXRα in the absence of ligand did not significantly alter the transcriptional activity of γRXRE.TKluc. Activation of γRXRE.TKluc by either all-trans RA or 9-cis-RA in the presence of both RXRα and RARβ was lower than the induction obtained with RXRα alone in the presence of 9-cis-RA (mean of 4-5-fold versus 8-fold, respectively). These results and the retinoid-mediated activation studies of the homologous promoter (Fig. 2A) indicate that the γRXRE is preferentially activated by RXR and its cognate ligand 9-cis-RA. The retinoid-mediated transcriptional regulatory properties of the γRXRE is similar to that of other DR-1 elements such as the cellular retinol-binding protein II gene RXRE (23Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 25Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) in which cotransfection of RARβ blunts 9-cis-RA mediated transactivation by RXRα. Additional experiments demonstrated that several other known RXR partners, including TRα1, TRβ1, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, had no effect on γRXRE.TKluc transcriptional activity in the presence of appropriate hormone ligands (thyroid hormone) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activators (fatty acids or clofibrate) with or without RXR (data not shown). To characterize the interaction of RXR with the γRXRE, EMSAs were performed with a 32P-radiolabeled γRXRE oligonucleotide probe and bacterially overexpressed, partially purified RXRα. As shown in Fig. 4A, RXRα homodimers bound the γRXRE as a single complex with an affinity that was significantly increased by the addition of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 4A, lane 3) compared with vehicle (Fig. 4A, lane 2). The specificity of the RXR homodimer-γRXRE interaction was demonstrated by competition studies showing complete inhibition of formation of the complex by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled γRXRE but no reduction in complex formation with an equivalent molar amount of unlabeled, unrelated double-stranded oligonucleotide (Fig. 4A; lanes 3-5). In addition, the specific complex was “supershifted” with anti-RXR antisera (Fig. 4A; lanes 6 and 7). Finally, when a mutated γRXRE probe, containing the same point mutations previously shown to abolish functional activity, was incubated with RXRα and 9-cis RA, no complex formed (Fig. 4A, lanes 8 and 9). These data confirm that RXRα homodimers can interact directly and specifically with the γRXRE and that ligand increases binding affinity. To characterize RXR·;RAR heterodimer binding to the γRXRE, EMSA was performed with bacterially overexpressed RARβ and RXRα (Fig. 4B). A minimal complex was observed when either RAR or RXR alone was added to γRXRE probe in the absence of ligand. In contrast, incubation of the probe with both receptors resulted in a marked increase in complex formation. Competition experiments confirmed that this interaction was specific (Fig. 4B; lanes 4-6). Accordingly, RXR·;RAR heterodimers bind the γRXRE in a cooperative manner. In contrast to the interaction of γRXRE with RXR homodimers, the RXR·;RAR-γRXRE interaction was not influenced by the addition of 9-cis-RA or all-trans-RA (data not shown). A significant body of evidence indicates that RXR and the known orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF often compete at a single DR-1-type element (26Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J.

To examine the potential binding of COUP-TF to the γRXRE, EMSAs were performed using COUP-TF tagged with an NH2-terminal Myc peptide overproduced in bacteria (COUP-TFMyc). COUP-TFMyc formed a specific complex with the γRXRE, as demonstrated by competition studies (Fig. 5). “Supershift” experiments with an anti-Myc antibody provided additional evidence for the specificity of the COUP-TF-γRXRE interaction. Thus, COUP-TF binds the γRXRE with high affinity. Cotransfection mixing experiments were performed with γRXRE.TKluc, pCDMRXRα, and pCDMCOUP to determine whether these transcription factors could compete at the γRXRE to modulate transcription (Fig. 6). For these experiments, increasing amounts of pCDMCOUP were transfected into CV-1 cells with a fixed amount of pCDMRXRα in the presence of 9-cis-RA. Because parallel experiments with pTKLuc alone demonstrated a modest repressive effect of COUP-TF on TK transcription, all data presented for γRXRE.TKluc have been corrected for the effect on the TK promoter. COUP-TF blunted the 9-cis-RA-mediated RXR activation via the γRXRE in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6). With the highest amounts of pCDMCOUP transfected, transcription of γRXRE.TKluc was repressed below basal levels, indicating that, in addition to competing with RXR, at higher levels COUP-TF actively represses transcription via the γRXRE, a property shown for most known COUP-TF response elements (14Carter M.E.

These results, together with the binding studies, indicate that COUP-TF modulates retinoid-mediated activation of γRXRE and suggest a mechanism whereby transcriptional activity can be modulated over a wide range. This report demonstrates that the human RXRγ2 gene promoter contains a RXR response element, a mechanism for the regulation of RXRγ2 gene expression by retinoid-mediated pathways. The presence of autoregulatory elements within the promoters of genes encoding other nuclear receptor isoforms, including RARβ2, RARα2, RARγ2, and TRβ1, suggests that the expression of a subset of nuclear receptor genes are controlled by this mechanism (38de The H. del Mar Vivanco-Fuiz M.

A comparison of the γRXRE sequence with the relatively few known natural DR-1 RXREs is shown in Fig. 7. Although the 5′-half-site sequence of the γRXRE is novel compared with other known elements, it conforms to the known consensus (PuG(G/T)TNA) for binding class II or class III nuclear receptors (reviewed in Ref. 7Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the γRXRE sequence, including the extended heptamer of the 5′-half-site (GGGTTGA) resembles the RXRα binding site (GGGGTCAaAGGTCA) and the high affinity RXRγ consensus (RGRNCAaAGGTCA) determined by nonbiased random oligonucleotide selection (47Subauste J.S.

Interestingly, comparison of the sequences shown in Fig. 7 reveals that the 5′-half-site sequence often diverges from the idealized class II/III sequence (AGGTCA). To our knowledge, the role, if any, of such sequence differences in dictating transactivation properties of RXR isoforms has not been established. We show here that the interaction of γRXRE with RXR homodimers but not RXR·;RAR heterodimers is induced by the ligand 9-cis-RA, a unique property. Although others have shown ligand-dependent binding of RXR homodimers to DR-1 elements with receptor produced in reticulocyte lysate expression systems, to our knowledge this is the first example of ligand-induced binding with receptor protein produced in bacteria. In fact, several other groups have shown that RXR homodimer (produced in bacterial expression systems) binding to perfect DR-1 elements is ligand-independent (25Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K.

We have also shown that binding of RXRα (produced in our bacterial expression system) to an idealized DR-1 (AGGTCAaAGGTCA) is not dependent on or induced by 9-cis-RA.2 Taken together, these results suggest that the unique sequence of the γRXRE dictates the relative affinity by which RXR homodimers bind this element and thus require ligand for this interaction. Our results also demonstrate that the orphan receptor COUP-TF competes with RXR homodimers on the γRXRE to repress transcription. This finding is consistent with the known role of COUP-TF as a negative modulator of RXR-mediated transcriptional regulatory pathways through competition for DNA binding. This competitive interaction has been demonstrated for a variety of natural and synthetic retinoid-responsive elements, including DR-1 (26Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Our data also indicate that, in addition to interference with RXR homodimer binding to the γRXRE, COUP-TF represses transcription via this element as it does on the majority of other COUP-TF response elements. A major unanswered question in nuclear receptor biology involves the specific biological roles of multiple RXR and RAR isoforms generated by differential promoter utilization and/or alternative splicing. The RXRγ2 isoform is an excellent focus for the study of the function of nuclear receptor isoforms because of its tissue- and developmental stage-restricted expression pattern (8Mangelsdorf D.J.

In addition, recent studies by us and others suggest that retinoids play a role in the control of postnatal cardiac energy metabolism (56Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R.

The known cardiac enriched expression of RXRγ2 and our identification of the γRXRE raises the intriguing possibility that the cardiac specific effects of retinoids occur via retinoid signaling pathways that converge on this gene. Given that RXRα and RXRβ are expressed prior to RXRγ in the developing heart and somites, it follows that the RXRγ2 gene promoter could be a downstream target during embryologic development. Cotransfection studies performed in our laboratory indicate that the γRXRE is activated similarly by RXRα, RXRβ, or RXRγ (data not shown), suggesting that the human RXRγ2 promoter is a potential target for any of the known RXRs. We especially thank Tod Gulick and David Moore for helpful discussions and Kelly Hall for expert secretarial assistance."

In order to characterize conformational changes in the 87-amino acid γPDE subunit that may accompany the activation of the holoenzyme, γPDE was labeled with the fluorescent probes 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein and eosin-5-isothiocyanate for use in resonance energy transfer measurements. 5-Iodoacetamidofluorescein specifically labeled a cysteine residue at position 68 and served as a resonance energy transfer donor. The site of modification of eosin-5-isothiocyanate, which served as the resonance energy transfer acceptor, was determined to be within the first seven residues of the amino terminus of γPDE. Energy transfer between the labeled sites on free, unbound γPDE indicated that they were separated by a distance of 63 Å, consistent with a random conformation. Upon binding the catalytic αβ subunits of the PDE, the distance between the two probes on γPDE increased to 77 Å. Binding of the labeled γPDE by αT·;guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate did not affect the distance between the probes under conditions where the PDE was activated. These data are consistent with the view that the binding of activated αT to γPDE, which is essential for the stimulation of PDE activity, does not impart significant alterations in the tertiary structure of the γPDE molecule.

The vertebrate phototransduction system has served as a paradigm for understanding how receptors containing seven transmembrane helices couple to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) and how activated G proteins regulate the activities of their biological effectors. The receptor in this system, rhodopsin (made up of the protein backbone opsin and the chromophore retinal), initiates the signaling pathway following the absorption of light. This leads to the formation of a complex between rhodopsin and the G protein transducin (which consists of a 39-kDa α subunit, designated αT, a 35-kDa β subunit, and an ∼8-kDa γ subunit, designated γT). Within this complex, rhodopsin stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP, which in turn causes the dissociation of transducin into an αT·;GTP species and intact β·;γT complex. The αT·;GTP species then stimulates the biological effector, the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), 1The abbreviations used are: PDEphosphodiesteraseGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateDTTdithiothreitolIAF5-iodoacetamidofluoresceinEITCeosin-5-isothiocyanateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionizationTOFtime of flight. a tetrameric enzyme consisting of two larger subunits (designated αPDE and βPDE, molecular mass ∼85 kDa) and two identical smaller subunits designated γPDE (∼14 kDa). The γPDE subunits serve as the binding sites for the GTP-bound αT subunit, although the specific mechanism by which αT binding to γPDE results in the stimulation of cyclic GMP hydrolysis by the catalytic core of the enzyme (i.e. the αPDE and βPDE subunits) is still not understood.

Recently, a significant amount of information has been reported regarding the tertiary structural features of G protein α subunits, including x-ray crystallographic structures for GDP- and GTPγS-bound forms of αT (Noel et al., 1993; Lambright et al., 1994) and αi1 (Coleman et al., 1994). This structural information has raised a number of possibilities regarding the identity of the regions and amino acid residues on the G protein α subunits that are involved in the regulation of effector activity. However, thus far, no tertiary structural information is available for a G protein-effector complex, and consequently, very little is known regarding the specific mechanisms by which G protein binding is translated into effector regulation. The phototransduction system would seem to be especially amenable to such structure-function characterization, given that the target sites on the effector molecule for the G protein (i.e. the γPDE subunits) are relatively small. However, based on NMR structure studies performed in this laboratory, all indications are that the γPDE subunits do not possess significant secondary structure, at least when these subunits are free in solution (i.e. when dissociated both from the larger PDE subunits and the αT subunit). In studying the protein-protein interactions important in visual signal transduction, our aim has been to develop fluorescence spectroscopic approaches to examine different aspects of the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of transducin (Phillips and Cerione, 1988; Guy et al., 1990; Mittal et al., 1994) and to probe the mechanisms underlying the activation of the cyclic GMP PDE (Erickson and Cerione, 1989, 1991; Erickson et al., 1995). In the present study, we have used resonance energy transfer approaches to determine whether the γPDE subunit adopts a unique tertiary structure when it is bound to the αPDE and βPDE subunits (versus when it is free in solution) and when it binds GTP-bound αT. To do this, we developed procedures for generating doubly labeled γPDE subunits, with one label serving as an energy donor and the other as an energy acceptor. Using these labeled γPDE subunits, we are able to show that the γPDE subunit does change its tertiary conformation upon binding to the αPDE and βPDE subunits; this change extends the distance between the amino terminus and cysteine 68 of the γPDE molecule. However, the binding of the αT subunit does not appear to perturb the relative juxtaposition of these two sites on γPDE. Thus, these results suggest that the changes in the γPDE subunit that accompany the binding of the GTP-bound αT subunit and are responsible for the stimulation of cyclic GMP hydrolysis by the αPDE and βPDE subunits do not occur between residue 68 and the amino terminus of the γPDE molecule. Furthermore, measurements of PDE enzyme activation and inhibition, along with the characterization of corresponding spectroscopic states of the doubly labeled γPDE subunit, support a model in which the activated αT·;γPDE complexes remain associated with the αβPDE core of the effector enzyme during the stimulation of cyclic GMP hydrolysis. SP-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and blue Sepharose were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Factor Xa was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). 5-Iodoacetamidofluorescein and eosin-5-isothiocyanate were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Dark-adapted bovine retina were purchased from Hormel Meat Packers (Austin, MN). All other chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma. The pLCIIFXSG plasmid was a gift from Dr. Heidi Hamm (University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL). Recombinant γPDE was expressed in Escherichia coli, and cells were lysed as described by Brown and Stryer (1989). Briefly, E. coli strain AR68 containing the pLCIIFXSG plasmid was grown at 30°C in a Labline fermentor and induced by temperature jump to 42°C at an A600 of 0.5. After the temperature jump, the cells were grown at 37°C for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g and lysed with lysozyme. cII-γPDE fusion protein was partially purified based on its insolubility in detergent, and this particulate fraction was subsequently solubilized in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 6 M urea, pH 8.0. The cII-γPDE present in the urea-solubilized extract was further purified by binding to an SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography matrix and eluting the γPDE fusion protein with a linear gradient of NaCl (50-300 mM), 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 6 M urea. The cII-γPDE fusion protein was diluted to a final [NaCl] of 100 mM and bound again to the SP-Sepharose column. While bound to the column matrix, the buffer was changed to 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, with no urea. The protein was again eluted with the same NaCl gradient. At this point, the γPDE was >90% pure based on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified γPDE was clipped with factor Xa at 4°C overnight. Ammonium sulfate was added to the γPDE to a final concentration of 0.75 M, and the clipped γPDE was then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column. The γPDE eluted from the phenyl-Sepharose column when there was no (NH4)2SO4 in the column buffer. This eluted protein was >99% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This sample was dialyzed in Spectropore 2,000-Da molecular mass cut-off tubing versus 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM DTT, pH 7.4, and stored in aliquots at −80°C until use. γPDE was reacted with 1 mM IAF at pH 7.4 for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with the addition of 30 mM DTT, and the labeled protein was separated from free probe by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Labeled protein was visualized in the gel using UV trans-illumination and excised (Wensel and Stryer, 1990; Erickson and Cerione, 1991). Gel purification of the labeled γPDE subunit provides a means to obtain only γPDE that contains the IAF (fluorescence donor) molecule. This is due to the fact that the γPDE subunit possesses a single reactive residue at cysteine 68 and that the labeled γPDE subunit undergoes an apparent shift in molecular mass from ∼11 to ∼15 kDa after IAF labeling. Thus, pure IAF-γPDE subunit can be isolated using a preparative gel; amino acid analysis together with fluorescein absorption measurements at 495 nm (ϵmax = 75,000 M−1 cm−1) (Carraway et al. 1989) indicate a stoichiometry of IAF incorporation of 1 ± 0.1 mol of IAF/mol of γPDE. The gel slice containing the labeled γPDE was incubated in 4 volumes of distilled water at 4°C overnight, and the gel eluate was dialyzed against a 100 × volume of 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM DTT, pH 7.4. The fluorescein-labeled γPDE was then reacted in this buffer with 1 mM EITC for 3 h. The reaction was quenched with 15 mM Tris, pH 6.8, and the protein was run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and again eluted from a gel slice. The ratio of eosin to fluorescein in the doubly labeled γPDE was determined to be 1:1.08 ± 0.04 (S.E., n = 3) by absorbance spectroscopy using a Hewlett-Packard 8451A spectrophotometer. The fluorescein absorbance was measured at 495 nm and corrected for any contribution from EITC by deconvolution (this represented 20% of the total absorbance). The concentration of EITC in the doubly labeled protein was determined by eosin absorbance at 522 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 83,000 M−1 cm−1 for EITC (Cherry et al., 1976). There was no detectable contribution of fluorescein to this absorbance. Purification of transducin and holo-PDE from bovine retina were performed as described previously (Kroll et al., 1989). Rod outer segments were purified as described by Gierschik et al. (1984) and washed several times with isotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). The rod outer cell membranes were then resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) to release PDE from the membranes and centrifuged at 39,000 × g. The supernatant from the hypotonic wash (containing the holo-PDE) was concentrated using an Amicon 30,000-Da molecular mass cut-off membrane. Transducin was recovered from the hypotonically washed pellet by resuspending the membranes in hypotonic buffer supplemented with 100 mM GTP or GTPγS (for inactive GDP-bound αT or active GTPγS-bound αT, respectively). The membranes were washed several times with nucleotide-containing buffer, and the supernatants were pooled. The pooled extract containing crude transducin was purified by blue Sepharose chromatography as described by Pines et al. (1985). Trypsin-activated PDE (tPDE) was prepared by limited tryptic digest of purified PDE (Kroll et al., 1989). Trypsin at 65 μg/ml was added to 1 μM PDE and incubated at room temperature for 2 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 260 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. PDE activity was determined using a pH microelectrode as described by Yee and Liebman, 1978. Activity was measured in 5 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM cGMP, pH 7.5, at room temperature. Proton release from cGMP hydrolysis due to PDE activity was recorded in mV at one determination per second. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared by sonication of 17 mg of lecithin in 1.0 ml of deionized and distilled water. PDE purified from ROS was incubated with the phospholipid vesicles to allow binding, and the vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman Airfuge (10 min, 30 p.s.i.). Membrane-bound PDE was activated as described by Brown (1992). Briefly, PDE was digested with ArgC protease at a concentration of 0.1 units/μl for 6 h at room temperature. The PDE that remained in the membrane was then purified by recentrifugation in the Beckman Airfuge. Approximately 15-20% of the total PDE was recovered after binding and ArgC activation, and the ArgC-proteolyzed PDE had an activity of greater than 75% of that achieved by trypsinization. The PDE was inhibited by the addition of labeled recombinant γPDE or unlabeled, purified recombinant γPDE while activity was monitored to ensure that the minimum amount of γPDE required for full inhibition of PDE activity was added. The reconstituted, lipid vesicle-bound PDE was stimulated by the addition of the αT·;GTPγS subunit. In most cases, relative fluorescence was measured on an SLM 8000C spectrofluorimeter using a 1 × 0.3-cm quartz cuvette. Samples were diluted into 5 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5, and were stirred continuously. Excitation from a xenon lamp passed through a monochrometer set at 465 nm, and orthogonal emission was monitored continuously at 520 nm. Emission was corrected for changes in the lamp intensity by recording in ratio mode. The amplitude of the fluorescence changes (for example, following the addition of αPDE and βPDE to labeled γPDE) were measured by subtracting the peak height of the fluorescence change (i.e. after it has leveled off, typically after 800 s) from the fluorescence that is measured after unlabeled γPDE is added (i.e. conditions where the effect has been reversed by competition). Contributions to the fluorescence signals due to intrinsic protein fluorescence and light scattering were negligible (<1%) in all experiments presented here. The distance between donor and acceptor fluorophores was calculated according to Förster energy transfer theory (Lakowicz, 1983). When making resonance energy transfer measurements for the doubly labeled γPDE, we measured the change in IAF (donor) fluorescence that occurred after trypsin treatment (since this treatment effectively separates the donor (IAF) and acceptor (EITC) probes and eliminates energy transfer) and subtracted any changes caused by trypsin treatment of singly labeled IAF-γPDE. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) was calculated as follows,E=1−FVE−γFP−γ(Eq. 1) where FFE-γ is the relative fluorescein fluorescence of the intact doubly labeled γPDE, and FF-γ is the relative fluorescein fluorescence of the γPDE control following complete trypsinization of the singly labeled fluorescein species. Using the efficiency of energy transfer, the distance between the two probes (R) can be estimated using the following equation (Lakowicz, 1983), R=R0E−1−11/6(Eq. 2) and the R0 for fluorescein and eosin was calculated to be 56.8 Å, using the integral overlap method (Carraway et al., 1989; Epe et al., 1983). In calculating R0, the orientation factor κ2 was assumed to be 2/3, indicating equal probability for all dipole-dipole orientations. Polarization values of the free, labeled γPDE were determined to be ≤0.1, which indicates errors of <10% if κ2 is set to 2/3 (data not shown; see Tables II and III in Hass et al. (1978)). Fluorescence emission anisotropy was measured on an SLM 8000C fluorimeter. Emission in the horizontal and vertical orientations was measured simultaneously using a monochrometer set at 520 nm and a band pass filter of 520 nm. The G factor was set to 1.0 by adjusting the photomultiplier gain prior to beginning acquisition. All measurements were made at 20°C. Activity data in Fig. 2 were fit to the binding equation, A=A0−A0−A0K1+LT+RT−KI+LT+RT2−4RTLT2RT(Eq. 3) where A is the activity, A0 is the initial activity value, Af is the final (inhibited) activity, LT is the total γPDE concentration, RT is the total tPDE concentration, and KI is the inhibition constant. Anisotropy data in Fig. 2 were fit to the binding equation, r=r0+rrKD+LT+RT−KD+LT+RT2−4RTLT2RT(Eq. 4) where r is the anisotropy value, r0 is the initial anisotropy value, rf is the maximum anisotropy, LT is the total tPDE concentration, RT is the total γPDE concentration, and KD is the dissociation constant. All fits were generated using IgorPro software using a least squares fit criterion (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). For the comparison of the kinetics of relative fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy changes (e.g. Fig. 5B), relative fluorescence was determined using the mathematical relationship between fluorescence intensity and anisotropy (Lakowicz, 1983), I=3I∣1+2r(Eq. 5) orB=Au−A0.34A−1.34AB+Au(Eq. 6) where r is the anisotropy, I is the calculated emission intensity, I∥ is the intensity of emission polarized in parallel with the excitation beam, and I⊥ is the intensity of emission polarized perpendicular to the excitation beam. This calculated intensity was corrected for changes in the lamp intensity to give relative fluorescence. Calculated relative fluorescence was identical when using either I∥ or I⊥ and agreed very closely with data obtained when using the conventional measurement of relative fluorescence described above. In order to compare the rate of reversal by (unlabeled) γPDE of the αPDE/βPDE-induced enhancement in the fluorescein fluorescence of the doubly labeled γPDE and the rate of reversal of the increase in anisotropy (Fig. 3B), the fluorescence intensity differences for doubly labeled γPDE that is bound to tPDE and for doubly labeled (unbound) γPDE that is unbound must be mathematically corrected in the apparent anisotropy plot. This was performed using the equation, B=Au−A0.34A−1.34AB+Au(Eq. 7) where B is the fraction of γPDE that is bound to the trypsin-treated PDE, Au is the anisotropy of unbound (free) γPDE (0.176 for the data in Fig. 3B), AB is the anisotropy of γPDE bound to trypsin-treated PDE (0.232 in Fig. 3B), and A is the measured (uncorrected) anisotropy. The 0.34 and 1.34 factors are derived from the 34% higher fluorescence of the bound, doubly labeled γPDE (to αPDE and βPDE) relative to the unbound doubly labeled γPDE species.Fig. 3Interaction of γPDE with tPDE. Panel A shows the emission at 520 nm of IAF- and EITC-labeled γPDE and IAF-labeled γPDE. The upper curve shows the emission of 12 pmol (15 nM) of doubly labeled γPDE. The addition of 10 pmol of (12.5 nM) trypsinized PDE caused an increase in fluorescence emission, and the further addition of another 10 pmol of tPDE did not cause an additional increase in the emission. This increased fluorescence was reversed with 155 pmol (1.95 μM) of unlabeled γPDE. The lower curve shows the results for the corresponding control experiment with IAF-labeled γPDE. Inset, single exponential fit of the fluorescence changes that accompany the dissociation of doubly labeled γPDE upon the addition of unlabeled γPDE. Panel B shows anisotropy data recorded during the relative fluorescence measurements of the doubly labeled γPDE shown in panel A. Trypsinized PDE caused an increase in the anisotropy. This increase is saturable and reverses with the addition of the excess unlabeled γPDE.

In particular, we were interested in determining if the structure of γPDE changes upon its binding to the core of the PDE molecule and/or upon its binding to an activated αT subunit. We used the following strategy to generate a doubly labeled γPDE subunit. One site of labeling (with IAF) was the single cysteine residue at position 68, both because this site is located near one end of the γPDE molecule and because the conditions for its selective and stoichiometric modification have been well established (e.g. Erickson et al. (1995)). We then set out to label the primary amino group of the amino-terminal methionine residue, because previous studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal primary amino group of a protein can be selectively labeled when performing the modification at pH values below 7.5 (Carraway et al., 1990). However, given that the γPDE subunit contains a number of lysine residues, we first examined whether the labeling with EITC was in fact occurring at the amino-terminal residue rather than at one or more of the lysine residues on γPDE. When mass spectrometry was performed on the full-length recombinant γPDE labeled with both EITC and IAF, a single predominant peak was determined with a size of 10,880 (Fig. 1A). The position of this peak is within the experimental error of the calculated size for a full-length γPDE molecule containing just one IAF moiety and one EITC moiety (10,762 Da). We performed an additional experiment where the full-length γPDE, labeled with IAF and EITC, was trypsin-treated and then subjected to reverse-phase HPLC in order to resolve the resulting peptides. This was followed by mass spectrometry of the eosin-labeled species. The trypsin treatment resulted in the generation of only three peaks showing (EITC) absorbance at 525 nm. Two of these peaks showed lower relative levels of 525 nm absorbance and were subsequently found not to contain peptides as revealed by mass spectral analysis. It seems most likely that these peaks represented fluorescent dye aggregates, and we therefore concentrated on the third peak of 525-nm absorbance for further analysis. When this peak was subjected to mass spectrometry, two observable mass spectrum peaks were obtained (Fig. 1B). One peak of 1555 Da corresponds to the first seven amino acids from the amino terminus (ending with lysine residue 7) plus a single eosin moiety. The second peak of 2025 Da represents the first 11 amino acids (ending with arginine residue 11). Comparison of these experimentally determined labeled peptide masses revealed no other close matches when compared with hypothetical tryptic fragments in the γPDE sequence (not shown). These results indicate that the EITC label was attached either at the amino terminus as originally intended or at the lysine located seven residues from the terminus. Because the modification of lysine residues with isothiocyanate reagents typically requires several hours of incubation at pH > 8.5 (compared with the 3-h modification at pH 7.4 used here), we feel it is most likely that the EITC is attached to the amino-terminal methionine of γPDE. However, even if the EITC were placed at position 7, this would not affect the general aim of the study, which was to determine whether the position of the amino terminus of γPDE relative to cysteine 68 changed when binding to the larger subunits of the PDE and/or to the αT subunit of transducin. It has been well documented that trypsin treatment of the cyclic GMP PDE selectively degrades the γPDE subunits, resulting in a constitutively active PDE complex (composed of the αPDE and βPDE subunits) (Wensel and Stryer, 1990). Readdition of γPDE to the trypsin-treated enzyme reverses the constitutive activation and returns the enzyme to its inactive state. Fig. 2A shows that changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of IAF-γPDE can be used to monitor the interaction between the IAF- and EITC-labeled γPDE molecule and the αPDE and βPDE subunits. This anisotropy change directly reflects the association of the IAF-labeled γPDE subunit with the significantly larger core subunits (αPDE, βPDE) of the effector enzyme. The resultant titration profile is consistent with a single class of binding sites between the labeled γPDE and the trypsin-treated PDE and yields an apparent KD value of 6 nM. Fig. 2B shows the results of an experiment where the ability of the doubly labeled γPDE subunit to inhibit the trypsin-activated PDE was assayed. The data again yield a titration profile that can be fit by a single class of sites with an apparent KI value of 7 nM. The close agreement between these two observed KD values argues that the doubly labeled γPDE is fully functional in terms of its ability to bind to the core of the effector enzyme and inhibit cyclic GMP hydrolysis. We next determined whether the position of the amino-terminal domain (labeled with EITC) relative to cysteine 68 (labeled with IAF) changed upon the binding of the labeled γPDE to the trypsin-treated PDE. The rationale here was that any change in the proximity of these sites on the γPDE molecule would be reflected by a change in resonance energy transfer between the donor IAF and the acceptor EITC moiety, as monitored by a change in (donor) IAF fluorescence. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 3A. The lower trace represents a control where γPDE subunits, labeled at just a single site (cysteine 68) with IAF, were added to the trypsin-treated PDE. A slight increase (≤5%) in the IAF fluorescence was detected, presumably reflecting a change in the microenvironment of cysteine 68. This small change can be reversed by the addition of excess, unlabeled γPDE. The subsequent addition of trypsin also resulted in a minor increase in the singly IAF-labeled γPDE fluorescence. This suggests that the microenvironment of cysteine 68 within the full-length γPDE molecule is altered relative to the environment of cysteine 68 within the trypsinized fragment that contains this residue. A parallel set of controls was performed with a singly labeled eosin-γPDE species binding to trypsinized αβPDE. No detectable change in either eosin emission (at 545 nm) or absorbance (at 525) was observed when eosin-γPDE bound to the PDE enzyme core (data not shown). The upper trace in Fig. 3A shows the results obtained when γPDE labeled with both IAF and EITC was added to the αPDE and βPDE subunits, generated by trypsin treatment of the PDE. There was a significant increase in the IAF fluorescence of the doubly labeled γPDE upon binding to αPDE and βPDE. We have found that this increase, which ranged from 20 to 40% in different experiments (34 ± 5%, S.E., n = 4), could be completely eliminated by adding excess γPDE, consistent with the interaction between γPDE and the αPDE and βPDE subunits being fully reversible. Significantly, the addition of trypsin to the free, unbound doubly labeled γPDE caused a significant enhancement in the IAF fluorescence. After correction for the small changes caused by the addition of trypsin to the control IAF-labeled γPDE subunit (shown in the lower trace of Fig. 3A), the average value for trypsin-induced enhancement of the free IAF-γPDE fluorescence was 36 ± 2% (S.E., n = 8). In control experiments, the magnitude of the enhancement was not influenced by the presence of other nonfluoresc"

Although this metabolic effect is clear, the mechanism by which it is achieved is not known. Recently, a study of the regulation of Fru-2,6-P2 metabolism through different signal transduction pathways has been performed using murine Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts as a model (21Dalmau M. Bartrons R. Gil J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 212: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the attempts to measure regulation of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels and transcription rate were not successful because the cDNA probes available did not recognize Swiss 3T3 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA. The aim of this work is to study the signaling pathways that control the transcription of the 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase gene during cell proliferation. For this propose, we have investigated the effect of EGF, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), endothelin, and cholera toxin (CTx) on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase gene expression in Rat-1 fibroblasts and the role of mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) in this regulation.

Rat-1 fibroblasts were routinely grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For experimental purposes, cells were subcultured in six-well plates or 100-mm dishes and their quiescence was induced by maintaining the cells in serum-free medium during 24 h. After this, cells were stimulated with either FCS or different growth factors. Quiescent Rat-1 cells were activated with 10% FCS and different growth factors. At the indicated times, cells were exposed to [6-3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) for the last 1 h of stimulation. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was dissolved in 0.1 M NaOH and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. To measure Fru-2,6-P2 levels, Rat-1 cells were homogenized in 0.1 M NaOH, heated at 80°C for 15 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. Fru-2,6-P2 was determined in supernatants by its ability to activate pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase from potato tubers as described by Van Schaftingen et al. (25Van Schaftingen E. Lederer B. Bartrons R. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis were performed essentially as described by Burnette (26Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5844) Google Scholar). For 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase, we used a 1:1000 dilution of a polyclonal antibody raised against the rat liver protein (27El-Maghrabi M.R. Correia J.J. Heil P.J. Pate T. Coob C. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5005-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of MAPK phosphorylation was performed as described previously (28Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar) using anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-MAPK monoclonal antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence method. The amount of protein was determined by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms. Total RNA was extracted from Rat-1 cells by the LiCl/urea method (29Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses were carried out by standard procedures (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To detect 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA, a 1.4-kilobase EcoRI fragment from pPKB plasmid was used as a probe (31Tauler A. Rosenberg A.H. Colosia A. Studier W.F. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The integrity of the RNA was verified by observing the rRNA bands in the ethidium bromide gel under UV irradiation. The level of mRNA was evaluated by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms and corrected for the amount of 18 S rRNA using a ribosomic cDNA probe (32Gerlach W.L. Bedbrook J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1869-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Stable transfections were performed by the CaPO4 method as described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Rat-1 cells were plated at 106 cells/100-mm culture dish 24 h before transfection. The DNA precipitate (50 μg of the HindIII/BspmI 5′ flanking region of the F isoform of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase cloned into pBLCAT3 plasmid as described by Lange (11Lange A.J. Espinet C. Hall R. El-Maghrabi M.R. Vargas A.M. Miksicek R.J. Granner D.K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15673-15680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 5 μg of pSV2Neo) were left overnight. After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and replated at 1:4 dilution. G418 (400 μg/ml) was added 24 h later. Transfections containing resistant colonies were pooled for experimentation. CAT activity determinations were carried out as described by Ausebel et al. (33Ausebel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Protein was determined as described by Bradford (34Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 112: 195-203Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Statistical significance of difference was assessed by Student's unpaired t test. Confluent Rat-1 fibroblasts were made quiescent by maintaining them in serum-free medium for 24 h and then shifted to medium supplemented with 10% fetal-calf serum. After serum addition, the cells were harvested and samples were taken to be analyzed at different times. The data reported in Table I show that, after being exposed to serum, an increase of the intracellular Fru-2,6-P2 content was detected. During this process, the amount of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase protein also increased. This was measured by immunobloting with an antibody obtained against the liver 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase (Fig. 1). To determine whether the abundance of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase protein was correlated with the amount of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA, Northern blot analysis was done using a 1.4-kilobase cDNA probe (31Tauler A. Rosenberg A.H. Colosia A. Studier W.F. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, there was a transient increase in the level of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA with a maximum at 12-15 h (5-fold increase over serum deprivation mRNA levels) and a gradual decline to serum-free mRNA levels by 30 h. The analysis of the incorporation of [6-3H]thymidine into DNA during the course of this experiment revealed that the peak in mRNA accumulation was coincident with the onset of DNA synthesis (Fig. 2).Table IEffect of serum addition on fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levelsFru-2,6-P2 content6 h12 h24 hpmol/mg of proteinControl97 ± 13119 ± 1781 ± 7+ FCS154 ± 17*211 ± 15**233 ± 16** Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Expression of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA during the cell cycle of Rat-1 fibroblasts. Quiescent Rat-1 fibroblasts were stimulated with MEM supplemented with 10% FCS (v/v). At the indicated incubation times, total RNA (20 μg/lane) was extracted from cultured cells in the presence (▪) or absence (□) of FCS and analyzed by Northern blot. Upper, a representative Northern blot obtained with preparations including FCS is shown. Lower, the intensity of the autoradiographic signal was quantified by densitometric scanning and corrected for the amount of RNA obtained with the 18 S rRNA probe. Values are expressed relative to the value of control cells, which was considered as 1 arbitrary unit. Data are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. To measure thymidine incorporation, at the indicated incubation times, serum-stimulated cells were exposed to [6-3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi) during the last 1 h of stimulation, and incorporation was assayed by the trichloroacetic acid standard procedure. Each point (○) represents the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each one performed by triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the regulation of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels was due to a regulation of its transcription rate, Rat-1 fibroblasts were stable transfected with a CAT reporter gene under transcriptional control of a 1.7-kilobase genomic DNA fragment that contain the F-type promoter (11Lange A.J. Espinet C. Hall R. El-Maghrabi M.R. Vargas A.M. Miksicek R.J. Granner D.K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15673-15680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary RNase protection experiments, we observed that the F-type isoform is the only one expressed in these cells. Quiescent transfected cells were stimulated with 10% of serum, and CAT activity was measured at different times. As shown in Fig. 3, up to 4-fold induction of CAT activity was found at 4 and 8 h after addition of serum. In contrast, CAT activity did not change in cells incubated in the absence of serum during this period. In order to study the signal transduction pathways that control the expression of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase in Rat-1 fibroblasts during proliferation, we determined the effect of EGF, LPA, endothelin, and cholera toxin (CTx) on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels. As shown in Table II, EGF at 10 ng/ml and LPA at 70 μM increased the levels of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA 4- and 7-fold, respectively. No significant change in 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels was detected after endothelin addition. Furthermore, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC) also failed to increase 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA. In contrast, CTx at 10 ng/ml decreased the 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels by approximately 50%. In agreement with the results from measurement of mRNA levels, addition of EGF and LPA to quiescent Rat-1 fibroblasts induced an increase in Fru-2,6-P2 levels. In contrast, TPA or endothelin did not modify the concentration of this metabolite (Table III).Table IIEffect of growth factors on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levelsRelative amount of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNAArbitrary unitsControl1.0+ FCS6.2 ± 0.1+ EGF3.8 ± 0.3+ LPA7.1 ± 0.8+ TPA1.5 ± 0.1+ ET-11.4 ± 0.2+ CTx0.5 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Table IIIEffect of growth factors on fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levelsFructose 2,6-P2 contentpmol/mg of proteinControl119 ± 17+ EGF167 ± 3*+ LPA188 ± 17*+ TPA111 ± 25+ CTx110 ± 11 Open table in a new tab Both EGF and LPA induce the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (MAPKs) through the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway (35Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 36Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Rat-1 fibroblasts, cAMP can inhibit the activation of MAPKs by inhibiting Raf activation (37Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). To examine the correlation between MAPK activation and the increase in 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA found after mitogenic responses, quiescent Rat-1 cells were preincubated with CTx for 90 min before stimulation with EGF and the 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels were then measured. The phosphorylation state of ERK2 is shown in Fig. 4. As we expected, a phosphotyrosine protein that comigrated with ERK2 was detected after EGF and serum addition, but it was almost undetectable with TPA. Preincubation with CTx blocked the effect of EGF on ERK2 phosphorylation (panel B). Under these experimental conditions, EGF produced a 4-fold increase on the levels of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA and preincubation with CTx completely inhibited this effect (panel C). The same results were obtained with LPA (data not shown). Recently, PD 098059 has been identified as a specific cell-permeant inhibitor of MEK (38Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar). To prove that MAPK activation is involved in mediating the effect of EGF on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase expression, we examined the effect of this compound on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels. As shown in Fig. 5, PD 098059 is able to prevent the increase on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA by EGF. The concentration of inhibitor required to avoid this activation was similar to the one reported to inhibit MAPK (38Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar). The ability of PD 098059 to inhibit the effect EGF on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels was correlated with its ability to prevent the activation of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase transcription. Cells stably transfected with a CAT reporter gene under transcriptional control of 1.7-kilobase F-type promoter, were incubated at different concentrations of PD 098059 and CAT activity was assayed 8 h after addition of EGF. As expected, PD 098059 suppressed the increase of CAT activity induced by EGF and the activity remaining at basal levels at high concentration of the inhibitor (Fig. 6). Several reports have pointed out the essential role of Fru-2,6-P2 in the activation of glycolytic flux in growing cells (3Warburg O.

Commun. 1992; 183: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and recently with an increase in mRNA levels (40Joaquin M. Rosa J.L. Salvado C. Lopez S. Nakamura T. Bartrons R. Gil J. Tauler A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 41Darville M.I. Antoine I.V. Mertens-Strijhagen J.R. Dupriez V.J. Rousseau G.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1509-1517PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which growth factors regulate 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase are still unclear. The results presented here demonstrate that MAPK is involved in the regulation of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase gene transcription in response to mitogenic signals. The modulation of the expression of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase by growth factors is concomitant with their mitogenic response. Serum, LPA, and EGF, complete mitogens for Rat-1 fibroblasts (42van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), were able to increase the mRNA levels of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase and Fru-2,6-P2 content. In contrast, endothelin, which has a low mitogenic activity (43Van der Bend R.L. De Widt J. Van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. Van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), had no significant effect on the expression of this enzyme. Indeed, cAMP produced a decrease in 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels and inhibited the effect of LPA and EGF. In agreement with these results, Darville et al. (41Darville M.I. Antoine I.V. Mertens-Strijhagen J.R. Dupriez V.J. Rousseau G.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1509-1517PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that cAMP was also able to block the effect of serum on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase transcription. Previous studies reported a different effect of cAMP on Fru-2,6-P2 levels in fibroblasts. In Swiss 3T3 (21Dalmau M. Bartrons R. Gil J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 212: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and human fibroblasts (16Rousseau G.G. Fisher Y. Guening M.A. Marchand M.J. Testar X. Hue L. Prog. Cancer Res. Ther. 1988; 35: 150-163Google Scholar), cAMP induces an increase in the concentration of Fru-2,6-P2, while in chick-embryo fibroblast (19Boscà L. Rousseau G.G. Hue H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6440-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the presence of dibutyryl cAMP did not change the levels of this metabolite. It is very likely that the discrepancy between these results is due to the different mitogenic role of cAMP in these cells; cAMP is a mitogenic signal in Swiss 3T3 cells (44Rozengurt E. Legg A. Strang G. Courtenay-Luck N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4392-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), but it is a strong antimitogen in Rat-1 fibroblasts (37Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). With regard to the signaling pathways that control the transcription of the 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase gene during cell proliferation, our results suggest that agents or growth factors (LPA, EGF) that activate the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway also increase the levels of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA. In Rat-1 fibroblasts, EGF promotes the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 proteins through a Ras-dependent pathway without affecting inositol phosphate levels (42van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 45Van Corven E.J. van Rijswijk A. Jalink K. van der Bend R.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the same cells, LPA activates at least three independent signaling cascades by coupling its receptor to Gi and Gq proteins: stimulation of phospholipases C and D via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein (Gq), inhibition of adenylate cyclase via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (Giä), and activation of Ras via a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein (Gβγ) (46Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The activation of the Ras cascade by LPA produces the stimulation of MAPK (36Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Rat-1 fibroblasts, Ras is a point of convergence of EGF and LPA signaling pathways in the activation of MAPK. It has been shown that raising the cAMP levels in the cell induces the hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 by PKA, reducing the binding affinity of Raf-1 to Ras and consequently inhibiting the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway (47Häfner S. Adler H. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Our results show that the inhibition of this pathway by cAMP also leads to an inhibition of the stimulatory effect of EGF and LPA on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase expression. The effect of cAMP on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase expression is probably due to inhibition of MAPK activation. The implication of MAPK cascade on the expression of this enzyme has been suggested previously (41Darville M.I. Antoine I.V. Mertens-Strijhagen J.R. Dupriez V.J. Rousseau G.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1509-1517PubMed Google Scholar). However, definitive experiments were necessary to support this tentative hypothesis. Our finding that a specific inhibitor of MEK can prevent the effect of EGF on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels and on the transcriptional levels provides further evidence to confirm the idea that MAPK is involved in regulating 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase expression during proliferative processes. Activation of PKC increases Fru-2,6-P2 levels in different cells (16Rousseau G.G. Fisher Y. Guening M.A. Marchand M.J. Testar X. Hue L. Prog. Cancer Res.

Although there is no direct evidence, several reports suggest that PKC may regulate 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase gene expression. In chick embryo fibroblasts, incubation with TPA produced an increase in 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase activity and this effect was abolished in cells incubated with actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or puromycin (19Boscà L. Rousseau G.G. Hue H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6440-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In fetal hepatocytes (22Cascales M. Martin-Sanz P. Boscà L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Swiss 3T3 cells (21Dalmau M. Bartrons R. Gil J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 212: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the rise in 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase activity produced by phorbol esters was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that it is due to enhanced expression of the protein. Our results demonstrate that, in Rat-1 fibroblasts, endothelin, a strong stimulator of PKC, and TPA, had no detectable effect on 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase mRNA levels and Fru-2,6-P2, suggesting that activation of PKC pathway alone is not enough to stimulate 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase expression in these cells. It has been reported that, in Rat-1 fibroblasts, endothelin fails to stimulate ERK phosphorylation, despite its potent coupling to the phospholipase C-PKC second messenger cascade (36Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The different contribution of PKC to MAPK activation could explain the fact that, in Swiss 3T3 cells, bombesin, another phospholipase C-activating agonist, was able to increase 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase activity (21Dalmau M. Bartrons R. Gil J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 212: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In these cells, bombesin stimulates MAPK activity via a pathway that is almost entirely dependent on PKC (48Pang L. Decker J. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the F promoter of 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase reveals the presence of several DNA-binding sites that could directly or indirectly regulate the transcription of the 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase gene by MAPK activation. A region containing three binding motifs for transcription factors of the ets oncogene family has been found in the F promoter (10Dupriez V.J. Darville M.I. Antoine I.V. Gegonne A. Ghysdael J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8224-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of various Ets-related transcription factors is regulated by MAPK. Thus, c-Ets-2 is both transcriptionally activated and phosphorylated by MAPK (49Coffer P. de Jonge M. Mettouchi A. Binetruy B. Ghysdeal J. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 911-922PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the Ets-related transcription factor p62TCF/Elk-1 by MAPK stimulates ternary complex formation at c-fos promoter, thus activating the fos transcription and consequently, the AP-1 DNA binding activity (50Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 51Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R.

A. 1988; 86: 6543Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported an AP-1 DNA-binding site about 250 bp downstream of the F promoter, and several reports show that an intronic AP-1 site could regulate gene expression (54Hengerer B. Lindholm D. Heumann R. Rüther U. Wagner E.F. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 55Van Dijck P. Schoonjans K. Sassone Corsi P.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3748-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the same 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase gene, a potent glucocorticoid response element was identified in the first intron of liver transcript (11Lange A.J. Espinet C. Hall R. El-Maghrabi M.R. Vargas A.M. Miksicek R.J. Granner D.K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15673-15680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an E2F binding site localized at the 5′ end of the first exon has been suggested to be involved in the serum regulation of F promoter (41Darville M.I. Antoine I.V. Mertens-Strijhagen J.R. Dupriez V.J. Rousseau G.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1509-1517PubMed Google Scholar). E2F transcriptional activity is blocked by its binding to hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB). G1 cyclins, including cyclin D1, forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases which can phosphorylate pRB, causing to release E2F (57Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). Although there is no evidence, MAPK pathway could regulate the dissociation of E2F from retinoblastoma protein (pRB) leading to activation of E2F target genes. In this sense, EGF induction of cyclin D1 transcription was antagonized by either dominant negative MAPK or dominant negatives of Ets-2 activation, suggesting that MAPK and Ets-2 function downstream of EGF in the context of cyclin D1 induction (58Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). It would be very interesting to study whether this putative MAPK-Ets-cyclin D1-pRB-E2F pathway controls 6PF2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase expression. We thank Dr. R. Bartrons for continued interest in this work.
