https://openalex.org/W2093471887,"We describe the crystal structure of the complete Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome containing bound messenger RNA and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) at 5.5 angstrom resolution. All of the 16S, 23S, and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) chains, the A-, P-, and E-site tRNAs, and most of the ribosomal proteins can be fitted to the electron density map. The core of the interface between the 30S small subunit and the 50S large subunit, where the tRNA substrates are bound, is dominated by RNA, with proteins located mainly at the periphery, consistent with ribosomal function being based on rRNA. In each of the three tRNA binding sites, the ribosome contacts all of the major elements of tRNA, providing an explanation for the conservation of tRNA structure. The tRNAs are closely juxtaposed with the intersubunit bridges, in a way that suggests coupling of the 20 to 50 angstrom movements associated with tRNA translocation with intersubunit movement."
https://openalex.org/W1999284470,"The assembly of higher order chromatin structures has been linked to the covalent modifications of histone tails. We provide in vivo evidence that lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3 Lys9) is preferentially methylated by the Clr4 protein at heterochromatin-associated regions in fission yeast. Both the conserved chromo- and SET domains of Clr4 are required for H3 Lys9 methylation in vivo. Localization of Swi6, a homolog of Drosophila HP1, to heterochomatic regions is dependent on H3 Lys9 methylation. Moreover, an H3-specific deacetylase Clr3 and a beta-propeller domain protein Rik1 are required for H3 Lys9 methylation by Clr4 and Swi6 localization. These data define a conserved pathway wherein sequential histone modifications establish a ""histone code"" essential for the epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2047195788,"Heterotrophic organisms generally face a trade-off between rate and yield of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. This trade-off may result in an evolutionary dilemma, because cells with a higher rate but lower yield of ATP production may gain a selective advantage when competing for shared energy resources. Using an analysis of model simulations and biochemical observations, we show that ATP production with a low rate and high yield can be viewed as a form of cooperative resource use and may evolve in spatially structured environments. Furthermore, we argue that the high ATP yield of respiration may have facilitated the evolutionary transition from unicellular to undifferentiated multicellular organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2048435335,"We used strong-field laser pulses that were tailored with closed-loop optimal control to govern specified chemical dissociation and reactivity channels in a series of organic molecules. Selective cleavage and rearrangement of chemical bonds having dissociation energies up to approximately 100 kilocalories per mole (about 4 electron volts) are reported for polyatomic molecules, including (CH3)2CO (acetone), CH3COCF3 (trifluoroacetone), and C6H5COCH3 (acetophenone). Control over the formation of CH(3)CO from (CH3)2CO, CF3 (or CH3) from CH3COCF3, and C6H5CH3 (toluene) from C6H5COCH3 was observed with high selectivity. Strong-field control appears to have generic applicability for manipulating molecular reactivity because the tailored intense laser fields (about 10(13) watts per square centimeter) can dynamically Stark shift many excited states into resonance, and consequently, the method is not confined by resonant spectral restrictions found in the perturbative (weak-field) regime."
https://openalex.org/W2007486805,"Malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA), generated by acetyl-CoA carboxylases ACC1 and ACC2, is a key metabolite in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Here, we show that Acc2-/- mutant mice have a normal life span, a higher fatty acid oxidation rate, and lower amounts of fat. In comparison to the wild type, Acc2-deficient mice had 10- and 30-fold lower levels of malonyl-CoA in heart and muscle, respectively. The fatty acid oxidation rate in the soleus muscle of the Acc2-/- mice was 30% higher than that of wild-type mice and was not affected by addition of insulin; however, addition of insulin to the wild-type muscle reduced fatty acid oxidation by 45%. The mutant mice accumulated 50% less fat in their adipose tissue than did wild-type mice. These results raise the possibility that pharmacological manipulation of ACC2 may lead to loss of body fat in the context of normal caloric intake."

The Fermi gas has been cooled to a temperature of 0.25 times the Fermi temperature by thermal collisions with the evaporatively cooled bosons. At this temperature, the spatial size of the gas is strongly affected by the Fermi pressure resulting from the Pauli exclusion principle and gives clear experimental evidence for quantum degeneracy."
https://openalex.org/W2054294779,"An electron hopping on non-coplanar spin sites with spin chirality obtains a complex phase factor (Berry phase) in its quantum mechanical amplitude that acts as an internal magnetic field, and is predicted to manifest itself in the Hall effect when it is not cancelled. The present combined work of transport measurement, neutron scattering, and theoretical calculation provides evidence that the gigantic anomalous Hall effect observed in Nd 2 Mo 2 O 7 , a pyrochlore ferromagnet with geometrically frustrated lattice structure, is mostly due to the spin chirality and the associated Berry phase originating from the Mo spin tilting."

These measurements allowed the comparison of simultaneous ocean and land net primary production (NPP) responses to a major El Niño to La Niña transition. Between September 1997 and August 2000, biospheric NPP varied by 6 petagrams of carbon per year (from 111 to 117 petagrams of carbon per year). Increases in ocean NPP were pronounced in tropical regions where El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts on upwelling and nutrient availability were greatest. Globally, land NPP did not exhibit a clear ENSO response, although regional changes were substantial."
https://openalex.org/W2011777898,"There is increasing evidence that areas of outstanding conservation importance may coincide with dense human settlement or impact. We tested the generality of these findings using 1 degree-resolution data for sub-Saharan Africa. We find that human population density is positively correlated with species richness of birds, mammals, snakes, and amphibians. This association holds for widespread, narrowly endemic, and threatened species and looks set to persist in the face of foreseeable population growth. Our results contradict earlier expectations of low conflict based on the idea that species richness decreases and human impact increases with primary productivity. We find that across Africa, both variables instead exhibit unimodal relationships with productivity. Modifying priority-setting to take account of human density shows that, at this scale, conflicts between conservation and development are not easily avoided, because many densely inhabited grid cells contain species found nowhere else."

https://openalex.org/W2069780164,"We have shown that bacterial mutation rates change during the experimental colonization of the mouse gut. A high mutation rate was initially beneficial because it allowed faster adaptation, but this benefit disappeared once adaptation was achieved. Mutator bacteria accumulated mutations that, although neutral in the mouse gut, are often deleterious in secondary environments. Consistently, the competitiveness of mutator bacteria is reduced during transmission to and re-colonization of similar hosts. The short-term advantages and long-term disadvantages of mutator bacteria could account for their frequency in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2045488261,"Song imitation in birds provides good material for studying the basic biology of vocal learning. Techniques were developed for inducing the rapid onset of song imitation in young zebra finches and for tracking trajectories of vocal change over a 7-week period until a match to a model song was achieved. Exposure to a model song induced the prompt generation of repeated structured sounds (prototypes) followed by a slow transition from repetitive to serial delivery of syllables. Tracking this transition revealed two phenomena: (i) Imitations of dissimilar sounds can emerge from successive renditions of the same prototype, and (ii) developmental trajectories for some sounds followed paths of increasing acoustic mismatch until an abrupt correction occurred by period doubling. These dynamics are likely to reflect underlying neural and articulatory constraints on the production and imitation of sounds."

The Tharsis-induced trough and antipodal high were largely in place by the end of the Noachian Epoch and exerted control on the location and orientation of valley networks. The release of carbon dioxide and water accompanying the emplacement of ∼3 × 10 8 cubic kilometers of Tharsis magmas may have sustained a warmer climate than at present, enabling the formation of ancient valley networks and fluvial landscape denudation in and adjacent to the large-scale trough."

The experiments were performed using a low-temperature atomic force microscope, a silicon tip, and a silicon (111) 7x7 surface. The measured site-dependent attractive short-range force, which attains a maximum value of 2.1 nanonewtons, is in good agreement with first-principles calculations of an incipient covalent bond in an analogous model system. The resolution was sufficient to distinguish differences in the interaction potential between inequivalent adatoms, demonstrating the ability of atomic force microscopy to provide quantitative, atomic-scale information on surface chemical reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2088046044,"By advancing spring leaf flush and ensuing food availability, climatic warming results in a mismatch between the timing of peak food supply and nestling demand, shifting the optimal time for reproduction in birds. Two populations of blue tits ( Parus caeruleus ) that breed at different dates in similar, but spatially distinct, habitat types in Corsica and southern France provide a unique opportunity to quantify the energetic and fitness consequences when breeding is mismatched with local productivity. As food supply and demand become progressively mismatched, the increased cost of rearing young pushes the metabolic effort of adults beyond their apparent sustainable limit, drastically reducing the persistence of adults in the breeding population. We provide evidence that the economics of parental foraging and limits to sustainable metabolic effort are key selective forces underlying synchronized seasonal breeding and long-term shifts in breeding date in response to climatic change."
https://openalex.org/W2041710499,"We report the development of a pseudorabies virus that can be used for retrograde tracing from selected neurons. This virus encodes a green fluorescent protein marker and replicates only in neurons that express the Cre recombinase and in neurons in synaptic contact with the originally infected cells. The virus was injected into the arcuate nucleus of mice that express Cre only in those neurons that express neuropeptide Y or the leptin receptor. Sectioning of the brains revealed that these neurons receive inputs from neurons in other regions of the hypothalamus, as well as the amygdala, cortex, and other brain regions. These data suggest that higher cortical centers modulate leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. This method of neural tracing may prove useful in studies of other complex neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1985259535,"During normal cellular metabolism, mitochondrial electron transport results in the formation of superoxide anion (O⨪2) and subsequently hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Because H2O2 increases in concentration under certain physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions and can oxidatively modify cellular components, it is critical to understand the response of mitochondria to H2O2. In the present study, treatment of isolated rat heart mitochondria with H2O2 resulted in a decline and subsequent recovery of state 3 NADH-linked respiration. Alterations in NADH levels induced by H2O2 closely paralleled changes in the rate of state 3 respiration. Assessment of electron transport chain complexes and Krebs cycle enzymes revealed that α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and aconitase were susceptible to H2O2 inactivation. Of particular importance, KGDH and SDH activity returned to control levels, concurrent with the recovery of state 3 respiration. Inactivation is not because of direct interaction of H2O2 with KGDH and SDH. In addition, removal of H2O2alone is not sufficient for reactivation. Enzyme activity does not recover unless mitochondria remain intact. The sensitivity of KGDH and SDH to H2O2-mediated inactivation and the reversible nature of inactivation suggest a potential role for H2O2 in the regulation of KGDH and SDH.

Interaction of H2O2 with metal ions, such as Fe2+, can result in the formation of metal-centered oxygen radicals and hydroxyl radical (OH⋅). These species are highly reactive and can oxidatively damage protein, lipids, and DNA (11Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. J. Biol.

To maintain the delicate balance between production and removal of oxygen radicals, mitochondria maintain a vast array of antioxidant enzymes and low molecular weight scavengers. An important question emerges from these findings: does mitochondrial free radical production represent metabolic imperfection? If so, production of free radicals necessitates the expenditure of considerable energy and intracellular volume to prevent oxidative damage. Such imperfection is rarely tolerated by evolutionary constraints. Alternatively, oxygen radicals may serve a beneficial role in the regulation of metabolic function.To be considered signaling molecules, H2O2and/or oxygen radicals must exhibit rapid alterations in concentration and exert reversible effects commensurate with metabolic requirements. Evidence indicates that the rate of mitochondrial free radical production increases as a result of diminished electron transport (1Chance B. Williams G.R. Advan. Enzymol. Relat. Subj.

This would occur when demand for ATP declines or under certain conditions of stress that result in impairment of specific respiratory complexes (15Ambrosio G. Zweier J.L. Duilio C. Kuppusamy P.

The level of H2O2 and various free radicals is also dependent on the activity and concentration of a number of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems. Mitochondria are therefore capable of varying the concentration of oxygen radicals and H2O2 in response to alterations in metabolism. Furthermore, these species have been shown to react with and modify protein(s), thereby altering enzyme activity (12Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). Although these phenomena have been investigated primarily in the context of free radical damage, it is clear that oxidative modification(s) to specific proteins can influence the activity of certain processes. Evidence for free radical-mediated alterations in function that are reversible and yield an appropriate regulatory response is required if oxygen radicals are to be considered signaling molecules within mitochondria.The purpose of this study was to gain further insight into the potential role of pro-oxidants in the regulation of mitochondrial function. Specifically, mitochondria were isolated from rat heart and treated with concentrations of H2O2 that result in reversible declines in the rate of state 3 respiration. The level of NAD(P)H, activities of electron transport chain, and Krebs cycle enzymes were monitored as a function of H2O2concentration and time of exposure. Results are presented that indicate that when NAD(P)H levels are diminished and maximal inhibition of respiration is observed, specific Krebs cycle enzymes exhibit declines in activity. Upon consumption of H2O2, NAD(P)H levels and the activities of certain of these enzymes return to control levels. Reversible H2O2-mediated inactivation of these enzymes requires that mitochondria remain intact. These results are discussed in light of the potential role of oxidants in the regulation of mitochondrial function and suggest future experiments necessary to further test these possibilities.DISCUSSIONOxygen radicals and H2O2 have been viewed primarily from the perspective of the damage they may impart. It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that by virtue of the ability to alter protein function (12Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar) and exhibit rapid alterations in concentration in response to physiological stimuli, these species satisfy certain prerequisites of signaling molecules (21Trimm J.L.

We have demonstrated that maximum rates of respiration and ATP synthesis are inhibited in a fully reversible fashion upon incubation of intact cardiac mitochondria with H2O2. State 3 respiratory rates reflect the availability of NADH for electron transport. These results are in general agreement with those reported for rat liver mitochondria treated with t-butyl hydroperoxide (33Rokutan K. Kawai K. Asada K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Further analysis of electron transport chain complexes and Krebs cycle enzymes revealed H2O2-dependent inactivation of SDH, KGDH, and aconitase. Thus the levels of NADH required for maximum rates of mitochondrial respiration would be limited not only by consumption of reducing equivalents for removal of H2O2 but also by inhibition of NADH production. In contrast to aconitase, the activities of SDH and KGDH recovered completely in parallel with maximum rates of respiration. Our results indicate that H2O2 mediates its effects on SDH and KGDH by modulating the redox status of the mitochondria. These results suggest that variations in the rate of H2O2 production may serve to regulate mitochondrial function.To be considered a regulatory molecule, H2O2must exert effects necessitated by metabolic requirements. Inactivation of KGDH and SDH would diminish reducing equivalents required for electron transport and limit generation of O⨪2 and H2O2. Thus reversible H2O2-induced inhibition of KGDH and SDH may serve an antioxidant function, preventing a pernicious rise in oxygen radical concentration. Alternatively, variations in H2O2 production may serve to regulate electron transport and ATP synthesis. As demand for ATP and electron transport declines, mitochondrial production of H2O2increases (1Chance B. Williams G.R. Advan. Enzymol. Relat. Subj. Biochem. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 3Cadenas E.

This would in turn reduce the activities of KGDH and SDH under conditions when the requirement for NADH and FADH2 is diminished. Conversely, as the demand for ATP increases, production of H2O2 would be expected to decrease, resulting in reactivation of SDH and KGDH and the resumption of maximal rates of electron transport. Clearly, these potential roles for H2O2 within the mitochondria are not mutually exclusive. Reversible inactivation of KGDH and SDH would limit oxygen radical production under conditions of oxidative stress and may regulate ATP synthesis during normal metabolism. In this study, we utilized concentrations of H2O2 expected during conditions of oxidative stress. However, maximal inactivation of both KGDH and SDH (∼40%) was observed at the lowest concentration of H2O2 tested (12.5 μm). Future studies must address the response of mitochondria to H2O2 endogenously generated under diverse metabolic conditions.There is considerable recent precedence indicating that H2O2 and certain oxygen radicals regulate cellular function. It has been shown previously that H2O2 is an essential component of several signal transduction pathways. Mechanisms by which H2O2 and oxygen radicals exert their effects include reversible oxidation of key sulfhydryl residues and alterations in the interactions between redox-sensitive molecules and target proteins (21Trimm J.L.

To fully elucidate the role of H2O2 in mitochondria it is necessary to identify the mechanism through which SDH and KGDH are inhibited and reactivated. Inactivation of SDH and KGDH is not because of direct interaction with H2O2. In addition, removal of H2O2 alone is not sufficient for reactivation. These results indicate that SDH and KGDH are responsive to the redox status of the mitochondria. There are several possible mechanisms by which enzyme activity could be modulated. We are currently exploring the potential role of the redox-sensitive molecule glutathione and the susceptibility of SDH and KGDH to reversible glutathionylation. It is noteworthy that, under the conditions of our experiments, the magnitude to which both SDH and KGDH were inactivated was similar (40%), regardless of the concentration of H2O2 utilized. This observation coupled with the sensitivity of these enzymes to redox status suggests a common mechanism of reversible inactivation.The results of this study indicate that, in contrast to KGDH and SDH, H2O2 is able to interact directly with aconitase, resulting in enzyme inactivation. The susceptibility of aconitase to free radical inactivation is in keeping with previous studies (34Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Aconitase contains an active site iron-sulfur [4Fe-4S]2+ complex. Using electronic spin resonance, it was determined that when purified mitochondrial aconitase is treated with superoxide (O⨪2) the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster is oxidized to [3Fe-4S]1+, resulting in the release of Fe(II) and H2O2 (45Vasquez-Vivar J.

Whereas this process renders the enzyme inactive, studies utilizing intact cells or purified enzyme revealed that reactivation occurs upon removal of oxidants and requires the presence of Fe(II) to reassemble [4Fe-4S]2+ (35Janero D.R.

Aconitase was irreversibly inactivated under the conditions of our experiments. However, mitochondria were isolated in a buffer containing EDTA. It has been shown previously that EDTA prevents reactivation of aconitase through the depletion of labile iron (35Janero D.R. Hreniuk D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1735-C1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,38Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have obtained preliminary results indicating that the addition of Fe(II) following H2O2 inactivation results in recovery of aconitase activity. Therefore, as suggested previously (45Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Kennedy M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14064-14069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), under in vivo conditions the activity of aconitase is likely reversibly affected by mitochondrial redox status. These results underscore the need to assess the potential for reversal of free radical-mediated enzyme inactivation. Because of incomplete removal of oxidants and/or the removal of key components required for reactivation, the reversible nature of inactivation may be easily overlooked. In the present study, aconitase activity remained depressed whereas the rate of state 3 respiration recovered completely. This is because, with α-ketoglutarate as a substrate, aconitase activity is not required for the production of NADH. Future studies that address the reversibility of aconitase inactivation and its relationship to state 3 respiratory rates must utilize substrates that result in the full use of the Krebs cycle.In summary, the oxidation-reduction reactions continuously carried out by respiring mitochondria would be expected to create a dynamic redox environment dependent on metabolic state. Maintenance of mitochondrial viability would therefore depend, in part, on the ability of mitochondria to sense changes in redox status and respond in a manner commensurate with metabolic requirements. In this study, we have provided clear evidence that overall mitochondrial respiration and the activities of specific mitochondrial enzymes are inhibited by the addition of H2O2 in a fully reversible fashion. Whereas these observations suggest a role for free radicals in regulation of mitochondrial function, direct evidence requires identification of mechanisms that lead to enzyme inactivation/reactivation. In addition, experiments designed to test the effects of exogenously added and endogenously produced H2O2 using a variety of respiratory substrates will further enhance our understanding of the process and its physiological significance. Enhanced free radical generation as well as loss of mitochondrial respiration and KGDH activity have been observed in Parkinson's disease (46Mizuno Y. Ikebe S. Hattori N. Nakagawa-Hattori Y.

Elucidation of the interplay between free radical processes and mitochondrial function would greatly benefit efforts to define specific molecular mechanisms by which free radicals contribute to the progression of these degenerative conditions. The four-electron reduction of O2 to two molecules of H2O represents the final step in mitochondrial electron transport. Chance and Williams (1Chance B. Williams G.R. Advan. Enzymol. Relat. Subj. Biochem. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar) first reported, however, that as much as 1–2% of oxygen consumed during mitochondrial respiration undergoes incomplete reduction to superoxide anion (O⨪2). Produced at the NADH-coenzyme Q reductase (Complex I) and cytochromec oxidase (Complex III) sites of the electron transport chain, superoxide is rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by superoxide dismutase (1Chance B.

Interaction of H2O2 with metal ions, such as Fe2+, can result in the formation of metal-centered oxygen radicals and hydroxyl radical (OH⋅). These species are highly reactive and can oxidatively damage protein, lipids, and DNA (11Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. J. Biol.

To maintain the delicate balance between production and removal of oxygen radicals, mitochondria maintain a vast array of antioxidant enzymes and low molecular weight scavengers. An important question emerges from these findings: does mitochondrial free radical production represent metabolic imperfection? If so, production of free radicals necessitates the expenditure of considerable energy and intracellular volume to prevent oxidative damage. Such imperfection is rarely tolerated by evolutionary constraints. Alternatively, oxygen radicals may serve a beneficial role in the regulation of metabolic function. To be considered signaling molecules, H2O2and/or oxygen radicals must exhibit rapid alterations in concentration and exert reversible effects commensurate with metabolic requirements. Evidence indicates that the rate of mitochondrial free radical production increases as a result of diminished electron transport (1Chance B. Williams"

It has generally been assumed that during photosynthesis, oxygen in CO 2 reaches isotopic equilibrium with oxygen in 18 O-enriched water in leaves. We show, however, large differences in the activity of carbonic anhydrase (which catalyzes CO 2 hydration and 18 O exchange in leaves) among major plant groups that cause variations in the extent of 18 O equilibrium (θ eq ). A clear distinction in θ eq between C 3 trees and shrubs, and C 4 grasses makes atmospheric C 18 OO a potentially sensitive indicator to changes in C 3 and C 4 productivity.

Although a variety of transcription factors (including AP-1, Egr-1, and nuclear factor κB) mediate hypoxia-inducible gene expression in specific contexts, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)1 is an essential global regulator of oxygen homeostasis (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a basic helix-loop-helix/PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM homology domain) protein consisting of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which HIF-1 activity is induced under hypoxic conditions remains to be established. HIF-1α and HIF-1β mRNAs are constitutively expressed in cultured cells, indicating that HIF-1 activity is regulated by post-transcriptional events. HIF-1α protein expression and HIF-1 transcriptional activity are precisely regulated by cellular O2concentration, whereas HIF-1β protein is constitutively expressed (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of sensing and signal transduction by which changes in O2 concentration result in changes in HIF-1 activity are complex and involve regulation at multiple levels, including changes in HIF-1α protein stability, nuclear localization, and transactivation function in response to hypoxia (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). HIF-1α protein expression is negatively regulated in non-hypoxic cells by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (3Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol.

Although much has been learned about the role of HIF-1 in controlling the expression of hypoxia-inducible genes, the underlying mechanisms by which cells sense a decrease in O2 concentration and transduce this signal to HIF-1α are largely unknown. Presently, four diverse O2-sensing mechanisms have been proposed to mediate the hypoxic transcriptional response (9Semenza G.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Two of these models postulate involvement of an iron-containing unit, in the form of either a heme group or an iron/sulfur cluster, that undergoes a change in activity (10Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1998; 242: 1412-1415Crossref Scopus (865) Google Scholar). These models are supported by the observation that exposure of cells to cobaltous ion (CoCl2) or the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFX) stabilizes HIF-1α under non-hypoxic conditions (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). However, no specific proteins with this role have been identified in mammalian cells. Two other models involve the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates by a flavoprotein-containing NAD(P)H oxidase or by mitochondria. In the NAD(P)H model, decreased reactive oxygen intermediate production triggers the transcriptional response to hypoxia (11Fandrey J. Frede S. Jelkmann W. Biochem.

In these latter two models, O2 signals are converted to redox signals. In addition to changes in cellular redox, hypoxia signal transduction may also require kinase/phosphatase activity because treatment of cells with genistein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) or sodium fluoride (a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor) blocks hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression (16Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In certain cell types, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors such as LY294002 and wortmannin also block hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression (14Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano S.E.

We demonstrate here that Rac1 is activated in response to hypoxia and plays an essential role in the induction of HIF-1α protein expression and transcriptional activity.

Nishida (Kyoto University). Tissue culture dishes were transferred to a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA), which was flushed with 1‥ O2, 5‥ CO2, and 94‥ N2; sealed; and placed at 37 °C (30Forsythe J.A.

Cells were transferred to 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well on the day before transfection. Fugene-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for transfection (31Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27891-27897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In each transfection, the indicated doses of test plasmids, 200 ng of reporter gene plasmid, and 50 ng of control plasmid pTK-RL (containing a thymidine kinase promoter upstream ofRenilla reniformis (sea pansy) luciferase coding sequences;Promega) were premixed with the transfection reagent. In each assay, the total amount of DNA was held constant by addition of empty vector. After treatment, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter assay system (Promega) (17Zhong H. Chiles K. Felser D. Laughner D. Hanrahan C. Georgescu M. Simon J.W. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1541-1545PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of firefly to sea pansy luciferase activity was determined for each reporter experiment; at least two independent transfections were performed in triplicate. Whole cell lysates were prepared by incubating cells for 30 min in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm NaVO3. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet cell debris. Aliquots were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot assay using protein G-purified mouse monoclonal antibody H1α67 at 1:1000 dilution (4Sutter C.H. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4748-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Signal was developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK293 cells were transfected with pBOS-HA-Rac1. After 18 h of serum starvation, cells were exposed to 1‥ O2, CoCl2, or DFX. Then, cells were lysed in Mg2+lysis/wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mmNaCl, 1‥ Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 2‥ glycerol) supplemented with EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a controlled atmosphere chamber (Plas-Laboratories, Inc.) maintained at 1‥ O2. Lysates (200 μg) were incubated with 15 μg of GST-PBD (containing amino acids 69–150 of PAK1), bound to glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer. The bead pellet was finally suspended in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (32Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot assay using anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In each experiment, to confirm that equal amounts of HA-tagged Rac1 protein were expressed, immunoblot assay of the starting lysate with the anti-HA antibody was also performed. To examine the role of the small GTPase Rac1 in hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation, Hep3B cells were cotransfected with reporter p2.1 containing an HIF-1-dependent HRE and an expression vector encoding either a dominant-negative (Rac1-N17) or a constitutively activated (Rac1-V12) form of Rac1. Cells were exposed to 20 or 1‥ O2for 16 h and then subjected to luciferase assays. Rac1-N17 expression significantly suppressed hypoxia-induced reporter gene transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Rac1-V12 expression had a small but reproducible stimulatory effect. In addition to hypoxia, HIF-1 activity is also induced in cells exposed to CoCl2 or DFX (7Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Rac1-N17 expression significantly attenuated reporter gene transcription in response to 100 μm CoCl2 or DFX, although the degree of inhibition was less than the inhibition of the hypoxic response (Fig.1 B). We next tested two other members of the Rho family of small GTPases, Rho and Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Cdc42-N17 suppressed hypoxia-induced gene transcription, whereas Rho-DN did not. The dominant-negative form of another small GTPase, Ras-N17, also suppressed hypoxia-induced luciferase expression. Transcription of p2.1 in hypoxic HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells was also inhibited by Rac1-N17 (data not shown). Moreover, transcription of a reporter gene containing the HRE from the human VEGF gene in hypoxic Hep3B, HEK293, and NIH3T3 cells was also inhibited by Rac1-N17 (data not shown). The biological activity of HIF-1 is mainly determined by the expression and activity of the HIF-1α subunit. HEK293 cells overexpressing Rac1-N17 were exposed to hypoxia to examine whether Rac1 is involved in the regulation of HIF-1α protein expression. Rac1-N17 completely suppressed the induction of HIF-1α expression in response to hypoxia, whereas expression of Rac1-V12 modestly enhanced the induction of HIF-1α in hypoxic cells (Fig.2 A). Cdc42-N17 partially suppressed hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1α (Fig. 2 A,lane 6), which was consistent with its effects on reporter gene expression (Fig. 1 B). Under non-hypoxic conditions, neither Rac1-V12 nor Cdc42-V12 had a detectable effect on HIF-1α expression (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). Compared with Rac1-N17, the dominant-negative form of Rho did not affect HIF-1α expression (Fig. 2 B). We next examined the effect of Rac1-N17 on chemical-induced HIF-1α expression. Neither CoCl2- nor DFX-induced HIF-1α expression was significantly affected by Rac1-N17 (Fig. 2 C). There are two independent transactivation domains (TADs) present in HIF-1α designated as the amino-terminal (amino acids 531–575) and carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 786–826) TADs (TAD-N and TAD-C, respectively) (7Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that steady-state levels of fusion proteins consisting of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to HIF-1α TADs are similar under hypoxic and non-hypoxic conditions (7Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), these GAL4-HIF-1α fusion constructs can be used to examine the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α independent of its protein expression level. Rac1-N17 completely blocked hypoxia-induced transactivation mediated by GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–826), which contains both TAD-N and TAD-C (Fig.3 A). Moreover, transactivation by GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–826) induced by CoCl2 or DFX was also significantly suppressed by Rac1-N17 expression. It is noteworthy that CoCl2- or DFX-induced transactivation was attenuated by Rac1-N17, although CoCl2- or DFX-induced HIF-1α protein expression was not sensitive to Rac1-N17. Rac1-V12 expression stimulated transactivation mediated by GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–826), especially in cells not exposed to inducers (20‥ O2) (Fig.3 A), in contrast to its lack of effect on HIF-1α protein expression. Transactivation mediated by GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–575), which contains only TAD-N, was also blocked by Rac1-N17 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, GAL4-HIF-1α-(786–826), which contains only TAD-C, was constitutively activated and not inhibited by Rac1-N17 (Fig.3 C). These results demonstrate that Rac1 activity is specifically required for HIF-1α transcriptional activity that is induced by hypoxia or chemical agents. Activated GTP-bound Rac1 regulates distinct downstream signaling pathways by interacting with specific effector molecules, including the serine/threonine protein kinase PAK1 (21Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Using recombinant GST-PBD, which contains the Rac1-binding domain of PAK1, we examined whether Rac1 is activated in response to hypoxia. HEK293 cells overexpressing Rac1-WT or Rac1-V12 (GTP-bound) were lysed and used for an affinity precipitation assay (Fig. 4 A). GST-PBD bound and precipitated the activated form of Rac1 in lysates from Rac1-V12-expressing cells (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) and from Rac1-WT-expressing cells incubated with GTPγS (lane 2). GST-PBD did not interact with Rac1-WT loaded with GDP (Fig.4 A, lane 1) or with Rac1-N17 (data not shown). Activated Rac1 was also recovered from Rac1-WT-expressing cells treated with 500 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Fig. 4 A, lane 6) or 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (lane 7). Exposure to 1‥ O2 for 2 h (Fig.4 A, lane 5) or to 15 min of reoxygenation after 2 h of hypoxia (lane 8) also activated Rac1. We next investigated the time course of Rac1 activation under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4 B). Rac1 was activated as early as 30 min after exposure to 1‥ O2 (Fig. 4 B, lane 3), and this activation, although diminished after 2 h, lasted for at least 16 h of continuous hypoxia (lanes 4–8). This time course differed from that of epidermal growth factor- or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced Rac1 activation, which lasted no more than 15 min (data not shown). Exposure of cells to 75 μm CoCl2 also activated Rac1 (Fig.4 C, lane 3). However, exposure to 130 μm DFX did not activate Rac1 (Fig. 4 C,lane 4). To investigate potential components of the hypoxia signal transduction pathway upstream and downstream of Rac1, we first utilized a PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. As shown in Fig.5 (A and B, respectively), treatment with 50 nm wortmannin significantly attenuated HIF-1- and HIF-1α TAD-dependent transcriptional activity in response to hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced reporter gene transcription was also inhibited by p85Δ, a dominant-negative form of the PI3K p85 regulatory subunit (Fig.5 C). 10 μm PD98059, a MEK1 inhibitor, and 25 μm SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, also reduced HIF-1-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 5, Aand B). LY294002, wortmannin, and genistein suppressed hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, neither PD98059 nor SB203580 affected HIF-1α expression (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3 and 4). Rotenone and DPI, which inhibit the mitochondrial ETC at complex I, significantly attenuated the expression of HIF-1α in hypoxic cells (Fig. 6 B), as previously reported (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 13Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5015-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 15Agani F.H. Pichiule P. Chavez J.C. LaManna J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35863-35867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). LY294002 and genistein also inhibited Rac1 activation in response to hypoxia (Fig. 7). DPI and rotenone also markedly inhibited hypoxia-induced Rac1 activation. In contrast, neither PD98059 nor SB203580 attenuated Rac1 activation in response to hypoxia. These results, which are consistent with the analysis of HIF-1α expression and reporter gene transcription above (Figs. 5 and 6), demonstrate that mitochondrial ETC, tyrosine kinase, and PI3K activities are required for the activation of both Rac1 and HIF-1 in response to hypoxia. Because the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 blocked HIF-1-dependent gene transcription and HIF-1α TAD function in a hypoxia-specific manner (Fig. 5), we examined whether p38 MAPK activation in response to hypoxia is regulated by Rac1. Hypoxia induced transactivation mediated by GAL4-ATF2-(1–96), which contains the TAD from the transcription factor ATF2 that is known to be phosphorylated by p38 MAPK (33Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Rac1-N17 blocked hypoxia-induced transactivation, and Rac1-V12 expression stimulated transactivation mediated by GAL4-ATF2-(1–96) under both non-hypoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig.8 A). We next analyzed p38 MAPK activation using a rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr183/Tyr185) polyclonal antibody. Fig.8 B shows that Rac1-N17 completely blocked p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to hypoxia. As the results for the ATF2 TAD indicate, HIF-1 is not the only transcription factor that is activated in response to hypoxia. We therefore explored the possibility that Rac1 regulates the activation of AP-1 in response to hypoxia. Hep3B cells were cotransfected with reporter pAP-1-Luc, containing seven copies of an AP-1-binding site, and expression vector encoding either the dominant-negative (Rac1-N17) or constitutively activated (Rac1-V12) form of Rac1. Cells were exposed to 20 or 1‥ O2 for 8 h and then subjected to luciferase assays. Rac1-N17 significantly suppressed hypoxia-induced reporter gene transcription (Fig.9). Furthermore, Rac1-V12 strongly stimulated AP-1-dependent gene transcription in both non-hypoxic and hypoxic cells. The O2-dependent regulation of HIF-1 activity occurs at multiple levels in vivo (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Among these, the mechanisms regulating HIF-1α protein expression and transcriptional activity have been most extensively analyzed. An important recent advance has been the identification of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) as the HIF-1α-binding component of the ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets HIF-1α for proteasomal degradation in non-hypoxic cells (34Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.-W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Mahler E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4025) Google Scholar, 35Cockman M.E.

Hypoxia may induce changes in the phosphorylation and/or redox status of HIF-1α, pVHL, or another component of the ubiquitination machinery. Remarkably, exposure of cells to hypoxia, CoCl2, or DFX induces both HIF-1α protein stabilization and transcriptional activation (7Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 8Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliff P.J. J. Biol.

For example, inhibitors of mitochondrial ETC complex I block hypoxia-induced (but not CoCl2- or DFX-induced) HIF-1α protein expression (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar,13Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For both protein stabilization and transcriptional activation, hypoxia may induce change(s) in the phosphorylation and/or redox status of HIF-1α or HIF-1α-interacting protein(s). Rac1 has been shown to modulate both phosphorylation and redox status via its binding to protein kinases (20Chou M.M. Blenis J.

Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar), respectively. Our data indicate that Rac1 is required for the induction of HIF-1α protein expression, HIF-1α TAD function, and HIF-1-dependent gene transcription in response to hypoxia. Although the dramatic inhibitory effects of the dominant-negative form of Rac1 (Rac1-N17) under hypoxic conditions indicate that Rac1 is necessary for these events, the modest stimulatory effects of its constitutively activated form (Rac1-V12) under non-hypoxic conditions indicate that Rac1-independent signals are also required for HIF-1 activation. Below we consider, first, the relationship of Rac1 to other putative components of the hypoxia signal transduction pathway and, second, the mechanisms by which Rac1 may regulate HIF-1α expression and activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of mitochondrial ETC (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 13Chandel N.S.

The inhibitory effects of DPI, rotenone, LY294002, wortmannin, and genistein on the activation of Rac1 (Fig. 7) indicate that Rac1 is downstream of these putative components of the hypoxia signal transduction pathway (Fig. 10).

The present data suggest that activation of Rac1 may represent an intermediate step in this process. In contrast, the p38 MAPK activity that is induced by hypoxia is downstream of Rac1 (Fig. 10). HIF-1α protein expression and HIF-1 DNA-binding activity increase exponentially as cellular O2 concentration decreases and rapidly decay upon reoxygenation (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar, 41Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

In contrast, Rac1 has previously been shown to mediate the effects of hypoxia-reoxygenation on the activity of transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB and heat shock factor 1 via generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (43Kim K.S. Takeda K. Sethi R. Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Zhou Y.F., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. J. Clin.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 418-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In a recent study, hypoxia-reoxygenation, but not hypoxia, was shown to induce heat shock factor 1 activation as a result of Rac1-mediated H2O2 generation (45Ozaki M. Deshpande S.S. Angkeow P. Suzuki S. Irani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35377-35383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of Rac1 in hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation represents a novel pathway, and delineation of both the upstream signal for Rac1 activation in response to hypoxia as well as the downstream signal leading to HIF-1 activation will require further studies. As in the case of ETC activity, Rac1 activity is specifically required for hypoxia-induced (but not CoCl2- or DFX-induced) HIF-1α expression. These results are consistent with data indicating that CoCl2 and DFX directly disrupt the interaction of HIF-1α with pVHL (3Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 4Sutter C.H. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4748-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar),i.e. at a step downstream of Rac1. The carboxyl-terminal half of HIF-1α consists of two TADs separated by an inhibitory domain that represses TAD function especially under non-hypoxic conditions (7Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 8Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliff P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). TAD-N function (either in the presence or absence of the inhibitory domain) is induced by hypoxia, an effect that is dependent upon Rac1 activity (Fig. 3). In contrast, TAD-C function is independent of both O2 concentration and Rac1, again demonstrating that Rac1 is specifically required to transduce hypoxic signals to HIF-1α. Hypoxia also induced p38 MAPK activity in a Rac1-dependent manner, and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 attenuated hypoxia-induced TAD function (Fig. 5). Rac1 is known to interact with the MAPK kinase kinase PAK1 (20Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and p38 MAPK has been shown to phosphorylate the HIF-1α inhibitory domain in vitro (46Sodhi A. Montaner S. Patel V. Zohar M. Bais C. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4873-4880PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that in response to hypoxia, activated Rac1 induces p38 MAPK activity, leading to HIF-1α phosphorylation and increased TAD function. Rac1-N17 completely blocked hypoxia-induced transactivation, whereas SB203580 had only a partial inhibitory effect, suggesting that in addition to p38 MAPK activation, there may be other pathways by which Rac1 induces HIF-1α TAD function in response to hypoxia. The p42/p44 ERK MAPKs phosphorylate HIF-1α and stimulate HIF-1 transcriptional activity (46Sodhi A. Montaner S. Patel V. Zohar M. Bais C. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4873-4880PubMed Google Scholar, 47Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothié E. Roux D. Pouysséugur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), but this process in not regulated by O2 concentration. Hypoxia induces the activity of multiple transcription factors in addition to HIF-1. Transcription of an AP-1-dependent reporter gene was induced by hypoxia, and the induction was specifically blocked by Rac1-N17 (Fig. 9), as in the case of the HIF-1-dependent reporter gene (Fig. 1). However, Rac1-V12 markedly induced AP-1-dependent transcription under both hypoxic and non-hypoxic conditions, whereas it had only a minor effect on HIF-1-dependent transcription. These data indicate that Rac1 plays an important role in hypoxia signal transduction in other systems, although the specific mechanisms of transcriptional regulation involved may differ. With these results as a foundation, future studies will be necessary to further delineate the mechanisms and consequences of Rac1 activation in response to hypoxia. We thank Drs. Kozo Kaibuchi, Kaikobad Irani, Amato J. Giaccia, and Eisuke Nishida for providing plasmids and Erik Laughner for excellent technical advice."
https://openalex.org/W2109421983,"Thrombin plays a central role in normal and abnormal hemostatic processes. It is assumed that α-thrombin activates platelets by hydrolyzing the protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1, thereby exposing a new N-terminal sequence, a tethered ligand, which initiates a cascade of molecular reactions leading to thrombus formation. This process involves cross-linking of adjacent platelets mediated by the interaction of activated glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa with distinct amino acid sequences, LGGAKQAGDV and/or RGD, at each end of dimeric fibrinogen molecules. We demonstrate here the existence of a second α-thrombin-induced platelet-activating pathway, dependent on GP Ib, which does not require hydrolysis of a substrate receptor, utilizes polymerizing fibrin instead of fibrinogen, and can be inhibited by the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody LJIb-10 bound to the GP Ib thrombin-binding site or by the cobra venom metalloproteinase, mocarhagin, that hydrolyzes the extracellular portion of GP Ib. This alternative α-thrombin pathway is observed when PAR-1 or GP IIb/IIIa is inhibited. The recognition sites involved in the cross-linking of polymerizing fibrin and surface integrins via the GP Ib pathway are different from those associated with fibrinogen. This pathway is insensitive to RGDS and anti-GP IIb/IIIa antibodies but reactive with a mutant fibrinogen, γ407, with a deletion of the γ-chain sequence, AGDV. The reaction is not due to simple trapping of platelets by the fibrin clot, since ligand binding, signal transduction, and second messenger formation are required. The GP Ib pathway is accompanied by mobilization of internal calcium and the platelet release reaction. This latter aspect is not observed with ristocetin-induced GP Ib-von Willebrand factor agglutination nor with GP Ib-von Willebrand factor-polymerizing fibrin trapping of platelets. Human platelets also respond to γ-thrombin, an autoproteolytic product of α-thrombin, through PAR-4. Co-activation of the GP Ib, PAR-1, and PAR-4 pathways elicit synergistic responses. The presence of the GP Ib pathway may explain why anti-α-thrombin/anti-platelet regimens fail to completely abrogate thrombosis/restenosis in the cardiac patient. Thrombin plays a central role in normal and abnormal hemostatic processes.

Thrombin-induced activation of PAR-1, as for other agonist-activated platelet receptors, results in an outside-in signal transduced process followed by the alteration of the surface integrin, GP IIb/IIIa, by an inside-out signal (6Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). The conformational change of GP IIb/IIIa leads to the Ca2+-dependent binding of the bifunctional fibrinogen molecule (7Bodary S.C. Napier M.A. McLean J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18859-18862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fibrinogen-GP IIb/IIIa binding sites recognize RGDX sequences on the fibrinogen α-chains and an LGGAKQAGDV sequence on the γ-chains (8Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W. Gartner T.K. J. Biol.

Blood. 1987; 70: 475-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are also potent inhibitors of fibrinogen binding to this glycoprotein complex in activated platelets. Early studies of the cellular thrombin receptor indicated that more than one species exist in platelets (11Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 198: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,12Harmon J.T. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15928-15933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many questions related to the identity and mechanism(s) of action of the platelet thrombin receptor(s) were resolved with the cloning and sequencing of PAR-1 (13Vu T-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar). Human platelets appear to respond to PAR-1 and a second minor receptor PAR-4 (14Kahn M.L.

Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) is either absent or present in only trace amounts. Mouse platelets, on the other hand, respond to α-thrombin primarily through PAR-3 and, secondarily, PAR-4, with no involvement of PAR-1 (14Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.-W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zheng D. Moff S. Farese R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Other important issues still remain unresolved with regard to the PARs. Another platelet membrane protein, GP Ib, may also function, in part, as a thrombin receptor (11Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 198: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Harmon J.T. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15928-15933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Clemetson K.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A major role of GP Ib, complexed with GP IX, is the specific interaction with subendothelium-bound von Willebrand factor (vWF) under high shear rates to facilitate platelet adhesion to injured vascular walls (22Ruggeri Z.M. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 229-239PubMed Google Scholar). The expression on the plasma membrane of the vWF receptor, GP Ib, requires the stable expression of GP Ibβ, GP Ibα, and GP IX (23Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynold C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The GP Ib-IX complex associates with the cytoskeletal actin-binding protein via the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα (24Andrews R.K. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18605-18611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This GP Ibα-actin-binding protein association is initiated by the binding of vWF to GP Ib and appears to be linked to vWF-induced transmembrane signaling (25Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Signal transduction appears to be regulated, at least in part, by one form of the 14-3-3 ζ protein (26Du X. Fox J.E.B. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and its association with the GP Ib-IX-V complex (27Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The GP Ib receptor also possesses a thrombin binding site that may respond to lower concentrations of thrombin than required to activate the PARs (11Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 198: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Harmon J.T. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15928-15933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GP Ib-thrombin complex may serve to prime the activation of PAR-1 as the thrombin levels rise (11Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 198: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Clemetson K.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The physiologic roles of the three purported platelet thrombin receptors have yet to be clearly defined. While an in vitro functional role of PAR-1 has been demonstrated for α-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (13Vu T-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar), no comparable response has ever been described for PAR-4 or GP Ib with a natural thrombin agonist. We demonstrate here the existence of two thrombin receptors on human platelets that respond to α-thrombin. One is the PAR-1 receptor, and the second is GP Ib. Unlike the activation of platelets via PAR-1, activation by the GP Ib pathway does not require thrombin hydrolysis of the substrate receptor, utilizes polymerizing fibrin instead of fibrinogen, and is inhibited by the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody LJIb-10 that specifically binds to the GP Ib thrombin-binding site (28Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12579-12585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This alternative pathway is readily observed in the presence of PAR-1 or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Human platelets also respond to γ-thrombin, the autoproteolytic product of α-thrombin, through activation of a second protease-activated receptor, PAR-4. Co-activation of the GP Ib, PAR-1, and PAR-4 pathways elicits synergistic responses. The α-thrombin was initially obtained from Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan NJ), as Fibrindex. Production of Fibrindex was discontinued, and α-thrombin was subsequently obtained from Chronolog Corp. (Havertown, PA). The two products at 0.05–0.1 units/ml gave identical results. The γ-thrombin was obtained from Hematologic Technologies. The thrombin receptor-activating peptide for PAR-1 (TRAP-1), SFLLRNP, was synthesized by TANA Laboratories (Houston, TX), and peptides for PAR-4, GYPGQV (TRAP-4) and AYPGKF (TRAP-4A), were supplied from the Schering-Plough stocks. The anti-PAR-1 drug, SCH203099, was also supplied by Schering-Plough. Human fibrinogen, RGDS, GPRP-amide, and the water-soluble serine protease inhibitor, 4-[2-aminoethyl]-benzene sulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) were purchased from Sigma. The thrombin substrate CBS 34.47 came from Diagnostica Stago-American Bioproducts. Fura-2 AM was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The ristocetin and Chrono-lume (luciferin-luciferase) were obtained from Chronolog Corp. Anti-PAR-1 antibodies were kindly supplied by Drs. Greco and Jamieson (polyclonal antibody that recognizes the sequence LLRNPNDKYEPF) and Dr. Brass (monoclonal antibody ATAP-2). The anti-GP IIb/IIIa antibody c7E3 Fab was a kind gift from Dr. Coller. All other anti-GP Ib and anti-GP IIb/IIIa antibodies employed along with the recombinant fibrinogens were from our laboratories. The cobra metalloproteinase, mocarhagin, from Naja mocambique mocambique was kindly supplied by Dr. Berndt (Baker Medical Research Institute, Victoria, Australia). The concentrations and conditions employed with all reagents are described throughout. Blood was drawn by venipuncture into plastic tubes that contained 110 volume of 3.8‥ citrate and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared as previously described (29Soslau G. Giles J. Thromb. Res. 1982; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Blood samples were obtained from healthy graduate student donors who were medication-free and signed informed consent forms approved by the institutional human studies committee. Washed platelets were prepared from the PRP as previously described (30Basheer A.R. El-Asmar M.F. Soslau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1250: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, PRP was diluted with 3 volumes of 100 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) plus 1–2 volumes of Hepes-Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4, final volume 50 ml; pelleted; and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode buffer (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4,10 mm MgCl2, 3.8 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) with 1 mg/ml dextrose plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 2–3 × 105/μl or at a l0× normal concentration of 2–3 × 106/μl. Platelet aggregations were performed on a dual channel Chronolog lumiaggregometer (Chronolog Corp.) as previously described (31Soslau G. El-Asmar M.F. Parker J. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1988; 15: 909-916Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Aggregations were conducted with 480 μl of washed platelets or a 50-μl sample of the concentrated platelets added to 430 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer with a final platelet count of 2–3 × 105/μl. Agonists and inhibitors were added as detailed throughout with the concentration of the reagents noted. In some experiments, the α-thrombin plus fibrinogen was added to the platelets, while in others the order of addition was reversed. This reversal of order allowed for the generation of polymerizing fibrin prior to the addition of the platelets. The mobilization of internal stores of calcium, [Ca2+] i , was monitored with a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer as previously reported (32Soslau G. McKenzie R.J. Brodsky I. Devlin T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1268: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in the presence of extracellular EGTA to chelate extracellular Ca2+. Platelets, as PRP, were preloaded with 1 μm Fura-2/AM for 45–60 min and then washed and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode buffer as described above, at a 10× concentration. Samples were incubated, at room temperature, with or without 10 μm SCH203099 for 1 h prior to analysis. A 50-μl sample of platelets was added to 430 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer in a special quartz microcuvette with a 4.5-mm path length with stirring at 37 °C. Agonists were added through an injection port at the levels described. Excitation wavelengths were 340 and 380 nm, and emission was measured at 505 nm. Calibration and conversion of raw data were performed exactly as reported (32Soslau G. McKenzie R.J. Brodsky I. Devlin T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1268: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The platelet release reaction was monitored simultaneously, in some experiments, with aggregation as previously reported (33Soslau G. Parker J. Thromb. Res. 1992; 66: 15-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The release of dense granule ATP from aggregating platelets was detected as light emission in the Chronolog lumiaggregometer produced by the reaction of ATP with luciferin catalyzed by luciferase (Chrono-lume). Platelets were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1‥ (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 15 mm NaN3 (Buffer) for 5 min at 1200 × g. Pellets were resuspended and washed once, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of room temperature Buffer. Platelets were incubated with 20 μl of antibody at 20 μg/ml for 40 min at 4 °C, washed once in Buffer, and incubated with 20 μl of secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:40 dilution) for 30 min at 4 °C. Then platelets were washed as above, resuspended in 1 ml of count solution, and analyzed for fluorescence in a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using the Lysis II software program. An acquisition in a live gate containing the platelets and excluding red blood cells and debris was performed. Platelet aggregations were performed as described above and monitored in the aggregometer. A 300-μl sample of Trump's EM fixative (1‥ glutaraldehyde plus 4‥ formaldehyde) was added to the 500-μl aggregated platelet sample and incubated for 5 min. Samples were then pelleted at 4000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, and the pellet was fixed with Trump's EM fixative. Samples were postfixed with OsO4 and embedded in epon, and sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The experiments described here indicate that an α-thrombin-GP Ib interaction may induce a distinct pathway of platelet aggregation and, along with PAR-1 and PAR-4, may be functionally relevant. α-Thrombin (0.05–0.1 units/ml) and the peptide SFLLRNP, the PAR-1 TRAP-1, induced platelet aggregation with similar kinetics (Fig.1, A (a) andB (a)). An equivalent amount of γ-thrombin (10–20 nm, comparable with the activity of 0.05–0.1 units/ml α-thrombin) induced platelet aggregation with distinctly slower kinetics but a similar end point (Fig. 1 C(a)), as did the PAR-4 thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP-4), GYPGQV (Fig. 1 D (a)). Platelets that had been preincubated with an anti-PAR-1 antibody (either a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the sequence LLRNPNDKYEPF or the monoclonal antibody ATAP-2 (34Brass L.F.

Boykow G. Burnett D.A. Caplen M.A. Czarniecki M. Domalski M.S. Foster C. Manna M. Stamford A.W. Wu Y. Bioorganic Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), had a delayed aggregation profile relative to controls when stimulated with α-thrombin but ultimately reached a similar level of aggregation (Fig. 1, A (e) and E (a), respectively). SCH203099 at 5–10 μm did not inhibit platelet activation induced by 1 mm TRAP-4 or 10–30 nm γ-thrombin (Fig. 1, G and H); however, TRAP-1-induced aggregation was completely inhibited but not platelet shape change (Fig. 1 F). Total inhibition of platelet aggregation was maintained for greater than 15 min, at which time monitoring ceased. Platelets treated with SCH203099 (7.5 μm) plus ATAP-2 (50 μg/ml) have the PAR-1 receptor blocked at two levels: at the tethered ligand, blocking hydrolysis by α-thrombin, and at the PAR-1 receptor site for the tethered ligand or synthetic TRAP-1. These platelets still responded to α-thrombin after a delay period (Fig. 1 E (e)), suggesting the presence of another receptor. The complete inhibition of platelet aggregation upon the addition of the Fab fragment of the anti-GP Ib antibody, LJIb-10, (binds to the GP Ib thrombin binding site) to the SCH203099 plus ATAP-2-treated platelets indicates that GP Ib is the second α-thrombin receptor (Fig. 1 E (g)). The potential presence of three distinct thrombin receptors on human platelets could be defined with combinations of inhibitors and PAR-4 desensitization. Platelets preincubated for 1 h with 350–700 μm TRAP-4, under nonstirring conditions, could not be activated by subsequent additions of 10 nm γ-thrombin or TRAP-4 at mm concentrations (Fig. 1, C(b) and D (b)). Identical results were obtained with the more reactive PAR-4-activating peptide, AYPGKF (TRAP-4A) (36Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Control platelets aggregated optimally with 100 μm TRAP-4A. Platelets incubated for 20 min with suboptimal concentrations of TRAP-4A (30 μm) were totally unreactive with 100 μm TRAP-4A or 10 nmγ-thrombin but were fully aggregated upon the addition of 0.1 units/ml α-thrombin (data not shown). Furthermore, control platelets and platelets treated with SCH203099 plus ATAP-2 that were preincubated with TRAP-4 still aggregated upon the addition of α-thrombin (Fig. 1,A (b) and E (f), respectively). This evidence indicates that TRAP-4 and γ-thrombin activate PAR-4, while α-thrombin activates PAR-1 and a third receptor. Further evidence for the presence of a thrombin-GP Ib platelet aggregation pathway comes from studies with the cobra venom metalloproteinase, mocarhagin, which has been shown to hydrolyze the extracellular portion of GP Ib that contains the vWF and thrombin binding domains (37Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Concentrated platelet samples were incubated with 5–20 μg/ml mocarhagin for 60–90 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of SCH203099 and/or Fab LJ Ib-10 (Fab-10). Mocarhagin (20 μg/ml for 90 min) alone did not alter the slope or extent of platelet aggregation induced by the PAR-1 or PAR-4 agonists, TRAP-1 or γ-thrombin, respectively (Fig.2 A). However, in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, mocarhagin significantly inhibited α-thrombin-induced aggregation of platelets simultaneously incubated with the PAR-1 inhibitor, SCH203099. Fig. 2 B is representative of three different experiments where 10 μmSCH203099 plus 20 μg/ml mocarhagin inhibited α-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation ∼100‥ for the first 3 min with the eventual slow aggregation phase occurring at the 3–6-min point after the addition of α-thrombin. The delayed aggregation appears to be due to residual intact GP Ib molecules on the platelet surface as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 2 C). The combined addition of SCH203099 plus Fab-10 and mocarhagin essentially abrogated any delayed aggregation phase in the first 7 min (Fig. 2 B). We reasoned that GP Ib may be the third thrombin receptor that, along with PAR-1, is involved in the α-thrombin-induced activation of platelets. In this regard, we hypothesized that the 1–2-min delay in aggregation observed with platelets treated with anti-PAR-1 antibody or SCH203099 may correspond to the time required for the generation of polymerizing fibrin, which could then participate in platelet aggregation in a manner different from fibrinogen, as previously reported (38 39). This alternative α-thrombin pathway would normally be obscured by the action of the rapidly acting PAR-1 pathway. We further hypothesized that α-thrombin-induced aggregation via the PAR-1 pathway, as depicted in Fig. 1 A, is entirely, or predominantly, dependent upon fibrinogen-platelet interactions. Initial studies with TRAP-1-induced platelet aggregation demonstrated that the PAR-1 pathway was blocked by RGDS but little affected by GPRP-amide (Sigma), an inhibitor of fibrin polymerization (Fig. 1,B (c) and B (d), respectively). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that an alternate thrombin-induced pathway is associated with platelet aggregation mediated by polymerizing fibrin in lieu of native fibrinogen. Washed platelets (50 μl), as a 10× concentrate, were added to 0.05–0.1 units/ml α-thrombin plus fibrinogen preincubated for 2 min (polymerizing fibrin) in 430 μl of buffer. The kinetics of aggregation with thrombin plus polymerizing fibrin (Fig.3 B (a)) was essentially the same as that seen with thrombin plus fibrinogen added simultaneously to platelets (Fig. 3 A (a)). Aggregation in the presence of polymerizing fibrin was little affected by RGDS (Fig. 3 D (a)). In contrast, the rapid onset α-thrombin-induced PAR-1 pathway, seen in Fig. 3 A(a), was inhibited by the fibrinogen-competing peptide RGDS for the first few minutes, a time sufficient for the generation of polymerizing fibrin (Fig. 3 C (a)), after which aggregation ensued via the GP Ib pathway, overriding the RGDS inhibition. The addition of GPRP along with RGDS completely blocked platelet aggregation (Fig. 3, C (b) andD (b)), while the addition of GPRP alone had little effect on α-thrombin-induced aggregation (Fig. 3 A(b)). A recombinant mutant fibrinogen (γ407), lacking the AGDV sequence in the γ-chain required for GP IIb/IIIa-fibrinogen interactions (40Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 41Smith R.A. Mosesson M.W. Rooney M.M. Lord S.T. Daniels A.U. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22080-22085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), still supported α-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation with normal kinetics, as did recombinant wild type fibrinogen (data not shown). Aggregation via the PAR-1 pathway was again initially blocked by the addition of RGDS when γ407 replaced normal fibrinogen, until γ407 presumably began to polymerize (Fig. 3, compare E (a) and C (a)). Residual adhering/endogenous fibrinogen cannot account for the observed aggregation, since none occurred in the presence of RGDS without added fibrinogen (Fig. 3 E (c)). Aggregation occurred with polymerizing γ407 via the GP Ib pathway even in the presence of RGDS (Fig. 3 F) although at a reduced level. RGDS completely blocked aggregation induced by U46619 and ADP, two agonists that cannot generate polymerizing fibrin (Fig. 3, Gand H, without (a) versus with (b) RGDS) like α-thrombin. When the thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, was added to platelets (1–2 units/ml) followed by the addition of thrombin plus fibrinogen, aggregation was completely inhibited (Fig. 5 I). If this inhibitor was added 2 min after fibrinogen was preincubated with thrombin and then platelets were added 30 s later, hirudin continued to prevent aggregation completely (Fig. 3 B (d)), indicating that polymerizing fibrin alone could not account for the observed aggregations as platelet “trapping.” Electron micrographic analysis was conducted with control platelets aggregated by α-thrombin (Fig.4 A) and with 10 μm SCH203099-treated platelets added to polymerizing fibrin (fibrinogen plus α-thrombin preincubated for 2 min) (Fig.4 B) as described in experiments above. The platelet aggregates of both samples are indistinguishable and indicate true platelet aggregation of the SCH203099-treated platelets in the presence of polymerizing fibrin as opposed to platelet trapping.Figure 4Electron microscopic analysis of aggregated control and SCH203099-treated platelets.

https://openalex.org/W2048715361,"The intracellular signaling pathways responsible for cell cycle arrest and differentiation along the crypt-villus axis of the human small intestine remain largely unknown. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have recently emerged as key modulators of various vertebrate cell differentiation processes. In order to elucidate further the mechanism(s) responsible for the loss of proliferative potential once committed intestinal cells begin to differentiate, the role and regulation of p38 MAPK with regard to differentiation were analyzed in both intact epithelium as well as in well established intestinal cell models recapitulating the crypt-villus axis <i>in vitro</i>. Results show that phosphorylated and active forms of p38 were detected primarily in the nuclei of differentiated villus cells. Inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling by 2–20 μm SB203580 did not affect E2F-dependent transcriptional activity in subconfluent Caco-2/15 or HIEC cells. p38 MAPK activity dramatically increased as soon as Caco-2/15 cells reached confluence, whereas addition of SB203580 during differentiation of Caco-2/15 cells strongly attenuated sucrase-isomaltase gene and protein expression as well as protein expression of villin and alkaline phosphatase. The binding of CDX2 to the sucrase-isomaltase promoter and its transcriptional activity were significantly reduced by SB203580. Pull-down glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a direct interaction of CDX3 with p38. Finally, p38-dependent phosphorylation of CDX3 was observed in differentiating Caco-2/15 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that p38 MAPK may be involved in the regulation of CDX2/3 function and intestinal cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2041480518,"The molecules of a nematic liquid crystal exposed to an isotropic surface adopt a mean tilt relative to the normal but have no in-plane alignment-that is, they are free to have any azimuthal orientation in the surface plane. Pursuing the theoretical suggestion by Meyer that, in spite of this azimuthal degeneracy, spatially inhomogeneous isotropic surfaces combine with liquid crystal elastic anisotropy to produce alignment, we show that a boundary line between two isotropic regions that differ in mean tilt does indeed align the liquid crystal. The boundaries on a patterned surface of distinct isotropic regions thus act as a system of lines that the molecular orientation locally follows. This enables the development of liquid crystal alignment surfaces based on printing or lithographic patterning."

Members can be classified into three groups: those containing one carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD),1 those containing two homologous CRDs in tandem separated by a short linker, and the chimeric type, which has a proline/glycine-rich repetitive sequence connected to a CRD (1Barondes S.H.

Members of this evolutionarily highly conserved family are found in all vertebrates as well as lower organisms, including nematodes, sponges, and mushrooms (2Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In mammals, 11 members have been designated as galectins (galectin-1 through -11); a large number of additional members are likely to be discovered, and many identifiable homologues are present in the published data base (6Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Proteins containing sequence similarities with galectins but without demonstrable lectin activity also exist. For example, a novel protein structurally related to galectins, but lacking β-galactoside binding activity, has been identified in the lens and designated as GRIFIN (galectin-related interfiber protein) (7Ogden A.T.

Diverse biological functions have been demonstrated for various galectins in vitro, including extracellular functions that are consistent with the lectin properties. For example, galectin-1 and -3 have been shown to activate various cell types, through cross-linkage of appropriate cell surface glycoproteins, and to modulate cell adhesion, probably through interactions with cell surface glycoproteins, including cell adhesion molecules (reviewed in Refs. 3Perillo N.L.

Galectin-3 has been shown to promote neurite growth (8Pesheva P. Kuklinski S. Schmitz B. Probstmeier R. J. Neurosci.

Consistent with the absence of a classical signal sequence, many galectins are found to primarily reside intracellularly. Moreover, the presence of some, such as galectin-1 and -3, in the nuclei of proliferating cells has been reported (15Vyakarnam A. Lenneman A.J. Lakkides K.M. Patterson R.J. Wang J.L. Exp.

Galectin-7, on the other hand, has been demonstrated to promote apoptosis in transfected cells (22Bernerd F. Sarasin A. Magnaldo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Relevant to the intracellular functions is the fact that galectins have been shown to recognize intracellular proteins, including Bcl-2 (19Yang R.-Y. Hsu D.K. Liu F.-T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another notable feature of galectins is their association with neoplastic transformation. Galectin-3 is overexpressed in some types of cancers, in which the normal parental cells do not express the protein, including specific types of lymphomas (26Hsu D.K. Hammes S.R. Kuwabara I.

Whether the altered expression of galectins contributes to the neoplastic transformation or is a consequence of the transformation awaits elucidation. Studies of cells transfected with galectin-3 cDNA or treated with specific antisense oligonucleotides, however, have provided evidence for the involvement of galectin-3 in tumor development and metastasis (40Raz A.

Galectins may play a major role in the biological behaviors of cancer cells in which the lectins are either up-regulated or down-regulated because of the various functions of galectins mentioned above. Cell cycle control is a major theme of normal development and differentiation. Most cancers arise due to faulty cell cycle regulation (42Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar). Under genotoxic assaults, cell cycle arrest prevents transmission of damaged genomic DNA that could otherwise cause widespread mutations of vital genes controlling cell growth in daughter cells, a major cause of cancer (43Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). In conditions not permissive for productive proliferation, e.g. growth factor deficiency, cells invoke G1 arrest to stay alive until conditions improve. Premature entry into the cell cycle leads to apoptosis (44Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar, 45Gibson A.W. Cheng T. Johnston R.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cell differentiation is also usually associated with irreversible cell cycle exit (46Lipinski M.M. Jacks T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7873-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Identification of new cell cycle regulation proteins is therefore important for the understanding of normal cellular homeostasis and pathogenesis of neoplasms as well as the development of new methods for diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA for such a protein from human T-cells in G1 phase, identify that this protein is a member of the galectin family, and demonstrate that its ectopic expression arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase. All cell lines used were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human T leukemic lines and U937 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mm glutamine. HeLa cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% FBS and 2 mm glutamine. Other cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mmglutamine. The human tumor cell lines used to evaluate galectin-12 expression were cultured under logarithmic growth conditions and are as follows: B leukemic lines Daudi, Raji, and Wil-2; T leukemic lines CEM, HuT-78, MOLT-3, and MT-2; promonocytic line U937; basophilic line KU-812; myelomonocytic line HL-60; ovarian line SKOV3; pancreatic line CAPAN-2; prostate line PC-3; hepatic line HepG2; colon line HT-29; breast cell lines 435, T47D, HBL-100, and MCF-7. Human blood was obtained from three unrelated healthy volunteers following informed consent and pooled. Mononuclear cells were prepared by isopycnic centrifugation on Histopaque 1077 (Sigma). Polymorphonuclear cells were prepared by dextran sedimentation and isolated from the high density cell pellet that also contained erythrocytes, followed by removal of erythrocytes by osmotic shock. Randomly selected EST clones from a G1 phase Jurkat T-cell V cDNA library (47Adams M. et al.Nature. 1995; 377 Suppl. 6547: 3-174Google Scholar) were sequenced, and the sequences were compared with those in the public data base. A partial clone HJACE54 (GenBankTM accession number AA311108) was found to have sequence similarity to galectins. Based on the sequence of this clone, cloning of the full-length cDNA was attempted by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) from a human retina Marathon cDNA library using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with a touchdown PCR protocol recommended by the manufacturer. An oligonucleotide GSP (CCTGGAACCATCCTCAGGAGTGGACACAGTAGAGCTGG), which corresponds to a sequence in the HJACE54 cDNA encompassing the translation stop codon (antisense to nucleotides 942–979 in Fig. 1), was used as the downstream primer. The purified RACE product was subjected to another round of PCR using the same primers in the presence of Pfupolymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate blunt-ended DNA. The DNA products from the second PCR were digested with NotI and cloned into NotI/SmaI-digested pBlueScript SK vector. Transformants were screened by PCR using T3 and GGCTCATCAGCAGGAAAGG as primers, the latter corresponding to nucleotides 41–59 in the HJACE54 cDNA (antisense to nucleotides 553–571 in Fig. 1). Positive clones were sequenced with the ABI PRISM Rhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready kit (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer per the manufacturer's protocols. Three positive clones were found to contain the same insert, whose 3′ regions were identical to the HJACE54 cDNA. In the EST data base dbEST, a putative mouse homolog of the above described cDNA was found. Sequencing the entire EST clone, however, revealed that it contained additional 5′ sequence not present in the human clones. In GenBankTM, a cosmid clone (cSR187d6; GenBankTM Accession Number U73641) from human chromosome 11 was found to contain the genomic DNA for the cloned cDNA. In this cosmid DNA, a segment homologous to the leading sequence found in the mouse homolog was identified. The full-length cDNA was then obtained by PCR of human retina Marathon cDNA with an Advantage 2 PCR kit (CLONTECH), using the upstream primer (AGTTGGAGTTGCCCCAC), specified from the upstream cosmid sequence, and the downstream primer GSP. The PCR product was cloned into pCR-Script with the pCR-Script Amp Cloning kit (Stratagene) to generate pCR-Gal12 and sequenced as described above. PCR on Multiple Tissue cDNA panels (CLONTECH) was carried out per the manufacturer's protocol using the following primers: for galectin-12, CCAGCTCTACTGTGTCCACTCCTGAGGATGGTTCCAGG (nucleotides 942–979 in Fig. 1) and TAGTCTACAACACTTGCCTCTGTGAGTGCAGTCCAGGC (antisense to nucleotides 1211–1248 in Fig. 1); for galectin-3, CTTATAACCTGCCTTTGCC and CAGATTATATCATGG; and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT and CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC. PCR was performed using the Advantaq Plus PCR kit from CLONTECH. Cycling conditions were as follows: for galectin-12, 94 °C for 30 s and then 38 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1 min; for galectin-3, 94 °C for 30 s and then 30 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 94 °C for 30 s and then 22 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min. The PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels. For RT-PCR of mRNA from cell lines, total RNA was isolated from cell lines by a one-step method using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), and mRNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μl of the RT reaction was amplified by PCR usingTaq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) together with upstream (AGGTGCCCTGCTCACATGCTC; nucleotides 581–601 in Fig. 1) and downstream (CCATCCTTCAGGAGTGGACACAG; antisense to nucleotides 951–972 in Fig. 1) primers for galectin-12 and upstream (TCCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACT) and down stream (GAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT) primers for β-actin. Products were visualized on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Synchronization of Jurkat cells was performed by treatment of the cells (in logarithmic growth) overnight with 0.1 mm thymidine or 1 mmhydroxyurea to obtain cells at the G1/S boundary (48Tobey R.A. Crissman H.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 75: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with 0.1 μg/ml nocodazole to block cells at mitosis, or with 0.2 mm theophylline plus 0.5 mm dibutyryl-cAMP to obtain cells at G1 (49Coffino P. Gray J.W. Tomkins G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 878-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted, and reverse transcription was done as described above. PCR on the reverse transcribed products was performed using the same primers for galectin-12 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as described above. A peptide corresponding to residues 162–175 in the linker region of galectin-12 (Fig. 1) was synthesized, and antibody was produced in rabbits by standard procedures (50Cooper H.M. Paterson Y. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1995: 2.4.1-2.4.9Google Scholar). The specific antibody was affinity-purified with an adsorbent made by conjugating the peptide through the sulfhydryl group to sulfolink gel using the kit provided by the manufacturer (Pierce). The immunoblot analysis of galectin-12 was performed by using this antibody at 0.2 μg/ml. The immunoblot analysis for detecting HA-tagged proteins was performed by using the mouse monoclonal antibody C12A5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 0.2 μg/ml. All blots were developed with the SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate Kit from Pierce. This was performed as described (51Yang R.Y. Hill P.N. Hsu D.K. Liu F.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4086-4092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insert from pCR-Gal12 (see “Cloning of cDNAs for Full-length Galectin-12”) was directly cloned into pEF (51Yang R.Y. Hill P.N. Hsu D.K. Liu F.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4086-4092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pEF1-Gal12. pCMV was generated by deleting the internal ribosome entry site andneo gene from pIRES1neo (CLONTECH). cDNA for HA-tagged galectin-9 was generated by PCR using ACCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTATGGCCTTCAGCGG and AGCCGCCTATGTCTGCACATGGG as primers and the plasmid DNA from clone HTPBR22 as template. cDNA for HA-tagged galectin-12 was generated by PCR using ACCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTATGTCACCTGGAG and GSP as primers and pCR-Gal12 as template. PCR products were cloned into pCR-Script and sequenced to generate pCR-HA9 and pCR-HA12, inserts from which were finally cloned into pCMV to generate pCMV-HA9 and pCMV-HA12, respectively. pCMV-puro was made by replacing theBamHI–XhoI fragment in pIRES1neo with theBamHI–SalI fragment from pWE3 (ATCC). Cells from subconfluent cultures in the log growth phase were transfected by electroporation following published protocols with some modifications (52Baum C. Forster P. Hegewisch-Becker S. Harbers K. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 1058-1062PubMed Google Scholar, 53Agami R. Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). HeLa cells at 70–80% confluency were split 1:3 the day before transfection. On the day of transfection, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in culture medium (McCoy's 5A medium with 10% FBS and glutamine). Aliquots of 0.4 ml of cell suspension containing 0.75–1 × 106 cells were transferred to 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes. Plasmid DNA (a total of 30 μg) was added and electroporation was carried out on a Gene Pulser-II electroporator (Bio-Rad) at 250 V, 1070 microfarads. Cells were then resuspended in 5 ml of complete tissue culture media and cultured for 24 h. Cells were subsequently cultured in the presence or absence of 0.1 μg/ml nocodazole for an additional 24 h before harvest. For cell cycle analysis, trypsinized cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. Nuclear DNA was then stained for 20 min at 37 °C with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Calbiochem) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml RNase A. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for propidium iodide width versus area fluorescence, which allowed the exclusion of doublets and weakly fluorescent cell debris. The above gated cells were acquired into a red fluorescence area histogram on a FACS Calibur (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and analyzed with the CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson). HeLa cells (0.75 × 106) were transfected with a mixture of 6 μg of pCMV-puro and 24 μg of test constructs by electroporation and cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. Puromycin was added 24 h afterwards to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and the cells were cultured for an additional 5 days. For quantitative determination of viable cells, the transfected cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 2 ml of medium. The MTS assay was performed using the Cell Titer 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 490 nm was read on a SpectraMAX 250 ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) with SOFTmaxPRO software (Molecular Devices). One of the EST clones from a human T-cell line, Jurkat, at the G1 phase was found to have sequence homology with galectins. This clone, HJACE54, has an insert of 865 bp containing an open reading frame of 402 bp (134 amino acids). A search of an EST data base with this sequence revealed that the gene is also expressed in human retina. We then attempted to clone the full-length cDNA from a human retina cDNA library by 5′-RACE, and a clone with an open reading frame coding for 275 amino acids was obtained. A BLAST search showed that the deduced protein is homologous to the galectin family members with two CRDs separated by a linker sequence. The N-terminal domain of this protein, however, appeared to be incomplete, because it lacks the sequence to form the S1 β-strand that is present in all other known galectins. Sequence comparisons between our cDNA and homologous genomic DNA in a cosmid clone and with a mouse cDNA homolog, both identified in the nonredundant GenBankTM data base, revealed the complete 5′ sequence of the human cDNA. This complete sequence, however, did not contain the 5′ sequence of the RACE product obtained from the retina cDNA library. The full-length cDNA was then cloned by PCR using a primer designed on the basis of this extra sequence information. The complete nucleotide sequence and deduced protein sequence of the novel gene product, designated as galectin-12, are presented in Fig. 1. Like all other known galectins, the sequence of galectin-12 does not contain a transmembrane domain or a classical signal sequence. RT-PCR with mRNA from cell lines, using a primer corresponding to a sequence at the 5′-end of the cDNA generated by 5′-RACE, failed to yield any detectable product. In the same experiments, RT-PCR using primers specific for full-length galectin-12 resulted in predicted products (data not shown), and this is the method used for full-length cloning. The cDNA from 5′-RACE thus probably represents an alternatively spliced gene product with a retained intron, and the expression of the corresponding mRNA in cell lines may be insignificant compared with the authentic full-length mRNA. The first ATG in the open reading frame of galectin-12 cDNA is not in a favorable context for translation initiation, according to the Kozak rule (54Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). Significantly, the 3′-untranslated region contains five AT-rich motifs (ATTTA) (Fig. 1), which are initially identified in inflammatory cytokine cDNAs (55Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar) and are also detectable in many other cDNAs coding for proteins of growth regulatory functions, such as oncoproteins and growth factors (56Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). These motifs are known to confer instability to mRNA (56Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 57Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Alignment of the full-length galectin-12 cDNA sequence with the genomic DNA sequence revealed that the galectin-12 gene consists of nine exons (Fig.2 A). Comparison of the coding exon sequences of the galectin-12 gene with those of other known galectin genes revealed conservation in exon organization (Fig.2 B). This comparison allowed us to classify exons for the galectin CRD into two groups. The lengths of the three exons coding for the N-terminal CRD"

Here we report that binding of CD24 to L1 depends on α2,3-sialic acid on CD24, which determines the CD24 induced and cell type-specific promotion or inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Using knockout mutants, we could show that the CD24-induced effects on neurite outgrowth are mediated via L1, and not GPI-linked CD24, by trans-interaction of L1 with sialylated CD24. This glycoform is excluded together with L1 from raft microdomains, suggesting that molecular compartmentation in the surface membrane could play a role in signal transduction.

Axonal guidance depends on molecules at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. The different and often changing combinations of molecularly associated recognition molecules at the cell surface are important determinants of the ways by which the cell surface communicates with the cell interior, where cell surface signals are integrated to influence cell behavior.Two recognition molecules, L1 of the immunoglobulin superfamily and CD24, a highly glycosylated mucin type glycoprotein, interact with each other functionally (1Kadmon G. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Horstkorte R. Eckert M. Altevogt P. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Sammar M. Aigner S. Altevogt P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). L1 is a 200-kDa homophilic and heterophilic adhesion molecule expressed by many postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system (for reviews, see Refs. 3Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and 4Kamiguchi H. Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 12: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is one of the most potent promoters of neurite outgrowth in vitro known so far. Mutants of L1 in mice and men strongly underscore its importance during embryonic development in vivo (3Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Dahme M. Bartsch U. Martini R. Anliker B. Schachner M. Mantei N. Nat.

Biol. 1998; 8: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).CD24 is linked to the surface membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor and is, therefore, unable to directly interact with cytoplasmic proteins. It is also known as heat-stable antigen or nectadrin with a peptide core of only 30 amino acids (for references, see Ref. 1Kadmon G. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Horstkorte R. Eckert M. Altevogt P. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similar to L1, it is highly expressed by neurons (7Nédelec J. Pierres M. Moreau H. Barbet J. Naquet P. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Rougon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Shewan D. Calaora V. Nielsen P. Cohen J. Rougon G. Moreau H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2624-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of CD24 varies considerably among cell types and also within each cell type, depending on its developmental stage due to differences in glycosylation pattern (for references, see Refs. 1Kadmon G. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Horstkorte R. Eckert M. Altevogt P. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and 7Nédelec J. Pierres M. Moreau H. Barbet J. Naquet P. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Rougon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that post-translational modifications of CD24 play an important functional role. CD24 acts as a co-stimulator for various physiological functions. In the nervous system, CD24 has been reported to interact with L1 to stimulate cell adhesion and to increase intracellular Ca2+levels (1Kadmon G. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Horstkorte R. Eckert M. Altevogt P. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Sammar M. Aigner S. Altevogt P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD24 has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth of neonatal retinal ganglion cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture (8Shewan D. Calaora V. Nielsen P. Cohen J. Rougon G. Moreau H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2624-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by yet unknown signal transduction mechanisms.Based on these observations on the functional interplay and molecular association between L1 and CD24, we decided to further study their functional interdependence. Here we report that L1 is a sialic acid-binding lectin for CD24 and that CD24 inhibits neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons and promotes neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons via interaction in trans-position with L1 at the cell surface of the neurite outgrowth-competent cell. Our experiments appear to underscore four important observations in neural cell interactions: 1) the pivotal function of glycans as mediators of interactions between neural recognition molecules in trans-association, 2) the characterization of L1 as a sialic acid-binding lectin and identification of the siglec domain (9Crocker P.R. Clark E.A. Filbin M. Gordon S. Jones Y. Kehrl J.H. Kelm S. Le Douarin N. Powell L. Roder J. Schnaar R.L. Sgroi D.C. Stamenkovic K. Schauer R. Schachner M. van den Berg T.K. van der Merwe P.A. Watt S.M. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 211-212Google Scholar) in the first fibronectin type III homologous repeat of the L1 family, 3) the implication of L1 as a signal-transducing cell surface receptor for CD24-induced cell type-specific effects on neurite outgrowth, and 4) the importance of the intracellular signal transduction machinery of a particular neuronal cell type that determines whether neurite outgrowth enhancement or inhibition result from cell surface interactions.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we present evidence that the interaction between L1 and CD24- and CD24-induced neurite outgrowth depends on the presence of α2,3-linked sialic acid residues on CD24. Lectin blot analysis of CD24 affinity-purified from mouse brain indicates that the three major CD24 glycoforms differ in their glycans; the 30- and 33-kDa glycoforms, but not the 27-kDa glycoform, carry glycans substituted with terminal α2,3-linked sialic acid residues, which are crucial for binding of CD24 to L1. These observations and the fact that the 30- and 33-kDa glycoforms co-distribute with L1 in a detergent-soluble compartment, whereas the 27-kDa glycoform is found in the L1-depleted lipid raft microdomain fraction (for a review, see Ref. 15Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar) indicate that L1 specifically recognizes α2,3-linked sialic acid on CD24 and therefore functions as a sialic acid-binding lectin.Consensus sequences in sialic acid binding recognition molecules of the immune and nervous systems have been recognized in the siglecs, previously called the sialoadhesin family: sialoadhesin, CD33, the myelin-associated glycoprotein MAG, Schwann cell myelin protein, and CD22 (for a review, see Ref. 16Kelm S. Schauer R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 175: 137-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and for a new nomenclature, see Ref.9Crocker P.R. Clark E.A. Filbin M. Gordon S. Jones Y. Kehrl J.H. Kelm S. Le Douarin N. Powell L. Roder J. Schnaar R.L. Sgroi D.C. Stamenkovic K. Schauer R. Schachner M. van den Berg T.K. van der Merwe P.A. Watt S.M. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 211-212Google Scholar). These consensus sequences contain a crucial arginine residue in the F-strand of the immunoglobulin fold that is flanked by hydrophobic amino acids (see Ref. 17Vinson M. van der Merwe P.A. Kelm S. May A. Jones E.Y. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9267-9272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and references therein). Sialoadhesion, CD33, and MAG, which prefer NeuAcα(2,3)-Gal contain the characteristic YXFR motif, while CD22, which only binds to NeuAcα(2,6)-Gal, contains LXFR. The importance of a conserved arginine in the binding of sialic acid has been reported for several lectins, such as galectin-3 (18Henrick K. Bawumia S. Barboni E.A.M. Mehul B. Hughes R.C. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the siglecs (17Vinson M. van der Merwe P.A. Kelm S. May A. Jones E.Y. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9267-9272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), since the guanidinium group of the arginine forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of sialic acid. The sequence found in NeuAcα(2,3)-Gal preferring siglecs is present in the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of L1. This short sequence motif (YXFR) is present in all members of the L1 superfamily, including F3/F11/contactin, TAG-1/TAX-1/axonin, BIG-1/PANG, NB-2/NB-3, the close homologue of L1 (CHL1), Ng-CAM, Nr-CAM, neurofascin, and neuroglian (see Ref. 19Holm J. Hillenbrand R. Steuber V. Bartsch U. Moos M. Luebbert H. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1613-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and references therein). The L1 family appears to be distinct from the original siglec family of adhesion molecules by the feature that the FNIII but not the immunoglobulin-like domains contain the consensus sequences for sialic acid binding. Three-dimensional structure analysis of a neuroglian fragment comprising the first and second FNIII domain indicate that the YXFR sequence is part of a β-sheet (Fig.6 A) (20Huber A.H. Wang Y.E. Bieber A.J. Bjorkman P.J.

All of these molecules play crucial roles in neurogenesis and axonal path-finding.

The combined observations indicate the importance of this putative sialic acid binding motif for nervous system development.The binding of α2,3-linked sialic acid residues on CD24 to L1 is likely to play a functional role in neurite outgrowth. CD24 but not asialo-CD24 inhibits neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons and promotes neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons. Sialic acid residues on L1 are not required for binding to CD24 and promotion of neurite outgrowth, since desialylation of L1 did not interfere with neurite outgrowth3 and since procaryotically expressed L1 fragments also promote neurite outgrowth, although less efficiently on a molar basis than L1 isolated from eucaryotic systems (see Ref. 32Haspel J. Friedlaner D.R. Ivgy-May N. Chickramanes S. Roonprapunt C. Chen S. Schachner M. Grumet M. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 42: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and references therein). It is interesting that the mixture of L1 and CD24 substrate-coated proteins together reduces the levels of neurite outgrowth from an L1-mediated strong enhancement of neurite outgrowth of both dorsal root ganglion and cerebellar neurons to the level of substrate-coated CD24 alone. It is thus possible that CD24 competes with L1 in trans-interaction with L1 on neuronal membranes. It is also conceivable that binding of CD24 to L1 leads to a conformational change or to a steric hindrance of homophilic binding of L1 to the six immunoglobulin-like domains of L1 that comprise the decisive domains for cell binding and neurite outgrowth (32Haspel J.

A striking dependence of glycans in trans-interactions has recently been reported for notch, which interacts with its ligands delta and jagged/serrate. These interactions are modulated through the glycosyltransferase fringe. It has been proposed that a cell type-specific modification of glycosylation may provide a general mechanism to regulate ligand-receptor interactions in the nervous system (for discussion, see Ref. 35Fortini M.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 357-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The effects on neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion or cerebellar neurons by substrate-coated CD24 are neutralized by antibodies to L1 and are not observed when neurons are taken from L1 knockout mice, whereas neurons from CD24 knockout mice are not different in neurite outgrowth from wild type mice. These complementary findings show that substrate-coated CD24 generates its neurite outgrowth-inhibitory and -promoting effects via a trans-interaction with L1 at the neuronal cell surface and exclude the possibility that a homophilic interaction of CD24 mediates the effects on neurite outgrowth. Our biochemical analysis indicates that the α2,3-sialic acid-containing 30- and 33-kDa glycoforms are involved in this trans-interaction with L1, which was not only seen in the developing, 7-day-old brain but also in adult animals. 4R. Kleene, H. Yang, M. Kutsche, and M. Schachner, unpublished data. These glycoforms can be removed from L1-containing membranes by alkaline treatment and co-distribute with L1 in a detergent-soluble membrane subfraction, and they are co-immunoprecipitated with L1 antibodies. Interestingly, the α2,3-sialic acid-depleted 27-kDa glycoform cannot be removed from membranes by treatment with alkaline buffer, and since it does not co-distribute with L1 in lipid raft microdomains, it is unlikely to interact in cis- or trans-positions with L1 (Fig.7).Figure 7Hypothetical model proposed for L1 and CD24 interactions. The trans-interaction between the 30- and 33-kDa glycoforms of CD24 and L1 depends on α2,3-linked sialic acid (NeuAc) residues. These glycoforms could be located either on neurons or glia. L1 and the 27-kDa glycoform of CD24 are present in different membrane domains. L1 is predominantly in a detergent-soluble membrane domain, while the 27-kDa glycoform of CD24 is within L1-depleted detergent-insoluble microdomains (raft).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The observation that CD24 is highly expressed in the spinal cord where corticospinal axons decussate (6Cohen N.R. Taylor J.S. Scott L.B. Guillery R.W. Soriano P. Furley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) suggests that repellent interactions between L1 and CD24 may play a role in axon guidance as has recently been shown for the functional connection between the repellent extracellular matrix glycoprotein semaphorin 3A and L1, which associates with the semaphorin 3A receptor neuropilin-1 (36Castellani V. Chédotal A. Schachner M. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Rougon G. Neuron. 2000; 27: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). A striking reversion of the repellent activity of semaphorin 3A on L1-expressing neurons was observed when L1 was offered as a trans-acting partner together with semaphorin 3A. These observations and the ones in the present study support the view that the decision whether inhibition or enhancement of neurite outgrowth occurs could depend on several possibilities; the signal transduction machinery is different between different cell types and depends on the different cis-interacting partners in the different cell types, resulting in a different mixture of regulatory interdependences in the recruitment of signal cascades. Such cis-interacting partners could be cytokine or neurotrophin receptors (e.g. fibroblast growth factor receptor (37Doherty P. Walsh F.S Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 4: 157-168PubMed Google Scholar) or neurotrophin tyrosine receptor kinases (12Tannahill L. Klein R. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). The presence and specific triggering of these receptors by their ligands could not only activate the tyrosine receptor kinases but also could lead to different basal activity levels of cis-interacting partner molecules, such as L1, in conjunction with trans-interacting partner molecules, such as CD24. The dissection of the network of glycan-dependent cis- and trans-interacting partners in terms of their signal transduction machineries remains an exciting topic for future investigations. Path-finding of growth cones and neurite outgrowth toward targets are important events in the developing and regenerating nervous system and in synaptic remodeling during learning and memory. Axonal guidance depends on molecules at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. The different and often changing combinations of molecularly associated recognition molecules at the cell surface are important determinants of the ways by which the cell surface communicates with the cell interior, where cell surface signals are integrated to influence cell behavior. Two recognition molecules, L1 of the immunoglobulin superfamily and CD24, a highly glycosylated mucin type glycoprotein, interact with each other functionally (1Kadmon G. von Bohlen und Halbach F.

Acta. 1997; 1337: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). L1 is a 200-kDa homophilic and heterophilic adhesion molecule expressed by many postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system (for reviews, see Refs. 3Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and 4Kamiguchi H. Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 12: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is one of the most potent promoters of neurite outgrowth in vitro known so far. Mutants of L1 in mice and men strongly underscore its importance during embryonic development in vivo (3Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Dahme M. Bartsch U. Martini R. Anliker B. Schachner M. Mantei N. Nat.

CD24 is linked to the surface membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor and is, therefore, unable to directly interact with cytoplasmic proteins. It is also known as heat-stable antigen or nectadrin with a peptide core of only 30 amino acids (for references, see Ref. 1Kadmon G. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Horstkorte R. Eckert M. Altevogt P. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similar to L1, it is highly expressed by neurons (7Nédelec J. Pierres M. Moreau H. Barbet J. Naquet P. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Rougon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Shewan D. Calaora V. Nielsen P. Cohen J. Rougon G. Moreau H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2624-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of CD24 varies considerably among cell types and also within each cell type, depending on its developmental stage due to differences in glycosylation pattern (for references, see Refs. 1Kadmon G. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Horstkorte R. Eckert M. Altevogt P. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and 7Nédelec J. Pierres M. Moreau H. Barbet J. Naquet P. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Rougon G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that post-translational modifications of CD24 play an important functional role. CD24 acts as a co-stimulator for various physiological functions. In the nervous system, CD24 has been reported to interact with L1 to stimulate cell adhesion and to increase intracellular Ca2+levels (1Kadmon G. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Horstkorte R. Eckert M. Altevogt P. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Sammar M. Aigner S. Altevogt P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD24 has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth of neonatal retinal ganglion cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture (8Shewan D. Calaora V. Nielsen P. Cohen J. Rougon G. Moreau H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2624-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by yet unknown signal transduction mechanisms. Based on these observations on the functional interplay and molecular association between L1 and CD24, we decided to further study their functional interdependence. Here we report that L1 is a sialic acid-binding lectin for CD24 and that CD24 inhibits neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons and promotes neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons via interaction in trans-position with L1 at the cell surface of the neurite outgrowth-competent cell. Our experiments appear to underscore four important observations in neural cell interactions: 1) the pivotal function of glycans as mediators of interactions between neural recognition molecules in trans-association, 2) the characterization of L1 as a sialic acid-binding lectin and identification of the siglec domain (9Crocker P.R.

Watt S.M. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 211-212Google Scholar) in the first fibronectin type III homologous repeat of the L1 family, 3) the implication of L1 as a signal-transducing cell surface receptor for CD24-induced cell type-specific effects on neurite outgrowth, and 4) the importance of the intracellular signal transduction machinery of a particular neuronal cell type that determines whether neurite outgrowth enhancement or inhibition result from cell surface interactions. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we present evidence that the interaction between L1 and CD24- and CD24-induced neurite outgrowth depends on the presence of α2,3-linked sialic acid residues on CD24. Lectin blot analysis of CD24 affinity-purified from mouse brain indicates that the three major CD24 glycoforms differ in their glycans; the 30- and 33-kDa glycoforms, but not the 27-kDa glycoform, carry glycans substituted with terminal α2,3-linked sialic acid residues, which are crucial for binding of CD24 to L1. These observations and the fact that the 30- and 33-kDa glycoforms co-distribute with L1 in a detergent-soluble compartment, whereas the 27-kDa glycoform is found in the L1-depleted lipid raft microdomain fraction (for a review, see Ref. 15Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar) indicate that L1 specifically recognizes α2,3-linked sialic acid on CD24 and therefore functions as a sialic acid-binding lectin.Consensus sequences in sialic acid binding recognition molecules of the immune and nervous systems have been recognized in the siglecs, previously called the sialoadhesin family: sialoadhesin, CD33, the myelin-associated glycoprotein MAG, Schwann cell myelin protein, and CD22 (for a review, see Ref. 16Kelm S.

These consensus sequences contain a crucial arginine residue in the F-strand of the immunoglobulin fold that is flanked by hydrophobic amino acids (see Ref. 17Vinson M. van der Merwe P.A. Kelm S.

It was named iGn-T (7Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thereafter, β3Gn-T1 was isolated based on structural similarity with the β3Gal-T family (2Zhou D. Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96 (; Correction (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We previously reported three additional β3Gn-Ts, β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4, which are also structurally related to the β3Gn-T family (1Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y.

However, the cDNA sequence of β3Gn-T1 was recently corrected by Zhou et al. (see Ref. 2Zhou D. Dinter A. Gutierrez Gallego R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The corrected sequence of β3Gn-T1 was identical to that of β3Gn-T2 which was isolated and reported by us (1Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y. Imai N. Nakagawa S. Koizumi S. Sekine S. Narimatsu H. Sasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3498-3507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). So, a total of four β3Gn-Ts, i.e. iGn-T, β3Gn-T2(-T1), -T3, and -T4, have been described to date. To avoid further confusion, we note this fact, but do not change the enzyme names used in this study. By transfection experiments and in vitro enzymatic analysis, these four β3Gn-Ts were found to exhibit β3Gn-T activity that catalyzes the synthesis of polylactosamine chains, but not β3Gal-T activity. The monoclonal antibody HNK-1 reacts to a sulfoglucuronyl carbohydrate epitope, SO43-GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc-R, which is expressed in several glycoproteins involved in neural cell recognition, and in two neolactoglycolipids, named sulfoglucuronylglycolipid (SGGL)-1 and -2 (SGGL-1, SO43-GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1ceramide; and SGGL-2, SO43-GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1ceramide) (8Chou K.H.

In rat cerebellum, SGGLs are expressed in a biphasic manner, with the initial peak at around postnatal days (PD) 1–3, and the second peak at PD20 (15Jungalwala F.B. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the adult rat cerebellum, the expression of SGGLs is kept constant (16Prasadaro N. Koul O. Tobet S.A. Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B.

Immunohistochemical studies localized SGGLs in specific cells during the development of the cerebellum, and suggested some biological functions for neuron guidance (14Chou D.K. Tobet S.A.

In rat cerebral cortex, the expression of SGGLs peaked at embryonic day (ED) 19 and then decreased until postnatal PD 5, and had almost completely disappeared by PD 20. Carbohydrate chains on SGGLs are extended by stepwise reactions catalyzed by glycosyltransferases. Chou et al. (19Chou D.K. Flores S. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol.

It was demonstrated that Lc3Cer synthase, which catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc to the Gal residue of lactosylceramide (LacCer; Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer) with a β1–3-linkage resulting in the synthesis of Lc3Cer (GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer), is the key enzyme in the expression of SGGLs in the developing rat brain, because only the activity of this synthase was well correlated with the developmental change in SGGL expression. The expression of the Lewis x (Lex; CD15) carbohydrate structure, α1,3-fucosyl-N-acetyllactosamine, Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1-R, is also regulated developmentally and region specifically in the brain (23Allendoerfer K.L.

The Lex also functions as a cell-cell recognition molecule in the highly organized structures of the central nervous system (30Sajdel-Sulkowska E.M. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1998; 45: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Gotz M. Wizenmann A. Reinhardt S. Lumsden A. Price J.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Lex expression on GSLs in brain is also regulated by the Lc3Cer synthase which synthesizes a root structure of the GSLs carrying the Lex epitope (34Dasgupta S. Hogan E.L. Spicer S.S. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, SGGLs and GSLs carrying the Lex epitope are of interest in terms of their biosynthetic regulation. Lc3Cer synthase is an important enzyme with respect to hematopoietic cell differentiation (35Nakamura M. Tsunoda A. Sakoe K. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23507-23514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemic cell line, are capable of bidirectional differentiation into a monocytoid or granulocytoid lineage (35Nakamura M. Tsunoda A. Sakoe K. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23507-23514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Lc3Cer synthase and GM3 synthase (lactosylceramide:α2,3-sialyltransferase), which share the acceptor substrate lactosylceramide (LacCer); Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer, are key enzymes in determining the biosynthetic flow of GSLs in the two different directions. During the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment, ganglioside GM3 was markedly increased by up-regulation of GM3 synthase and down-regulation of Lc3Cer synthase. In contrast, during the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), neolacto-series GSLs were markedly increased by up-regulation of Lc3Cer synthase. Stults and Macher (36Stults C.L. Macher B.A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) concluded that mature myeloid cells exhibited β3Gn-T activity toward both acceptor substrates, leading to the expression of several types of neolacto-neutral GSLs in the cells, while lymphoid cells exhibited activity for nLc4Cer, but not LacCer. The lack of Lc3Cer synthesizing activity in lymphoid cells explains the absence of neolacto-neutral GSLs. Lc3Cer synthase is the enzyme controlling the expression of neolacto-series GSLs and so plays important roles in many cells. In the present study, we cloned and characterized a fifth member of the β3Gn-T family (β3Gn-T5), and identified β3Gn-T5 as the most likely candidate for Lc3Cer synthase. The tumor cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cell lines were donated or purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), Riken Cell Bank (RCB, Tsukuba, Japan), Japan Cell Research Bank (JCRB, Tokyo, Japan), Immunobiological laboratory (IBL, Fujioka, Japan), or Dai-Nippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

The 1B2 hybridoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. The supernatant of 1B2 hybridoma culture medium was used for experiments. The supernatant of 1B2 cells was kindly provided by Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). We constructed a rat shank cDNA library for a random sequencing project. During the sequencing, we found a rat cDNA encoding a partial sequence of β3Gn-T5. This novel sequence (738 bp) did not encode the full ORF. But it had the β3Gal-T (β3Gn-T) motifs which are shared by the known β3Gal-Ts and β3Gn-Ts. The cDNA library of Colo205 cells constructed in a previous study (6Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J.

We did not clone a rat full-length β3Gn-T5 in this study. The principle behind the competitive RT-PCR method for quantification of transcripts was described in detail in our previous studies (6Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M.

Those of various tumor cell lines were extracted and purified in our laboratory. As to the measurement of the transcripts for three cloned β3Gn-T genes,β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4, the primers and the PCR conditions were also reported previously (1Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A.

Regarding the β3Gn-T5 gene, a standard DNA plasmid was constructed by subcloning a full-length ORF cDNA into a pBluescript SK(−) vector. A competitor DNA plasmid carrying a small deletion (245 base pairs) within the ORF of the β3Gn-T5 cDNA was constructed as follows. The standard DNA plasmid was double digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases, MscI andBglII, and was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase. This was followed by self-ligation of the deleted DNA plasmid. As to the measurement of the β3Gn-T5 transcripts by competitive RT-PCR, we used the following primer set: forward primer, 5′-TCTTATGACTGCTGATGATGACAT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTTTAGGATCTGTAGCATTCTTCC-3′.

The construction of pAMo vector inserted with each of three cloned β3Gn-T genes,β3Gn-T2, -T3, and -T4, was also reported previously (1Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T.

Regarding theβ3Gn-T5 gene, the β3Gn-T5 ORF fragment was excised from the standard β3Gn-T5 DNA in pBluescript SK(−), and then blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase. The blunt-ended fragment was flanked with SfiI linker and inserted into theSfiI site of pAMo vector. Each of the fourβ3Gn-T genes subcloned into a pAMo vector was transfected by electroporation into Namalwa cells. These cells were selected in the presence of geneticin (G418) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. Stable transfectant cells were obtained after 25 days exposure to geneticin. The levels of the transcripts expressed in the Namalwa transfectant cells were measured by means of competitive RT-PCR. For glycolipid analysis, 1.0 × 108 of the Namalwa transfectant cells with each β3Gn-Tgene were collected, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lyophilized. Total glycolipids were extracted from the lyophilized cells. Crude glycolipids were extracted twice from the transfectant cells, first with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and then with chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8, v/v/v). Samples dried with the N2 evaporator were dissolved in methanol, then subjected to mild alkaline treatment in 0.1 n KOH/methanol at 40 °C for 2 h, and neutralized with 1 n acetic acid. After the free fatty acids had been removed with n-hexane, the remaining fractions were dried with the N2 evaporator and subjected to Folch's partition. The lower neutral glycolipid fractions were dried with the N2 evaporator and subjected to immuno-TLC analysis. Neutral glycolipid equivalent to 1.0 × 107 cells was applied to each lane of TLC. Neutral glycolipids were separated by TLC (HPTLC Kieselgel 60, 5641; MERK, Germany) with mixtures of chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, v/v/v) and immuno-TLC analysis was performed with the antibody 1B2 as described (36Stults C.L. Macher B.A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The putative catalytic domain of each of β3Gn-T2, -T3, -T4 had been expressed as a secreted protein fused with FLAG peptide in insect cells as described in a previous study (1Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y. Imai N. Nakagawa S. Koizumi S. Sekine S. Narimatsu H. Sasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3498-3507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present study, a 1.1-kilobase pair DNA fragment encoding a COOH-terminal portion of β3Gn-T5 (amino acids 39 to 378) was amplified by PCR. The PCR was performed with Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the supplier's manual. The 5′ and 3′ primer sequences were flanked withBamHI and XbaI sequences, respectively, to create the restriction sites. Those sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5′-CGGGATCCATTGTGAGCCATATGAAGTCATAT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATGACAGTGAAAACATACAACATTC-3′. The amplified fragment was first inserted between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pBluescript SK(−) vector. Subsequently, the insert DNA was excised by BamHI and NotI, and was inserted between the BamHI and NotI sites of pVL1393-F2 to yield pVL1393-F2G5. pVL1393-F2 is an expression vector derived from pVL1393 (Pharmingen) and contains a fragment encoding the signal peptide of human immunoglobulin (MHFQVQIFSFLLISASVIMSRG) and FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK). We prepared recombinant viruses as described previously (1Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y. Imai N. Nakagawa S. Koizumi S. Sekine S. Narimatsu H. Sasaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3498-3507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Sf21 insect cells (Pharmingen) were infected with each individual recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and incubated at 27 °C for 72 h to yield conditioned media containing recombinant β3Gn-T proteins fused with FLAG peptide. Bacu3GnT proteins were readily purified by anti-FLAG M1 antibody resin (Sigma) and eluted with 50 mm TBS (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), 4 mmCaCl2 buffer (pH 7.4). The recombinant proteins obtained in this system were named Bacu3GnT2, Bacu3GnT3, Bacu3GnT4, and Bacu3GnT5. Bacu3GnT proteins separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to an Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was probed with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, and stained with the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intensity of positive bands on Western blotting was measured by densitometer (43Togayachi A. Kudo T. Ikehara Y. Iwasaki H. Nishihara S. Andoh T. Higashiyama M. Kodama K. Nakamori S. Narimatsu H. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to determine the relative amounts of each Bacu3GnT protein. Two types of each recombinant β3Gn-T, the soluble enzyme produced in the baculoexpression system and the membrane-bound form expressed in the cell homogenates of Namalwa transfectant cells and other cultured cell lines, were used to determine the relative activities of each β3Gn-T toward various substrates. Each soluble Bacu3Gn-T purified was adjusted to the same amount as described above and used for the assay. The various cultured cells were solubilized in a 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2% Triton X-100, and 20 μg of total protein in the cell homogenates was used for the enzyme reaction. Various oligosaccharides were fluorescently labeled with 2-aminobenzamide (2AB) or pyridylaminated (PA) (1Shiraishi N. Natsume A. Togayachi A. Endo T. Akashima T. Yamada Y. Imai N. Nakagawa S.

After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the reaction was terminated by boiling for 3 min, and the mixture was diluted with 80 μl of water. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was filtered using an Ultrafree-MC column (Millipore). A 10-μl aliquot of each supernatant was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography on a TSK-gel ODS-80TS QA column (4.6 × 300 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The reaction products were eluted with 20 mmammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 7% methanol at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 50 °C and monitored with a fluorescence spectrophotometer, JASCO FP-920 (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) (1Shiraishi N.

We show that Dmblm is identical to mus309, a locus originally identified in a mutagen-sensitivity screen. One mus309 allele, which carries a stop codon between two of the helicase motifs, causes partial male sterility and complete female sterility. Mutant males produce an excess of XY sperm and nullo sperm, consistent with a high frequency of nondisjunction and/or chromosome loss. These phenotypes of mus309 suggest that Dmblm functions in DNA double-strand break repair. The mutant Dmblm phenotypes were partially rescued by an extra copy of the DNA repair gene Ku70, indicating that the two genes functionally interact in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2087076426,"In the present study, we characterize the covalent modification of a protein by crotonaldehyde, a representative carcinogenic aldehyde, and describe the endogenous production of this aldehyde in vivo. The crotonaldehyde preferentially reacted with the lysine and histidine residues of bovine serum albumin and generated a protein-linked carbonyl derivative. Upon incubation with the histidine and lysine derivatives, crotonaldehyde predominantly generated β-substituted butanal adducts of histidine and lysine andN ε-(2,5-dimethyl-3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine (dimethyl-FDP-lysine) as the putative carbonyl derivatives generated in the crotonaldehyde-modified protein. To verify the endogenous formation of crotonaldehyde in vivo, we raised the monoclonal antibody (mAb82D3) against the crotonaldehyde-modified protein and found that it cross-reacted with the protein-bound 2-alkenals, such as crotonaldehyde, 2-pentenal, and 2-hexenal. The anti-2-alkenal antibody recognized multiple crotonaldehyde-lysine adducts, including dimethyl-FDP-lysine and an unknown product, which showed the greatest immunoreactivity with the antibody. On the basis of the chemical and spectroscopic evidence, the major antigenic product was determined to be a novel Schiff base-derived crotonaldehyde-lysine adduct,N ε-(5-ethyl-2-methylpyridinium)lysine (EMP-lysine). It was found that the lysine residues that had disappeared in the protein treated with crotonaldehyde were partially recovered by EMP-lysine. The presence of immunoreactive materials with mAb82D3 in vivo was demonstrated in the kidney of rats exposed to the renal carcinogen, ferric nitrilotriacetate. In addition, the observations that the metal-catalyzed oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the presence of proteins resulted in an increase in the antigenicity of the protein indicated that lipid peroxidation represents a potential pathway for the formation of crotonaldehyde/2-alkenals in vivo. These data suggest that the formation of carcinogenic aldehydes during lipid peroxidation may be causally involved in the pathophysiological effects associated with oxidative stress.

The important agents that give rise to the modification of a protein may be represented by reactive aldehydic intermediates, such as ketoaldehydes, 2-alkenals and 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals (3Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar, 5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol.

These reactive aldehydes are considered important mediators of cell damage due to their ability to covalently modify biomolecules, which can disrupt important cellular functions and can cause mutations (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the adduction of aldehydes to apolipoprotein B in low density lipoproteins (LDL)1 has been strongly implicated in the mechanism by which LDL is converted to an atherogenic form that is taken up by macrophages, leading to the formation of foam cells (7Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Steinberg D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 369: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 2-Alkenals represent a group of highly reactive aldehydes containing two electrophilic reaction center (Fig.1). A partially positive carbon 1 or 3 in such molecules can attack a nucleophile, such as protein. It has been suggested that these aldehydes primarily react with the sulfhydryl group of cysteine, the ε-amino group of lysine, and the imidazole group of histidine in the proteins (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar, 6Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Among the 2-alkenals, crotonaldehyde is known to be mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium and other systems used for the detection of genetic damage (9International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans. Dry Cleaning, Some Chlorinated Solvents and other Industrial Chemicals, 63, 1995, 373, 391, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.Google Scholar). Its high reactivity indeed makes this aldehyde a dangerous substance for the living cell. It has been shown that crotonaldehyde induces altered liver cell foci, neoplastic nodules, and hepatocellular carcinoma upon oral administration to F344 rats (9International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans.

Hecht S.S. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1285-1289PubMed Google Scholar). Crotonaldehyde is commonly detected in mobile source emissions, cigarette smoke, and other products of thermal degradation (9International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans. Dry Cleaning, Some Chlorinated Solvents and other Industrial Chemicals, 63, 1995, 373, 391, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.Google Scholar). It is also a product of lipid peroxidation and a metabolite of the hepatocarcinogenN-nitrosopyrrolidone and forms adducts with DNA (11Chung F.-L. Chen H.-J.C. Nath R.G. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2105-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 12Chung F.-L. Nath R.G. Nagao M. Nishikawa A. Zhou G.-D. Randerath K. Mutat.

Crotonaldehyde, like other 2-alkenals, may also form adducts with the nucleophilic amino acid residues of protein; however, there have been few detailed insights into the chemical mechanism involved in the modification of proteins by crotonaldehyde. To understand the mechanism underlying the formation of covalently modified protein in vivo, we have initiated studies on the characterization of modified proteins with reactive aldehyde species. In the present study, we investigated the reaction of protein with crotonaldehyde and determined the structures of the crotonaldehyde adducts, possessing a carbonyl function. Moreover, to assess their formations in vivo, we raised the monoclonal antibody directed to protein-bound crotonaldehyde and examined the endogenous production of antigenic materials in an experimental carcinogenesis model. Our results suggest that crotonaldehyde/2-alkenals and their protein adducts are endogenously produced under oxidative stress. Finally, lipid peroxidation is demonstrated to be a potential pathway for the endogenous formation of 2-alkenals. N α-Hippuryl-l-lysine,N α-acetyl-l-histidine, crotonaldehyde, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was obtained from Pierce. Ferric nitrate nonahydrate and sodium carbonate were from Wako (Osaka, Japan); and the nitrilotriacetic acid disodium salt was from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulin and ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence). Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AMX600 (600 MHz) instrument. Ultraviolet absorption spectra were measured with a Hitachi U-Best-50 spectrophotometer, and fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-2000 spectrometer. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry was measured with a JEOL JMS-700 (MStation) instrument. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was measured with a Jasco PlatformII-LC instrument. Modification of the protein by crotonaldehyde was performed by incubating BSA (1.0 mg/ml) with 1–10 mm crotonaldehyde in 10 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 24 h. The iron-catalyzed oxidation of arachidonate in the presence of BSA was performed by incubating BSA (1 mg/ml) with 2 mm polyunsaturated fatty acids in the presence of either 10 μm Fe2+, 1 mm ascorbate, or 10 μm Fe2+ and 1 mm ascorbate in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in atmospheric oxygen. The reaction mixture (10 ml) contained 100 mm crotonaldehyde and 100 mm N α-acetylhistidine in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed with a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nomura Chemicals, Aichi, Japan) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 200–400 nm. The reaction gave a single product, which was isolated (yield, 18 mg) with a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (20.0 × 250 mm, Nomura Chemicals) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 8.0 ml/min.

The reaction mixture (10 ml) contained 100 mm crotonaldehyde and 100 mm N α-hippuryllysine in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed with a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-MG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nomura Chemicals) equilibrated in a solution of 20% methanol in 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 240 nm. The reaction provided two major products (P-1 and P-2), but only P-2 was isolable (yield, 12 mg). P-2 was isolated with a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (20.0 × 250 mm) equilibrated in 23% methanol in 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 6.0 ml/min. The molecular masses of P-1 and P-2 were estimated by LC-MS. The chemical structure of P-2 was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectrometries.1H NMR (CD3OD): δH 1.13 (2H, m), 1.19 (3H, m), 1.29 (3H, d, J = 6.76 Hz), 1.49–1.67 (4H, m), 2.25–2.50 (2H, m), 2.95 (2H, m), 3.75 (1H, m), 3.88 (2H, m), 4.08 (1H, m), 4.21 (1H, q, J = 7.62 Hz), 6.95 (1H, m), 7.33 (2H, t, J = 7.40, 8.04 Hz), 7.43 (1H, m), 7.60 (2H, d, J = 7.32 Hz), 9.10 (1/2 H, s), 9.16 (1/2 H, s); δC 55.9, 25.3, 23.5, 32.0, 47.7, 44.4, 172.3, 178.9, 134.1, 130.1, 128.5, 133.8. Isolation of the antigenic material, X-1, was performed with a reverse-phase HPLC on a Develosil C-30 column (4.6 × 250 mm). The reaction mixture was concentrated and applied to the column equilibrated in a solution of 23% methanol in 0.1% acetic acid. Products were eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, the elution being monitored by absorbance at 240 nm. X-1 was isolated (yield, 7 mg), and its chemical structure was characterized by LC-MS and 1H and 13C NMR spectrometries. 1H NMR (CD3OD): δH 1.13 (3H, t, J = 7.60 Hz), 1.32 (2H, m), 1.62–1.93 (4H, m), 2.63 (3H, m), 2.65 (2H, m), 4.00 (2H, dd, J = 6.96, 16.66 Hz), 4.17 (1H, m), 4.35 (2H, m), 7.46 (2H, t, J = 7.68 Hz), 7.56 (1H, t,J = 7.20, 7.48 Hz), 7.62 (1H, d, J = 8.24 Hz), 7.72 (2H, d, J = 8.16 Hz), 8.05 (1H, d, J = 8.20 Hz), 8.38 (1H, s); δC 55.7, 26.0, 23.1, 32.2, 58.7, 44.4, 172.0, 179.4, 134.0, 130.0, 128.3, 133.7. An aliquot (0.5 ml) of the protein samples was treated with an equal volume of 0.1% (w/v) 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in 2n HCl and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. This mixture was treated with 0.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid (w/v, final concentration), and after centrifugation, the precipitate was extracted three times with ethanol/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v). The protein sample was then dissolved with 2 ml of 8 mguanidine hydrochloride/13 mm EDTA/133 mm Tris solution (pH 7.4), and the UV absorbance was measured at 365 nm. The results were expressed as moles of DNPH incorporated/protein (mol/mol) based on an average absorptivity of 21.0 mm −1cm−1 (15Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). An aliquot (0.1 ml) of the protein samples incubated in the absence or presence of crotonaldehyde was treated with 10 mm EDTA (10 μl), 1 n NaOH (10 μl), and 100 mm NaBH4 (10 μl). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the mixture was treated with treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 3 min, the proteins were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 6 n HCl for 24 h at 105 °C. The hydrolysates were then concentrated and dissolved in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The amino acid analysis was performed using a JEOL JLC-500 amino acid analyzer equipped with a JEOL LC30-DK20 data analyzing system. LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml) was prepared from the plasma of healthy humans by sequential ultracentrifugation and then extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.01% EDTA at 4 °C. LDL used for the oxidative modification by Cu2+ was dialyzed against a 1000-fold volume of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The oxidation of LDL was performed by incubating 0.5 mg of LDL with CuSO4 (10 μm) in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C. Female BALB/c mice were immunized three times with the crotonaldehyde-treated KLH. Spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with P3/U1 murine myeloma cells and cultured in hypoxanthine/amethopterin/thymidine selection medium. Culture supernatants of the hybridoma were screened using an ELISA, employing pairs of wells of microtiter plates on which were absorbed crotonaldehyde-treated BSA as the antigen (1 μg of protein/well). After incubation with 100 μl of the hybridoma supernatants, and with intervening washes with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.8, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween), the wells were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by a substrate solution containing 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Hybridoma cells corresponding to the supernatants that were positive on crotonaldehyde-modified BSA were then cloned by limiting dilution. After repeated screening, four clones were obtained. Among them, clone 82D3 showed the most distinctive recognition of the crotonaldehyde-modified BSA. The competitive and non-competitive ELISA were performed as previously described (16Uchida K. Szweda L.I. Chae H.Z. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8742-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The protein was stained with Coomassie Blue. Agarose gel electrophoresis of LDL was performed using the TITAN GEL High Resolution Protein System (Helena Laboratories, Saitama, Japan). LDL was stained with Fat Red 7B. A gel was transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with Block Ace (40 mg/ml) for blocking, washed, and treated with the primary antibody (mAb82D3). This procedure was followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to a goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). The bands were visualized by exposure of the membranes to autoradiography film. The ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe3+-NTA) solution was prepared immediately before use by the method described in a previous study (18Toyokuni S. Uchida K. Okamoto K. Hattori-Nakakuki Y. Hiai H. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, ferric nitrate enneahydrate and the nitrilotriacetic acid disodium salt were each dissolved in deionized water to form 80 and 160 mmsolutions, respectively. They were mixed at the volume ratio of 1:2 (molar ratio, 1:4), and the pH was adjusted with sodium hydrogen carbonate to 7.4. Male SPF slc: Wistar rats (Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center, Shizuoka), weighing 130–150 g (6 weeks of age), were used. They were kept in a stainless steel cage and given commercial rat chow (Funabashi F-2, Chiba) as well as deionized water (Millipore Japan, Osaka) ad libitum. Animals received a single intraperitoneal injection of Fe3+-NTA (15 mg Fe/kg of body weight). They were sacrificed at 0, 24, 48 h after the administration. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Both kidneys of each animal were immediately removed. One of them was fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, cut at 3-μm thickness, and used for immunohistochemical analyses by an avidin-biotin complex method with alkaline phosphatase (19Toyokuni S. Tanaka T. Hattori Y. Nishiyama Y. Yoshida A. Uchida K. Hiai H. Ochi H. Osawa T. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 365-374PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after deparaffinization with xylene and ethanol, normal rabbit serum (Dako Japan Co., Ltd., Kyoto; diluted to 1:75) for the inhibition of the nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody, a monoclonal antibody (mAb82D3) against crotonaldehyde-modified proteins (0.5 μg/ml), biotin-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG serum (Vector Laboratories; diluted 1:300), and avidin-biotin complex (Vector; diluted 1:100) were sequentially used. Procedures using phosphate-buffered saline or the IgG fraction (0.5 μg/ml) of normal mouse serum instead of mAb82D3 antibody against crotonaldehyde-modified proteins showed no or negligible positivity. Crotonaldehyde is a strong electrophile, which may readily react with nucleophiles, such as protein. As shown in Fig.2 A, binding of the crotonaldehyde to bovine serum albumin was suggested by a slight expanse and mobility shift of the protein bands on the SDS-PAGE analysis. To further evaluate the covalent binding of crotonaldehyde to the protein, we examined the generation of the protein-linked carbonyl groups and changes in the amino acid composition. Spectrophotometric measurement of the protein carbonyls, after their reaction with DNPH, is a simple and accurate technique that has been widely used to reveal increased levels of covalently modified proteins during aging and disease (1Stadtman E.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 11-12Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 2Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 3Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, exposure of BSA to crotonaldehyde resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the protein carbonyl formation. The incorporation of crotonaldehyde into the protein was accompanied by selective loss of histidine and lysine residues (Fig. 2 C). However, as shown in Fig. 2 D, the stoichiometry between the loss of amino acids and the increase in protein carbonyls did not show a linear correlation. At low concentrations of crotonaldehyde (≤2.5 mm), the sum of the amounts of lysine and histidine residues lost was almost equal to the amount of protein carbonyl groups detected; whereas, even after the protein carbonyl content leveled off, the loss of amino acids still continued when the concentration of crotonaldehyde was raised from 10 to 20 mm. These data suggest that crotonaldehyde at low concentrations mainly forms carbonyl adducts, whereas, at high concentrations, it preferentially forms non-carbonyl adducts, in addition to carbonyl adducts, in the protein. To characterize the crotonaldehyde adducts possessing a carbonyl function, the histidine and lysine derivatives were incubated with crotonaldehyde, and the products were characterized by LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy (1H and 13C NMR). As shown in Fig.3 A, the incubation ofN α-acetylhistidine with crotonaldehyde generated a single product. The LC-MS analysis of the product showed a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 268 (M+H)+, suggesting that it was composed of one molecule ofN α-acetylhistidine and one molecule of crotonaldehyde. Support for modification of the imidazole nitrogens was shifts downfield of the imidazole vinyls (δH 7.59 and 9.07; δC 117.76 and 134.1) in the 1H NMR spectrum. The presence of the β-substituted butanal moiety was clearly observed: δH 1.46 (-CH3), 3.10 (-CH2-), 4.95 (>CH-), and 9.58 (-CHO); δC 20.78 (-CH3), 48.38 (-CH2-), 50.39 (>CH-), and 200.13 (-CHO). This was also confirmed by the1H-detected multiple-bond heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectrum (HMBC) experiments (data not shown). Thus, the structure of the product was determined to be the β-substituted butanal derivative of N α-acetylhistidine (Fig.3 B). It is suggested that the adduct is generated from the nucleophilic attack of the imidazole nitrogen on the ethylenic bond of crotonaldehyde (Michael addition). Therefore, the adduct, we first speculated, was a mixture of the isomeric form of theN π- andN τ-substituted adducts of the imidazole ring. However, the NMR spectra apparently indicated that the reaction was exclusively occurring at one position. Our assignment of the structure involving the N τ alkylation was on the basis that the methine proton of the butanal moiety was correlated with the two imidazole vinyls (C-2 and C-5) in the HMBC spectrum (data not shown). Our observation of exclusive N τalkylation is not without precedent (20Nadkarni D.V. Sayre L.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and must reflect a combination of the high chemoselectivity and large steric requirements of this particular Michael addition reaction, as opposed to, for example, simple alkylation by primary alkyl halides. Upon incubation of the lysine derivative (N α-hippuryllysine) with crotonaldehyde, two major products (P-1 and P-2) were detected (Fig.4 A). P-1 was suggested to be the butanal derivative of N α-hippuryllysine by LC-MS (m/z 378 [M + H+]) (Fig. 4 B), while we were unable to isolate the adduct. P-2 was isolated and submitted for structural characterization. The LC-MS analysis of the product showed a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 430 (M+H)+, suggesting that it was composed of one molecule ofN α-hippuryllysine and two molecules of crotonaldehyde. In analogy with the acrolein reaction (21Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Morimitsu Y. Osawa T. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16058-16066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), the1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product suggested the presence of a 3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino (FDP) moiety. In addition, the adduct appeared to have two methyl groups: δH 1.19 (3H, m) and 1.29 (3H, d, J = 6.76 Hz); δC 16.2 and 18.0. An HMBC experiment showed the correlations of methyl protons (1.29 ppm) to C-2 and C-3 and another methyl proton (1.19 ppm) to C-5 and C-6. Taken together, P-2 was determined to be the N α-hippuryl derivative ofN ε-(2,5-dimethyl-3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine (dimethyl-FDP-lysine) (Fig. 4 B). The findings that both acrolein and crotonaldehyde generate the FDP-lysine adducts suggest that this type of condensation reaction is characteristic of the reaction for 2-alkenals with primary amines. Indeed, upon reaction withN α-hippuryllysine, the 2-alkenals, such as 2-pentenal and 2-hexenal, generated products that were suggested to be diethyl-FDP-lysine and dipropyl-FDP-lysine, respectively, by the LC-MS analysis (Fig. 4 C). Thus, upon reaction with the histidine and lysine derivatives, crotonaldehyde predominantly generated the butanal and FDP adducts. Notably, they all have free aldehyde groups. To examine whether these adducts indeed possess a carbonyl function, we exposed them to excess DNPH, and the products were analyzed by a reverse-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 5, they indeed reacted with the carbonyl reagent and provided the new products. The LC-MS analysis of the products gave pseudomolecular ion peaks (M+H)+ atm/z 446 and 608, which corresponded to the expected dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives of the butanalhistidine and dimethyl-FDP-lysine adducts, respectively. The formation of these adducts may therefore contribute to the generation of carbonyl groups in the protein exposed to crotonaldehyde. There is increasing evidence that aldehydes endogenously generated during the degradation process of biological molecules are involved in many of the pathophysiologies (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Major sources of reactive aldehydesin vivo have been suggested to be lipid peroxidation, glycation, and amino acid oxidation (6Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Crotonaldehyde has been reported to be produced during lipid peroxidation (11Chung F.-L. Chen H.-J.C. Nath R.G. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2105-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 12Chung F.-L. Nath R.G. Nagao M. Nishikawa A. Zhou G.-D. Randerath K. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); however, as far as we know, very few papers have addressed the endogenous production of the crotonaldehyde protein adduct in vivo. Accordingly, to evaluate whether the adduct is produced in vivo, we attempted to raise the monoclonal antibody specific to the protein-bound crotonaldehyde. Mice were immunized with the crotonaldehyde-modified KLH and, during the preparation of the monoclonal antibodies, hybridomas were selected by the reactivities of the culture supernatant to the crotonaldehyde-modified BSA. Among the six clones obtained, the clone 82D3 showed the most distinctive recognition of the crotonaldehyde-modified BSA. Characterization of the antibodies' ability to recognize specific molecular targets in their native three-dimensional conformation is critical to the use of these reagents. Therefore, we attempted to identify the structure of the epitope recognized by mAb82D3. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the monoclonal antibody showed a strong immunoreactivity not"

A 4 kelvin decrease in the temperature of the Arctic stratosphere due to anthropogenic and/or natural effects can trigger the occurrence of widespread severe denitrification. Ozone loss is amplified in a denitrified stratosphere, so the effects of falling temperatures in promoting denitrification must be considered in assessment studies of ozone recovery trends."

Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar and 2Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Normal cellular homeostasis appears dependent on a balance between the actions of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, etc.) and those of pro-apoptotic members (Bax, Bak, Bad, etc.). These proteins all share significant homology to Bcl-2 in a number of regions designated BH1–3 with the antiapoptotic members also having a BH4 domain. An additional sub-family is made up of proteins whose only homology to Bcl-2 is in the BH3 domain (Bad, Bik, Bid, Bim, etc.; reviewed in Ref. 3Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). These appear to fall exclusively into the pro-apoptotic class. At least part of this Bcl-2 family balancing act appears to be controlled by direct binding interactions between the family members. Both homo- and heterodimeric interactions between family members are mediated by the binding of the BH3 domain in a hydrophobic cleft formed by three helices in its corresponding partner (4Diaz J.L. Oltersdorf T. Horne W. McConnell M. Wilson G. Weeks S. Garcia T. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11350-11355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family proteins containing multiple BH domains may function in part through the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential and a corresponding release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Due to their structural homology with pore-forming bacterial toxins, it was postulated that these proteins could act directly by forming ion channels in mitochondria (6Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Indeed, this was demonstrated in anin vitro lipid membrane system (7Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that Bcl-2 family proteins can act indirectly to affect membrane potential through interactions with the mitochondrial channel VDAC1 (8Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Unlike the channels formed by Bcl-2 family members themselves, the VDAC is capable of directly passing cytochrome c out of the mitochondria. However, this model still leaves open the issue of how protein interactions within the Bcl-2 family could regulate apoptosis. One possibility is that BH3 domain binding of a family member causes the competitive release of other interacting proteins. This is a particularly attractive model for the BH3-only class of molecules, as each may serve to monitor a specific cellular activity and respond to insult by stimulating apoptosis (3Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Indeed, in addition to forming dimers with other members of the Bcl-2 family, both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL have been shown to interact with a number of heterologous proteins. By discovering what proteins interact with Bcl-2 family members, insight may be gained into the cellular processes that are monitored by the apoptotic machinery. In addition, the identity of proteins released in response to these signals may be discovered. The major tool used in the identification and characterization of dimerizing pairs within the Bcl-2 family has been the yeast two-hybrid assay (9Wong C. Naumovski L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 10Simonen M. Keller H. Heim J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whereas two-hybrid has emerged as the leading technology for mapping protein-protein interactions, it is not without significant limitations that arise because the interaction takes place in the yeast nucleus (11Luban J. Goff S.P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Display technologies provide a powerful alternative because the interaction between library and target occurs in vitro, allowing optimal binding conditions to be used for different targets (12Zozulya S. Lioubin M. Hill R.J. Abram C. Gishizky M.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Additionally, large libraries are screened iteratively, thus allowing even very low copy number proteins to be identified. However, the use of phage display, the most widely practiced display technology, has been similarly hampered by the limitations of producing libraries in a living system. We have chosen to investigate the binding interactions of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL by direct mRNA display (13Roberts R.W. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12297-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), a technology that circumvents many of the difficulties associated with yeast two-hybrid and phage display. In mRNA display, a newly translated mRNA molecule is covalently coupled to its corresponding nascent protein chain through a puromycin moiety ligated to the 3′ end of the RNA. The subsequent synthesis of a cDNA copy stabilizes the RNA and provides a template for PCR amplification. Because mRNA display is a completely in vitro technique, many of the problems inherent in cloning and expression are circumvented. The elimination of cloning bottlenecks in library preparation allows the generation of very large libraries, routinely in the range of 1013 members. Toxicity of display molecules in a particular host is not a problem because no living system is involved. In addition, mRNA display constructs form readily in mammalianin vitro translation systems that provide suitable chaperones for the folding of human proteins and the potential for appropriate post-translational modifications. Herein is described a set of Bcl-XL binding interactions identified by mRNA display. Included are interactions with novel as well as previously identified protein partners. In order to increase the diversity of the pool of mRNA displayed proteins used in the selection, it was desirable to mix together libraries prepared from different tissue sources. In order not to lose the potentially valuable information of which starting library a particular isolated clone came from, a tag sequence was incorporated into the 5′-UTR during construction. Unique UTR sequences that are compatible with translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates were identified by selection from a library of c-myc mRNAs with a partially randomized 5′-UTR. The c-myc construct described by Roberts and Szostak (13Roberts R.W. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12297-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the 5′ primer TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA CAA TTA CTA TTT ACA ATT HHH HHH HHA CAA TGG CTG AAG AAC AGA AAC TG (where H is an equimolar mixture of A, C, and T). This inserted 8 random bases into the 5′-UTR upstream of the ATG start codon, to give a library of 38 (6561) different mRNA molecules afterin vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. Fusion formation, reverse transcription, and immunoprecipitation with an anti-c-myc antibody were carried out as described (13Roberts R.W. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12297-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) to separate mRNAs that had undergone translation from those that had not. The successfully translated and fused sequences were amplified by PCR using the 5′ primerTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACAATTACTATTTACAATT, in which the T7 promoter is underlined, to preserve the information in the randomized region. Sequences obtained from individual clones were subsequently used in the construction of tagged libraries. Poly(A)+ mRNA (CLONTECH) was primed using the oligonucleotides GGAACTTGCTTCGTCTTTGCAATCN9 or GGATGATGCTTCGTCTTTGTAATCN9 and cDNA synthesized using SuperScript II RT (Promega). Two primers were used initially to allow the investigation of different ligation sequences. These sequences were subsequently altered and made uniform by the use of a single PCR primer under conditions that would allow it to anneal to either template (see below). After RNase H treatment, unextended primer was removed by purification over an S-300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) size exclusion column. Second strand synthesis by the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase was primed using oligonucleotides of the form GGACAATTACTATTTACAATT(H8)ACAATGN9, which include a 5′-UTR with sequence tag H8 derived as above and a start codon (underlined). In the production of libraries from human kidney, liver, marrow, and brain mRNAs, the tags CTCCTAAC, CTTTCTCT, CTTACTTC, and ATTTCAAT were used, respectively. Unextended primer was again removed by S-300 size exclusion chromatography, and the cDNA product was then PCR-amplified using a forward primer encoding the T7 promoter (underlined) and 5′-UTR,TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACAATTACTATTTACAATT, and reverse primers corresponding to the fixed regions of the first strand primers above. After PCR product purification using spin columns (Qiagen), short fragments were removed by S-300 size exclusion chromatography. Libraries prepared as PCR products (see above) were reamplified using the forward primer described above (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACAATTACTATTTACAATT) and a single reverse primer, TTTTAAATAGCGCATGC CTTATCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAATC, encoding the FLAG-M2 epitope (underlined) and a region complementary to the photoligation linker (italics). The single reverse primer was used to amplify libraries containing each of the initial first strand primer sequences in order to produce a single uniform end. These amplicons were then used as templates for transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion MegaScript). The resulting RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and NAP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) purification. The puromycin-containing linker 5′-Psoralen-TAGCGGATGCA18 XXCCPu (Xindicates PEG spacer 9; Pu indicates 3′-puromycin) was photo-ligated to the 3′ end of the RNA essentially as described (14Kurz M. Gu K. Lohse P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ligated RNA was translated for 30 min at 30 °C in a 300-μl reaction containing 200 μl of Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate (Ambion), 120 pmol of ligated RNA, 10 μl of −Met amino acid mix (Ambion), and 15 μl of [35S]Met (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequently, 100 μl of 2 m KCl and 25 μl of 1m MgCl2 was added to facilitate formation of the mRNA display complex. The mRNA display constructs were then purified by binding to 100 μl of 50% oligo(dT)-cellulose slurry in a total volume of 10 ml (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1 h. The binding reaction was then transferred to a column (Bio-Rad), washed 3 times with 1 ml of binding buffer containing no EDTA, and then eluted with 100-μl aliquots of 2 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A cDNA strand was synthesized using SuperScript II RT (Promega) and the reverse sense PCR primer in the manufacturer-supplied buffer. The reverse transcription reaction was then diluted to 1 ml in TBK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) and incubated with 200 μl of anti-FLAG antibody immobilized on agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The binding reaction was transferred to a column, and the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of TBK buffer. mRNA-display constructs were then eluted with 100-μl aliquots of TBK buffer containing 100 μm FLAG-M2 peptide, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The yield of mRNA-protein fusion product was based on an estimated specific activity of methionine in the lysate (5 μm total concentration) and determined by scintillation counting both the purified product and the crude translation mixture. For the libraries containing a heterogeneous population of proteins, the prevalence of methionine was approximated as one initiator methionine per molecule plus one for each 60 amino acids. Bcl-XL was PCR-amplified using the primers AGTATCGAATTCATGTCTCAGAGCAACCGG and TACAGTCTCGAGCTAGTTGAAGCGTTCCTGGCCCT and then cloned into the expression vector 4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Competent E. coli(BL21(DE3) pLysS) cells were transformed and grown on LB/carbenicillin plates overnight at 37 °C. A single colony was picked and grown overnight in 5 ml of LB/carbenicillin. Two ml of this starter culture was used to inoculate a fresh 100-ml culture, and this was grown at 37 °C until an A 600 of 0.6 was reached. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm, and the culture was shaken at 25 °C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1/10th volume 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1.0% glycerol, and the cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization and three freeze/thaw cycles. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and 5 ml of the clarified lysate was applied to a 2-ml RediPack GST column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 20 ml of lysis buffer and eluted, in a stepwise manner, with lysis buffer to which reduced glutathione had been added, to final concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm. Fractions were analyzed on 4–12% NuPAGE gels (NOVEX), and positive fractions were pooled. The protein was dialyzed against 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1.0% glycerol, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA (Pierce). 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was aliquoted to a microcentrifuge tube and washed with PBS. 60 μg of Bcl-XL-GST fusion protein (100 μl) was added, allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads rewashed in selection buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The Bcl-XL-GST beads were resuspended in 100 μl of selection buffer (∼11.5 μm Bcl-XL), and 35S-labeled mRNA display construct or free peptide was added (∼10–60 nm final concentration) and incubated on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction was then transferred to a microcentrifuge column (Bio-Rad), and unbound material was removed by a 10-s spin at 1,000 rpm. The beads were washed 3 times with 500 μl of selection buffer. The extent of binding was determined by scintillation counting each fraction including the recovered beads. The general scheme of the selection is given in Fig. 1. Bcl-XL-GST was immobilized and incubated with the mRNA display library and washed under the conditions described above for the binding assay. For the first round of selection the input was ∼0.06 pmol of each of four libraries (kidney, liver, marrow, and brain) mixed prior to selection. For subsequent rounds of selection the input ranged from 0.25 to 0.92 pmol in total. After washing, the cDNA strand of bound material was recovered in three elutions with 100 μl of 0.1 n KOH. Eluates were subsequently neutralized by the addition of 2 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7) and 8 μl of 1 n HCl. A small scale PCR optimization was performed with the eluate to determine the number of cycles required to produce a strong signal without overamplification (typically 18–28 cycles). The library was then regenerated by PCR using the remainder of the eluate. After selection, PCR products were cloned into the TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen), and after isolation of individual colonies, the plasmids were purified (Qiagen) and sequenced. RNAs were prepared from PCR templates and purified as described above. After translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Ambion) peptides were purified directly from the lysate by immunoprecipitation and peptide elution based on a C-terminal FLAG-M2 epitope (Sigma). In order to demonstrate the feasibility of using mRNA display technology to identify proteins that bind to Bcl-XL, a model study was performed using known BH3 domains. The target protein used in this study was the human Bcl-XL protein produced as a GST fusion and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The BH3 domains of three different Bcl-2 family proteins (Fig. 2) were prepared as mRNA display constructs along with control peptides derived from unrelated proteins Stat-1 and Raf-1. The constructs were radiolabeled by incorporation of [35S]Met during in vitro translation. These mRNA displayed peptides were then incubated with immobilized Bcl-XL, and the unbound material was removed by washing. The amount of peptide bound to the beads was determined by scintillation counting and graphed in Fig. 2 as the percent of input counts bound. Binding was specific to the BH3 helices, with Bak bound most efficiently (40%) followed by Bax (6%); no binding was observed for the BH3 helix from Bcl-2 or either control. The ordering of Bax and Bak is in good agreement with published IC50 values, which indicate that Bcl-XL has an affinity for the Bak BH3 domain that is ∼5-fold higher than that for Bax (4Diaz J.L. Oltersdorf T. Horne W. McConnell M. Wilson G. Weeks S. Garcia T. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11350-11355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). There are several possible explanations for the lack of binding observed for the BH3 domain of Bcl-2. Published interactions between Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (15Zhang H. Saeed B. Ng S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Xie Z. Schendel S. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6410-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) utilized full-length proteins, so perhaps the chosen BH3 domain peptide fails to form a helix by itself. Alternatively, previously observed interactions may be due to the recognition of the BH3 domain of Bcl-XL by Bcl-2 rather than the reverse. Finally, the affinity may be below that required to generate a signal in this assay. By having established the binding to Bcl-XL of control peptides in the form of mRNA display constructs, a selection to identify binders from within the complex mixture of an mRNA display library was initiated (Fig.1). Four libraries, individually prepared from the tissue-specific mRNAs of human kidney, liver, marrow, and brain, were pooled prior to the start of selection. Each library contained a unique 8-nucleotide tag within the 5′-UTR to allow specific amplification of an individual library, as well as to provide for the identification of the tissue of origin during sequence analysis of individual selected clones. As a target for the selection, a GST fusion protein of Bcl-XL was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The selection was initiated with a combined library of ∼1.5 × 1011 molecules. After incubation of the library with the target, unbound members of the library were washed away, and the bound material was eluted. An enriched library was then regenerated by PCR, transcription, ligation, translation, fusion, reverse transcription, and purification. This enriched library was then used for the subsequent round of selection. After four rounds of selection, the enriched pool from the combined libraries bound the Bcl-XL target at about 40%, an extent similar to the Bak control construct (Fig.2). In order to determine if the winning molecules came from one or multiple libraries, the enriched pool was deconvoluted by PCR with library-specific amplification primers. The pool derived from the brain library was omitted due to cross-reaction of the PCR amplification primers. A test of binding revealed that each tissue-specific pool bound to the target to an extent similar to the mixed pool. The bound material from each of the individual pools was then recovered by elution, PCR-amplified, and analyzed by cloning and sequencing. A total of 378 sequences were obtained as follows: 181 from the kidney, 85 from the liver, and 112 from the marrow library. Initial analysis of the sequences revealed a total of 71 distinct sequence clusters. Six of the clusters originated from all three libraries, 14 from two of the three libraries and the remaining 51 from only one library. The sequences were then subjected to both nBLAST and pBLAST searches to identify the proteins represented by each cluster. Thirty-seven of the clones were from known proteins, 22 from hypothetical or unknown proteins whose nucleic acid sequences were found in the data base, and 12 were unique sequences not yet present in the public data base at the time of the search. Twenty of the most frequently found proteins are given in TableI.Table IThe most abundant protein winners from selectionProteinNumber of clones identifiedKidney (181)Liver (85)Marrow (112)Total (378)Clone IDBim43113690T44HSPC3009151135C68TPR, nuclear pore complex-associated protein23NFNF23C55Bax19NF322C49Novel protein A111618V18cDNA FLJ23277, clone HEP03322122216X42Hypothetical protein DKFZp586HO623NF11516V47Syntaxin 4A84NF12U58Tumor protein HDCMB21P15511V50Proline/glutamine-rich splicing factor (frameshift)7119Novel protein B35NF8V68Talin4NF15X56Thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein5NFNF5U25Sterol regulatory element binding txn factor 1NFNF55W17BCL2L12NF235Y75cDNA FLJ22171, clone HRC00654NFNF55T42Toll-like receptor 34NFNF4U15Calpain 1 (large subunit)13NF4V53Bak21NF3C32Novel protein DNF123T25Numbers in parentheses indicate the total number of clones from that tissue; NF, none found among the clones sequenced; ID, identifier of unique characterized clone.

Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Two other proteins, Bak and Bax, contain BH3 domains known to interact with Bcl-XL (4Diaz J.L. Oltersdorf T. Horne W. McConnell M. Wilson G. Weeks S. Garcia T. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11350-11355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A fourth member of the Bcl-2 family, BCL2L12, was also found in this screen. However, no data on the interaction of BCL2L12 with Bcl-XL have been reported. Bcl-XL has recently been reported to bind directly to the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) (8Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of this protein, VDAC2 and VDAC3, have also been reported (18Rahmani Z. Maunoury C. Siddiqui A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 6: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Blachly-Dyson E. Zambronicz E.B., Yu, W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R. Adelman J. Colombini M. Forte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the less frequently observed proteins was a single clone from the latter, VDAC3, which this screen identifies as a binder of Bcl-XL. None of the other proteins found has previously been reported to bind to Bcl-XL. Further analysis of the known proteins was done to determine whether the selected sequence was from the coding region or UTR and if the reading frame matched that of the native protein. This analysis was used as a filter to eliminate false positives; proteins that failed at this step were not further characterized. Twenty seven of the 35 clusters from known proteins were in frame and within the native open reading frames. Only 1 of 35, proline/glutamine-rich splicing factor, was from the incorrect reading frame. Two clusters had inserts in the reversed orientation relative to the parent mRNA and probably arose due either to incomplete removal of the first strand primer after cDNA synthesis or re-priming on the cDNA strand after first strand synthesis. An additional six clusters were derived from reportedly noncoding regions of the parent mRNA, either the 3′-UTR or introns. Of the clusters with multiple clones, several included more than one unique sequence with distinct N and/or C termini. This variety reflects the random priming used to prepare the library. Alignment of these fragments against parental protein sequences allowed minimal functional regions required for binding to be delineated based on the overlap of individual family members (Fig. 3). For the Bcl-2 family members BimL and Bax, these overlaps clearly define the BH3 domains. In the case of Bax, this overlap domain, Lys58–Gln77, is only 12 amino acids longer than the BH3 core, Leu63–Leu70 (Fig.3 B). Greater variety was observed at the C terminus than at the N terminus. This may be due to the different enzymes, reverse transcriptase, and Klenow fragment used for first and second strand synthesis, respectively. The N termini show a distinct pattern of starting immediately after methionine residues in the native protein (Fig. 3, A and C). This is apparently due to annealing of the primer-encoded ATG start codon (immediately adjacent to the nine random nucleotides of the second strand primer) to corresponding sequences in the cDNA. It should be noted that the information obtained upon cloning and sequencing represents a snapshot of the status of the selection at a specific point. Additional rounds of selection may change the population distribution significantly. A rare sequence from the starting pool that binds tightly might be enriched only to the point of appearing once among the clones, whereas a poorer binding sequence that was abundant in the starting pool might still be found at high copy number. Also, sequencing more clones might lead to the identification of other proteins still present at low copy number. Although the most prevalent binder was the known Bcl-XL-binding protein Bim, the number of clones represented in each sequence cluster may not be a good indicator of which clones are biologically relevant. Therefore, post-selection characterization was performed to determine the relevance of"

We have investigated the products of the reaction of HOCl with GSH in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Despite a complete loss of GSH, there were only very small increases in intracellular and extracellular glutathione disulfide and glutathione sulfonic acid after exposure to HOCl. 35S labeling of the GSH pool showed only a minimal increase in protein-bound GSH, suggesting that S-thiolation was not a major contributor to HOCl-mediated loss of GSH in endothelial cells. Rather, the products of the reaction were mostly exported from cells and included a peak that co-eluted with the cyclic sulfonamide that is a product of the reaction of GSH with reagent HOCl. Evidence of this species in endothelial cell supernatants after HOCl treatment was also obtained using electrospray mass spectrometry. In conclusion, exposure to HOCl causes the irreversible loss of cellular GSH with the formation of novel products that are rapidly exported from the cell, and resynthesis of GSH will be required to restore levels. The loss of GSH would alter the redox state of the cell and compromise its defenses against further oxidative stress.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 2Folkes L.K. Candeias L.P. Wardman P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A likely target for its reaction in vivo is reduced glutathione (γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine, GSH), the major low molecular weight thiol in most cells (3Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5974) Google Scholar). GSH plays a fundamental role in defending against injury induced by reactive oxygen species, as well as being an important cellular redox buffer involved in the maintenance of protein thiol groups in a reduced form (3Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5974) Google Scholar). Previous work has established that exposure to sublethal concentrations of HOCl causes a decrease in the GSH content of several cell types (4Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Carr A.C. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Tatsumi T. Fliss H. Am. J.

Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). However, the products of the reaction in endothelial cells have not been established. Oxidation of intracellular GSH by oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides generally leads to the formation of GSSG. This alters the redox state of the cell, but enzymatic reduction means that the effect is transient, and GSH is able to function as a recyclable antioxidant defense. GSH can be further oxidized to the sulfenic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acid derivatives via successive two-electron oxidations of the thiol group. Low molecular weight sulfenic acids are generally not stable (8Claiborne A. Miller H. Parsonage D. Ross R.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and although the initial product of GSH oxidation by hydrogen peroxide is the sulfenic acid, this reacts with more GSH to give GSSG. The reaction of thiols with HOCl yields an initial sulfenyl chloride, which undergoes further reactions (9Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Armesto X.L. Canle M. Fernandez M.I. Garcia M.V. Santabella J.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 1103-1109Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cysteine (when present in excess) gives nearly stoichiometric conversion to the disulfide, but with GSH, two additional stable end products have been identified (1Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 11Winterbourn C.C. Brennan S.O. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Based on their mass spectra, these have been provisionally characterized as an internal sulfonamide of GSH (Fig. 1) and an additional oxidation product of GSSG, glutathione thiosulfonate. In this study, we have investigated the products of the reaction of HOCl with GSH in HUVEC. We have found only minimal formation of GSSG and protein-mixed disulfides. Other oxidation products, including glutathione sulfonamide, were detected. They were present in the extracellular medium, indicating their rapid export from the cell. Sodium hypochlorite was supplied by Reckitt and Coleman Ltd. (Auckland, New Zealand). The concentration of HOCl was established by reaction with 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid and measurement of A412 (ε = 28200m−1·cm−1) (12Vissers M.C.M. Fantone J.C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or alternatively by using the extinction coefficient of hypochlorite ε292= 350 m−1·cm−1 at pH 10–12. GSSG was supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals New Zealand Ltd. [35S]Cysteine was supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Cell culture materials including medium 199, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. CLS type I collagenase was from Worthington, and heparin was from Fisons Pty, Ltd. (Sydney, Australia). Fibronectin was purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose (13Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma or BDH Chemicals New Zealand Ltd. (Palmerston North, New Zealand). HUVEC were isolated from umbilical cords, obtained with informed consent, by collagenase digestion (14Jaffe E. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6012) Google Scholar). They were cultured in fibronectin-coated flasks in medium 199 supplemented with fetal calf serum, heparin, endothelial cell growth supplement, penicillin, and streptomycin as in previous studies (7Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluency in 15- or 32-mm-diameter wells and used after the second or third passage. HUVEC were identified by their typical morphology including the presence of Wiebel-Palade bodies and cobblestone pattern on confluency. HOCl was diluted to working concentrations in HBSS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5.5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm magnesium, and 1.0 mm calcium) and used immediately. At this pH, HOCl and OCl− were present in approximately equimolar concentrations (pKa = 7.53), but the solution is subsequently referred to as HOCl. Confluent cells were washed in HBSS, the HOCl was added to the wells, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The 15-mm wells contained ∼120,000 cells and were treated in a 1-ml volume, whereas the 32-mm wells contained about 700,000 cells and were treated in a 2-ml volume. Glutathione species (GSH, GSSG, and glutathione sulfonic acid) were analyzed using an adaptation of the Martin and White fluorescent HPLC assay in which thiol groups were blocked with iodoacetic acid, and amine groups were derivatized with dansyl chloride (15Martin J. White I.N.H. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 568: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After exposure of cells to HOCl, the supernatants were frozen for later analysis, and adherent cells were extracted with lysing buffer (perchloric acid-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-boric acid-cresol red indicator), and 1 μmol of iodoacetic acid. Extracts were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, the pH was corrected to 8–8.5 with 1.45 m lithium hydroxide, and the samples were left for 1 h in the dark at 25 °C. An equal volume of 4 mg/ml dansyl chloride in acetonitrile was then added, and the samples were incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 30–60 min. Following chloroform extraction, samples were separated by HPLC using a 5-μm NH2 silica LiChrospher column (E Merck, Alltech). Detection was with a Jasco FP-920 fluorescent detector with excitation and emission wavelengths of 328 and 542 nm, respectively. Concentrations of GSH, GSSG, and glutathione sulfonic acid in cell samples were calculated by comparing their peak areas to a series of standards of known concentrations. Fresh reagents were made up before each assay was performed. HUVEC grown in 15- or 32-mm wells were preincubated with medium that lacked sulfur-containing amino acids for 2 h and then incubated with 20 μm cycloheximide for 1 h in the same medium. Following this, the cells were loaded with [35S]cysteine (2.5 μCi/ml; specific activity of 1075 Ci/mmol) in the presence of cycloheximide for 2–3 h, again in the deficient medium, as described by Thomas et al. (16Thomas J.A. Chai Y.C. Jung C.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cells were washed in HBSS with 1% bovine serum albumin to remove any residual radioactivity, followed by HBSS alone. After treatment with HOCl, the supernatant was removed, and the cellular protein was precipitated with ice-cold 5% perchloric acid. An aliquot was removed to represent the total intracellular counts. The protein was pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice in ice-cold ether, and resuspended in 1% SDS for counting. Alternatively, to determine the proportion of labeled GSH bound to protein as mixed disulfides, cell pellets were suspended in 20 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mm MOPS, pH 8.5, for 1 h at room temperature to release the GSH. After centrifugation, the protein was reprecipitated with ice-cold 5% perchloric acid and resuspended in 1% SDS. Bray's scintillant was added to each of the fractions, and the radioactivity was determined. The 35S-labeled components of the extracellular supernatant and intracellular low molecular weight fraction were separated by HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column with 50 mm formic acid as eluant (11Winterbourn C.C. Brennan S.O. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Samples were spiked with GSH and GSSG, and the fractions were collected every 0.25 min for scintillation counting. The retention times of the labeled peaks were compared with those of the products of the oxidation of GSH by HOCl. To obtain sufficient material for analysis, HUVEC were grown in 75-cm2 flasks and treated with HOCl (260 μm) in a volume of 8 ml. For control and treated cells, supernatants from two flasks were pooled and fractionated to remove salt and enrich them with glutathione sulfonamide, using two consecutive HPLC procedures. After centrifugation to remove debris and concentration by freeze drying, samples were first applied to a Superdex peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with water as the eluant. Fractions eluting in the tripeptide position (calibrated with GSH) were concentrated by freeze drying and then applied to a C18 Nucleosil column with 50 mm formic acid as eluant. Fractions eluting in the position expected for glutathione sulfonamide were collected, concentrated by freeze drying, and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry was performed in negative ion mode on a VG Platform II mass spectrometer. Samples were in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% NH4OH. The source temperature was 60 °C, the probe voltage was −3000 V, and the cone voltage was −70 V. Scans from 200 to 700 m/z were acquired every 2 s. We have previously characterized the effects of exposure of HUVEC to HOCl (7Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). With an oxidant dose of between 5 and 50 nmol of HOCl/1.2 × 105 cells, there is progressive loss of cell viability, oxidation of cell thiols, and inactivation of susceptible thiol enzymes, particularly glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Doses of 25 nmol and less are sublethal, although there is significant oxidation of cell thiols including GSH at these doses. In the current study we have used similar doses of oxidant. Exposure of HUVEC to HOCl for 10 min caused a concentration-dependent loss of intracellular GSH. A small amount of GSH present in the medium was also oxidized (Fig. 2 A). When the cells were analyzed for products, small increases in intracellular GSSG were seen with 35 and 50 nmol of HOCl (Fig. 2 B). Glutathione sulfonic acid was undetectable in control cells. Levels were increased at 50 nmol of HOCl but only to a small extent (Fig. 2 B). Extracellular GSSG and glutathione sulfonic acid were not increased with HOCl treatment (data not shown). Therefore, neither GSSG nor glutathione sulfonic acid accounted for the majority of the observed GSH loss. To investigate the fate of endothelial GSH after exposure to HOCl, intact cells were incubated with [35S]cysteine in the presence of cycloheximide to label the cellular GSH pool. Analysis of control cells by HPLC and scintillation counting indicated that there was almost complete incorporation of the cysteine into GSH (data not shown). Upon fractionation, 81% of the total counts were intracellular, of which 12% were in the protein fraction and 69% were in the low molecular weight fraction. The remaining counts were extracellular. After exposure to increasing concentrations of HOCl, there was a progressive increase in extracellular counts and a corresponding decrease in the intracellular low molecular weight fraction (Fig. 3). The decrease was significant at 25 nmol of HOCl and closely paralleled the loss of GSH shown in Fig. 2. With 50 nmol of HOCl, more than half the counts were extracellular. The increased extracellular counts were not the result of cell lysis, because there was no significant release of51Cr at this time with these amounts of HOCl (7Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). A very small increase in protein-bound counts occurred with increasing doses of HOCl; this became statistically significant at 50 nmol of HOCl (Fig.3). To determine whether the protein-associated counts representedS-thiolation and could be removed by reduction, protein extracts were treated with DTT. In control cells, 64% of the counts were released (a decrease in protein-associated counts from 12 to 4% of the total), representing the basal level of S-thiolation. The released counts remained relatively constant with increasing concentrations of HOCl (Fig. 4), indicating that there was minimal S-thiolation of endothelial cell protein. At the highest HOCl concentration tested (50 nmol), an increase in DTT-released counts above control levels is suggested but did not reach statistical significance. The 35S-labeled components of the extracellular supernatant and the intracellular low molecular weight fraction were separated by HPLC, and the elution profiles of labeled material compared with that of HOCl-treated GSH. As shown previously (11Winterbourn C.C. Brennan S.O. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the reaction of GSH with HOCl gave two novel products in addition to GSSG (Fig. 5 A). The sulfonamide (337 peak) eluted at ∼5 min, immediately prior to GSH at 6.5 min. The thiolsulfonate (644 Da) ran as a shoulder on the GSH peak, eluting at about 8 min. Analysis of the intracellular fraction for control endothelial cells gave a large peak corresponding to GSH, a small broad peak at the breakthrough position, and no detectable GSSG (Fig. 5 B). Treatment with HOCl resulted in an almost complete loss of GSH, a small increase in counts eluting in the position of GSSG, and a small peak at 5.5 min (Fig. 5 B). The extracellular fraction from control cells gave a small peak corresponding to GSH and no other labeled peaks (Fig. 5 C). HOCl treatment of cells resulted in several new peaks, one of which migrated in the position of glutathione sulfonamide (Fig.5 C). There were also significant increases in counts in the breakthrough peak at 3–5 min and two additional new peaks, eluting between 8 and 11 min. These peaks were not further characterized. Experiments were performed with a range of HOCl concentrations, and the percentage distribution of the radiolabeled peaks was calculated as a fraction of the total extracellular soluble counts. For these experiments, it was necessary to grow cells in larger wells to obtain sufficient material to analyze. Under these conditions, the cells were more sensitive to HOCl, with lower concentrations causing greater toxicity and greater GSH loss. To determine the relative proportions of radiolabeled peaks, HOCl concentrations were used that gave GSH losses of 45–90%. After exposure to HOCl, up to 25% of counts are present in the peak that co-elutes with the sulfonamide, increasing from about 5% in control cells (Fig. 6). The early peak increased to about 20% of total counts. The two unknowns that elute between 8 and 11 min were combined for analysis. These peaks account for up to 40% of the total extracellular counts after HOCl exposure. Electrospray mass spectrometry was used to seek further evidence for the presence of glutathione sulfonamide in endothelial cell supernatants. Pure GSH gave the characteristic signal corresponding to [M − H] atm/z 306 in negative ion mode (Fig.7 a), and glutathione sulfonamide prepared from GSH and HOCl gave a major signal at m/z 336.3 (Fig. 7 b). Following a two-step procedure designed to enrich for the sulfonamide, the supernatant from HOCl-treated endothelial cells also gave a signal at m/z 336.3–336.4 (Fig.7 d). Although comparatively weak, this was the strongest signal in the sample. The supernatant from identically treated control cells gave no equivalent peak (Fig. 7 c). There was a peak of about one-third the size at m/z 337.1. On repeated injection this signal was consistently 0.7 mass units higher than the major peak in the treated cells and aligned with a shoulder on this peak. On this basis we conclude that only the HOCl-treated endothelial cells gave a signal at the correct m/z for glutathione sulfonamide. We have previously shown that sublethal concentrations of HOCl, either added as a reagent or generated by myeloperoxidase, cause a significant loss of GSH in cultured endothelial cells (7Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the products of the reaction has given unexpected results. Very little GSSG was measurable either intracellularly or extracellularly, accounting for only a few percentages of the GSH lost. Glutathione sulfonic acid was also a minor product. By labeling the GSH pool with35S, we recovered much of the label lost from HOCl-treated cells in the extracellular medium. This was not the result of cell lysis or leakage from the cells. Several major products were detected by HPLC, predominantly in the cell supernatant. One of these would appear to be glutathione sulfonamide. At least two other products were observed but not identified. The sulfonamide is a unique product that has only been described for GSH oxidation by HOCl. Evidence for its presence in HUVEC comes from two sources. HPLC separation of 35S-labeled products in the cell supernatant gave a labeled peak eluting at the same time as the sulfonamide synthesized from pure GSH. Also, a species with the predicted molecular mass was detected by electrospray mass spectrometry in the supernatant from HOCl-treated but not control cells. Although the signal was small, in combination with the 35S data, these findings provide a strong basis for concluding that glutathione sulfonamide is formed in endothelial cells treated with HOCl and represents about 25% of the extracellular counts with HOCl treatment. Two other HPLC peaks, eluting after GSH and present in the extracellular medium, constituted the other major GSH oxidation products, about 40% of the total extracellular counts with HOCl treatment. They escaped detection by the dansyl chloride assay, which implies that, like the sulfonamide, they lack the amine group required for derivatization. Whether they are related to the sulfonamide or contain chloramine groups remains to be explored. Other labeled products were seen in the breakthrough peak on HPLC. Although glutathione sulfonic acid elutes in this position, it was detected by the dansyl chloride method only intracellularly at the higher HOCl concentrations and is unlikely to be a major contributor to this peak. Pure thiols are oxidized by HOCl to a mixture of products. The initial product is the sulfenyl chloride that can react with more thiol to give the disulfide or be oxidized further (8Claiborne A. Miller H. Parsonage D. Ross R.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Armesto X.L. Canle M. Fernandez M.I. Garcia M.V. Santabella J.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 1103-1109Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Silverstein R.M. Hager L.P. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GSH forms a mixture of predominantly GSSG and the sulfonamide, which is presumed to form via condensation of the sulfenyl chloride with the α-amino group (11Winterbourn C.C. Brennan S.O. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). On this basis, if the sulfonamide were formed in cells, we would also expect to see GSSG. The reason only low amounts of GSSG were detected could be that enzymatic reduction prevents its accumulation. Alternatively, the sulfenyl chloride could have a different fate in a cellular environment. HOCl caused only minimal S-thiolation of cell proteins. Protein-associated counts increased only slightly at the highest dose, and the proportion released with dithiothreitol was similarly increased only at the highest HOCl dose. We have previously reported that up to half of endothelial cell protein thiols are lost under the conditions of HOCl treatment used in the present study (7Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). Although our results cannot discount a contribution of S-thiolation, perhaps of specific proteins, most of this protein thiol loss must be due to other mechanisms. The limited S-thiolation seen with HOCl may be explained on the basis of the minimal GSSG accumulation and restricted capacity for thiol/disulfide exchange. These results contrast with the accumulation of substantial amounts of glutathionylated proteins in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides (18Schuppe I. Moldeus P. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Chai Y.-C. Hendrich S. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). S-Thiolation is considered to be one of the mechanisms whereby these oxidants exert a regulatory effect on cell function (20Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that at the doses used in the current study, HOCl can activate pathways leading to p53 activation, growth arrest, and apoptosis (21Vile G.F. Rothwell L.A. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Vile G.F. Rothwell L.A. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem.

Our results suggest that S-thiolation may not play a major role in the activation of these processes by HOCl. Our findings with endothelial cells are very similar to those with neutrophils (5Carr A.C. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The addition of HOCl or stimulation of the neutrophils to produce endogenous HOCl from myeloperoxidase caused a loss of GSH without GSSG formation and little evidence of S-thiolation.35S labeling also showed a peak in the position of the sulfonamide, which was predominantly extracellular and accounted for about 20% of the GSH loss. It is notable that glutathione sulfonamide and the other major products of the reaction of endothelial cell GSH with HOCl were detected predominantly in the extracellular medium within the 10-min treatment time. It is likely that the majority of the reaction occurred intracellularly. The small amount of GSH present in the medium of resting cells was insufficient to account for the product formed, and the HOCl concentrations used caused an insignificant release of cell constituents in that time (7Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1505-H1512PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the detection of some sulfonamide in cell extracts points to an intracellular origin. It appears, therefore, that the cells have an efficient transport mechanism for exporting these glutathione oxidation products. This may provide protection for the cells, although this possibility remains to be explored. However, the irreversible formation and export of these oxidation products mean that with HOCl, GSH does not function as a recyclable antioxidant. As a consequence the ability of GSH to provide protection against ongoing oxidative stress is diminished and can only be restored by glutathione resynthesis. The altered redox buffering of the cells also has implications for their responses to regulatory signals. In addition to understanding the impact of reactive oxidants on cell function, it is important to have reliable biomarkers for detecting oxidant formation and its consequences in vivo. Our findings both with endothelial cells and neutrophils suggest that glutathione sulfonamide is a promising candidate for a biomarker of HOCl production by neutrophils in vivo. The reaction with GSH is one of the fastest observed for HOCl (2Folkes L.K. Candeias L.P. Wardman P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), making GSH a likely major target for HOCl in vivo. The detection of glutathione sulfonamide as a significant product in both neutrophils and HUVEC and its rapid release from the cells after HOCl exposure suggests it may be present in urine or blood. Further work is needed, however, to establish whether the sulfonamide is indeed unique to HOCl, to determine whether it can be detected with high sensitivity, and to define its biological properties.

https://openalex.org/W2086421549,"Insulin regulates the inclusion of the exon encoding protein kinase C (PKC) βII mRNA. In this report, we show that insulin regulates this exon inclusion (alternative splicing) via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) signaling pathway through the phosphorylation state of SRp40, a factor required for insulin-regulated splice site selection for PKCβII mRNA. By taking advantage of a well known inhibitor of PI 3–kinase, LY294002, we demonstrated that pretreatment of L6 myotubes with LY294002 blocked insulin-induced PKCβII exon inclusion as well as phosphorylation of SRp40. In the absence of LY294002, overexpression of SRp40 in L6 cells mimicked insulin-induced exon inclusion. When antisense oligonucleotides targeted to a putative SRp40-binding sequence in the βII-βI intron were transfected into L6 cells, insulin effects on splicing and glucose uptake were blocked. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role for SRp40 in insulin-mediated alternative splicing independent of changes in SRp40 concentration but dependent on serine phosphorylation of SRp40 via a PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. This switch in PKC isozyme expression is important for increases in the glucose transport effect of insulin. Significantly, insulin regulation of PKCβII exon inclusion occurred in the absence of cell growth and differentiation demonstrating that insulin-induced alternative splicing of PKCβII mRNA in L6 cells occurs in response to a metabolic change."

Recent evidence links WASP and related proteins to actin polymerization by the Arp2/3 complex. To study whether the role of WASP in actin polymerization is coupled to T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated transcriptional activation, we made a series of WASP deletion mutants and tested them for actin co-localization, actin polymerization, and transcriptional activation of NFAT. A WASP mutant with a deletion in the C-terminal region (WASPΔC) that is defective in actin polymerization potentiated NFAT transcription following TCR activation by anti-CD3 and anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, but not by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin. Furthermore, cotransfection of a dominant-active mutant (WASP-WH2-C) for Arp2/3 polymerization did not inhibit NFAT activation. Finally, by analyzing a series of WASP double-domain deletion mutants, we determined that the WASP homology-1 domain is responsible for NFAT transcriptional activation.

Similar cellular abnormalities are observed in WASP−/− mice, including impaired antigen receptor-induced activation and cytoskeletal rearrangements (6Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S. Mizoguchi E. Cohen P.

These include a GTPase-binding domain (GBD); a polyproline-rich region capable of binding Src homology 3 (SH3) domains; two conserved domains, WH1 and WH2, postulated to be involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton; and a conserved acidic carboxyl-terminal domain that associates with the Arp2/3 complex (3Abo A.

The modular organization of these domains is known to be shared by several proteins, suggesting that a conserved family of related proteins exists (9Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T.

The presence of a binding domain for activated Cdc42 suggests that WASP may provide a link between Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton. We have previously shown that overexpression of WASP in different cell types has a profound effect on Cdc42-regulated actin polymerization (8Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Franke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Cdc42 has been implicated in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in many cell types and has also been shown to play a role in polarization of the T-cell cytoskeleton during antigen presentation (13Stowers L. Yelon D. Berg L.J. Chant J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5027-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which WASP regulates actin polymerization is not known. Recent findings indicate that the carboxyl terminus of WASP, including the WH2 domain and acidic residues (referred to as the WH2-C domain; also known as the verprolin/cofilin/acidic domain), enhances nucleation of actin filaments by the Arp2/3 complex (12Higgs H.H. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 14Machesky L.M. Mullins R.D. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Moreover, introduction of the WH2-C domain into Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells is sufficient to block membrane ruffling and to disrupt Arp2/3 localization (12Higgs H.H. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 15Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Although the WH2-C motif is required for actin nucleation by Arp2/3, other WASP domains may also play a role in regulating this activity. Structural and biochemical analyses suggest that the WH2-C domain of WASP interacts with the Arp2/3 complex only when both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) and Cdc42 bind to WASP (16Sechi A.S. Wehland J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3685-3695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The restriction of WASP expression to hematopoietic cells, as well as studies of T-cells from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients and WASP-deficient mice, indicates that WASP function is vital for T-cells (6Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S. Mizoguchi E. Cohen P. Khan W. Liu C. Hagermann T.L. Kwan S. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Bhan A.K. Alt F.

Although WASP has been shown to play a role in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and transcriptional activation, the specific function of WASP in T-cells remains unknown. T-cells from Vav−/− mice show many similarities to T-cells from WASP−/− mice, including impaired proliferative responses and defective TCR capping following TCR/CD3 engagement (18Holsinger L.J.

These findings suggest that the proliferative defects of WASP- and Vav-deficient T-cells result from inactivation of a common signaling pathway. These studies also suggest that assembly of the actin cytoskeleton, receptor clustering, and capping may have a direct role in connecting signals originating at the TCR to downstream IL-2 transcription (18Holsinger L.J.

To characterize the role of WASP in T-cell activation and to test the hypothesis that actin polymerization and transcriptional activation are functionally linked, we mapped the domains within WASP required for each of these processes. Our results demonstrate that regulation of actin polymerization by WASP is independent of its role in TCR-mediated transcriptional activation. Furthermore, deletional analysis reveals a distinct region of WASP, the WH1 domain, that is required for NFAT-dependent IL-2 transcription.

WASPΔWH1 (deletion of amino acids 1–146) was made by subcloning theStuI-EcoRV fragment into a blunt XbaI site of the same vector. WASPΔPPr (deletion of amino acids 310–420) was made by removing the KasI-BanI fragment containing the proline-rich region. WASPΔWH2 (deletion of amino acids 423–449) was a gift from Dan Kalman (University of California, San Francisco). WASPΔWH1ΔC, WASPΔGBDΔC, and WASPΔPPrΔC double-domain deletion mutants were all constructed by introducing a C-terminal nucleotide deletion at position 1364 (polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis) in each of the various single-domain deletion mutant constructs, resulting in a frameshift and generation of a stop codon at position 444. Production of the correct truncated protein in transfected cells was verified by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (M2). pRK5-MycWASP-WH2-C was a gift from Dr. Laura Machesky. Microinjections and immunofluorescence microscopy were carried out as previously described (20Belisle B. Abo A. J. Biol.

PAE cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum were plated on coverslips. Expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged WASP constructs diluted to a concentration of 50 ng/ml in injection buffer (5 mm potassium glutamate and 130 mm KCl) were microinjected into the nuclei of >100 subconfluent PAE cells. Injected cells were incubated for 4–6 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated in the presence of primary monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies for 60 min. Coverslips were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min with secondary Alexa 350-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated phalloidin to visualize F-actin and with Texas Red-conjugated DNase I to visualize G-actin. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out on a Zeiss Axiophot 100 with appropriate filters for fluorescence detection. Jurkat cells (1 × 107) were cotransfected by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarads) with FLAG-tagged WASP-WT, WASP mutants, or vector control (pEF vector, 20 μg) and a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene driven by the NFAT-responsive element (20 μg). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 500 ng/ml soluble anti-CD3 antibody (UCHT1), anti-CD3 plus 500 ng/ml anti-CD28 (CD28.2) antibodies, or 25 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1 μm ionomycin for 5 h in the presence or absence of 1 μm latrunculin A or 10 μm cytochalasin D (where indicated). Cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity. Each graph represents the mean of at least three independent experiments. Error bars represent the S.D. of these experiments. Equal expression levels of full-length FLAG-tagged WASP and WASP mutants were verified by immunoblotting lysates with anti-FLAG epitope tag antibody. To derive WASPΔC cell lines, Jurkat cells were transfected with WASP and WASPΔC plasmids by electroporation as in the transient transfection procedure. Briefly, Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation at 250 V and 960 microfarads in 0.4-cm cuvettes with mammalian expression constructs (20 μg) all in the pEF vector. Cells (1 × 107) were transfected with WASP-WT, the WASPΔC mutant, or the pEF vector control (20 μg). Electroporated cells were transferred to a 10-cm dish containing 20 ml of prewarmed fresh RPMI 1640 medium. The cell suspension (100 μl) was transferred to a flat-bottom 96-well plate and incubated overnight. Transfected cells were then selected 18–24 h post-transfection with 1 mg/ml G418 for 2–3 weeks. The medium was changed every 3–4 days, and positive clones (those occupying >50% of the wells) were expanded into 12-well plates containing selection medium. Positive clones were then confirmed by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using anti-FLAG antibody. Each graph represents the average of at least three separate experiments. The relative luciferase activity described in Figs.

Cells were cytospun onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. To visualize the CD3 complex or polymerized actin, the slides were incubated with anti-CD3 antibody or Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes), respectively. The anti-CD3 antibody was detected with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Fluorescence photomicroscopy was carried out on a Zeiss Axiophot with appropriate filter sets for epifluorescence detection of FITC or Texas Red signals. Cells were resuspended in staining buffer (PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.05% NaN3). WASPΔC and parent T-cell lines (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 30 min on ice with anti-CD3 antibody (1 μg/ml) or isotype-matched control IgG antibody and then washed and incubated for an additional 30 min on ice with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1 μg/ml). Cells were warmed to 37 °C and incubated for 60 min, followed by fixation for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Stained cells were analyzed using a FACSCaliburTM with CellQuestTM software (Becton Dickinson). Parent vector control and WASPΔC stable cells (1 × 106/ml) were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody (1 μg/ml), pervanadate (0.02 mm), or PMA/ionomycin. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, suspended in SDS sample buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes was blocked in 5% skim milk-containing PBS and then incubated with anti-phospho-ERK antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.). After washing, the membranes were incubated with a secondary mouse antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. Protein bands were subsequently detected with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Given the multifunctional domain structure of WASP and its role in both signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization, WASP likely represents a critical player that coordinates receptor-mediated signaling pathways with the actin cytoskeleton. Although WASP regulates both cytoskeletal reorganization and transcriptional activation, it is not clear whether TCR-mediated transcriptional activation by WASP is controlled by a pathway that is independent of WASP-Arp2/3-directed actin polymerization. To determine whether the role of WASP in actin polymerization is directly coupled to TCR-mediated transcription, we generated a series of WASP deletion mutants and compared their functions in actin polymerization and transcriptional activation assays. We previously showed that overexpression of WASP-WT in PAE cells induces WASP clustering that co-localizes with polymerized actin (8Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Franke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). To map the region of WASP that is essential for WASP clustering and association with F-actin (polymerized) or G-actin (monomeric), we microinjected epitope-tagged WASP DNA constructs into PAE cells and immunostained for WASP, G-actin, and F-actin (Figs. 1 and2). WASP-WT-expressing cells had large extended cluster formations of both F-actin and G-actin that co-localized with WASP (Fig.2 A). Similar results were obtained for cells microinjected with the WASPΔGBD or WASPΔWH2 mutant (Fig. 2 A). This is in contrast to a recent report that described a role for the WH2 domain in actin polymerization and co-clustering with WASP (21Kato M. Miki H. Imai K. Nonoyama S. Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is possible that at higher levels of WASP expression, the WH2 domain is not required for actin polymerization.Figure 2Localization of WASP-WT and deletion mutants with F-actin and G-actin in PAE cells. A, PAE cells were microinjected with plasmids coding for FLAG-tagged WASP or WASP deletion mutants, incubated for 4–6 h, fixed, and stained for immunofluorescence. The fluorescence micrographs compare anti-FLAG antibody (for expression), phalloidin (F-actin), and DNase I (G-actin).B, PAE cells were microinjected with a series of plasmids coding for FLAG-tagged WASP double-domain deletion mutants lacking the WH1, GBD, or PPr domain in a WASPΔC background. Cells were treated as described for A. C, PAE cells were co-injected with the pEF vector control and green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid constructs and treated as described forA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells expressing WASPΔC had punctate staining throughout the cytoplasm and co-localization of WASPΔC with G-actin clusters (Fig.2 A). No F-actin clustering or polymerization was observed in any of the cells expressing WASPΔC. Recombinant WASPΔC was also inactive in in vitro pyrene-actin polymerization assays (data not shown). These results suggest that the C-terminal 59 amino acids are essential for actin polymerization, whereas the remaining 443 amino acids retain the ability to co-localize with monomeric actin. Our results, like those of Machesky et al. (14Machesky L.M. Mullins R.D. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 15Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), indicate that the Arp2/3-interacting domain of WASP is critical for actin polymerization. Cells microinjected with the WASPΔWH1 or WASPΔPPr DNA construct had a diffuse pattern of WASP staining (Fig. 2 A). These two mutant proteins were detected throughout the cytoplasm and were not co-localized with G-actin or F-actin clusters. Although our data suggest that these regions are essential for WASP co-clustering and co-localization with actin, the microinjection method may not fully detect polymerized actin by a mutant that is defective in clustering. Therefore, co-clustering of WASP with actin may be required for polymerization. Since the WASPΔC mutant retains the ability to cluster G-actin, it is likely that the region(s) responsible for clustering actin monomers resides in one or more of the remaining domains. To further map the domain(s) on WASP required for G-actin co-localization and clustering, we constructed a series of WASP double-domain deletion mutants lacking the WH1, GBD, or PPr domain in a WASPΔC background. As shown in Fig. 2 B, WASPΔWH1ΔC failed to cluster and co-localize with G-actin. In contrast, WASPΔPPrΔC and WASPΔGBDΔC were able to cluster or co-localize with G-actin like the WASPΔC mutant. These data indicate that the WH1 domain is necessary for G-actin co-localization and co-clustering with WASP. Our results also indicate that WASP clustering and G-actin clustering are linked to each other, in contrast to results reported by Kato et al. (21Kato M. Miki H. Imai K. Nonoyama S. Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The discrepancies between our findings and those of Katoet al. may be due either to different expression methods used (i.e. microinjection versus transient transfection) or to cell type variations. Recent studies with WASP-deficient T-cells suggest that WASP links T-cell receptor engagement to cytoskeletal reorganization, receptor clustering, and cap assembly (6Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S.

Deletion of the WASP gene has been shown to impair T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and IL-2 transcription (6Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S. Mizoguchi E. Cohen P. Khan W. Liu C. Hagermann T.L.

Although numerous studies have suggested a role for WASP in actin reorganization and transcriptional activation, it is not clear whether these two functions are directly linked by WASP. To investigate the role of WASP in TCR-mediated transcriptional activation, Jurkat T-cells were cotransfected with either WASP or WASP deletion mutants and a reporter gene driven by the NFAT-responsive element. Transfected Jurkat cells stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 antibody revealed a selective 8–10-fold enhancement of activation of NFAT-dependent transcription by the C-terminally truncated WASPΔC mutant (Fig.3, A and B), but not by any other mutants (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were seen when cells were stimulated with antibodies cross-linking both CD3 and CD28 (Fig. 3 C). No statistically significant differences between the various WASP mutants were observed in cells stimulated with soluble stimuli such as PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 3 D). Enhancement of NFAT activity was also observed in stable Jurkat cell lines expressing the WASPΔC mutant (Fig. 3, F andG). Moreover, ERK phosphorylation was significantly increased in the WASPΔC cell line over vector control following stimulation with either anti-CD3 antibody or pervanadate, but not with PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 3 H). ERK phosphorylation in the WASP-WT cell line was comparable to that in the vector control cell line (data not shown). These results indicate that enhancement of transcriptional activation by WASPΔC is dependent on proximal signals coming from the TCR, but independent of CD28 co-stimulation or downstream signaling events initiated by PMA and ionomycin. These data are consistent with previous reports describing T-cells from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients and WASP-deficient mice that suggest the defect is downstream of early TCR activation in that all defined signaling pathways appear to be intact (5Molina I.J.

Furthermore, IκBα phosphorylation and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, p38 kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways also appear intact in these cells (7Zhang J.

These data suggest that WASP may function as a cytoskeletal scaffold, integrating one or more of these pathways and thereby overcoming an activation threshold by assembling receptors and signaling molecules at the cap. To rule out the possibility that WASPΔC acts in a dominant-negative way to block TCR- and WASP-mediated actin polymerization, we examined the induction of TCR capping and internalization in the WASPΔC stable cell line. It was previously shown that WASP−/− cells are defective in actin-mediated TCR capping and internalization (7Zhang J. Shehabeldin A. da Cruz L.A.G. Butler J. Somani A. McGavin M. Kozieradzki I. dos Santos A.O. Nagy A. Grinstein S. Penninger J.M. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1329-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Normal ligand-induced capping was observed in our WASPΔC cell line as visualized by immunofluorescence using anti-CD3 antibody (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, TCR-mediated actin recruitment and polymerization at the cap were not affected in the WASPΔC cell line. In contrast, treating cells with the actin inhibitor cytochalasin D completely blocked receptor capping and actin polymerization. These data suggest that WASPΔC does not act in a dominant-negative way to block actin polymerization and receptor capping during T-cell activation. To rule out the possibility that NFAT activation by WASPΔC may be a consequence of aberrant TCR internalization, we tested the rate of receptor endocytosis in WASPΔC and control cell lines. Comparable TCR internalization was detected in stable Jurkat T-cell lines expressing WASP-WT, WASPΔC, or vector control (Fig. 4 B). The potentiation of NFAT activation by WASPΔC may result from stimulation of a novel signal transduction pathway (19Penninenger J.M. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is possible that this mutant interacts with an unidentified protein(s) that normally associates with activated endogenous WASP. In this model, WASP may exist in one of two activation states (17Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 22Abdul-Manan N.

Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). It was recently proposed that in the inactive state, the acidic C terminus of WASP interacts with the basic region immediately upstream of the GBD (22Abdul-Manan N. Aghazadeh B. Liu G.A. Majumdar A. Ouerfelli O. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1999; 399: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 23Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A.

Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Binding of Cdc42·GTP therefore relieves this interaction, opening the molecule to allow multiple protein complexes to form. It has recently been suggested that WASP normally exists in an autoinhibited state similar to that observed in the structurally related Cdc42 effector, PAK1 (23Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 403-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In both cases, it has been shown that the N-terminal half of the molecule interacts with the C terminus, thereby sequestering protein activity. We hypothesized that the NFAT potentiation observed with the C-terminally truncated WASPΔC mutant might be due to a loss of this autoinhibition. To determine which of the remaining regions of WASP is responsible for enhanced transcriptional activation, a series of WASP double-domain deletion mutants were constructed in a WASPΔC background (Fig. 1). Jurkat T-cells were then cotransfected with WASPΔC or WASPΔC double-domain deletion mutants and a reporter gene driven by the NFAT-responsive element. Cells transfected with WASPΔGBDΔC or WASPΔPPrΔC and stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody exhibited enhanced activation of the NFAT reporter by 8- and 7-fold, respectively (Fig.5 A). Cells transfected with the WASPΔWH1ΔC mutant and stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody did not enhance NFAT activation, suggesting that the WH1 domain is required for activation (Fig. 5 A). In agreement with these results, a recent study showed that WASP-interacting protein (WIP) and Vav synergize to enhance NFAT-dependent transcription (25Savoy D.N. Billadeau D.D. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2866-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). WIP was previously shown to interact with the WH1 domain of WASP, and WIP-dependent NFAT activation requires the WASP-interacting region on WIP. (25Savoy D.N. Billadeau D.D. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2866-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although our result clearly suggests that the WH1 domain is required for transcriptional activation, we were unable to effect NFAT activation with the WH1 domain alone (data not shown). These results indicate that the WH1 domain is required but not sufficient for transcriptional activation. In addition, it is possible that the dominant-negative or dominant-positive effects could not be achieved due to misfolding or mislocalization of the expressed WH1 protein. Numerous signaling proteins have been shown to interact both directly and indirectly with the WH1 domain, including WIP and the SH3 domain-containing proteins Nck, Fyn, Vav, and Grb2 (3Abo A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of these interactions remains unknown. The WH1-related domain EVH1 is structurally similar to the pleckstrin homology domain, containing a binding pocket for polyproline sequences and basic residues (27Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E. Gertler F. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Callebaut I. Cossart P. Dehoux P.

Cell. 1999; 97: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). WH1 and EVH1 domains derived from different proteins were found to bind proline-rich peptides with a specific sequence motif (27Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E. Gertler F. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Prehoda K.E. Lee D.J. Lim W.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For instance, WASP was shown to bind the proline-rich peptide DFPPPPTDEEL derived from ActA (30Prehoda K.E. Lee D.J. Lim W.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The function of the proteins containing the WH1 domain implies that this region acts to couple signaling pathways to actin polymerization. Our results are consistent with such a hypothesis. WASPΔC did not polymerize actin, but did activate NFAT. It is possible that endogenous levels of WASP effected polymerization and subsequent transcriptional activation. To determine whether activation of NFAT by WASPΔC is linked to WASP-directed actin polymerization, Jurkat T-cells were cotransfected with WASPΔC and WASP-WH2-C, a WASP mutant shown to be dominant-active for WASP-Arp2/3-directed polymerization (Fig.6, A and B) (31Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Coexpression of WASPΔC with WASP-WH2-C had little or no effect on NFAT activation (Fig. 6 A). This suggests that the ability of WASP to regulate IL-2 transcription can be uncoupled from its role in actin polymerization. Several recent studies have linked cytoskeletal rearrangement to signals originating from the TCR leading to downstream IL-2 transcription (3Abo A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Penninenger J.M. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the contribution of WASP-Arp2/3-directed actin polymerization to the process of transcriptional activation of T-cells is marginal. To further address whether the actin cytoskeleton plays a role in WASPΔC activation of transcription, Jurkat T-cells were cotransfected with WASPΔC and the reporter gene driven by the NFAT-responsive element, followed by treatment with an actin inhibitor (latrunculin A or cytochalasin D). Transcriptional activation of NFAT by WASPΔC following anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/CD28 antibody stimulation was reduced by ∼50% with both agents (Fig. 6, C and D). In addition, no statistically significant changes were observed in latrunculin A- or cytochalasin D-treated cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin (Fig.6, C and D). This confirms that TCR-mediated transcriptional activation of NFAT by WASPΔC requires an intact actin cytoskeleton. In summary, we have identified the WH1 domain of WASP as an important domain required for TCR-mediated NFAT transcriptional activation in T-cells. We demonstrated, by use of a dominant-active mutant for actin polymerization (WASP-WH2-C), that this potentiation is independent of WASP-Arp2/3-directed actin polymerization. Our data suggest that the regulation of IL-2 transcription by WASP can be uncoupled from its role in actin polymerization. The model in Fig.7 describes a pivotal role for WASP in integrating signals to activate both transcription and actin polymerization. During TCR stimulation, activated Cdc42 binds to the GBD of WASP to relieve intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. The active form of WASP can then deliver simultaneously at least two signals through two different domains. The C terminus interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to initiate actin polymerization, and the WH1 domain binds to unknown protein(s), possibly WIP, to initiate transcriptional activation. We thank Drs.

Although the ER localization of PS dovetails with the former data, others have suggested that Golgi may be related to the abnormal effect of mt PS1 to increase Aβ42 (39Xia W. Zhang J.

Furthermore, subdomains in βAPP proteins that are required for this interaction with mt PS to increase production of Aβ42 have not been definitively identified. In this study, we studied the intracellular compartment and intramolecular subdomain of βAPP that are relevant to the abnormal effects of mutant PS2 to affect γ-cleavage and increase production of Aβ42. For these purposes, we expressed modified forms of a C-terminal fragment of βAPP tagged with targeting signals to specific compartments or harboring deletion of defined cytoplasmic subdomains. We show here that TGN and other late intracellular compartments are the major sites where mt PS2 up-regulates Aβ42 production and that the cytoplasmic domain of βAPP is dispensable for the overproduction of Aβ42 caused by mt PS2. A cDNA encoding the C- terminal 99 amino acids of βAPP fused to a signal peptide for rat preproenkephalin cDNA (C100) was previously described (32Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K.

Usami M. Yoshikawa K. Nature. 1990; 347: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). C100 peptides tagged with sorting signals to ER or TGN were generated using a C100 cDNA constructed in mammalian vector p91023 as a template. Briefly, oligonucleotides encoding the rat preproenkephalin signal peptide were used as a sense polymerase chain reaction primer: 5′-TTTAAGCTTCCACCATGGCGCAGTTCCTG-3′. The following oligonucleotides encoding the last four C-terminal amino acid residues of C100 (i.e. QMQN) followed by the signal sequences KKLN (for ER) or SDYQRL (for TGN) (42Peraus G.C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7714-7724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used as antisense polymerase chain reaction primers: 5′-CCCGGATCCCTAATTCAGATTATTGTTCTGCATCTG-3′ for C100/ER, 5′-CCCGGATCCCTAGAGCCGCTGATAATCGAAGTTCTGCATCTG-3′ for C100/TGN, and 5′-AAAGGATCCCTAGTTCTGCATCTG-3′ for C100 (without signal motif). Amplification of cDNAs was performed using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Strategene). Amplified DNA fragments were digested withHindIII and BamHI and ligated into a pcDNA3.1-Hygro vector (Invitrogen). βAPP695 tagged with KKLN or SDYQRL motifs were constructed by ligating theEcoRI/XbaI fragments of tagged C100 with those of βAPP695 cDNA in pcDNA3. cDNAs encoding C-terminally truncated C100 (i.e.C100/stop68, C100/stop56, and C100/stop52) were generated by polymerase chain reaction, using the following oligonucleotides as polymerase chain reaction primers: 5′-TTTAAGCTTCCACCATGGCGCAGTTCCTG-3′ as a sense primer, 5′-TTTTCTAGACTAGTCAACCTCCAC-3′ as an antisense primer for C100/stop68, 5′-CCCTCTAGACTACTGTTTCTTCTT-3′ as an antisense primer for C100/stop56, and 5′-CCCTCTAGACTACAGCATCACCAA-3′ as an antisense primer for C100/stop52. C-terminally truncated C100 peptides were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into pcDNA3.1-Hygro vector similarly as with C-terminally tagged C100. C-terminally truncated βAPP695 cDNAs were constructed by ligating the EcoRI/XbaI fragments of tagged C100 with those of βAPP695 cDNA in pcDNA3.

Expression of transfected proteins was enhanced by treatment with 10 mm butyric acid for 24 h prior to harvesting cells or culture supernatants. For the inhibition of caspase activities, cells were treated with a 100 μm concentration of a pancaspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, for 24 h prior to analysis by Western blotting. Cells were lysed in 2% SDS sample buffer and briefly sonicated. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Tris-Tricine gel system, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.), and probed with monoclonal antibodies BAN50 (specific for human Aβ1–16) for the detection of C100 derivatives. A rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-G2N4 raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to the N-terminal residues 2–59 of human PS2 was used to probe PS2 and its derivatives. For the detection of Aβ in RIPA-soluble fractions of cell lysates, samples were initially lysed in RIPA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and the supernatants after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min were immunoprecipitated by BAN50 using protein G-agarose and then analyzed by immunoblotting with BA27, BC05, or BAN50, using previously described procedures (44Tomita T.

The immunoblots were developed using an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Immunostar (Wako Pure Chemicals). Transiently transfected N2a cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 48 h.

BAN50 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody were used for single immunofluorescence detection of C100 derivatives. Two-site ELISAs that specifically detect the C terminus of Aβ were used as described. BAN50, which was used as a capture antibody, binds only human βAPP or Aβ and does not cross-react with rodent Aβ or with an N-terminally truncated fragment (e.g. p3). BA27 and BC05 that specifically recognize the C terminus of Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively, were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and used as detector antibodies.

Cell-associated Aβ was quantitated after solubilization in 1% Nonidet P-40. ELISA data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance using StatView-J.4.11. Subcellular fractionation was performed using iodixanol as medium according to the previously described method (39Xia W. Zhang J. Ostaszewski B.L. Kimberly W.T. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Shen J.

N2a cells stably expressing either WT PS2 or N141I mt PS2 and transiently transfected with C100 cDNAs were grown on three 10-cm dishes. Cells were scraped in TS and resuspended in 4 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were disrupted by a Polytron homogenizer (Hitachi) at power level 2 for 10 s, and nuclei and large cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged for 1 h at 65,000 × g. The resultant vesicle pellets (i.e. microsomal fractions) were resuspended in 0.8 ml of homogenization buffer. Gradients were set up in 13-ml Beckman SW41 centrifuge tubes by diluting iodixanol with homogenization buffer: 2.5%, 1 ml; 5%, 2 ml; 7.5%, 2 ml; 10%, 2 ml; 12.5%, 0.5 ml; 15%, 2 ml; 17.5%, 0.5 ml; 20%, 0.5 ml; 30%, 0.3 ml (iodixanol concentration/volume). The resuspended vesicle fractions were loaded on the top of the gradients and centrifuged in a SW41 rotor at 40,000 × rpm for 2.5 h. The resulting gradients were collected in 1-ml fractions. For the differential extraction of C-terminally truncated C100, microsomal fractions of N2a cells transiently expressing C100/WT, C100/stop68, C100/stop56, and C100/stop52 prepared as above were extracted by 0.5 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.0) or 1% Triton X-100, and solubilized proteins in supernatants after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min and insoluble pellets were analyzed by Western blotting with BAN50. To identify the intracellular compartments where Aβ, especially Aβ42, is generated and destined to be secreted, we transiently expressed cDNAs coding for the C-terminal 99 amino acids of human βAPP harboring a signal peptide at the N terminus (C100) or C100 tagged with sorting signals for retention to ER (C100/ER) or for recycling to TGN (C100/TGN) tagged at the C terminus in mouse N2a cells (Fig. 1,A–C). C100, C100/ER, or C100/TGN was expressed as a major ∼13-kDa and a minor ∼8-kDa polypeptide on immunoblots, the latter corresponding to fragments cleaved by caspases (see below), and the banding patterns were similar between C100 with and without sorting signals (Fig. 1 B). Immunocytochemistry by C4 (against the cytoplasmic tail of βAPP (48Tomita T. Chang T.Y. Kodama T. Iwatsubo T. Neuroreport. 1998; 5: 911-913Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar)) combined with anti-BiP antibody that specifically reacts with a KDEL sequence (ER marker) or anti-adaptin-γ antibody (TGN marker) showed retention of C100/ER in a meshwork like pattern overlapping with an immunolabeling with the ER marker (Fig. 1 C, top left), whereas immunoreactive pattern for C100/TGN completely overlapped with that for adaptin-γ (Fig. 1 C, middle right), suggesting proper localization of C100 variants at the intended sites. C100/WT showed a combined ER and TGN localization (Fig. 1 C,lower panels). We then quantitated Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) secreted from N2a cells expressing C100 variants by two-site ELISAs using BAN50 as a capture antibody, which specifically detects human Aβ but not endogenous murine Aβ (Fig. 1 D). Cells transfected with C100/TGN secreted ∼2000 pm Aβ-(1–40) and ∼200 pm Aβ-(1–42), which were at comparable levels with those secreted from cells expressing C100/WT. In contrast, C100/ER did not secrete detectable levels of Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(1–42) as in N2a cells transfected with an empty vector. These results suggested that TGN would be the major intracellular site in which γ-cleavage to yield Aβ-(1–40) as well as Aβ-(1–42) that are destined for secretion takes place. We then expressed C100/ER, C100/TGN, or C100/WT in N2a cells that stably express WT or N141I or M239V FAD mt PS2 and examined the production of secreted or intracellular Aβ. N2a cells expressing WT PS2 transiently transfected with C100/WT or C100/TGN secreted similar levels of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42), whereas those with C100/ER did not secrete detectable lev"
https://openalex.org/W1913777314,"Biosynthesis of diacylglycerols in plants occurs mainly through the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid in the microsomal membranes. Here we describe the first identification of diacylglycerol biosynthetic activity in the soluble fraction of developing oilseeds. This activity was NaF-insensitive and acyl-CoA-dependent. Diacylglycerol formation was catalyzed by monoacylglycerol (MAG) acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.22) that transferred an acyl moiety from acyl-CoA to MAG. The enzyme was purified by successive chromatographic separations on octyl-Sepharose, blue-Sepharose, Superdex-75, and palmitoyl-CoA-agarose to apparent homogeneity from developing peanut (Arachis hypogaea) cotyledons. The enzyme was purified to 6,608-fold with the final specific activity of 15.86 nmol min−1 mg−1. The purified enzyme was electrophoretically homogeneous, and its molecular mass was 43,000 daltons. The purified MAG acyltransferase was specific for MAG and did not utilize any other acyl acceptor such as glycerol, glycerol-3-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine. The Km values for 1-palmitoylglycerol and 1-oleoylglycerol were 16.39 and 5.65 μm, respectively. The Km values for 2-monoacylglycerols were 2- to 4-fold higher than that of the corresponding 1-monoacylglycerol. The apparentKm values for palmitoyl-, stearoyl-, and oleoyl-CoAs were 17.54, 25.66, and 9.35 μm, respectively. Fatty acids, phospholipids, and sphingosine at low concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity. The identification of MAG acyltransferase in oilseeds suggests the presence of a regulatory link between signal transduction and synthesis of complex lipids in plants. Biosynthesis of diacylglycerols in plants occurs mainly through the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid in the microsomal membranes. Here we describe the first identification of diacylglycerol biosynthetic activity in the soluble fraction of developing oilseeds. This activity was NaF-insensitive and acyl-CoA-dependent. Diacylglycerol formation was catalyzed by monoacylglycerol (MAG) acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.22) that transferred an acyl moiety from acyl-CoA to MAG. The enzyme was purified by successive chromatographic separations on octyl-Sepharose, blue-Sepharose, Superdex-75, and palmitoyl-CoA-agarose to apparent homogeneity from developing peanut (Arachis hypogaea) cotyledons. The enzyme was purified to 6,608-fold with the final specific activity of 15.86 nmol min−1 mg−1. The purified enzyme was electrophoretically homogeneous, and its molecular mass was 43,000 daltons. The purified MAG acyltransferase was specific for MAG and did not utilize any other acyl acceptor such as glycerol, glycerol-3-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine. The Km values for 1-palmitoylglycerol and 1-oleoylglycerol were 16.39 and 5.65 μm, respectively. The Km values for 2-monoacylglycerols were 2- to 4-fold higher than that of the corresponding 1-monoacylglycerol. The apparentKm values for palmitoyl-, stearoyl-, and oleoyl-CoAs were 17.54, 25.66, and 9.35 μm, respectively. Fatty acids, phospholipids, and sphingosine at low concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity. The identification of MAG acyltransferase in oilseeds suggests the presence of a regulatory link between signal transduction and synthesis of complex lipids in plants. glycerol-3-phosphate diacylglycerol free fatty acid lysophosphatidic acid monoacylglycerol phosphatidic acid triacylglycerol fast protein liquid chromatography 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid Biosynthesis of diacylglycerol is shown to occur by the sequential acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate (1Bell R.M.

The first enzyme in this pathway, G3P1acyltransferase, catalyzes the formation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA can also be synthesized by acylation followed by the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate that is catalyzed by dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (4Webber K.O. Hajra A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and the NADPH-dependent acyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase (5Athenstaedt K. Paltauf F. Weys S. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. LPA is shown to induce a wide range of activities in animal systems (6van Crovan E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 7Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Postma S.R. van Crovan E.J. Moolenaar W.H.

LPA can be metabolized through dephosphorylation by a soluble LPA phosphatase to form monoacylglycerol (MAG) or acylated to phosphatidic acid (PA) by LPA acyltransferase. LPA phosphatase has been identified (9Xie M. Low M.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), purified (10Hiroyama M. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and cloned (11Hiroyama M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29172-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) from animal systems. PA is the precursor for diacylglycerol (DAG) and anionic phospholipids. PA phosphatase catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to form DAG, which is the immediate precursor for triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. DAG is also an important signal molecule that activates protein kinase C (12Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). DAG can also be derived directly from phospholipids by the action of phospholipase C (13Pelech S. Vance D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 28-30Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DAG can be synthesized by the esterification of MAG by acyl-CoA:MAG acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.22). This enzyme has been proposed to be important for fat absorption in human small intestine (14Xia T. Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Florant G.L. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R414-R4198PubMed Google Scholar, 15Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 229: 8934-8938Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 16Bhat B.G. Wang P. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13172-13178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another acyltransferase, acyl-CoA-independent MAG acyltransferase, has been purified to homogeneity from rat intestinal mucosa (17Tsujita T. Miyazaki T. Tabei R. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2156-2161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas acyl-CoA-dependent MAG acyltransferase has not been purified from any source. All the acyltransferases in these pathways are membrane-bound, and most of them use acyl-CoA as a primary acyl donor (1Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 2Browse J. Somerville C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

We identified DAG biosynthetic activity from the soluble fraction of developing peanut (Arachis hypogaea) cotyledons, and the enzyme involved was purified to apparent homogeneity by successive column chromatographic procedures and characterized. This is the first report of the purification of acyl-CoA-dependent MAG acyltransferase. [1-14C]Palmitoyl-CoA (54 mCi mmol−1), [9,10-3H(N)]trioleoylglycerol (10 Ci mmol−1), [glycerol-U-14C]PA (100 mCi mmol−1), [[2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]phosphatidylcholine (92.3 Ci mmol−1) and [2- 3H]G3P (12 Ci mmol−1), were obtained from Perkin Elmer Biosystems. Prep grade Superdex 75 (26/60) and Superdex 200 (10/30) FPLC columns, octyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow matrix, and gel filtration molecular mass standards were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein assay reagents were obtained from Pierce. Thin layer chromatography plates were from Merck. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. MAG was purified by preparative silica-TLC and quantified colorimetrically (18Mattson F.H. Volpenhein R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1961; 2: 58-62Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar,19Fletcher M.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1968; 22: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Field grown-developing peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cotyledons were harvested at 20–25 days after flowering and used either fresh or stored at −80 °C until further use. Lipids were extracted from 10 g of frozen immature seeds by grinding the tissue in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder in mortar and pestle (20De La Roche I.A. Andrews C.J. Kates M. Plant Physiol. 1973; 51: 468-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The powder was extracted with 20 ml of boiling isopropyl alcohol. The mixture was then centrifuged briefly, supernatant was removed, and the extraction repeated twice. The pooled isopropyl alcohol extracts were brought to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The tissue residue was then reextracted twice with 38 ml of chloroform/methanol/10% acetic acid (1:2:0.8, v/v). After centrifugation, the supernatant was added to the isopropyl alcohol extract, and 20 ml each of chloroform and water were added to the mixture. The biphasic system was mixed and centrifuged. The lower chloroform phase was removed and dried in a rotary evaporator. The lipid residue was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and stored at −20 °C. Differential centrifugation was used to fractionate intracellular components (21de Duve C. Pressmann B.C. Giannetto R. Wattiaux R. Applemans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). Either fresh or frozen immature seeds (100 g) were ground in a prechilled mortar and pestle with 10 g of acid-washed sand and 250 ml of buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg ml−1leupeptin, and 0.25 m sucrose. The extract was passed through two layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 3,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min. The 18,000 × g supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 2.5 h. The pellets were resuspended in small volume of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. All these operations were performed at 4 °C. All the fractions were assayed for acyltransferase activities. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olsen B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. For the purification of MAG acyltransferase, the homogenate was centrifuged directly at 18,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 2.5 h. The 150,000 ×g supernatant (soluble fraction) was used as the source for MAG acyltransferase. The assay mixtures consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 μm[1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (100,000 dpm), 15–45 μg enzyme, and 50 μm MAG (1-oleoyl) in a total volume of 100 μl. The incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of 400 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2, v/v). Following lipid extraction by the modified method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43117) Google Scholar), the lower chloroform-soluble materials were separated by TLC on 250 μm silica gel G plates either using petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v) or chloroform/methanol/water (98:2:0.5, v/v) as the solvent system (24Ichihara K. Norikura S. Fujii S. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 419-423Crossref Google Scholar). The lipids were visualized with iodine vapor, and the spots of DAG scraped off for determination of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. All operations were conducted at 4 °C except the FPLC purification step, which was conducted at ambient temperature. Buffer A contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to bring the soluble fraction to 1 m followed by centrifugation to make the solution clear and then loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose column (4.4 × 15 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with 1 m ammonium sulfate in Buffer A with a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. The column was washed with the same buffer to remove unbound proteins until the effluent had very low absorbency at 280 nm. The enzyme was eluted with 200 ml of a linear-reversed gradient from 1 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in Buffer A, and fractions of 5 ml were collected. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A. Active fractions from the octyl-Sepharose were combined, dialyzed against Buffer A, and applied onto a blue-Sepharose (cibacron blue A) column. The column was eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The fractions eluted at 0.35–0.4 m NaCl from the blue-Sepharose were concentrated using a Centricon (30-kDa cut-off) concentrator and filtered. The filtrate was applied onto a preparative Superdex 75 FPLC column fitted with Bio-Rad BioLogic low-pressure chromatography system. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 5 ml min−1. A 2.5-ml sample of palmitoyl-CoA-agarose was pre-equilibrated with Buffer A at room temperature, and the active fractions from the previous column was mixed with matrix for 90 min at 4 °C. The mixture was then poured into a column, washed with Buffer A, and eluted with Buffer A containing 0.25, 0.5, and 1 m NaCl, respectively. The MAG acyltransferase activity was eluted at 0.5 m NaCl. The subcellular distribution of DAG biosynthesis in fresh peanut cotyledons was studied by isolating the intracellular components by differential centrifugation. DAG biosynthetic capacity was found low in the membrane fraction because of the presence of active triacylglycerol biosynthesis (data not shown). However, DAG formation was higher in 150,000 × g supernatant as compared with the corresponding microsomal pellet, which is in agreement with the earlier report on developing rapeseed (25Murphy D.J. Lipids. 1988; 23: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The pattern of distribution remained the same even in the frozen tissue, but total DAG biosynthetic activity decreased 21% after freezing and thawing. These results suggested that the additional DAG biosynthetic machinery could exist in the soluble fraction. There was a significant amount of DAG formation in the soluble fraction, and this could either be caused by the presence of soluble enzymes or the presence of nonsedimentable cellular membrane fragments generated during isolation procedures. Marker enzyme activities were measured to assess the extent of contamination in the soluble fraction with the membranes. The activities of succinate dehydrogenase (26Sparace S.A. Moore T.S. Plant Physiol. 1979; 63: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NADH cytochrome C reductase (27Gallagher S.R. Leonard R.T. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and vanadium sensitive ATPase (28Briskin D.P. Leonard R.T. Hodges T.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 542-558Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar) were measured as the marker enzymes for mitochondrial, microsomal, and plasma membranes, respectively. About 6% (1.2 μmol min−1 mg−1), 18% (1.3 μmol min−1 mg−1) and 11% (0.55 μmol min−1 mg−1) activities of these enzymes were detected in the soluble fraction, respectively. These results indicated that the membrane contamination in the soluble fraction was not significant. Effect of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA incorporation into DAG was measured both in the soluble and the membrane fractions of immature peanuts (Fig.1). Maximum activity was observed at 10 μm in the soluble fraction and at 20 μmpalmitoyl-CoA in the membrane fraction. Exogenous MAG did not alter the rate and the pattern of incorporation into DAG. To determine the amounts of MAG in the immature peanut seeds, the total lipid was extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amounts of MAG in the immature seeds and the soluble fraction were calculated to be about 134 nmol/g fresh weight and 2.6–3.1 nmol/mg protein, respectively. DAG can be synthesized either by the dephosphorylation of PA or by the direct acylation of MAG. To find out the contribution of each step to the total DAG pool, peanut soluble fraction was treated with various concentrations of NaF to inhibit phosphatase activity, and these were used for the incorporation of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA into DAG. Initially, we studied the effect of various concentrations of NaF on the dephosphorylation of PA in the membrane fraction and found that there was no formation of DAG at 20 mm NaF (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, there was only a 25–38% decrease in the incorporation of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA into DAG in the soluble fraction in the presence of 20 mm NaF suggesting that the DAG formation was independent of PA dephosphorylation activity. NaF-treated membrane fraction showed a profound inhibition of DAG formation indicating the presence of NaF sensitive PA dephosphorylation activity (Fig.2 C). These results suggest that the soluble fraction has NaF-insensitive and PA dephosphorylation-independent DAG biosynthesizing activity in the soluble fraction of immature peanuts. Incorporation of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA into DAG was studied in the soluble and the particulate fractions from the tissues of leaf and hypocotyl of peanut and immature seed and leaf tissue of castor (Ricinus communis L.). The MAG acyltransferase activity was not detected in the soluble fractions of leaf and hypocotyl, but the enzyme activity was in the membrane fractions (data not shown). In peanut leaf, the activity was ∼48-fold lower than that of immature seed. These data suggest that MAG acyltransferase was also present in other plant tissues but at low levels. MAG acyltransferase activity was found to be high in the soluble fraction, and the rate of synthesis of diacylglycerol in the soluble fraction was 24 pmol min−1 mg−1. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to bring the soluble fraction to 1m and then loaded onto an octyl-Sepharose column. The column was eluted with a 1–0 m linear-reversed gradient of ammonium sulfate (Fig. 3 A). This step was the most effective resulting in a 221-fold purification of acyltransferase and yielding a 2.6-fold increase in the total activity. The active fractions from the octyl-Sepharose were loaded onto a blue-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. The activity was eluted between 0.35 and 0.4 m NaCl (Fig.3 B). The recovery of MAG acyltransferase activity from the blue-Sepharose column was nearly 77% of that applied. The pooled active fractions were applied to a preparative Superdex 75 column. The MAG acyltransferase activity was eluted as a single peak from fraction 27 to 31 (Fig. 3 C). The active fractions were pooled and applied to a palmitoyl-CoA agarose column as the final step. An overall purification of ∼6,608-fold was obtained, and the specific activity of acyltransferase was 15.86 nmol min−1 mg−1(Table I). The purified enzyme was resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which showed a single band with a molecular mass of 43 kDa (Fig. 4). The native molecular mass of the purified enzyme was found to be 43 kDa by Superdex 200 column chromatography (data not shown).Table IPurification of MAG acyltransferase from developing peanut cotyledonsFractionProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationmgnmol/minnmol/min/mg-foldCytosol1721.64.130.00241Octyl-Sepharose20.1510.680.53221Blue-Sepharose1.568.175.242,183Superdex 750.455.5012.225,092Palmitoyl-CoA-agarose0.101.5915.866,608The results are from the summary of purification of the MAG acyltransferase.

Frozen immature seed (100 g) was used for preparing the soluble fraction. The enzyme activity measurement and the purification steps are described in “Experimental Procedures.” To confirm that the 43-kDa polypeptide corresponds to the MAG acyltransferase, the purified enzyme was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 0.1% SDS without boiling and electrophoresed at 4 °C. The gel was cut into 0.5-cm sections, the protein eluted from the gel with Buffer A and assayed for the enzyme activity (29Bischoff K.M. Shi L. Kennelly P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The yield of MAG acyltransferase activity from the gel was low (1.5%), and the activity was associated with the area of the gel corresponding to the 43-kDa protein (data not shown). These results indicate that the 43-kDa protein detected on the silver-stained gel (Fig. 4) was indeed the MAG acyltransferase. The reaction products formed at each step of purification were analyzed on a silica-TLC and autoradiographed (Fig.5). When the soluble fraction was incubated with [14C]palmitoyl-CoA in the presence of 1-MAG (16:0), formation of 1-acyl-, 1,2-diacyl-, and 1,3-diacyl- and triacylglycerols was observed suggesting the presence of many different acylation activities. The active fractions eluted from the octyl-Sepharose column showed minor amounts of other acylation activities, which diminished in further purification steps as shown in Fig. 5. The enzyme activity was linear with respect to time and protein concentrations, and the pH optimum of the MAG acyltransferase was found to be 7.0. The enzyme was specific for MAG and did not utilize any other acyl acceptor such as glycerol, G3P, LPA, or lysophosphatidylcholine. The effect of various detergents on the MAG acyltransferase activity was studied (data not shown). In the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100, the enzyme activity was reduced to 58%. At 20 mm concentration of the zwitterionic detergent (CHAPS), the enzyme lost its activity completely. The activity of MAG acyltransferase was reduced to 50% in the presence of 40 mm octylglucoside (data not shown). The substrate specificity of MAG acyltransferase was studied by providing monoacylglycerol of varying chain lengths and position of fatty acid as the substrate. The MAG acyltransferase activity was highest for 1-MAG (16:0) and lower for 2-MAG (16:0). The initial rate of reaction was high for 1-MAG (18:1) but the Vmax was small when compared with MAG containing saturated acyl chains. The rate of reaction declined sharply after 10 μm of 1-MAG (18:1). The 1-MAG (16:0) and 1-MAG (18:1) had higherVmax values and the Kmvalues were 16.39 and 5.65 μm, respectively. The other monoacylglycerols had lower Vmax and apparentKm values (Fig.6 A). These results suggest that the MAG acyltransferase preferentially usesn-1-monoacylglycerols. MAG acyltransferase activity was the highest for palmitoyl-CoA when compared with stearoyl-, and oleoyl-CoAs, but the initial rate of reaction was higher for oleoyl-CoA. The apparentKm values for palmitoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, and stearoyl-CoA were 17.54, 9.35, and 25.64 μm, respectively (Fig. 6 B). Competition studies with myristoyl-CoA and lauroyl-CoA showed that the medium-chain acyl-CoAs and acetyl-CoA were not good substrates for the MAG acyltransferase (data not shown). Based on the Lineweaver-Burk plots, apparent Vmax andKm values for acyl acceptors and acyl donors at the standard assay conditions were obtained as summarized in TableII.Table IIKinetic parameters of MAG acyltransferaseSubstratesKm2-aApparentKm and Vmax values were calculated from data in Fig. 6.VmaxVmax/Kmμmnmol/min/mg1-MAG (16:0)16.3916.91.032-MAG (16:0)30.3013.40.441-MAG (18:1)5.6515.82.802-MAG (18:1)22.7313.70.601-MAG (12:0)58.8111.10.1916:0-CoA17.5420.01.1418:0-CoA9.3517.91.9118:1-CoA25.649.40.372-a ApparentKm and Vmax values were calculated from data in Fig. 6. Open table in a new tab Effect of fatty acids on the MAG acyltransferase activity was studied using C8 to C18 and C18:1 (Fig. 7 A). Oleic acid stimulated the MAG acyltransferase activity at concentrations below 15 μm, but at the higher concentrations, the activity was reduced. Palmitic acid at concentrations between 20 and 50 μm had a stimulatory effect on the enzyme activity, and other fatty acids had no significant effect on the MAG acyltransferase activity. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid had stimulatory effects on the purified MAG acyltransferase activity at lower concentrations from 2.5 to 15 μm, whereas at higher concentrations no stimulatory effect was observed (Fig.7 B). Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol had no effect on the enzyme activity. At lower concentrations of 2.5–7.5 μm, sphingosine and sphingomylein activated the acyltransferase activity (Fig.7 C). The derivative of sphingosine, dehydrosphingosine showed lower stimulatory effects when compared with sphingosine. Dehydrosphingosine had no effect on the MAG acyltransferase activity. The biosynthesis of diacylglycerol is known to occur via the Kennedy pathway in the microsomal membranes (1Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev.

The incubation of NaF-treated soluble fraction with [14C]PA did not generate DAG; however, about 62–75% of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA incorporation into diacylglycerol was observed in the immature peanuts. The synthesized DAG did not originate from the hydrolysis of either triacylglycerol or phosphatidylcholine. These results provide evidences for an alternate enzymatic step for the synthesis of DAG. In this study, we show that DAG is synthesized by the acylation of MAG by acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase and this enzyme has not been purified from any source. The following observations revealed that the MAG acyltransferase is present in the soluble fraction. (i) The activity is associated with 150,000 ×g supernatant. (ii) The enzyme is permeable in the gel filtration column, and (iii) the MAG acyltransferase is purified to homogeneity by successive column chromatographic separations without detergent. The role of this enzyme in intracellular processes and its regulation has yet to be elucidated. It appears that different tissues express isozymes with respect to subcellular location. For example, leaf enzyme is found in the particulate fraction, but the soluble form is found in immature seeds. We have purified to apparent homogeneity a MAG acyltransferase activity from developing peanut cotyledons by successive chromatographic procedures. The key to the successful purification was the initial step of octyl-Sepharose column chromatography, and this step gave a 221-fold purification with a 2.6-fold increase in the total activity. The increase in total enzyme activity could be attributed to the elimination of an inhibitor or the enzymes competing for palmitoyl-CoA. The remaining purification steps showed a successive increase in the specific activity and the fold purification. The purified peanut MAG acyltransferase showed the highest activity with palmitoyl-CoA, but oleoyl-CoA had a lowerKm when compared with palmitoyl- or stearoyl-CoAs. Characterization of the partially purified MAG acyltransferase from rat liver (14Xia T. Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Florant G.L. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R414-R4198PubMed Google Scholar), intestinal mucosa (39Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 224-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and adipocytes (40Jamdar S.C. Cao W.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) has also showed higher activity with palmitoyl-CoA. Unlike rat MAG acyltransferase (14Xia T. Mostafa N. Bhat B.G. Florant G.L. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R414-R4198PubMed Google Scholar), peanut enzyme showed a preference to sn-1-monoacylglycerol over the sn-2 isomer. This observation could also be attributed to the possible acyl migration from sn-2 to sn-1 of MAG during conditions of storage, assay, or extraction (41Stimmel B.F. King C.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 1724-1725Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, we are not certain about either of the two possibilities. Kinetic experiments showed that the overall catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) for 1-acyl acceptor was higher than that of the 2-acyl acceptor suggesting the 1-acyl acceptor was a good substrate. The analysis of acyl donors showed that the catalytic efficiency for oleoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA were comparable. The activity of most of the lipid biosynthetic enzymes is dependent on or modulated by the various lipid cofactors. In developing oilseeds, lipid biosynthesis is highly active, and various metabolic intermediates are accumulated during seed development. All these intermediates either stimulate or inhibit the enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. The characterization of the purified peanut MAG acyltransferase indicated that the lower concentrations of phospholipids and oleic acid stimulated the activity. Apart from oleic acid, palmitic acid also showed an activation effect on peanut MAG acyltransferase. In contrast to our results, it was shown in partially purified hepatic MAG acyltransferase that the higher concentrations of fatty acid inhibited the enzyme activity (15Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 229: 8934-8938Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Sphingosine was shown to inhibit rat hepatic MAG acyltransferase (42Bhat B.G. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11237-11244Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but the peanut enzyme was activated in the presence of lower concentrations of sphingosine, and no inhibition was observed at higher concentrations. Identification of MAG acyltransferase in peanut indicates the presence of the MAG pathway for DAG biosynthesis. It has been proposed in animal systems that the MAG pathway may play an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism by controlling the chain length of fatty acids (43Knudsen J. Clark S. Dils R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or controlling the intracellular concentrations of acyl-CoA esters (44Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or facilitating selective retention of essential fatty acids during hepatic oxidation (13Pelech S. Vance D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 28-30Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In plants, the MAG pathway may be involved in the synthesis of triacylglycerol and may also provide a regulatory link between signal transduction and synthesis of complex lipids. Another possibility is that the MAG pathway contributes to a separate intracellular pool of DAG for different sets of metabolic reaction (45Gurr M.I. Stumpf P.K. The Biochemistry of Plants. 4. Academic Press, New York1980: 205-248Google Scholar). The identification of the MAG acyltransferase has significant implications in understanding the regulation of di- and triacylglycerol biosynthesis in plants. We thank Dr. P. N. Rangarajan for helpful discussions and for allowing us to use the FPLC facility. We are grateful to Dr. Savithramma, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore for giving us peanut and castor seeds."

These ZFP types have been described in a human heart EST data base survey as well as in anin silico Northern analysis of a total of 15 different tissues (13Dai K.S. Liew C.C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1749-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The C3HC4-type zinc finger domain, also termed RING domain, was first described in the sequence of the human ring 1 gene (14Freemont P.S. Hanson I.M. Trowsdale J. Cell. 1991; 64: 483-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). This domain was subsequently found in a number of virus, yeast, plant, and animal proteins, which have various functions such as oncogenesis, signal transduction, peroxisome biogenesis, viral infection, development, transcriptional repression, and ubiquitination (15Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 16Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The widespread presence of the RING domain in functionally distinct proteins and in many different species indicates that the domain is essential to basic cellular function and is conserved during evolution. With the aid of sequence alignment, the consensus sequence of this domain was defined as CX2CX(9–39)CX(1–3)HX(2–3)CX2CX(4–48)CX2C, where X can be any amino acid. Unlike other zinc finger domains, this domain shows a unique cross-brace arrangement on the conserved residues that coordinate the two zinc ions (15Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 16Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence suggests that the RING domain is mainly involved in protein-protein interactions (15Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 16Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and the structural integrity of RING is reportedly essential for this type of interaction. For example, deletion of RING domain resulted in a loss of activity in Bmi-1 transformation (17Cohen K.J. Hanna J.S. Prescott J.E. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5527-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and in PML interaction with IE1 (18Ahn J.H. Brignole III, E.J. Hayward G.S. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 1995; 69: 7339-7344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to improve our understanding of the functional roles of ZFPs and the RING domain, we identified a novel RING domain ZFP gene, named SMRZ, through a human EST data base sequence similarity search. Northern expression analysis indicated that SMRZ shows restricted expression in striated muscle and its pattern of expression in heart tissue suggests that the gene is developmentally regulated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization located SMRZ on chromosome 1p33–34. A yeast two-hybrid screen demonstrated an interaction between SMRZ and SMT3b, a ubiquitin-like protein. This interaction was confirmed using in vitro interaction assays. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis further strengthens the hypothesis that RING domain plays an essential role in protein-protein (SMRZ-SMT3b) interaction. Subcellular localization analysis showed that SMRZ is located in the nucleus. An EST clone, named striated muscle RING zinc finger protein (SMRZ), exhibiting an amino acid sequence similar to the conserved RING domain sequence, was isolated from a human heart EST data base (27Liew C.C. Hwang D.M. Fung Y.W. Laurenssen C. Cukerman E. Tsui S. Lee C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10645-10649Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Hwang D.M. Fung Y.W. Wang R.X.

The clone was subsequently excised in vivo from the λZAP Express vector using the ExAssist/XLOLR helper phage system (Stratagene). In brief, phagemid particles were excised by coinfecting XL1-BLUE MRF′ cells with ExAssist helper phage. The excised pBluescript phagemids were used to infect Escherichia coli XLOLR cells, which lack the amber suppressor necessary for ExAssist phage replication. Infected XLOLR cells were selected using kanamycin resistance. Resultant colonies contained the double-stranded phagemid vector with the cloned cDNA insert. A single colony was grown overnight in LB-kanamycin, and DNA was purified using a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen). The expression pattern of SMRZ was analyzed using Northern blot hybridization. An ∼1.2-kb SMRZ cDNA was amplified and labeled using DIG DNA labeling system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Two commercial human tissue Northern blots, Human 12-Lane MTN Blot (CLONTECH catalog no. 7780-1) and Human Cardiovascular System MTN Blot (CLONTECH catalog no. 7791-1), were hybridized with DIG-labeled probe in ExpressedHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). Blots were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min each, followed by two washes in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min each. After these washes, blots were treated with CSPD according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Signals were visualized by exposing the blots to Kodak X-Omat film. To normalize the hybridization signals, a commercial cDNA encoding β-actin probe (CLONTECH) was used as a control. Phagemid DNA was sequenced using the Taqdye-deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit for the Applied Biosystems 377 sequencing system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Both strands of the cDNA were then sequenced using commercial T3 or T7 primers and the specific nested forward and reverse primers: 5′-ATGGAGAACTTGGAGAAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-ATTTACCACCCCGTATG TCTGG-3′. To obtain the full length of the SMRZ gene, 5′-rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (5′-RACE; Life Technologies, Inc.) was performed on human fetal heart total RNA. Using Trizol reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.), total RNA was isolated from pooled human fetal hearts (10–12 weeks) and treated with DNase I. The purity and integrity of RNA was assessed by absorbance at 260/280 nm and by 1% formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using 3 μg of total RNA as template incubated with SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase and an antisense primer located in the SMRZ coding region (5′-TCATTGGCACACTTCCGGCACAGGTTGTGCTGGCACG GCAAGA-3′) at 42 °C for 1 h. After treating with RNase Mix (RNase H and RNase T1) and performing 3′ end tailing reaction, the 5′-RACE product was PCR-amplified according to the manufacturer's manual (Life Technologies, Inc.) and sequenced. Full-length SMRZ sequence comparisons against the nonredundant nucleotide and protein data bases were performed using BLASTN and BLASTX programs (30Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar, 31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Genet. 1993; 3: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar), at the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the Swiss-Prot protein sequence data base. The RING domain amino acid sequence was aligned to the members of the RING domain-containing proteins to identify consensus sequence. The SMRZ phagemid, used for human chromosome mapping, was prepared by dATP biotinylation with the BioNick labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Methods for preparation of cultured lymphocyte slide and FISH protocols have been described previously (33Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 34Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposition of the FISH signals with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-banded chromosome. Detailed positioning of each of the assignments was determined based on the summary from 10 photographs. A yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted to determine the protein-protein interaction role of SMRZ-RING domain. Both RING domain region (nucleotides encoding amino acids 1–67) and non-RING domain region (nucleotides encoding amino acids 68–288) were PCR-amplified from the SMRZ cDNA clone. The PCR primers were constructed to incorporate an EcoRI and aSalI site in forward and reverse primers, respectively. After digestion with restriction enzyme, these two regions of PCR products were subcloned into pAS2–1 vector (CLONTECH) in frame to generate pAS2-R1 (RING domain region) and pAS2-R2 (non-RING domain region) fused to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain as bait. After cloning, the expression plasmids were sequenced to verify that no mutation had been introduced during the PCR process. A human heart Matchmaker cDNA library (CLONTECH catalog no. HL4042AH), constructed in the pACT2 vector expressing GAL4 activation domain fusion protein, was used as prey. Using a lithium acetate method, bait and prey vectors were transformed sequentially into yeast strain Y190. Transformants were selected by the use of appropriate selective media lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, but containing 25 mm3-aminotriazole. Histidine prototrophs were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using a filter lift technique. Colonies remaining histidine- and β-galactosidase-positive were further characterized by sequencing and searched for gene sequence similarity on the GenBank™ data base using the BLAST program. To generate epitope-tagged SMRZ and SMT3b, two prokaryotic expression vectors, pET27b(+) and pET9a (Novagen), were used. The full open reading frame of SMRZ was amplified with PCR primers containingEcoRI and SalI enzyme digestion sites and ligated into the corresponding sites of pET27b(+) vector in-frame to generate pET27b(+)-SMRZ plasmid. For SMT3b, the full open reading frame was amplified with PCR primers containing BamHI andBpu1102I enzyme digestion sites and inserted into the pET9a vector in-frame to generate pET9a-SMT3b plasmid. To further determine whether the RING domain of SMRZ is essential to protein-protein interaction, the RING domain was mutated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Using pET27b(+)-SMRZ plasmid as a template, one round of mutagenesis in which Cys26, His28, Cys31, and Cys34 were mutated to alanine using sense primer (5′-ATC TTG CCG GCC CAG GCA AAC CTG GCC CGG AAG GCC GCC AAT GAC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GTC ATT GGC GGC CTT CCG GGC CAG GTT TGC CTG GGC CGG CAA GAT-3′). The temperature cycling reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). After cloning, the sequence fidelity of all recombinants was verified by sequencing. The bacteria expression plasmids pET27b(+)-SMRZ (both wild type and mutant) and pET9a-SMT3b were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), a bacterial host containing T7 RNA polymerase gene under lacUV5 control. Recombinant protein synthesis was stimulated by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside for 3 h. The expressed wild-type RING domain SMRZ (HSVSMRZ), mutated RING domain SMRZ (HSVSMRZMT) and SMT3b (T7SMT3b) fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). To confirm the protein-protein interaction between SMRZ and SMT3b, in vitro interaction assay was performed as described previously (35delPozo J.C. Timpte C. Tan S. Callis J. Estelle M. Science. 1998; 280: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of wild-type HSV SMRZ and mutantHSVSMRZMT fusion proteins were each immobilized on 100 μl of His·Bind® resin (Novagen) and washed with 60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.9), to remove unboundHSVSMRZ and HSVSMRZMT. Bacterial cell lysates from E. coli BL21 (DE3) expressingT7SMT3b fusion protein were split into aliquots and incubated with His·Bind resin immobilized with HSVSMRZ orHSVSMRZMT in a final concentration of 1 mm ATP in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (BugBuster protein extraction reagent; Novagen). Following incubation at 4 °C overnight (with gentle rocking), the mixture was pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.9). The bound proteins were eluted using buffer containing 1 mimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.9). SDS sample buffer was added to the protein elution under reducing and non-reducing conditions for recombinant protein analysis using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Control experiments under reducing conditions were performed under conditions: 1) nontransformed bacterial lysates were used to incubate with His·Bind resin immobilized with HSVSMRZ orHSVSMRZMT and 2) bacterial lysates expressingT7SMT3b were used to incubate with non-HSVSMRZ immobilized His·Bind resin. C2C12 myoblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. Before transfections, the full open reading frame of SMRZ was amplified with PCR primers containing EcoRI andXhoI enzyme digestion sites and ligated into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with V5 epitope-tag to generate pcDNA3.1-SMRZ plasmid. Sequence fidelity of this recombinant was verified by sequencing. The cells were plated on multiwell chamber slides (Nunc) 1 day before transfection at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 0.7 μg of pcDNA3.1-SMRZ plasmid was precomplexed with 5 μl of the Plus reagent in 50 μl of serum-free DMEM for 15 min at 37 °C was combined with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent in 50 μl of serum-free DMEM and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Complexes of DNA-plus-LipofectAMINE reagent were then added to each well. Three hours following transfection, medium containing the complexes was replaced with fresh medium. Forty-eight hours after incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking buffer) for 30 min, incubated with a 1:200 diluted alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 1 h, and stained with Vector® Red substrate (Vector Laboratories Inc.). After washing, the slides were analyzed using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Cells transfected with pDNA3.1 vectors were used as control. Proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Helix) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol) with a Mini Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 100 V. Proteins were immunoblotted with specific antibodies. For example, membrane blotted with purified T7SMT3b fusion protein and its co-immunoprecipitates was blocked with a 3% solution of nonfat milk powder in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with 1:5000 dilution of T7 tag horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Novagen) at room temperature. Membrane blotted with purified HSVSMRZ orHSVSMRZMT fusion proteins and their co-immunoprecipitates was blocked with 3% solution of bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer, incubated with monoclonal antibody directed against HSV tag (dilution 1 into 10,000; Novagen) and then treated with 1:10,000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Novagen). Unbound antibody was removed by washing with TBST for 5 × 1 min. Bound antibody was detected using ECL Western blotting detecting reagents as described by the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). The binding was visualized by exposing the blots to Kodak X-Omat film. An EST clone (SMRZ; GenBank™ accession no. AF361946) exhibiting (approximately) 39% amino acid sequence similarity to the RING domain of several known ZFPs was isolated and sequenced. To obtain the full length of the cDNA, 5′-RACE was performed. The full-length nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of SMRZ are shown in Fig.1. The 1903-bp cDNA contains an 864-bp open reading frame extending from 984 to 1847, which corresponds to an encoded protein of 288 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 32.3 kDa. The sequence around the initiation ATG codon at nucleotide 984–986 was matched with the Kozak consensus ((A/G)CCATGG) (36Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar, 37Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The coding region contained an N-terminal RING domain between residues 2–67. In the 3′-untranslated region, a potential polyadenylation signal AATAAA (38Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar) was detected 26 bases upstream of a poly(A) tail. A search of the EST data base, disclosed 10 ESTs (GenBank™ accession no. F35868, F21990, AI351421,F36292, F32077, F25523, F18452, C02645, F34432, and BE894237) showing identity to portions of the SMRZ coding region. Fifty ESTs also matched an Alu sequence containing portion (nucleotides 220–295) of the 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR). No gene sequence deposited in public data bases was found to match to SMRZ suggesting that SMRZ is a novel gene. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the RING domain regions of SMRZ and 26 known RING domain-containing ZFPs is shown in Fig. 2. The alignment shows that the cysteine and histidine residues for constructing the RING finger (i.e. C3HC4) are 100% conserved (shown in bold). Six additional highly conserved (>50% conservation) amino acids within the sequences are also shown in the consensus sequence (CONS).Figure 2Alignment of the RING domain. An alignment of the RING domain of SMRZ and 26 RING zinc finger proteins. The conserved amino acids with 100% conservation are indicated inbold. A consensus sequence is presented at thebottom; gaps between conserved amino acids (>50% conservation) are indicated by dashes. Asterisksindicate upstream translated region (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the expression of the SMRZ transcript in various human tissues, both human multiple-tissue and cardiovascular system Northern blot analyses were probed using DIG-labeled SMRZ cDNA. For the human 12-lane multiple-tissue blot, a single transcript of ∼2.1 kb was detected exclusively in heart and skeletal muscle lanes (Fig.3 A). A second blot (human cardiovascular system) probed in the same way showed a high expression of an ∼2.1-kb transcript in fetal heart, intermediate expression in ventricle, and low expression in atrium and adult heart (Fig.3 B). Chromosomal localization of SMRZ was performed using FISH (Fig. 4). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and detailed position analysis allowed for assignment of the signal to 1p33–34. No additional loci were detected under the conditions applied. To determine whether the SMRZ-RING domain is the region involved in protein-protein interactions and to identify its possible interactive partners, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using two baits: the RING domain region of SMRZ and the non-RING domain region (a region outside of the RING domain) of SMRZ. Each bait was fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain serving to screen a commercial human heart cDNA library fused to a GAL4 activation domain in yeast Y190. After screening 1 × 106 transformants, 126 yeast colonies fitting the criteria for the interaction between bait and prey proteins (i.e. positive for both histidine growth and β-galactosidase activity) were obtained from the bait fused with RING domain. No colony was found to grow on the histidine dropout medium from the bait fused with non-RING domain region (TableI), suggesting that RING domain is the region of SMRZ responsible for protein-protein interaction. Nucleotide sequencing was carried out with 12 randomly selected cDNA clones fused with activating domain isolated from yeast His and LacZ positive colonies. A sequence similarity search through the GenBank™ data base revealed 12 selected positive clones: 1) one H+-ATP synthase subunit b (GenBank™ accession no. X60221), 2) one NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (GenBank™ accession no. AF014892), 3) one ferritin light chain (GenBank™ accession no. M11147), 4) one overlapping cosmid cSRL72 g7–140b8 (GenBank™ accession no. AC002037), 5) two cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (GenBank™ accession no. X54802), 6) two SMT3b (GenBank™ accession no. X99585), 7) two ribosomal proteins L27 (GenBank™ accession no. L19527), and 8) two KAT11391 clones (GenBank™ accession no. AK026634). Previous evidence has shown that many RING ZFPs were involved in either ubiquitination (39Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or in interacting with ubiquitin-like protein such as the interactions between RING ZFPs (PML (Refs. 40Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P.

It is interesting that 2 of the 12 selected positive clones were identical to SMT3b, a ubiquitin-like protein. Thus, SMT3b was selected for further study as an interaction partner of SMRZ.Table ISelection of positive clones that interact with DNA binding domain in yeast two-hybrid systemConstructPlates with selective mediaLacZ expressionTrp−Leu−Trp−Leu−His−pAS2-R1+++pAS2"

As the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is a potential target for this autoregulation. Using the serotonergic neuron-like CA77 cell line, we have demonstrated that treatment with a 5-hydroxytryptamine autoreceptor agonist, CGS 12066A, can lower TPH mRNA levels and promoter activity. We reasoned that this repression might involve inhibition of MAP kinases, since 5-HT1 receptors can increase mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase levels. To test this hypothesis, we first showed that the TPH promoter can be activated 20-fold by mitogen-activated extracellular-signal regulated kinase kinase kinase (MEKK), an activator of MAP kinases. This activation was then blocked by CGS 12066A. The maximal MAP kinase and CGS repression regulatory region was mapped to between −149 and −45 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. The activation by MEKK appears to be cell-specific, because MEKK did not activate the TPH promoter in nonneuronal cell lines. At least part, but not all, of the MAP kinase responsiveness was mapped to an inverted CCAAT box that binds the transcription factor NF-Y. These data suggest a model for the autoregulation of serotonin biosynthesis by repression of MAP kinase stimulation of the TPH promoter.

Whitaker-Azmitia P.M. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1991; 52: 4-16PubMed Google Scholar). Dysfunction in serotonergic systems has been implicated in the etiology of depression, aggressive behavior, and anxiety disorders (2Graeff F.G. Guimaraes F.S. De Andrade T.G.C.S. Deakin J.F.W. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1996; 54: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 3Saudou F. Amara D.A. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Ramboz S. Segu L. Buhot M.C. Hen R. Science. 1994; 265: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The pathophysiological mechanisms behind these illnesses, however, are poorly understood, and very little is known about the control of serotonin levels in neurons. Serotonin biosynthesis is restricted to serotonergic neurons in the brain raphe and gut, the pineal gland, enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract, and rodent mast cells (4Tyce G.M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1990; 16: S1-S7Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Boadle-Biber M.C. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 60: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This is largely due to the cell-specific expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the first and rate-limiting step in serotonin biosynthesis, which catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan. As the rate-limiting enzyme, TPH is a potential target for control of serotonin levels. There is extensive evidence for post-translational regulation of TPH enzyme activity through phosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and a member of the 14-3-3 protein family (6Ehret M. Cash C.D. Hamon M. Maitre M. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Johansen P.A. Jennings I. Cotton R.G.H. Kuhn D.M. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26219-26225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another mechanism for the control of serotonin levels is through a negative feedback loop via activation of presynaptic 5-HT1 autoreceptors, which inhibit neuronal firing and serotonin release (5Boadle-Biber M.C. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 60: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,9Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-192PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of 5-HT1 autoreceptors also decreases the conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, suggesting that extracellular serotonin can regulate TPH activity (5Boadle-Biber M.C. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 60: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). No studies to date directly demonstrate that 5-HT autoreceptor activation regulates TPH mRNA levels; however, in rats, administration of parachlorophenylalanine, an irreversible TPH inhibitor, depletes brain serotonin and causes significant increases in TPH mRNA (10Park D.H. Stone D.M. Baker H. Kim K.S. Joh T.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, temporal changes in TPH mRNA are opposite and symmetric to changes in serotonin levels and TPH activity following parachlorophenylalanine treatment (11Cortes R. Mengod G. Celasa P. Artigas F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that feedback control of serotonin biosynthesis may occur by transcriptional regulation of TPH gene expression. A significant obstacle to the study of TPH transcription has been the absence of a good model system. Few neuronal cell lines express TPH. Previous studies of TPH promoter activity have been conducted in mouse mastocytoma cells (12Reed G.E. Kirchner J.E. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1995; 682: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Teerawatanasuk N. Carr L.G. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Teerawatanasuk N.

Res. 1998; 52: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), or non-TPH-expressing cell lines (12Reed G.E. Kirchner J.E. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1995; 682: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Teerawatanasuk N. Carr L.G. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Boularand S.

RN46A cells are a good model but have limitations due to culture and transfection difficulties. We have used the rat CA77 thyroid C-cell cell line. Thyroid C cells share a similar ontogeny from the neural crest with TPH-expressing enteric neurons in the gut (17Clark M.S. Lanigan T.M. Page N.M. Russo A.F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6167-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CA77 cells express a number of serotonergic and neuronal markers, including TPH, the 5-HT1B autoreceptor, the 5-HT transporter, and regulated secretion of serotonin (17Clark M.S. Lanigan T.M. Page N.M. Russo A.F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6167-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Clark M.S. Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. Methods. 1995; 7: 253-261Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These features make CA77 cells a reasonable model for studying the regulation of serotonin biosynthesis in a neuronal setting. In the present study, we demonstrate that the selective 5-HT1 agonist CGS 12066A (CGS) decreases TPH mRNA levels and represses TPH promoter activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that CGS acts through 5-HT1 receptors in CA77 cells (19Durham P.L. Sharma R. Russo A.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9545-9553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Durham P.L. Russo A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using transient transfection reporter gene assays, we also show that CGS blocks activation of a cell-specific MAP kinase-responsive element in the TPH promoter. In addition, we provide evidence for binding of the NF-Y transcription factor and at least one other, possibly cell-specific, factor to the MAP kinase-responsive element. CA77 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose; 1:1) with 10‥ fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C and 7‥ CO2. CHO-IR/ER (CHO cell line stably transfected with the insulin and epidermal growth factor receptors) cells were kindly provided by Jeffrey Pessin (University of Iowa) (21Okada S. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20737-20741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). CHO-IR/ER (CHO) cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium with 10‥ FBS and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C and 5‥ CO2. GH3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) with 2.5‥ FBS and 15‥ horse serum at 37 °C and 5‥ CO2. NIH3T3 and N2A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 10‥ FBS at 37 °C and 5‥ CO2. P815 cells were kindly provided by John Harty (University of Iowa) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10‥ FBS, 5 mm HEPES, 1.375 mml-glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C and 5‥ CO2. Adherent cell lines were subcultured by brief treatment with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). For 24 h prior to transfections and RNA isolation, all cells, except P815 cells, were subcultured in serum-free media supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS; Collaborative Biomedical Products) (18Clark M.S. Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. Methods. 1995; 7: 253-261Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). P815 cells maintained in serum-free conditions for 24 h prior to transfection yielded unusually low luciferase activities. Results obtained under these conditions, however, were similar to those from experiments without the serum-free period before transfection. All media contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CGS 12066A monomaleate (Research Biochemicals International) was prepared as a 10 mm solution in 0.1 n HCl and diluted to a final concentration of 10 μm (19Durham P.L. Sharma R. Russo A.F. J.

In all studies using CGS or MAP kinase inhibitors, control cells were treated with an equivalent amount of vehicle (final concentration 0.0001 n HCl or 0.125‥ Me2SO, respectively). Poly(A) RNA was isolated from CA77 cells using the FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). Samples of 1 μg of poly(A) RNA were electrophoresed through a 1.2‥ formaldehyde-agarose gel, blotted to nylon membrane, and hybridized as previously described (24Russo A.F. Lanigan T.M. Sullivan B.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar). Bases 942–1338 of the rat TPH cDNA were cloned into plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega) by PCR to generate pcTPH400. TPH cDNA probe (396 bp) was prepared by restriction digestion of pcTPH400 with NcoI and NdeI and labeling with [α-32P]dATP (20 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a random hexamer priming kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following quantification of the TPH probe signal, membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled rabbit mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (COII) cDNA probe (25Durham P.L. Nanthakumar E.J. Snyder J.M. Exp. Lung Res. 1992; 18: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Signals were quantified using the InstantImager or NIH Image software. Analysis of blots with both methods yielded similar results. To normalize for RNA loading and nonspecific effects of CGS, total signals for the 4.0- and 1.8-kb TPH bands were combined then divided by total COII signal. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's paired t test. Plasmid p6N2 containing 12 kb of DNA 5′ to the murine TPH transcription start site was kindly provided by David Neilsen (National Institute of Mental Health) (26Stoll J. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TPH0.7-luc and TPH0.15-luc were generated by PCR amplification of sequence from −717 to +90 and from −149 to +90, respectively, from p6N2 with primers containing BamHI (−149) and NcoI (+90) sites using the Extend high fidelity PCR amplification system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (forward primer TPH0.7-luc, ACGGATCCGTGTCCTAAGACTAGT; forward primer TPH0.15-luc, 5′-ACGGATCCGGGGCAAGCTGCTCCCGCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCATGGCCTTGCTGGGAGTCTTCTG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), excised with BamHI and NcoI, and cloned into BglII/NcoI-digested pGL3-Basic (Promega). TPH0.045-luc was generated by PCR amplification of sequence from −45 to +90 bp from TPH0.15-luc (TPH0.045-luc forward primer, 5′-TGACGATGCGCTTCTCCTAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCCTTGCTGGGAGTCTTCTG-3′). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy, excised with NcoI and SacI, and cloned into SacI/SmaI-digested pGL3-Basic. TPH0.069-luc was cloned by PCR amplification of −69 of the TPH promoter to +134 bp of the luciferase gene from TPH0.15-luc (forward primer, 5′-TGCGCCCGGCGCCCATTGGCCGTTCTGACG-3′; reverse primer (pGL3), 5′-GGATAGAATGGCGCCGGGCC-3′). Overhangs left by Taqpolymerase were removed with T4 DNA polymerase. The fragment was digested with NcoI and cloned intoSmaI/NcoI-digested pGL3-Basic. The 5′ T of the forward primer was lost, yielding a construct with 69 bp of promoter sequence. TPH7x2-SV40luc was constructed from complementary oligonucleotides from −70 to −41 bp with partial KpnI ends (5′-cTGCGCCCGGCGCCCATTGGCCGTTCTGACGggtac-3′ and its complement 5′-cCGTCAGAACGGCCAATGGGCGCCGGGCGCAggtac-3′). Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated on the 5′ ends by T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed, and ligated into KpnI-digested pGL3 promoter (Promega). TPH9-SV40luc was constructed by PCR amplification from TPH0.7-luc of sequence from −151 to −65 bp with primers containing KpnI (forward) or BglII (reverse) sites (forward primer, 5′-acgggtaccTCAGGGCAAGCTGCTCCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′ tcgagatctGGCGCACGGTTGAGGATA-3′). Following BglII andKpnI digestion, the PCR product was cloned intoBglII/KpnI-digested pGL3-promoter (Promega). TPHmut0.15-luc was generated by PCR from TPH0.15-luc of two overlapping fragments containing the mutations. The first fragment extended from the RVprimer3 site in pGL3-Basic to −48 of the TPH promoter (forward primer, RVprimer3 (Promega); reverse primer (TPH), 5′-ACGGCTAAAGGGCGCCGGGCGCACGGTT-3′). The second fragment extended from −61 of the TPH promoter to base pair 134 of pGL3-Basic (forward primer (TPH), 5′-CGCCCTTTAGCCGTTCTGACGATGCGC-3′; reverse primer (pGL3), 5′-GGATAGAATGGCGCCGGGCC-3′). Gel-purified PCR products were combined and amplified using the pGL3-Basic primers. The resulting product was cut with XbaI and NcoI and cloned intoXbaI/NcoI digested pGL3-Basic. All cloned DNA was confirmed by sequencing. The following plasmids are part of the Path Detect System (Stratagene): MEKK (amino acids 380–672) expression vector, MEK1 (S218/222E, Δ32–51) expression vector, Elk1 transactivation domain (amino acids 307–428) fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) (pFA-Elk), ATF2 transactivation domain (amino acids 1–96) fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) (pFA-ATF2), and the Gal4 luciferase reporter plasmid (pFR-Luc). CA77 cells (3–5 × 106) were transfected by electroporation in PBS at 220 mV, 960 microfarads as previously described (27Lanigan T.M. Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6079-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with 2.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 3.0 μg of MEKK using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus. CHO cells were similarly transfected, but at 340 V with 0.5–10 μg of MEKK. In transfections lacking MEKK, CMV5 vector control plasmid DNA was used to provide equal amounts of DNA in all transfections. In experiments using the Elk1/Gal4 or ATF2/Gal4 reporter system, 2–3 μg of pFR-Luc, 0.5–1.0 μg of pFA-Elk or pFA-ATF2, and 0.5–1.0 μg of MEKK plasmid were used. To ensure equal transfection efficiency between CGS or MAP kinase inhibitor-treated cells and controls, electroporations were divided equally between 60-mm dishes containing serum-free media. Cells were treated with 10 μm CGS or vehicle control (0.0001 n HCl) for 24 h immediately following transfection except for the CGS time course, when cells were treated with 10 μm CGS for varying amounts of time immediately following transfection and the CGS-containing media were replaced with serum-free ITS media for the time remaining until harvest. For MAP kinase inhibitor experiments, cells were treated with 25 μm SB203580, 10 μm U0126, 10 μm U0124, or vehicle control (0.125‥ Me2SO) in serum-free ITS media for 6 h prior to harvest (22Kultz D.

For adherent cell lines, 1–2 × 105 cells were seeded in 12-well dishes in serum-free ITS media 24 h prior to transfection. For P815 cells, 5 × 105 cells were added to 12-well dishes in serum-free ITS media without antibiotics at the time of transfection. 0.5 μg of TPH0.15-luc or SV40-luc (pGL3-promoter; Promega) were cotransfected with 50 ng to 2.0 μg of MEKK plasmid. For controls, 0.5 μg of pFR-Luc and 0.25 μg of pFA-Elk or pFA-ATF2 were cotransfected with 50–250 ng of MEKK plasmid. CMV5 vector DNA was used to bring total DNA amounts to 2.5 μg in each transfection. Transfections were performed in ITS media without antibiotics with 4 μl (GH3), 6 μl (N2A), 7.5 μl (NIH3T3), or 6 μl (P815) of LipofectAMINE 2000/well. 1.0–2.0 μg of β-galactosidase control vector (pSV-βgal; Promega) was included in some experiments (electroporations and LipofectAMINE transfections) to correct for transfection efficiency; however, it was activated ∼2-fold by MEKK. CGS had no effect on pSV-βgal. In transfections lacking MEKK, no significant variations in transfection efficiency were observed. After 20–24 h, cells were assayed for luciferase activity using reagents from Promega and protein using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activities were normalized to protein concentration. In some experiments, activities were also normalized to pGL3-Basic or pGL3-promoter activity to control for variation in basal promoter activity between independent experiments. All experiments were repeated at least three times with assays performed in duplicate. Statistical analyses were done using the Student's paired t test. CA77 cells were transfected with MEKK or CMV5 and harvested 24 h later. For sorbitol-treated controls, an equivalent number of cells were incubated in 0.6 msorbitol for 30 min before harvesting. Cells were washed in PBS, removed from dishes by scraping, and centrifuged to pellet. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega)/1× cell lysis buffer (MAP kinase assay kit; New England Biolabs) and removal of cellular debris by centrifugation. 10 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as previously described (20Durham P.L. Russo A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-active MAP kinase antibodies (Promega) were used at the following dilutions: ERK and JNK, 1:5000; p38, 1:2000. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies recognizing total (active and inactive) forms of ERK, JNK, or p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:200. Oligonucleotides used for EMSA were synthesized with partial BamHI ends (lowercase): TPH7 (wild type inverted CCAAT), 5′-gatccTGCGCCCGGCGCCCATTGGCCGTTCTGACGg-3′, and its complement, 5′-gatccCGTCAGAACGGCCAATGGGCGCCGGGCGCAg-3′; TPHmut 7 (mutant inverted CCAAT), 5′-gatccTGCGCCCGGCGCCCTTTAGCCGTTCTGACGg-3′, and its complement, 5′-gatccCGTCAGAACGGCTAAAGGGCGCCGGGCGCAg-3′ (mutations in boldface type). NF-Y, Sp1, and C/EBP consensus oligonucleotides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Oligonucleotides were annealed, labeled with [α-32P]dATP (20 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol) using Klenow polymerase, and purified through a Sephadex G-25 column. Cold competitor oligonucleotides were similarly prepared in the absence of [α-32P]dATP. Nuclear extracts were prepared with a modified Dignam protocol (28Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained 0.02 pmol of labeled oligonucleotide (100,000–150,000 cpm), 3 μg of nuclear extract, 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and binding buffer (27Lanigan T.M. Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6079-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For some experiments, nuclear extracts were prepared from CA77 cells treated with CGS for 24 h. For competition assays, competitor oligonucleotides (1.0 pmol) and nuclear extract were preincubated for 15 min on ice prior to the addition of probe. For supershift assays, probe and nuclear extracts were preincubated on ice for 15 min prior to the addition of antibody (1–3 μl of Trans-X). The following rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.: NF-Y-B (c-18), Sp1 (PEP-2), and C/EBP2 (14AA). Reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min and then resolved on a 6‥ polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 0.25× TBE (Tris, borate, EDTA, pH 8.5) at 250 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to film with an intensifying screen for 2–20 h. To examine the effects of 5-HT1 agonists on TPH expression, CA77 cells were treated with the selective 5-HT1 receptor agonist CGS. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that CGS preferentially interacts with rat and human 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D (29Boess F.G. Martin I.L. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 275-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), and presumably 5-HT1F receptors. The selectivity of CGS for 5-HT1 receptors in CA77 cells has previously been demonstrated in CA77 cells using the 5-HT1 antagonist methiothepin (19Durham P.L. Sharma R. Russo A.F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9545-9553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CA77 cells were treated for 24 h with CGS or vehicle control prior to isolation of poly(A) RNA. These conditions gave maximal effects of CGS on TPH promoter activity in transient transfection assays (data not shown). Northern blot analysis detected two TPH mRNA species of ∼4.0 and 1.8 kb, as previously identified in neuronal cells (18Clark M.S. Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. Methods. 1995; 7: 253-261Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Darmon M.C. Guibert B. Leviel V. Ehret M. Maitre M. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). To demonstrate specificity of CGS effects, blots were also hybridized with a cytochrome oxidase II (COII) probe, and TPH signals were normalized to COII. Total TPH mRNA levels were decreased by nearly one-half in CGS-treated cells, compared with levels in control-treated cells (p = 0.02) (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that TPH mRNA levels are decreased by 5-HT1 receptor activation. To determine if the observed changes in mRNA levels were due to CGS repression of transcription from the TPH promoter, CA77 cells were transiently transfected with TPH promoter luciferase reporter gene constructs. Transfected cells were divided equally between two dishes and treated with CGS or vehicle control for 24 h. CGS repressed basal transcriptional activity of the proximal 149 bp of the TPH promoter (TPH0.15-luc) to 57‥ of control levels (p < 0.001) (Fig.2 A). A construct containing 69 bp of TPH 5′-flanking sequence (TPH0.069-luc) was repressed to 55‥ of control levels (p = 0.005). No significant differences in luciferase activity were observed with a construct containing the proximal 45 bp of the TPH promoter (TPH0.045-luc) or promoterless reporter gene vector (pGL3-Basic). These data indicate that the element mediating CGS responsiveness is located between −69 and −45 bp (Fig.2 B). Next, we investigated the mechanism of CGS repression of TPH promoter activity. Two pieces of data suggested that MAP kinase signal transduction pathways may be involved in CGS regulation of the TPH promoter. First, osmotic shock of RN46A cell lines stably transfected with a 3.1-kb TPH promoter-luciferase plasmid resulted in a 50-fold increase in luciferase activity (31Rind H.B. Russo A.F. Whittemore S.R. Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Osmotic shock is a strong activator of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase pathways (32Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). Second, treatment of CA77 cells with CGS results in increased levels of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a repressor of MAP kinase activity (20Durham P.L. Russo A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggested that MAP kinases might stimulate TPH gene transcription. To test this hypothesis, the effects of MAP kinases on TPH promoter activity were examined. MAP kinase signal transduction pathways in CA77 were activated by transfection of a plasmid encoding amino acids 380–672 of MEKK. This truncation of MEKK deletes the regulatory NH2-terminal domain to create a constitutively active protein that acts as an upstream activator of the three major MAP kinases: ERK, JNK, and p38 (32Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar, 33Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with phosphospecific antibodies showed increased levels of the active forms of ERK, JNK, and p38 in cells transfected with MEKK plasmid compared with control plasmid (Fig.3 A). Phosphorylation of ERK by MEKK was considerably less pronounced than activation of JNK and p38 due to much higher basal levels of ERK phosphorylation. These data confirm that MEKK transfection can activate all three MAP kinase pathways in CA77 cells. CA77 cells were also cotransfected with MEKK and a Gal4/Elk1 or Gal4/ATF2 reporter system. These synthetic reporters contain a luciferase gene with Gal4 DNA-binding sites (pFR-Luc) and a plasmid encoding the Elk1 transactivation domain (pFA-Elk) or ATF2 transactivation domain (pFA-ATF2) linked to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The transcription factor Elk can be activated by all three major MAP kinases, while ATF2 is activated by JNK and p38 (34Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the Western blot data, the pFA-Elk transactivator stimulated pFR-Luc promoter activity ∼50-fold when cotransfected with MEKK in CA77 cells (p < 0.001), and the pFA-ATF2 construct stimulated the pFR-Luc promoter about 700-fold (p = 0.002) (data not shown). Previous studies in CA77 cells have described CGS effects on MAP kinase activity. When transfected with plasmid encoding constitutively active MEK1, CGS represses ERK phosphorylation (20Durham P.L. Russo A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In cells cotransfect"

It remains poorly understood how the nuclear transport pathway responds to increased demands for nucleocytoplasmic communication. A case in point is cellular hypertrophy in which increased amounts of genetic material need to be transported from the nucleus to the cytosol. Here, we report an adaptive down-regulation of nuclear import supporting such an increased demand for nuclear export. The induction of cardiac cell hypertrophy by phenylephrine or angiotensin II inhibited the nuclear translocation of H1 histones. The removal of hypertrophic stimuli reversed the hypertrophic phenotype and restored nuclear import. Moreover, the inhibition of nuclear export by leptomycin B rescued import. Hypertrophic reprogramming increased the intracellular GTP/GDP ratio and promoted the nuclear redistribution of the GTP-binding transport factor Ran, favoring export over import. Further, in hypertrophy, the reduced creatine kinase and adenylate kinase activities limited energy delivery to the nuclear pore. The reduction of activities was associated with the closure of the cytoplasmic phase of the nuclear pore preventing import at the translocation step. Thus, to overcome the limited capacity for nucleocytoplasmic transport, cells requiring increased nuclear export regulate the nuclear transport pathway by undergoing a metabolic and structural restriction of nuclear import.

The nuclear envelope, which separates the nuclear content from the cytoplasm, mediates the transport required for the regulation of gene expression and processing of genetic information (14Dingwall C.

Bioessays. 2001; 23: 77-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that traffic through the nuclear pores is a dynamic process determined by the functional and metabolic state of a cell. We report a down-regulated nuclear import in hypertrophy, which is restored by the removal of the hypertrophic signal or blockade of nuclear export. Thus, cardiac cells suppress nuclear import under conditions of increased demand for nucleocytoplasmic communication to secure the availability of the nuclear transport pathways required for the generation of the hypertrophic phenotype. Hearts were removed from 1–2-day-old rats, and cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured (29Perez-Terzic C. Gacy A.M. Bortolon R. Dzeja P.P. Puceat M. Jaconi M. Prendergast F.G. Terzic A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hypertrophy was induced with phenylephrine (100 μm), an α-adrenoreceptor agonist (in the presence of 10 μm propranolol, a β-adrenoreceptor antagonist), or with angiotensin II (100 nm). Myocyte size and sarcomeric α-actin content were used as markers of hypertrophy (4Izumo S. Lompre A.M. Matsuoka R. Koren G. Schwartz K. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 970-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Size was quantified by measuring the cell surface area with laser confocal microscopy (LSM 410 Carl Zeiss) and a × 40 (1.3 NA) objective. The expression of α-actin was determined by phalloidin staining that recognizes sarcomeric actin. To this end, cells fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde were incubated (20 min) with 20 nm phalloidin tagged with fluorescein, washed in 3% Tween in phosphate-buffered saline, and imaged by laser confocal microscopy using a × 63 (1.4 NA) objective. The light source was an argon/krypton laser tuned at 488 nm, and emission light was collected using a 510-nm-long pass dichroic beam splitter and a 515-nm-long pass emission filter. Two-dimensional confocal images were acquired by scanning 512 × 512 pixels per image and processed on a Silicon Graphics Iris Computer with ANALYZE software (Mayo Foundation). Control or hypertrophied cardiomyocytes were transferred to prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and 20 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime (Sigma). Microinjections into the cytosol were carried out with a nanometer-precision microinjector unit (Eppendorf 5242) coupled to a micromanipulator (Eppendorf 5171) mounted on a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiovert 100) (29Perez-Terzic C.

Cardiomyocytes were superfused with 116 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 4 mm NaHCO3, 21 mm HEPES, and 1 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Nuclear transport was measured using × 40 (1.3 NA) or × 63 (1.4 NA) objectives on a laser confocal imaging system (LSM 410). The thickness of the optical sections of imaged cells was set at 1–2 μm to discriminate fluorescence emitted from nuclear versusnonnuclear regions. Fluorescent probes were excited (at 488 nm) using an argon/krypton visible laser (Omnichrome), and emission spectra were collected using a 510-nm-long pass dichroic beam splitter and a 515-nm-long pass emission filter. Confocal images were acquired by scanning a field at 16 s/frame. Fluorescence intensity in the nucleusversus the cytosol was determined with ANALYZE on a Silicon Graphics Iris computer. Nuclear accumulation was expressed as the ratio of nuclear over cytosolic fluorescence (27Stehno-Bittel L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E.

To localize the monomeric GTPase Ran, cardiomyocytes were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with an anti-Ran monoclonal antibody (32Hieda M. Tachibana T. Yokoya F. Kose S. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Optical z-sections of cells (0.2 μm) were acquired with a 1300 YHS CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) using an objective mounted on a piezoelectric controller driven by the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) (33Meyer N. Jaconi M. Landopoulou A. Fort P. Puceat M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Images were processed by the Imaris software (Bitplane) using the isosurface module (for three-dimensional reconstruction) following digital deconvolution (Huygens, Scientific Volume Imaging) (33Meyer N. Jaconi M. Landopoulou A. Fort P. Puceat M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine nucleotide levels, perchloric acid cardiomyocyte extracts were prepared (34Dzeja P.P. Vitkevicius K.T. Redfield M.M. Burnett J.C. Terzic A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cells, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immersed into liquid nitrogen, were layered with 0.6 m HClO4 and 1 mmEDTA and then centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 4 °C) (Hermline Z230 MA microcentrifuge, Labnet). The supernatant was neutralized with 2m K2HCO3, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. ATP was measured in the supernatant by using a coupled enzyme assay in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm glucose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μmNADP+, 20 μm diadenosine pentaphosphate, 4 units/ml of hexokinase, and 2 units/ml of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. NADPH levels, reflecting ATP concentration, were measured using a fluorometer with a minicell kit (Turner TD-700). ATP, GTP, and GDP were also determined by HPLC (System Gold, Beckman) using a QHR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nucleotides were eluted with a linear gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer. Cells were extracted with 150 mm NaCl, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.2% Triton X-100 and were then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C). Creatine kinase activity was measured with a Beckman DU 7400 spectrophotometer in 100 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 20 mm glucose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NADP+, 2 mm ADP, 5 mm AMP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 20 μm diadenosine pentaphosphate, 4.5 units/ml hexokinase, and 2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (35Dzeja P.P.

Cardiac nuclei were imaged with transmitted and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Cardiomyocytes were fixed in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde (pH 7.2). For transmitted scanning electron microscopy, cells were postfixed in phosphate-buffered 1% OsO4, stained en blocwith 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in low viscosity epoxy resin. Thin (90-nm) sections were cut on an ultramicrotome (Reichert Ultracut E), placed on 200-μm mesh copper grids, and stained with lead citrate. Micrographs were taken on a JEOL 1200 EXII electron microscope operating at 60 kV. For FESEM, cardiomyocytes were stripped of sarcolemma by using a hypotonic solution followed by a 5-min treatment with 1% Triton X-100 (29Perez-Terzic C. Gacy A.M. Bortolon R. Dzeja P.P. Puceat M. Jaconi M. Prendergast F.G. Terzic A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sarcolemma-stripped cardiomyocytes were fixed in situ with 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). The specimen was rinsed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and the buffer was supplemented with 1% osmium. Cells, which were dehydrated with ethanol and dried in a critical point dryer, were coated with platinum using an Ion Tech indirect argon ion voltage of 9.5 kV and 4.2 mA and then examined at accelerating voltages (1.0, 2.4, 3.5, and 5.0 kV) on a JEOL JSM 6400 field-emission scanning microscope. Contact-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed in air with silicon nitride NP-S tips (spring constant, 0.58 newtons/m) using a Digital Instruments Multimode AFM with a Nanoscope III controller (29Perez-Terzic C. Gacy A.M. Bortolon R. Dzeja P.P. Puceat M. Jaconi M. Prendergast F.G. Terzic A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The nuclear envelope of sarcolemma-stripped and fixed cardiomyocytes was scanned with an E-type (15 × 15 μm maximum area) scanner. Images were collected by raster scanning at 512 pixels/line with linear scanning frequencies ranging from 5 to 15 Hz to build 512 × 512 pixel images. AFM images were analyzed using Nanoscope IIIa software, and three-dimensional images were generated from topographical height information. Open and closed states of individual nuclear pore complexes were determined from 3 × 3 μm scans. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out by the Student's ttest. The significant difference was accepted at the p< 0.05 level. Neonatal cardiomyocytes treated with growth factors such as α1-adrenoreceptor agonists are an established cell system of hypertrophy (9Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 12Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Within 12 h of phenylephrine treatment (100 μm), cardiomyocytes nearly doubled in size from 655 ± 49 μm2 (n = 40) to 1158 ± 91 μm2 (n = 21) and markedly increased their content of actin filaments organized in contractile myofibrils (Fig. 1). Cardiomyocytes further enlarged to 1580 ± 143 μm2 (n = 32) and 1950 ± 177 μm2 (n = 28) at 24 and 48 h following phenylephrine treatment. Histones, major constituents of eukaryotic chromatin, are imported into nuclei by active transport (36Thomas J.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 37Breeuwer M. Goldfarb D.S. Cell. 1990; 60: 999-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 38Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). When microinjected into the cytosol of control cardiomyocytes, fluorescein-tagged histone 1 (fl-H1) were readily transported into the nucleus, resulting in pronounced nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 1). However, early in hypertrophy, the active import of fl-H1 was down-regulated with the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, an index of nuclear transport (27Stehno-Bittel L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1835-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Perez-Terzic C. Gacy A.M. Bortolon R. Dzeja P.P. Puceat M. Jaconi M. Prendergast F.G. Terzic A. Circ.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), decreasing by 74% from 3.18 ± 0.23 (n = 54) to 0.82 ± 0.12 (n = 7) within 12 h following the addition of phenylephrine (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). With prolonged hypertrophy (48 h), the import of fl-H1 remained at reduced levels with the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of 0.74 ± 0.20 (n = 59) (Fig. 1). To determine whether the down-regulated transport of fl-H1 was attributable to hypertrophy rather than to a nonhypertrophy-related effect of phenylephrine, we evaluated nuclear transport in cells in which hypertrophy was induced through another receptor system. Angiotensin II (100 nm), which acts via angiotensin receptors (12Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), also induced hypertrophy, and the cell surface increased from 933 ± 57 μm2 (n = 81) to 2176 ± 288 μm2 (n = 24 at 48 h of treatment). In angiotensin II-treated cells, the nuclear import of fl-H1 was also rapidly reduced within 12 h, and the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio decreased by 57% (from 3.35 ± 0.23,n = 47 to 1.43 ± 0.34, n = 12;p < 0.05). Like phenylephrine and angiotensin II, the purinergic agonist ATP activates the phosphoinositide pathway without, however, inducing hypertrophy (40Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Inositol trisphosphate, a product of this pathway, releases Ca2+ from the nuclear cisterna and can inhibit nuclear import (27Stehno-Bittel L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1835-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 39Greber U.F. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 41Perez-Terzic C. Jaconi M. Clapham D.E. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that impaired transport in hypertrophied cells was attributable to the inositol trisphosphate-induced decrease in cisternal Ca2+, we examined cells treated with ATP (50 μm, 48 h). ATP did not increase the cell size or actin content (40Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), but it activated phosphoinositide turnover (42Puceat M. Vassort G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cell surface was 582 ± 36 μm2 (n = 81) and 618 ± 43 μm2 (n = 62) in untreated and ATP-treated cells, respectively (p > 0.05). In ATP-treated cells, even following prolonged exposure (48 h) to the purinergic agonist, fl-H1 was readily imported in the nucleus. The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio for fl-H1 was 3.35 ± 0.23 (n = 47) and 3.12 ± 0.33 (n = 6) in controls and ATP-treated cells (p > 0.05), respectively. Thus, the down-regulation of active nuclear import is concomitant with the development of cell hypertrophy. Small molecular weight molecules such as dextrans commonly lack a nuclear localization signal and passively diffuse into the nucleus (39Greber U.F. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When microinjected into the cytosol, fluorescein-conjugated 10-kDa dextrans diffused readily into the nucleus of control cells (Fig. 1). With the development of hypertrophy, passive diffusion appeared unaltered with nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios at 1.66 ± 0.12 (n= 12; 12 h) and 1.78 ± 0.08 (n = 17; 24 h), values not significantly different from the control ratio of 1.58 ± 0.18 (n = 4; p > 0.05) (Fig. 1). The passive diffusion of 10-kDa dextrans decreased only in the advanced stages of hypertrophy. In fact, 48 h was required after the initiation of hypertrophy for a significant reduction in the nucleocytoplasmic ratio (0.65 ± 0.04; n = 5) (Fig. 1). Even smaller molecules such as 3-kDa dextrans demonstrate unregulated diffusion across the nuclear membrane (27Stehno-Bittel L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1835-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Perez-Terzic C. Gacy A.M. Bortolon R. Dzeja P.P. Puceat M. Jaconi M. Prendergast F.G. Terzic A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1292-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) regardless of the hypertrophic state. The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio for 3-kDa dextrans was 1.92 ± 0.10 (n = 16) in control and 1.99 ± 0.10 (n = 14) following 48 h of phenylephrine treatment (p > 0.05). With the removal of the α1-adrenoreceptor agonist, cells progressively returned to their original sizes. At 48 and 72 h after the withdrawal of phenylephrine, the cell surface was 910 ± 103 μm2 (n = 11) and 750 ± 40 μm2 (n = 77), respectively, values close to those obtained prior to hypertrophy (Fig.2). With the reversal of the hypertrophic phenotype, active nuclear import was partially restored with a nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of 1.94 ± 0.21 (n = 11). This represents an increase of 61% of the control, compared with ∼25% of the control at 12 and 48 h of hypertrophy (Fig. 2). With the removal of the hypertrophic stimulus, passive nuclear diffusion promptly returned to prehypertrophy values with a nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of 2.08 ± 0.10 (n = 9) within 48 h of phenylephrine withdrawal (Fig. 2). Thus, the increase in cell size and the down-regulation of nuclear import are reversed on the removal of the hypertrophic signal. With hypertrophy, a more dense actin network may have impeded transfer to the nuclear surface, thereby precluding nuclear import. Cytochalasin B (20 μm), a disrupter of the cytoskeleton (43Terzic A. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 492: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), reduced the organized actin networks but did not improve nuclear import in hypertrophied cells (data not shown). Rather, in hypertrophy an increased amount of mRNA needs to be transported from the nucleus into the cytosol (1Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 2McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1999; 9: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Swynghedauw B.

Optimal nuclear export requires a high cellular GTP/GDP ratio along with the nuclear availability of the GTP-binding protein Ran (20Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 21Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 32Hieda M. Tachibana T. Yokoya F. Kose S. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here, the GTP/GDP ratio increased from 2.7 in normal cardiomyocytes to 3.6 in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes (Fig.3 a). Moreover, Ran immunofluorescence, although diffusely distributed throughout the control cardiomyocytes, was primarily confined to the nucleus of hypertrophied cells (Fig. 3, a–c). Thus, cellular hypertrophy promotes the rearrangement of nuclear transport factors that favor export over import. TheStreptomyces metabolite leptomycin B is a potent inhibitor of nuclear export through binding to exportin, the export shuttle protein (44Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P.

Sci. 1990; 15: 153-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), but their precise function is largely unknown. The biosynthesis of polyamines in yeast and most of animals depends on the decarboxylation of ornithine to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC,1 EC 4.1.1.17). Subsequent attachment of an aminopropyl moiety forms spermidine, and the second aminopropyl transfer to spermidine yields spermine. Decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine serves as the aminopropyl donor, which is produced by S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC, EC 4.1.1.50). Both the decarboxylating enzymes are highly regulated and subject to control by cellular polyamines.In mammalian cells, ODC is negatively regulated in response to the increase in cellular polyamines mainly through a unique mechanism mediated by a protein termed antizyme (4Heller J.S.

Biochem. 1995; 229: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, computer search of an antizyme homolog in the completed genome of S. cerevisiae has been negative (20Zhu C. Karplus K. Grate L. Coffino P. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In a filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, spermidine and putrescine accelerate the turnover of ODC protein (21Barnett G.R. Seyfzadeh M. Davis R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10005-10008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a presumed antizyme homolog has been noted in the N. crassa genome (AF291578, MIPS Neurospora data base).Although S. cerevisiae and the fission yeast,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, are both ascomycetous fungi, they are almost as divergent each other as between these and mammals (22Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1986; 45: 781-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).S. pombe is often more similar to mammalian cells thanS. cerevisiae in various aspects. Interestingly, the frameshift signal of mammalian antizyme directs the correct +1 shift inS. pombe, but aberrant −2 shift in S. cerevisiae(23Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Wills N.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1360-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Matsufuji S. Atkins J.F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1230-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Very recently, Ivanov et al. (25Ivanov I.P. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1907-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) identified an antizyme gene in S. pombe demonstrating its frameshift induction by polyamines, involvement in the cellular polyamine control, and inhibitory activity on ODC. Deletion of antizyme gene (SPA) from the fisson yeast genome did not bring about apparent phenotypes, but resulted in the increase in putrescine, spermidine, and cadaverine, which was more prominently observed in the cells at stationary phase than in exponentially growing cells, whereas overexpression of SPA led to large reduction in the cellular level of polyamines (25Ivanov I.P. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1907-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A role for antizyme in ODC degradation in S. pombe cells, however, was not demonstrated.In the present paper, we studied the mechanism of ODC repression by spermidine in S. pombe. In order to be able to regulate cellular spermidine experimentally, we cloned and disrupted S. pombe gene for AdoMetDC (spe2). We show that the null mutant of spe2 (Δspe2) is devoid of spermidine and spermine and contains a high ODC activity, which is rapidly repressed in response to addition of spermidine through antizyme-dependent ODC degradation catalyzed by proteasome. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence of antizyme being involved in the regulation of ODC degradation in single-cellular eukaryotes.DISCUSSIONMammalian antizyme represents a unique regulatory protein with a number of novel features, namely (i) expression and induction through translational frameshifting, (ii) the function as a non-ubiquitin stimulator for proteolysis of ODC by the proteasome, and (iii) dual activity on ODC and polyamine transporter. The frameshift induction serves as a polyamine sensor. The feedback system allows both the maintenance of the cellular polyamines within a certain range and their appropriate fluctuation. The molecular mechanisms of antizyme functions, however, have not been fully understood. In addition to the availability of genetics, recent identification of antizyme in S. pombe (25Ivanov I.P. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1907-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) makes the organism particularly an attractive system to study the mechanisms of antizyme functions.The wild type S. pombe cells contain a high endogenous level of spermidine, which is not readily changed by exogenous spermidine. To study the feedback control of ODC by exogenous polyamines, use of mutants lacking spermidine synthesis appears to be useful as shown inS. cerevisiae (17Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Toth C. Coffino P. J. Biol.

Therefore, we intended to clone and disrupt S. pombe gene for AdoMetDC, spe2.The Δspe2 mutant (spe2::ura4) cease dividing after several generations in polyamine-free medium. The mutant contained a large excess of putrescine and cadaverine, indicating indispensability of spermidine and spermine for growth in the organism. The essential role of spermidine and spermine was also demonstrated in S. cerevisiae and N. crassa (40Balasundaram D. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5872-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 41Pitkin J. Davis R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Δspe2mutant of the budding yeast showed an increase in cell size, a decrease in budding, accumulation of vesicle-like bodies, and abnormal distribution of actin-like material (40Balasundaram D. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5872-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the presence of oxygen, a rapid cessation of cell growth and associated cell death were observed (42Balasundaram D. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar studies in S. pombe are yet to be performed.Wild type S. pombe cells contain very low basal level of ODC. It was induced by changing medium, but subject to rapid repression due probably to increase in the endogenous polyamines (Fig.4 A). In Δspe2 cells ODC is elevated (Fig.4 B) despite a large accumulation of putrescine (Fig. 2). Spermidine added to the culture medium could rapidly repress ODC (Fig.4 B). It is of interest to note that S. pombe ODC is repressed by spermidine, but not effectively by putrescine, in connection with the observation that spermidine or spermine, but not putrescine, supports cellular growth. In S. cerevisiae, ODC decay is accelerated by putrescine to much less extent than by spermidine (43Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas N. crassa ODC is strongly destabilized by both spermidine and putrescine (21Barnett G.R. Seyfzadeh M. Davis R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10005-10008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The half-life of ODC activity was greatly shortened by spermidine in Δspe2 cells (Fig. 5 A). The ODC decay is mostly attributable to a change in ODC protein (Fig. 5 B). The accelerated ODC decay was prevented by the inhibitor of protein synthesis, but not by the inhibitor of RNA synthesis. In addition, it was found that a part of ODC existed as an inactive complex, from which active ODC is released by the competitors such as DFMO-ODC or antizyme inhibitor (Fig. 6). Although the fraction of ODC forming the inactive complex was increased by spermidine, it only accounts for a part of ODC decay in the activity. All these results are compatible with a model that antizyme is induced through the stimulation of translational frameshifting by spermidine, bound to ODC forming inactive complex, and promotes ODC protein for rapid degradation. The half-life of ODC activity in the spermidine-treated cells, 65 min (Fig. 5 A), is not as short as those observed in mammalian cells, but comparable to those in S. cerevisiae in the repressed conditions (17Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,43Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Using an S. pombe mutant lacking antizyme and AdoMetDC (spa::Leu2 spe2::Ura4), we show requirement of antizyme for the accelerated ODC decay. In the absence of functional antizyme gene, the initial ODC activity was slightly higher and the decay of ODC activity after spermidine addition was much retarded than in SPA+ cells (Fig. 7). It is noted, however, that spermidine still promoted ODC decay to a certain extent in the absence of the antizyme in a protein synthesis-dependent manner. This observation may suggest that spermidine not only induces de novo synthesis of the antizyme, but some other protein(s) or additional form(s) of antizyme to causes the slower decay of ODC. The presence of multiple forms of antizyme has been reported from mammalian systems (for review, see Ref. 44Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a lower vertebrate (45Saito T. Hascilowicz T. Ohkido I. Kikuchi Y. Okamoto H. Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We show that S. pombe ODC is subject to the polyamine-stimulated degradation catalyzed by the 26 S proteasome as previously observed in S. cerevisiae and the higher animals. The mechanism by which ODC is targeted for the degradation is very similar between S. pombe and mammals, but substantially different between the two yeast species. S. pombe will serve as a suitable model system to study both the mammalian-type polyamine regulation, and the molecular bases of the difference in ODC regulation among the yeast, which may reflect the difference in the critical features of ODC and the proteasome. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are biologically ubiquitous compounds that have been implicated in many aspects of growth and development in a wide range of organisms (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bagni, N., The Physiology of Polyamines, Bachrach, U., Heimer, Y. M., II, 1989, 107, 120, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL.Google Scholar, 3Heby O. Persson L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 153-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), but their precise function is largely unknown. The biosynthesis of polyamines in yeast and most of animals depends on the decarboxylation of ornithine to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC,1 EC 4.1.1.17). Subsequent attachment of an aminopropyl moiety forms spermidine, and the second aminopropyl transfer to spermidine yields spermine. Decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine serves as the aminopropyl donor, which is produced by S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC, EC 4.1.1.50). Both the decarboxylating enzymes are highly regulated and subject to control by cellular polyamines. In mammalian cells, ODC is negatively regulated in response to the increase in cellular polyamines mainly through a unique mechanism mediated by a protein termed antizyme (4Heller J.S. Fong W.F. Canellakis E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 5Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Synthesis of antizyme requires translational frameshifting, which occurs at the end of the initiating frame or open reading frame 1 (ORF1) (6Rom E. Kahana C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3959-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 7Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The ribosome shifts its reading frame to the +1 frame and continues to decode the second ORF to synthesize the entire antizyme protein. The second ORF of antizyme encodes all the known functions of the protein (8Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Polyamines stimulate the frameshifting and thus control the level of antizyme. Antizyme binds to ODC monomer preventing formation of the homodimeric active enzyme. The ODC associated with antizyme is rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome without ubiquitination (11Murakami Y.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7216-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, antizyme negatively regulates the polyamine transporter (14Mitchell J.L.A. Judd G.G. Bareyal-Leyser A. Ling S.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 15Suzuki T. He Y. Kashiwagi K. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain another regulatory protein, antizyme inhibitor, a homolog of ODC without the decarboxylating activity (16Murakami Y. Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3340-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It binds to antizyme with a higher affinity than ODC and releases active ODC from the inactive antizyme-ODC heterodimer. At least in two lower eukaryotes, polyamine-induced destablization of ODC has been studied in detail. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae,spermidine-induced ODC destabilization seems to be dependent on protein synthesis (17Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol.

In the presence of oxygen, a rapid cessation of cell growth and associated cell death were observed (42Balasundaram D. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar studies in S. pombe are yet to be performed. Wild type S. pombe cells contain very low basal level of ODC. It was induced by changing medium, but subject to rapid repression due probably to increase in the endogenous polyamines (Fig.4 A). In Δspe2 cells ODC is elevated (Fig.4 B) despite a large accumulation of putrescine (Fig. 2). Spermidine added to the culture medium could rapidly repress ODC (Fig.4 B). It is of interest to note that S. pombe ODC is repressed by spermidine, but not effectively by putrescine, in connection with the observation that spermidine or spermine, but not putrescine, supports cellular growth. In S. cerevisiae, ODC decay is accelerated by putrescine to much less extent than by spermidine (43Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas N. crassa ODC is strongly destabilized by both spermidine and putrescine (21Barnett G.R. Seyfzadeh M. Davis R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10005-10008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of ODC activity was greatly shortened by spermidine in Δspe2 cells (Fig. 5 A). The ODC decay is mostly attributable to a change in ODC protein (Fig. 5 B). The accelerated ODC decay was prevented by the inhibitor of protein synthesis, but not by the inhibitor of RNA synthesis. In addition, it was found that a part of ODC existed as an inactive complex, from which active ODC is released by the competitors such as DFMO-ODC or antizyme inhibitor (Fig. 6). Although the fraction of ODC forming the inactive complex was increased by spermidine, it only accounts for a part of ODC decay in the activity. All these results are compatible with a model that antizyme is induced through the stimulation of translational frameshifting by spermidine, bound to ODC forming inactive complex, and promotes ODC protein for rapid degradation. The half-life of ODC activity in the spermidine-treated cells, 65 min (Fig. 5 A), is not as short as those observed in mammalian cells, but comparable to those in S. cerevisiae in the repressed conditions (17Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,43Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using an S. pombe mutant lacking antizyme and AdoMetDC (spa::Leu2 spe2::Ura4), we show requirement of antizyme for the accelerated ODC decay. In the absence of functional antizyme gene, the initial ODC activity was slightly higher and the decay of ODC activity after spermidine addition was much retarded than in SPA+ cells (Fig. 7). It is noted, however, that spermidine still promoted ODC decay to a certain extent in the absence of the antizyme in a protein synthesis-dependent manner. This observation may suggest that spermidine not only induces de novo synthesis of the antizyme, but some other protein(s) or additional form(s) of antizyme to causes the slower decay of ODC. The presence of multiple forms of antizyme has been reported from mammalian systems (for review, see Ref. 44Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a lower vertebrate (45Saito T. Hascilowicz T. Ohkido I. Kikuchi Y. Okamoto H. Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that S. pombe ODC is subject to the polyamine-stimulated degradation catalyzed by the 26 S proteasome as previously observed in S. cerevisiae and the higher animals. The mechanism by which ODC is targeted for the degradation is very similar between S. pombe and mammals, but substantially different between the two yeast species. S. pombe will serve as a suitable model system to study both the mammalian-type polyamine regulation, and the molecular bases of the difference in ODC regulation among the yeast, which may reflect the difference in the critical features of ODC and the proteasome.

Here, we describe the regulation of human Pol III transcription in response to sustained cell cycle arrest. The experimental system used is a cell line in which cell cycle arrest is induced by the regulated expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53. We show that the capacity of cells to carry out Pol III transcription from various promoter types, when tested in vitro, is severely reduced in response to sustained p53-mediated cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, this effect does not appear to be due to direct inhibition by p53. By using complementation assays, we demonstrate that a subcomponent of the Pol III transcription factor IIIB, which contains the proteins TATA-binding protein and TAF3B2, is the target of repression. Moreover, we reveal that TAF3B2 levels are markedly reduced in extracts from cell cycle-arrested cells because of a decrease in TAF3B2 protein stability. These findings provide a novel mechanism of Pol III regulation and yield insights into how cellular biosynthetic capacity and growth status can be coordinated.

Proliferation is defined as the increase in the number of cells, which occurs when cells progress through a new cell division cycle. Cell growth, on the other hand, is defined as the increase in mass of an individual cell. Growth is related to the biosynthetic capacity of a cell, a reliable indicator of which is the level of protein synthesis (1Larminie C.G.C. Alzuherri H.M. Cairns C.A. McLees A. White R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conceptually, it seems requisite that the processes of growth and proliferation are linked and that sensitive fine tuning exists between them. At present, however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that ensure that this crucial cross-regulation is achieved.After neoplastic transformation of cells, uncontrolled proliferation is only sustainable if it is linked to deregulated cell growth (2Rosenwald I.B. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Major determinants of protein synthesis are the ribosomes and the machinery that delivers activated amino acids to the ribosomes during translation. Growth is therefore dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of rRNAs and tRNAs. It has been shown that, as cells enter quiescence, existing ribosomes disaggregate into their subunits, the levels of rRNAs and tRNAs decrease, and net protein synthesis is down-regulated. These events are reversed upon mitogenic stimulation (2Rosenwald I.B. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). But how are regulation of growth and regulation of proliferation jointly accomplished? The prevailing model is that tumor suppressor proteins play a crucial role in eliciting this control (1Larminie C.G.C. Alzuherri H.M. Cairns C.A. McLees A. White R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3White R.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar, 4White R.J. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1998; 1: 613-628Google Scholar). For example, the retinoblastoma protein regulates entry into S phase by controlling E2F, a transcription factor involved in the expression of S phase-inducing genes (5Kouzarides T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). It may also affect cell growth potential by repressing the activities of RNA polymerases I (7Cavanaugh A.H. Hempel W.M. Taylor L.J. Rogalsky V. Todorov G. Rothblum L.I. Nature. 1995; 374: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and III (8White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which synthesize rRNAs and tRNAs, respectively. Multi-functional proteins such as retinoblastoma protein may therefore be vital for adjusting cellular growth potential to match proliferative activity. Conversely, as a consequence of losing retinoblastoma protein function, cells may lose control over both proliferation and growth and be put on a fast track toward neoplasia (1Larminie C.G.C. Alzuherri H.M. Cairns C.A. McLees A. White R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).RNA polymerase (Pol)1 III synthesizes a number of small RNA species, including the 5 S rRNA, tRNAs, the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA, the 7SL RNA of the signal recognition particle, and the adenovirus VAI RNA (9White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994Google Scholar). The promoters of genes transcribed by Pol III are subdivided into three groups, type 1, type 2, and type 3 promoters, based on promoter structure and their requirements for basal Pol III transcription factors (10Willis I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). TFIIIA is a monomeric protein factor specific for the promoters of the 5 S rRNA genes (type 1 promoters) (11Engelke D.R. Ng S.-Y. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1980; 19: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 12Ginsberg A.M. King B.O. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1984; 39: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Moorefield B. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIIC is a multimeric protein required for both type 1 and type 2 promoters. Human TFIIIC consists of at least nine polypeptides (14Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and can be split into two subcomponents, TFIIIC1 and TFIIIC2 (15Yoshinaga S.K. Boulanger P.A. Berk A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3585-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For type 3 promoters, only the C1 component of TFIIIC is required as an initiation factor (16Yoon J.-B. Murphy S. Bai L. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Like TFIIIC, TFIIIB is an important Pol III transcription factor involved in initiating transcription on type 1 and type 2 promoters. According to the sequential recruitment model, TFIIIB is assembled into the preinitiation complex by TFIIIC on type 2 promoters or by the TFIIIC-TFIIIA complex on type 1 promoters and is positioned upstream of the transcription start site (17Kassavetis G.A. Burkhard R.B. Lam H.N. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies have shown that TFIIIB then recruits Pol III to the promoter to direct accurate initiation of transcription and can do so even after TFIIIC has been stripped off the promoter (18Chédin S. Ferri M.L. Peyroche G. Andrau J.C. Jourdain S. Lefebvre O. Werner M. Carles C. Sentenac A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; LXIII: 381-389Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). TFIIIB contains the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and various TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (19Buratowski S. Zhou H. Cell. 1992; 71: 221-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Lobo S.M. Tanaka M. Sullivan M.L. Hernandez N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Taggart A.K.P. Fisher T.S. Pugh B.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 1015-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22White R.J. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 1041-1053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the number and identity of TAFs in human TFIIIB have not been fully established, a TAF that has been characterized in some detail is TAF3B2 (previously named BRF or hTFIIIB90) (23Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Mital R. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 7031-7042Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, two additional TAFs that form part of TFIIIB have been identified: hB“, which is the human homologue of the yeast TFIIIB component, B”, and hBRFU/TFIIIB50 (25Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y.L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The aim of the work presented here was to investigate how Pol III transcription is regulated during changes in cell growth and proliferation. Toward this end, we used the human fibroblast cell line TR9–7, derived from a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, in which both copies of the endogenous gene for p53 are inactivated (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). TR9–7 cells are stably transfected with a recombinant construct that allows for the inducible expression of p53 from a tetracycline-controlled promoter. Thus, whereas p53 expression is barely detectable in TR9–7 cells grown in the presence of 1 μg/ml of tetracycline, decreasing the tetracycline concentration in the growth medium results in an increase in both p53 expression and function, as determined by the induction of the p53-responsive p21/Waf1 gene (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of p53 expression in TR9–7 cells upon tetracycline withdrawal are comparable with those induced in a wild-type cell line in response to DNA damage (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This degree of p53 induction in the TR9–7 cells results in a slow onset, reversible cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2/M stages of the cell cycle. Complete cell cycle arrest is achieved 4–6 days after the onset of p53 induction. TR9–7 cells can be maintained in this arrested state for up to 20 days and yet can still return to a normal cycling state afterward (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The TR9–7 cell line therefore provides a versatile experimental system in which cell cycle arrest can be manipulated. As discussed below, by use of this system, we have gained insights into the mechanisms by which sustained cell cycle arrest leads to a reduced capacity for Pol III transcription.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to investigate whether RNA Pol III transcription is regulated in response to sustained cell cycle arrest. RNA Pol III transcription is responsible for the synthesis of various small RNA species involved in maintaining cellular biosynthetic capacity. Under conditions of prolonged cell cycle arrest, when cells do not require high levels of protein synthesis, it might therefore be assumed that cells can afford to down-regulate Pol III transcriptional activity. We tested this hypothesis in the human TR9–7 tissue culture cell line in which cell cycle arrest can be initiated by the inducible expression of p53 (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that Pol III capacity for a range of type 1 and type 2 Pol III promoters is indeed reduced greatly as a consequence of sustained cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we showed that this was not the result of decreased activity of the RNA polymerase III enzyme itself nor decreased TFIIIC activity. Instead, we showed that TFIIIB activity was the target for repression and that it was the 0.38M-TFIIIB component but not the 0.48M-TFIIIB component, of this factor that was specifically repressed. Finally, we revealed that this repression was accompanied by a dramatic destabilization of the 0.38M-TFIIIB component TAF3B2 and showed that reversing this destabilization by treating cells with proteasome inhibitors led to restored Pol III transcriptional capacity. Because TAF3B2 is essential for Pol III transcription (23Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Mital R. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 7031-7042Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we conclude that its destabilization is likely to play a major role in effecting the loss of Pol III capacity in the TR9–7 system. However, it should be noted that not all human TFIIIB subunits have so far been cloned; it therefore remains possible that down-regulation of another TFIIIB component may also contribute to the reduced Pol III transcription that we observe. It will clearly be of great interest to determine the features of TAF3B2 that allow it be targeted for degradation upon sustained cell cycle arrest and to identify and characterize thetrans-acting factors that mediate this control.Two previous studies reported that p53 can act as a direct repressor of Pol III transcription through inhibitory interactions with TFIIIB (43Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,47Chesnokov I. Chu W.-M. Botchan M.R. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the promoters we used in our study, namely those of the human 5 S rRNA gene, two different tRNA genes, and the adenoviral VAI gene, were inhibited directly by p53 in the study of Cairns and White (43Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, we considered the possibility that the repressive effects on Pol III transcription that we observed in TR9–7 cells could be mediated directly by p53. However, several lines of evidence indicate that this is not the case. First, the kinetics of Pol III repression in TR9–7 cells correlated best with the onset of cell cycle arrest, not the kinetics of p53 induction. Second, the addition of recombinant p53 to extracts of proliferating TR9–7 cells, in amounts similar to those used by Cairns and White (43Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), did not reproduce the repression observed in extracts from cell cycle-arrested cells. The amount of exogenous p53 added in these experiments was at least 100-fold higher than the amounts present endogenously in extracts of cell cycle-arrested cells. Third, transcriptional repression was sustained after removing p53 selectively from extracts of cell cycle-arrested cells by immunodepletion. Finally, and most compelling, we showed that p53 protein was maintained at high levels when cell cycle-arrested cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, yet there was full recovery of Pol III transcriptional activity. It therefore seems clear that p53 is not directly responsible for repression of Pol III transcription capacity following sustained cell cycle arrest in the TR9–7 cell system.The data we present here are in agreement with the model that there is an intimate linkage between cellular biosynthetic capacity and the activity of RNA Pol III transcription apparatus (1Larminie C.G.C. Alzuherri H.M. Cairns C.A. McLees A. White R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We describe a novel pathway by which Pol III transcription may be negatively regulated during times when cells do not require elevated levels of active protein synthesis, such as during sustained cell cycle arrest. Taken together with other work, our results suggest that down-regulation of Pol III transcription can be elicited by multiple mechanisms: direct inhibitory interactions between the retinoblastoma protein and TFIIIB (8White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), direct inhibition of TFIIIB by the p53 protein (43Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and destabilization of TAF3B2. Remarkably, all three pathways converge on TFIIIB, which therefore seems to have evolved as a crucial target in the regulation of Pol III transcription (3White R.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that these mechanisms represent distinct but complementary pathways to bring about regulation of Pol III activity in response to changes in cellular growth potential and proliferative status. These pathways could operate in different biological contexts or, at least in some circumstances, could co-operate to reinforce the level of transcriptional control. The unraveling of the molecular details of TAF3B2 destabilization upon sustained cell cycle arrest may provide further insights into how this important cross-regulation is achieved, and this might eventually lead to a better understanding of tissue growth under both physiological and pathological conditions. Cellular growth and proliferation are two distinct processes. Proliferation is defined as the increase in the number of cells, which occurs when cells progress through a new cell division cycle. Cell growth, on the other hand, is defined as the increase in mass of an individual cell. Growth is related to the biosynthetic capacity of a cell, a reliable indicator of which is the level of protein synthesis (1Larminie C.G.C. Alzuherri H.M. Cairns C.A. McLees A. White R.J. J. Mol.

Conceptually, it seems requisite that the processes of growth and proliferation are linked and that sensitive fine tuning exists between them. At present, however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that ensure that this crucial cross-regulation is achieved. After neoplastic transformation of cells, uncontrolled proliferation is only sustainable if it is linked to deregulated cell growth (2Rosenwald I.B.

But how are regulation of growth and regulation of proliferation jointly accomplished? The prevailing model is that tumor suppressor proteins play a crucial role in eliciting this control (1Larminie C.G.C. Alzuherri H.M. Cairns C.A. McLees A. White R.J. J. Mol.

For example, the retinoblastoma protein regulates entry into S phase by controlling E2F, a transcription factor involved in the expression of S phase-inducing genes (5Kouzarides T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). It may also affect cell growth potential by repressing the activities of RNA polymerases I (7Cavanaugh A.H. Hempel W.M. Taylor L.J. Rogalsky V. Todorov G. Rothblum L.I.

Multi-functional proteins such as retinoblastoma protein may therefore be vital for adjusting cellular growth potential to match proliferative activity.

Cell. 1998; 1: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and can be split into two subcomponents, TFIIIC1 and TFIIIC2 (15Yoshinaga S.K. Boulanger P.A. Berk A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3585-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For type 3 promoters, only the C1 component of TFIIIC is required as an initiation factor (16Yoon J.-B. Murphy S. Bai L. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Like TFIIIC, TFIIIB is an important Pol III transcription factor involved in initiating transcription on type 1 and type 2 promoters. According to the sequential recruitment model, TFIIIB is assembled into the preinitiation complex by TFIIIC on type 2 promoters or by the TFIIIC-TFIIIA complex on type 1 promoters and is positioned upstream of the transcription start site (17Kassavetis G.A. Burkhard R.B. Lam H.N. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies have shown that TFIIIB then recruits Pol III to the promoter to direct accurate initiation of transcription and can do so even after TFIIIC has been stripped off the promoter (18Chédin S. Ferri M.L. Peyroche G. Andrau J.C. Jourdain S. Lefebvre O. Werner M. Carles C. Sentenac A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; LXIII: 381-389Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). TFIIIB contains the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and various TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (19Buratowski S. Zhou H. Cell. 1992; 71: 221-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Lobo S.M. Tanaka M. Sullivan M.L. Hernandez N.

Although the number and identity of TAFs in human TFIIIB have not been fully established, a TAF that has been characterized in some detail is TAF3B2 (previously named BRF or hTFIIIB90) (23Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Mital R. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 7031-7042Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, two additional TAFs that form part of TFIIIB have been identified: hB“, which is the human homologue of the yeast TFIIIB component, B”, and hBRFU/TFIIIB50 (25Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y.L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The aim of the work presented here was to investigate how Pol III transcription is regulated during changes in cell growth and proliferation. Toward this end, we used the human fibroblast cell line TR9–7, derived from a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, in which both copies of the endogenous gene for p53 are inactivated (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). TR9–7 cells are stably transfected with a recombinant construct that allows for the inducible expression of p53 from a tetracycline-controlled promoter. Thus, whereas p53 expression is barely detectable in TR9–7 cells grown in the presence of 1 μg/ml of tetracycline, decreasing the tetracycline concentration in the growth medium results in an increase in both p53 expression and function, as determined by the induction of the p53-responsive p21/Waf1 gene (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of p53 expression in TR9–7 cells upon tetracycline withdrawal are comparable with those induced in a wild-type cell line in response to DNA damage (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This degree of p53 induction in the TR9–7 cells results in a slow onset, reversible cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2/M stages of the cell cycle. Complete cell cycle arrest is achieved 4–6 days after the onset of p53 induction. TR9–7 cells can be maintained in this arrested state for up to 20 days and yet can still return to a normal cycling state afterward (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The TR9–7 cell line therefore provides a versatile experimental system in which cell cycle arrest can be manipulated. As discussed below, by use of this system, we have gained insights into the mechanisms by which sustained cell cycle arrest leads to a reduced capacity for Pol III transcription. DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to investigate whether RNA Pol III transcription is regulated in response to sustained cell cycle arrest. RNA Pol III transcription is responsible for the synthesis of various small RNA species involved in maintaining cellular biosynthetic capacity. Under conditions of prolonged cell cycle arrest, when cells do not require high levels of protein synthesis, it might therefore be assumed that cells can afford to down-regulate Pol III transcriptional activity. We tested this hypothesis in the human TR9–7 tissue culture cell line in which cell cycle arrest can be initiated by the inducible expression of p53 (27Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that Pol III capacity for a range of type 1 and type 2 Pol III promoters is indeed reduced greatly as a consequence of sustained cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we showed that this was not the result of decreased activity of the RNA polymerase III enzyme itself nor decreased TFIIIC activity. Instead, we showed that TFIIIB activity was the target for repression and that it was the 0.38M-TFIIIB component but not the 0.48M-TFIIIB component, of this factor that was specifically repressed. Finally, we revealed that this repression was accompanied by a dramatic destabilization of the 0.38M-TFIIIB component TAF3B2 and showed that reversing this destabilization by treating cells with proteasome inhibitors led to restored Pol III transcriptional capacity. Because TAF3B2 is essential for Pol III transcription (23Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Mital R. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 7031-7042Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we conclude that its destabilization is likely to play a major role in effecting the loss of Pol III capacity in the TR9–7 system. However, it should be noted that not all human TFIIIB subunits have so far been cloned; it therefore remains possible that down-regulation of another TFIIIB component may also contribute to the reduced Pol III transcription that we observe. It will clearly be of great interest to determine the features of TAF3B2 that allow it be targeted for degradation upon sustained cell cycle arrest and to identify and characterize thetrans-acting factors that mediate this control.Two previous studies reported that p53 can act as a direct repressor of Pol III transcription through inhibitory interactions with TFIIIB (43Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,47Chesnokov I. Chu W.-M. Botchan M.R. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the promoters we used in our study, namely those of the human 5 S rRNA gene, two different tRNA genes, and the adenoviral VAI gene, were inhibited directly by p53 in the study of Cairns and White (43Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, we considered the possibility that the repressive effects on Pol III transcription that we observed in TR9–7 cells could be mediated directly by p53. However, several lines of evidence indicate that this is not the case. First, the kinetics of Pol III repression in TR9–7 cells correlated best with the onset of cell cycle arrest, not the kinetics of p53 induction. Second, the addition of recombinant p53 to extracts of proliferating TR9–7 cells, in amounts similar to those used by Cairns and White (43Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), did not reproduce the repression observed in extracts from cell cycle-arrested cells. The amount of exogenous p53 added in these experiments was at least 100-fold higher than the amounts present endogenously in extracts of cell cycle-arrested cells. Third, transcriptional repression was sustained after removing p53 selectively from extracts of cell cycle-arrested cells by immunodepletion. Finally, and most compelling, we showed that p53 protein was maintained at high levels when cell cycle-arrested cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, yet there was full recovery of Pol III transcriptional activity. It therefore seems clear that p53 is not directly responsible for repression of Pol III transcription capacity following sustained cell cycle arrest in the TR9–7 cell system.The data we present here are in agreement with the model that there is an intimate linkage between cellular biosynthetic capacity and the activity of RNA Pol III transcription apparatus (1Larminie C.G.C. Alzuherri H.M. Cairns C.A. McLees A. White R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We describe a novel pathway by which Pol III transcription may be negatively regulated during times when cells do not require elevated levels of active protein synthesis, such as during sustained cell cycle arrest. Taken together with other work, our results suggest that down-regulation of Pol III transcription can be elicited by multiple mechanisms: direct inhibitory interactions between the retinoblastoma protein and TFIIIB (8White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), direct inhibition of TFIIIB by the p53 protein (43Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and destabilization of TAF3B2. Remarkably, all three pathways converge on TFIIIB, which therefore seems to have evolved as a crucial target in the regulation of Pol III transcription (3White R.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that these mechanisms represent distinct but complementary pathways to bring about regulation of Pol III activity in response to changes in cellular growth potential and proliferative status. These pathways could operate in different biological contexts or, at least in some circumstances, could co-operate to reinforce the level of transcriptional control. The unraveling of the molecular details of TAF3B2 destabilization upon sustained cell cycle arrest may provide further insights into how this important cross-regulation is achieved, and this might eventually lead to a better understanding of tissue growth under both physiological and pathological conditions.
