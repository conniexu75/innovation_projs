https://openalex.org/W2054172214,"Drosophila chorion genes are located in two clusters, one on the X chromosome at 7F1-2 of the polytene chromosome map and a second on the third chromosome at 66D11-15. Genes in both regions undergo amplification in ovarian follicle cells prior to their expression late in oogenesis. Analysis of cloned genomic segments derived from these chromosomal sites revealed that each cluster contains two tandemly transcribed chorion protein genes separated by only 1-2 kb. At least two other regions complementary to ovary RNA are located within 5 kb of these genes. During oogenesis, the transcribed sequences within each cluster, as well as the spacer sequences that separate them, are amplified equally. Sequences adjacent to the transcribed regions also replicate differentially but to a lesser extent, giving rise to gradients of decreasing amplification involving 40-50 kb of flanking chromosomal sequences. Differences between the restriction maps of unamplified and amplified DNA could not be detected in genomic DNA within either of the 90-100 kb domains of amplification. These observations suggest a model of amplification in which additional rounds of replication are specifically initiated within the central gene-containing regions, followed by bidirectional replication in the absence of discrete termination sites."
https://openalex.org/W1489871342,"The products of arachidonic acid oxygenations by resident mouse peritoneal macrophages have been found to depend upon the nature of the stimulus. For example, soluble membrane-mediated inflammatory stimuli such as phorbol myristate acetate and lipopolysaccharide stimulated the formation of prostaglandin E2 via the cyclooxygenase pathway. In contrast, zymosan, a particulate, phagocytozable inflammatory mediator stimulated leukotrienes C4 and B4 synthesis via the lipoxygenase pathway in addition to stimulating prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Thus, the release of leukotrienes is not necessarily linked to the release of prostaglandins in a cell that has the enzymatic capability of producing both mediators. This suggests that the prostaglandin synthetase system can obtain substrate arachidonic acid from a source different from that for leukotriene synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1992137920,"Administration of the hepatic carcinogen aflatoxin B1 to experimental animals results in covalent binding to liver mitochondrial DNA at concentrations three to four times higher than nuclear DNA. The concentration of carcinogen adducts in mitochondrial DNA remains unchanged even after 24 hours, possible because of lack of excision repair. Similarly, mitochondrial transcription and translation remain inhibited up to 24 hours suggesting long-term effects of aflatoxin B1 on the mitochondrial genetic system."

https://openalex.org/W1544618298,"Abstract We have characterized the NH2-terminal sequence of the primary translation product of intestinal apolipoprotein A-I mRNA. Co-translational cleavage of this in vitro product and NH2-terminal sequence analysis of plasma high density lipoprotein-associated apolipoprotein A-I showed that it is initially synthesized as a preproprotein. The 24-amino-acid NH2-terminal extension consists of an 18-amino-acid presegment; Met-Lys-Ala-Ala-Val-Leu-Ala-Val-Ala-Leu-Val-Phe-Leu-Thr-Gly-Cys-Gln-Ala, and a hexapeptide prosegment; -X-Glu-Phe-X-Gln-Gln, followed by the NH2 terminus of the mature plasma protein: Asp-Glu-Pro-Gln-X-Gln-Trp-Asp-Arg-Val-Lys-Asp-Phe-Ala-X-Val-Tyr-X-Asp-Ala-Val. Although the prepeptide resembles other signal peptides, the prosegment differs from other propeptides in that it does not terminate with paired basic amino acid residues. These results suggest that translocation of nascent preproapolipoprotein A-I is similar to that of other secretory proteins. However, post-translational proteolytic processing of proapolipoprotein A-I must be unique, and could play a role in the formation of nascent high density lipoprotein particles."
https://openalex.org/W1484320593,"Swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid, inhibits the alpha-mannosidase that is involved in glycoprotein processing. Thus, in cultured animal cells, this alkaloid causes an increase in the surface content of high mannose glycoproteins and a decrease in the amount of complex type glycoproteins (Elbein, A. D., Solf, R., Dorling, P. R., and Vosbeck, K. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 78, 7393-7397). In this report, the effect of swainsonine on the synthesis virus hemagglutinins was examined. Primary calf kidney cultures were infected with influenza virus and viral replication was allowed to proceed in the absence or presence of swainsonine. Several hours after the addition of swainsonine, [2-3H]mannose or [6-3H]glucosamine were added to label the hemagglutinins and the mature virus particles were isolated. Virus particles raised in the presence of this alkaloid had the same infectivity and hemagglutination titer as virus particles from control cells. However, when the hemagglutinins were examined on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the major hemagglutinin (HA0) and its subunits, HA1 and HA2, from swainsonine-treated cells, migrated faster, indicating that they were of lower molecular weights. The labeled hemagglutinins were digested with pronase and the resulting glycopeptides were chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4. Both the mannose-labeled and glucosamine-labeled glycopeptides from swainsonine-treated virus migrated more slowly on these columns than those of controls cells, suggesting that they were altered in structure. Furthermore, when the glycopeptides were digested with endoglucosaminidase H, 90% of the glycopeptides from swainsonine-treated cells were susceptible to this enzyme, whereas only 30% of those from control cells were digested. The major oligosaccharide released from inhibited cells by endoglucosaminidase H was digestible with alpha-mannosidase, whereas that of control cells was resistant to this enzyme. However, the control cell glycopeptide was digested by a combination of neuraminidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, and alpha-mannosidase. These data show that swainsonine prevents the formation of complex glycoproteins and gives rise to increased amounts of high-mannose glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1657001864,"Abstract The calmodulin plus Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of a 60,000-dalton protein was detectable in muscle homogenates and in purified sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. Phosphorylation was enhanced when purified sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were extracted with 1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid at pH 8.0 to remove endogenous calmodulin and lower the level of residual phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the 60,000-dalton protein was stimulated by NaF, reached maximal levels of about 55 pmol/mg of protein within 90 s and was not affected by cAMP. Half-maximal stimulation of phosphorylation required 0.1 microM calmodulin and maximal phosphorylation required 0.6 microM calmodulin; in the presence of 0.6 microM calmodulin, maximal phosphorylation required 0.3 microM Ca2+. Calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of the 60,000-dalton protein was inhibited by trifluoperazine with a Ki of 5 microM. The pH optimum of phosphorylation was below 6.0 and was inhibited over 90% at pH 8.0. The purified 60,000-dalton protein contained phosphoserine and phosphothreonine but no phosphotyrosine. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation showed that the 60,000-dalton phosphoprotein was not calsequestrin. Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases H and D digestion failed to alter its molecular weight, indicating that it was not a glycoprotein. A functional role for the phosphorylation system is suggested by the observations that ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid extraction, which removes endogenous calmodulin and lowers endogenous phosphorylation levels, and high pH, which inhibits phosphorylation, lead to greatly diminished Ca2+ accumulation by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2116451505,"Hemin enhances the adipose differentiation of mouse 3T3-F442A cells in a medium containing high levels of adipogenic factor that is present in fetal calf serum or calf serum. This enhancement is more prominent in the presence of insulin. Hemin also promotes adipose differentiation in a medium containing 10% cat serum, which has very little adipogenic factor; this effect is in contrast to that of insulin, which is relatively ineffective in promoting adipose differentiation in this medium. Adipose differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells is inhibited by the addition of aminotriazole, an inhibitor of heme biosynthesis. The inhibition of adipose differentiation by aminotriazole is prevented by the simultaneous addition of hemin and aminotriazole. These results indicate that treatment with hemin can promote the differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes in vitro, and they raise the possibility that endogenous heme may have a physiological role in the differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2027112152,"We have cloned two rearranged kappa immunoglobulin genes from the mouse myeloma cell line S107, and find that both are expressed. One gene, designated S107A, encodes the secreted kappa chain that participates in phosphocholine binding and expression of the T-15 idiotype. The other gene, designated S107B, as described here, contains an unusual junction between a V region unrelated to that of S107A and a different J region. The V-J junction preserves the triplet reading frame, but 6 nucleotides have been deleted at the recombination site. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the germline V-region precursor of S107B in comparison with other germline kappa-variable sequences reveals an ""extra"" 2 nucleotides in S107B between codon 95 and the palindromic heptanucleotide CACAGTG previously implicated in V-J recombination; this difference may be relevant to the 6 nucleotide deletion. Both S107A and S107B genes are expressed in the S107 cell as protein products, but unlike the S107A kappa chain, the S107B protein product is not secreted into the medium. The expression of these two kappa genes in the S107 cell has implications for theories of allelic exclusion."
https://openalex.org/W1573414259,"The cleavage of fatty acyl moieties from phospholipids was compared in intact cells and homogenates of mouse lymphocytes (thymocytes, spleen cells) and macrophages. Liberation of free arachidonic acid during incubations of intact cells was only detectable in the presence of albumin. Homogenization of prelabeled thymocytes and further incubation of these homogenates at 37 degrees C resulted in a pronounced decrease of phospholipid degradation and cleavage of arachidonoyl residues, while further incubation of homogenates from prelabeled macrophages produced a greatly increased phospholipid degradation. Homogenates of macrophages but not those of thymocytes contain substantial activities of phospholipase A2 detectable using exogenous radiolabeled substrates. These findings indicate that in thymocytes cleavage of arachidonic acid from phosphatidylcholine is an active process that is not catalyzed by phospholipase A2. Addition of CoA and lysophosphatidylethanolamine to prelabeled thymocyte homogenates induced a fast breakdown of phosphatidylcholine and transfer of arachidonic acid to phosphatidylethanolamine, as in seen during incubations of intact thymocytes or macrophages. The transfer is restricted to arachidonic acid and does not require addition of ATP. Sodium cholate, a known inhibitor of the acyl-CoA:lysophosphatide acyltransferase, completely inhibited this transfer reaction. These results suggest that the CoA-mediated, ATP-independent breakdown of phosphatidylcholine and transfer of arachidonic acid is catalyzed by the acyl-CoA:lysophosphatide acyltransferase operating in reverse."
https://openalex.org/W1973069846,"We have investigated micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin and purified DNA at the heat-shock locus 67B in Drosophila melanogaster. At early stages of the reaction a distinct set of fragments is generated, indicating the presence of preferential cleavage sites. These sites are also observed when purified recombinant plasmid DNA is used as the substrate, demonstrating that the sites are specified by the DNA sequence. At Drosophila locus 67B, prominent sites occur frequently, spaced approximately 200 bp apart, within the nontranscribed portions of the locus, but are generally not observed within the regions that are transcribed. In contrast, such sites are randomly distributed along the procaryotic plasmid pBR322. The results indicate that specific patterns of digestion of eucaryotic chromatin by micrococcal nuclease cannot be simply interpreted as the consequence of the nucleosome array. However, it is possible that the organization of eucaryotic DNA sequences detected by micrococcal nuclease bears a functional relationship to the organization of DNA by nucleosomes and, in fact, was so selected through evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1975845574,"In cell lines producing IgM, secreted and membrane bound forms of immunoglobulin mu heavy chains are produced from two separate mu mRNAs that are identical except for alternative 3' coding sequences. We now show that cell lines producing IgG likewise contain two mRNA species for immunoglobulin gamma chains. The major, 1.7 kilobase (kb) species encodes secreted gamma chains. A less abundant species of 3-4 appears to encode membrane bound gamma chains, in that it contains an alternative 3' end encoded in separate exons 3' to the remainder of the gene. The first exon of this M gene segment has been identified in chromosomal gamma 1 and gamma 2b gene clones by its sequence homology with the corresponding exon in the mu gene. Like the mu M exon, it encodes a probable transmembrane polypeptide segment. The flanking DNA sequences show a patchwork pattern of homology between genes that suggests a checkered evolutionary history."
https://openalex.org/W1599209789,"Glycolipids containing fucose linked to N-acetylglucosamine were isolated and characterized from 14 individual human and 13 individual dog intestines. From 8 of the dog intestines, Lewis a isomer fucolipids were isolated, all identical and having the structure Gal(beta 1 leads to 4)[Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3]GlcNAc(beta 1 leads to 3)Gal(beta 1 leads to 4)Glc-ceramide. Lewis b isomer fucolipids were isolated from 12 of the intestines, all identical and having the structure Fuc(alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal(beta 1 leads to 4)[Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3]GlcNAc(beta 1 leads to 3)Gal(beta 1 leads to 4)Glc-ceramide. Lewis a-active glycolipids were isolated as the sole major fucolipid in 6 of the human intestines and differed from the canine isomer only in the position of the linkage of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine, having the beta 1 leads to 3 (type 1) rather than the beta 1 leads to 4 (type 2) linkage. Lewis b-active fucolipids were isolated from 8 human intestines and differed from their canine isomer only in that they, too, had the type 1 rather than the type 2 oligosaccharide chain. Lewis a and b glycolipid isomers commonly co-existed in canine intestine as major fucolipids whereas Lewis a and b glycolipids did not so co-exist in human intestine. In all of the fucolipids, only hydroxylated fatty acids were present and phytosphingosine and sphingosine were the predominant long chain bases. These findings are of interest in the biosynthesis of these substances and in their genetic expression."
https://openalex.org/W2016857271,"Subcutaneous injection of 50 micrograms of a luteinizing hormone-releasing factor agonist (LRF agonist) for three successive days at the time of menstruation in normal cycling women induces a shortened luteal phase with suboptimal concentrations of circulating estradiol and progesterone. This luteal phase defect follows a reduced concentration of follicle-stimulating hormone during the follicular phase and a resulting inadequate follicular maturation. Since a short luteal phase is associated with an endometrium not conductive to implantation, administration of the LRF agonist at the onset of menstrual cycle may prove to be a practical and novel approach to fertility control."

https://openalex.org/W1503217886,"A chitinase was extracted with digitonin from intact yeast cells and purified by adsorption-digestion on chitin. The purified enzyme liberates oligosaccharides of various sizes from chitin, thus behaving as an endochitinase. As found with other chitinases, the yeast enzyme is much more active on nascent chitin, i.e. the chitin formed in the same reaction mixture by the corresponding synthetase, than on preformed polysaccharide. The enzyme has a very low pH optimum, about pH 2.5, and is quite stable at pH 3. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of different preparations of purified chitinase revealed a variable number of protein bands, whose pattern often changed after storage of the enzyme. The distribution of activity in the gel matched that of the stainable material. Association of the chitinase with mannan is indicated by the following results: (a) coincidence in Coomassie blue-staining and periodate-Schiff-staining bands after disc gel electrophoresis; (b) adsorption of the activity on concanavalin A-Sepharose and elution with alpha-methylmanoside; (c) precipitation of the chitinase with appropriate antimannan sera. A carbohydrate content of approximately 18% was found in a trichloroacetic acid-precipitated sample of purified enzyme. Protein and mannan were not dissociated by boiling with sodium dodecyl sulfate, urea, and beta-mercaptoethanol. It could not, however, be conclusively established whether protein and carbohydrate are covalently linked, because the chitinase is resistant to endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase."

https://openalex.org/W2026025698,"Cell proliferation under nonadhesive conditions was examined in anchorage-dependent mouse fibroblasts (3T3 and 3T6), in epithelial monkey kidney cells (BSC-1) and in four B16 melanoma cell variants that exhibit distinct metastatic properties. Non-adhesive conditions established by suspension culture in methyl cellulose or by plating on poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate)-coated plates cause multinucleation and inhibition of cytokinesis in all cell types. Formation of binucleated cells in suspended 3T3 cells continues for 24 hr until DNA synthesis is completely inhibited. Twenty percent of the cells become binucleated during this time. During a similar period in suspension culture over 60% of a synchronized epithelial cell culture (suspended 8 hr after the initiation of S phase) became binucleated. The melanoma cells that maintain a high level of metabolism while in suspension continued to develop into multinucleated cells. After 3 days in suspension, 50% of the melanoma cells have more than one nucleus. Since cell number during suspension culture remains constant, because of a block in cytokinesis, there is a remarkable increase in cell size in suspended melanoma cells. When replated on tissue culture plates, normal cell division resumes by an early extrusion of the extra nuclei in melanoma cells. The melanoma cell variants, although displaying different metastatic potential in vivo, behave similarly in suspension culture. 3T3 cells require 24 hr of replating before recovering DNA synthesis and initiating extrusion of the extra nucleus. The results suggest a differential sensitivity of cytokinesis and karyokinesis to cell-surface contact with the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2073857089,"Abstract The ocelliless ( oc ) mutation is associated with a small chromosome inversion ( In (1)7F1,2-8A1,2) whose distal breakpoint is located 1–3 kb upstream from the s36-1 and s38-1 chorion protein structural genes. The breakpoint lies within the central portion of a 90 kb region, containing chorion genes and adjacent chromosomal sequences, which normally undergoes amplification in ovarian follicle cells (Spradling, 1981). The pattern of differential replication of these sequences is drastically altered in the ocelliless chromosome. The 40 kb of DNA lying distal to the 7F breakpoint completely fails to amplify. The remaining 50 kb, now located at cytogenetic locus 8A, still undergoes amplification, although of a somewhat reduced magnitude. Amplification spreads past the proximal breakpoint, however, because normally unamplified sequences adjacent to the breakpoint in 8A differentially replicate in ocelliless follicle cells. These observations suggest that a specific chromosomal region located proximal to the ocelliless breakpoint at 7F is required in cis for amplification, possibly as a specific origin of replication. The pattern of amplification in ocelliless is explained most simply by the repositioning of this control sequence due to the inversion. As a consequence, the dosage of large, continuous chromosome regions adjacent to the breakpoints is altered in follicle cells. The of the ocelliless inversion on chorion gene expression are analogous to the effects associated with many other chromosome rearrangements in Drosophila. Disturbances of differential DNA replication may be reponsible for additional examples of position effects."
https://openalex.org/W1554525826,"The binding of initiation factor IF2 to 30 S ribosomal subunits was studied quantitatively by steady state fluorescence polarization techniques. Covalent fluorescent derivatives of IF2 were prepared by treating the pure factor with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Derivatives (F-IF2) containing about 1 fluorescein molecule/protein bound to 30 S ribosomal subunits as measured by sucrose gradient centrifugation; however, their activity is slightly impaired in assays for stimulation of formylmethionyl-tRNA binding to 70 S ribosomes. Upon addition of 30 S ribosomal subunits to F-IF2 solutions, a significant increase in fluorescence polarization results, but no change in quantum yield or fluorescence lifetime is detected. Fluorescence polarization values were measured at different F-IF2 and 30 S ribosomal subunit concentrations and the equilibrium association constant and number of ribosomal binding sites were calculated. The association constant for F-IF2 in buffer containing 100 mM NH4Cl and 10 mM Mg acetate is 1.5 +/- 0.2 X 10(7) M-1; the number of binding sites is 0.9 +/- 0.2. Competition of F-IF2 with IF2 showed that the nonderivatized factor binds somewhat more tightly than F-IF2, with an association constant of 2.7 X 10(7) M-1. The binding of F-IF2 is strongly inhibited by raising the NH4Cl concentration from 20 mM to 150 mM, but is rather insensitive to Mg acetate concentrations between 2.5 and 10 mM. Addition of initiation factors IF1 and IF3 causes a 3-fold increase in the association constant for F-If2 binding to 30 S subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1515160680,"It has been shown that NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.99.2) reduces vitamin K1 and can support the [vitamin K1 + NADH]-dependent carboxylation reaction in rat liver microsomes (Wallin, R., Gebhardt, O., and Prydz, H. (1978) Biochem. J. 169, 95-101). Antibodies were raised in rabbits against the purified enzyme from liver cytosol and used to study the importance of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase in the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation reaction. The antibodies neutralized the warfarin-sensitive NAD(P)H dehydrogenase activity in Triton X-100-solubilized microsomes; however, they neutralized only 45% of the total [vitamin K1 + NADH]-dependent carboxylation activity. Chromatography on protein A-sepharose showed that the remaining carboxylase activity was not the result of soluble antigen-antibody complexes. The data presented support the conclusion that the microsomal preparation also contains a non-warfarin-sensitive dehydrogenase(s) that, in addition to NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, can reduce vitamin K1 to support the carboxylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1598028840,"We tested and compared several in vitro properties of wild type and mutant RNA polymerases II from Drosophila melanogaster, using several different mutants of a single X-linked genetic locus, RpIIC4 (Greenleaf, A. L., Weeks, J. R., Voelker, R. A., Ohnishi, S., and Dickson, B. (1980) Cell 21, 785-792); the mutants tested included the original amanitin-resistant mutant, C4, which is nonconditional, plus the temperature-sensitive mutants A9, C20, E28, and 1Fb40. Using a tritium-labeled amanitin derivative, we demonstrated that C4 polymerase has a reduced binding affinity for amanitin. The C4 polymerase was as stable to thermal denaturation as the wild type enzyme, and the two enzymes had similar specific activities, ionic strength and Mn2+ requirements, and apparent Km values for UTP and GTP when assayed in the presence of Mn2+. However, with Mg2+ as the divalent cation, C4 polymerase was less active than wild type and had 2-fold higher apparent Km values for UTP and GTP. Three of the temperature-sensitive mutants, A9, C20, and E28, were derived from the amanitin-resistant mutant C4; the polymerase II activities from these mutants displayed resistance to alpha-amanitin in vitro identical with that of the C4 enzyme. C20, E28, and 1Fb40 polymerases were markedly less stable to thermal denaturation in vitro than wild type polymerase. The results presented indicate that the mutations at the RNA polymerase locus (RpIIC4-) directly alter the structure of the enzyme, providing conclusive evidence that the locus is a structural gene for a polymerase II subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1566601835,"Blood group A and H active glycosphingolipids have been isolated from rat small intestine. By mass spectrometry of the permethylated and LiAlH4-reduced permethylated glycolipid derivatives, the A glycolipids were shown to contain four (A-4), six (A-6), and 12 (A-12) sugar residues, respectively. The anomeric structure of the A-4 and A-6 glycolipids was established by proton NMR spectroscopy of the permethylated-reduced derivatives. Acid degradation and gas chromatography were used for analysis of binding positions. The structures of the A-4 and A-6 glycolipids were GalNAcp alpha 1 leads to 3Galp(2 comes from 1Fucp alpha) beta 1 leads to Glcp beta 1 leads to 1Cer and GalNAcp alpha 1 leads to 3Galp(2 comes from 1Fucp alpha) beta 1 leads to 3GlcNAcp beta 1 leads to 4Galp beta 1 leads to 4Glcp beta 1 leads to 1Cer. The third glycolipid (A-12) was a branched dodecaglycosylceramide with two blood group A determinants. The complete structure of this glycolipid has not yet been solved. The blood group A activity was the same for the A-6 and A-12 glycolipids based on an equal number of blood group A determinants, but the activity of the A-4 compound was only about half of the others. The A-6 glycolipid was based on a type 1 (Gal beta 1 leads to 3GlcNAc) carbohydrate chain, thus differing from the already known isomer based on a type 2 chain (Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc) present in human erythrocyte. The blood group A activity of these two glycolipids was found to be identical. The three rat intestinal blood group A active glycolipids were exclusively located to the mucosa epithelial cells. The blood group H active tri- and pentaglycosylceramides (H-3 and H-5), presumed to be the precursors of the A-4 and A-6 glycolipids, were also identified. A 10-sugar glycolipid (H-10), a possible precursor of A-12, was not detected."

https://openalex.org/W2018070588,"Many of the reactions of cellular immunity are mediated by soluble lymphocyte-derived factors (lymphokines). One important category of lymphokine action involves effects on cell motility. These effects have been described mainly with respect to inflammatory cells. In this report, we describe the ability of a lymphocyte product to inhibit the migration of endothelial cells in a system in vitro. The responsible factor is distinct from a previously described mediator that inhibits the migration of tumor cells. The ability of lymphocytes to influence the migration properties of endothelial cells is consistent with data of others showing a relation between the immune system and processes involving neovascularization."

https://openalex.org/W1605558393,"Abstract Calcium-dependent self-association of rabbit skeletal troponin-C was investigated by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Troponin-C which was homogeneous by the criterion of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate was shown to undergo reversible dimerization (K2,app = 1.7 X 10(3) M-1) even in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (0.1-1.0 M KCl, 0.01 M imidazole, 0.005 M potassium phosphate, 0.4 mM EGTA (pH 7.0), 1.0 mM dithiothreitol). The existence of a monomer-dimer reaction under these conditions could be demonstrated as long as the effects of the Donnan equilibrium were taken into account. The value of the observed second virial coefficient was consistent with the value expected from troponin-C at this pH. The dimerization could be enhanced by the addition of calcium to 0.1 mM (K2,app = 1.2 X 10(4) M-1). A monomer molecular weight of 18,700 was estimated from a two-species plot of the data. The effect of calcium was completely reversible."

This peptide was shown to be the carboxyl terminus by sequence determination and by carboxypeptidase A digestion of the native protein. For GPDHF-1, the sequence of the COOH-terminal tryptic peptide is Asn-His-Pro-Glu-His-Met-Gln-Asn-Leu-COOH, while that of GPDHF-3 is Asn-His-Pro-Glu-His-Met-COOH."

https://openalex.org/W35418996,"Abstract Slices of rat aorta were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for measurements of immunoreactive 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane (TX) B2, prostaglandin (PG)E2, and PGF2 alpha, and in Tris buffer (pH 9.3) for determination of prostacyclin (PGI2)-like activity. No significant generation of TXB2, PGE2, or PGF2 alpha by rat aortic tissue could be detected. The time-dependent release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer closely correlated with PGI2 generation in alkaline Tris buffer. During a 30-min incubation period, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, release was 79.8 +/- 3.3 pmol/mg at a buffer potassium concentration of 3.9 mmol/liter and significantly increased by 23% to 98.3 +/- 8.5 pmol/mg (P less than 0.025) in the absence of potassium in the incubation medium. A smaller decrease in buffer potassium concentration to 2.1 mmol/liter and an increase to 8.8 mmol/liter did not significantly alter aortic 6-keto-PGF1 alpha release. Changes in the incubation buffer sodium concentration from 144 mmol/liter to either 138 or 150 mmol/liter at a constant potassium concentration of 3.9 mmol/liter did not alter the recovery of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Our results support the concept that PGI2 is the predominant product of arachidonic acid metabolism in rat aorta. They further show that PGI2 can be recovered quantitatively as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha under the present in vitro conditions. In addition, this in vitro study points to the potassium ion as a modulator of vascular PGI2 synthesis with a stimulation at low potassium concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1570885883,"An ADP-ribosyltransferase from turkey erythrocytes which utilizes proteins and low molecular weight guanidino compounds such as arginine and agmatine as ADP-ribose acceptors was stimulated by histones. The effect was specific in that choleragen, a bacterial mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase that increased adenylate cyclase activity in animal cells, was not activated by histones. With the erythrocyte enzyme, histones decreased the apparent Km values for arginine methyl ester and agmatine and increased the stability of the transferase to thermal denaturation. Activation of the transferase by histones was rapid, with a minimal delay observed upon addition of histones to a histone-free assay. Activation by histones was reversed upon dilution of a sample containing histones into an assay mix free of histone. In the absence of histone, the transferase existed as a rapidly sedimenting species; in the presence of histone, the transferase sedimented as a protomer."

https://openalex.org/W1574877018,"Segments of cloned Drosophila DNA from four recombinant plasmids that hybridize with tRNA4Val have been sequenced. The segments from pDt92R and pDt120R that hybridize to 90C on the third polytene chromosome appear to be either repeats or alleles. They contain one structural gene each of identical sequence but differ at eight sites in 506 base pairs. The structural genes differ at four sites from the sequence expected from that of tRNA4Val. A third plasmid, pDt14, which hybridizes to 89BC on the third chromosome, also contains a structural gene with the same sequence as those in pDt92R and pDt120R. In addition, pDt14 has a gene for tRNA2Phe 214 base pairs upstream and with the same polarity as the tRNA4Val gene. The tRNA2Phe gene contains a 23-base pair segment identical with the corresponding segment in the tRNA4Val genes except for one base pair. The fourth plasmid investigated, pDt55, hybridizes to 70BC. It contains two tRNA4Val genes 525 base pairs apart with opposite polarity. These genes have identical sequences, which corresponds to that expected from the sequence of tRNA4Val. There is no evidence that the first three tRNA4Val genes are expressed at any stage during the development of Drosophila."

https://openalex.org/W2117751300,"Treatment of the catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli with either D- or Lbromosuccinate at pH 8.5 results in a loss of catalytic activity. Succinate, an analog of the substrate L-aspartate, affords some protection against inactivation, while the putative transition state analogN-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate provides complete protection. The substrate carbamyl phosphate provides greater protection against inactivation by L-bromosuccinate than by D-bromosuccinate. Complete loss of activity is accompanied by incorporation of approximately 1.3 succinate moieties per catalytic chain resulting from partial modification of 3 lysine residues, identified as numbers 83, 84, and 224 in the preliminary catalytic chain sequence of W. Konigsberg (personal communication). A significant number of catalytic chains are modified at both positions 83 and 84. In the absence of ligands, D-bromosuccinate reacts with lysine 83 to a greater extent than does the L isomer. Bulky inhibitors such as CTP and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate provide varying degrees of protection against inactivation and overall modification without altering significantly the relative extent of alkylation of the 3 residues. However, carbamyl phosphate not only protects against inactivation and overall modification, but also selectively suppresses alkylation of lysine 83 and eliminates the production of catalytic chains modified at both lysines 83 and 84. The results suggest that all 3 lysine residues are at or near the active site, that modification of any one of them causes loss of catalytic activity, and that lysine 83 is at or near the carbamyl phosphate binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1935789387,"Immobilized subtilisin Novo was used for the cleavage of iron-saturated ovotransferrin (Fe2OT) into separate NH2- and CO2H-terminal iron-binding fragments, designated as FeNF and FeCF, respectively. The Mr of each fragment is 39,000. The purified fragments show major differences in the content of histidine, alanine, and methionine. Both apo-NH2- and apo-CO2H-terminal fragments are able to bind one ferric ion per molecule. FeCF is more resistant than FeNF to dissociation at acid pH and to subtilisin action. FeNF and FeCF are immunochemically distinct. However, equal mixtures of the two show immunochemical reaction indistinguishable from intact Fe2OT. The iron-binding sites of FeNF and FeCF are very similar to each other on the basis of visible absorption and CD spectra. The major difference in the backbone conformations between FeNF and FeCF is in the alpha-helical content of FeCF which is twice that of FeNF. Individually, fragments show quantitative differences in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra; however, equal mixture of the two fragments produce EPR spectra very similar to that of the intact Fe2OT. These studies indicate that subtilitic cleavage of Fe2OT does not produce significant change in the iron-binding capacity or the conformation of the separated iron-binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W1484050374,"Hydrostatic pressure can be used to perturb the ribosome-ribosomal subunit equilibrium. We have used glutaraldehyde fixation and subsequent sucrose gradient analysis to determine the equilibrium concentrations of Escherichia coli 70 S, 50 S, and 30 S particles at pressures from 1 to 1400 atm. This method is shown to be sufficiently rapid and free of interfering ribosomal aggregation artifacts when performed at Mg2+ concentrations below 8 mM. We show directly that the E. coli ribosome is in equilibrium with its subunits and that the pressure-sensitive reaction is appropriately described by the expression: In Kp = ln K0 + (P delta V/RT), where Kp and K0 are the equilibrium constants at pressure P and 1 atm, respectively, and delta V is the change in molecular volume that occurs during the reaction. The method provides values for K0 under different conditions, and the effects of Mg2+ ion can be readily ascertained. K0 and delta V were also estimated by a method of fitting computer-generated sucrose gradient profiles to experimental profiles. Determination of delta H0, delta S0, and delta V0 at 5 mM Mg2+ are presented. The results are discussed in the context of previous thermodynamic studies of the E. coli ribosome."

It is probable that residue C 49 is modified to m5C. The use of tRNA modified with chloroacetaldehyde to overcome secondary structure problems in sequencing is described.
https://openalex.org/W154352485,"Mercurated DNA was synthesized in permeable cells of Bacillus subtilis, using 5-mercurideoxycytidine triphosphate as one of the substrates, and was separated from parental unsubstituted DNA by isopycnic centrifugation in CsCl gradients. The ability of mercurated DNA to transform auxotrophic strains of B. subtilis to prototrophy was compared with that of normal DNA and was 10-20% of the latter. Mercurated and normal DNA bound with similar affinities to identical surface receptors of the recipient cells, but the efficiency of the bound mercurated DNA in promoting transformation was one-tenth to one-fifth of that of normal DNA. The transforming activity of mercury-substituted DNA synthesized in an in vitro system opens the way for the use of mercury as a probe to study the mechanism of bacterial transformation and various other kinds of genetic exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1679398883,"Abstract A method of purifying H5 mRNA from immature hen erythrocytes is described. Polysomes from red blood cells of anemic animals were allowed to react with affinity-chromatography-purified rabbit anti-H5 antibodies and immunoadsorbed to cellulose-insolubilized sheep and anti-rabbit antibodies. This method produced a 10- to 15-fold enrichment of the H5 mRNA, which was further purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation, poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography, and size fractionation in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The H5 mRNA activity was essentially pure, as shown by translation in a reticulocyte cell-free system and immunoprecipitation with H5-antibodies. The proportion of H5 mRNA has been estimated to lie in the range 0.4-0.6% of all cellular mRNAs. These values are in agreement with the estimated relative synthesis of H5 in the immature erythrocyte."

https://openalex.org/W1543035102,"Upon incubation with uridine diphosphate-[14C]glucuronic acid, membrane fractions from adult and phenobarbital-induced embryonic liver synthesize a single glucuronide, which is soluble in chloroform:methanol (2:1). The compound is completely hydrolyzed and glucuronic acid released by either mild acid or beta-glucuronidase, whereas mild base hydrolysis results in a mixture of glucuronic acid and glucuronic acid-1,2-cyclic phosphate. These data and the behavior of the lipid-linked glucuronide on DEAE-cellulose chromatography indicate that the compound contains a monophosphate diester of glucuronic acid, which is beta-linked to a lipid. The synthesis of the lipid-linked glucuronide in uninduced normal embryonic liver is very low (5-15 pmol product/mg/5 min) at all developmental ages up to hatching, but the introduction of phenobarbital into the air space of a 9-10-day-old embryo causes a premature increase of activity (75-150 pmol products/mg/5 min) within 7 days. The glucuronyltransferase in adult and induced embryonic liver has a Km for UDPGlcUA of 0.17 x 10(-3) M and a broad pH optimum between pH 6 and 7. Glucuronic acid is released from the lipid-linked glucuronide by a beta-glucuronidase in liver that is active at neutral pH and is not inhibited by saccharolactone. This glycosidase activity appears, therefore, to be distinct from the previously characterized lysosomal beta-glucuronidase. Fractionation of adult chicken liver membranes by differential centrifugation indicates that over 70% of the glucuronyltransferase is associated with the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions. The endogenous beta-glucuronidase capable of hydrolyzing the lipid-linked glucuronide was not separated from the glucuronyl-transferase activity during fractionation. The data available suggests that the lipid-linked glucuronide is involved directly in the generation of free glucuronic acid for further metabolism."
