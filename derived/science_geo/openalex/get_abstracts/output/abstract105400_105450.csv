We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel member (uKATP-1) of the inward rectifier K+ channel family from a rat pancreatic islet cDNA library. Rat uKATP-1 is a 424-amino acid residue protein (Mr = 47,960). Electrophysiological studies of uKATP-1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes show that uKATP-1 is a weak rectifier and is blocked with Ba2+ ions. Single-channel patch clamp study of clonal human kidney epithelial cells (HEK293) transfected with uKATP-1 cDNA reveals that uKATP-1 closes in response to 1 mM ATP and has a single channel conductance of 70 ± 2 picosiemens (n = 6), indicating that uKATP-1 is an ATP-sensitive inward rectifier K+ channel. In addition, uKATP-1 is activated by the KATP channel opener, diazoxide. RNA blot analysis shows that uKATP-1 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in rat tissues, including pancreatic islets, pituitary, skeletal muscle, and heart, suggesting that uKATP-1 may play a physiological role as a link between the metabolic state and membrane K+ permeability of cells in almost every normal tissue. Since uKATP-1 shares only 43-46% amino acid identity with members of previously reported inward rectifier K+ channel subfamilies, including ROMK1, IRK1, GIRK1, and cKATP-1, uKATP-1 is not an isoform of these subfamilies and, therefore, represents a new subfamily of the inward rectifier K+ channel family having two transmembrane segments.

https://openalex.org/W2039037981,"The plasma membrane V-ATPase of Manduca sexta larval midgut is an electrogenic proton pump located in goblet cell apical membranes (GCAM); it energizes, by the voltage component of its proton motive force, an electrophoretic K+/nH+ antiport and thus K+ secretion (Wieczorek, H., Putzenlechner, M., Zeiske, W., and Klein, U.(1991) J. Biol Chem. 266, 15340-15347). Midgut transepithelial voltage, indicating net active K+ transport, was found to be more than 100 mV during intermoult stages but was abolished during moulting. Simultaneously, ATP hydrolysis and ATP-dependent proton transport in GCAM vesicles were found to be reduced to 10-15% of the intermoult level. Immunocytochemistry of midgut cryosections as well as SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblots of GCAM demonstrated that loss of ATPase activity paralleled the disappearance of specific subunits. The subunits missing were those considered to compose the peripheral V1 sector, whereas the membrane integral V0 subunits remained in the GCAM of moulting larvae. The results provide, for the first time, evidence that a V-ATPase activity can be controlled in vivo by the loss of the peripheral V1 domain.

The results provide, for the first time, evidence that a V-ATPase activity can be controlled in vivo by the loss of the peripheral V1 domain. H+ translocating V-ATPases are ubiquitous in endomembranes (Anraku et al., 1992) but also occur in many plasma membranes (Gluck et al., 1992). The plasma membrane V-ATPase in the larval midgut epithelium of Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) is a typical representative of these heteromultimeric proteins (Wieczorek, 1992): amino acid sequences deduced from cDNAs encoding four M. sexta V-ATPase subunits show substantial similarities to subunits of V-ATPases from other sources (67-kDa subunit A (Gräf et al., 1992); 56-kDa subunit B (Novak et al., 1992); 28-kDa subunit E (Gräf et al., 1994a); 17-kDa subunit c (Dow et al., 1992)). The peripheral V1 part of the M. sexta V-ATPase appears to consist of at least the subunits A, B and E, which are common to all V-ATPases, along with a 14-kDa subunit (Gräf et al., 1994b), which has since been identified and sequenced in Drosophila melanogaster (EMBL/GenBank accession number Z26918) and yeast (Graham et al., 1994; Nelson et al., 1994) although no homologous subunits have yet been identified in vertebrates. The membrane integral V0 part appears to consist of at least the 43-kDa subunit and the 17-kDa subunit c (Gräf et al., 1994b); the latter subunit evidently forms the proton-conducting pore, and, like its counterparts in other V-ATPases (Mandel et al., 1988), it is labeled by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 1A. Lepier and H. Wieczorek, unpublished observations. V-ATPases usually energize the transport of acid into organelles or out of cells (see Harvey and Nelson(1992)). The plasma membrane V-ATPase in the larval midgut of M. sexta is an exception to this rule since it does not energize acid transport to the cell exterior (Wieczorek, 1992). By contrast, it produces, due to the absence of functional anion channels, a high transmembrane voltage in excess of 250 mV across the goblet cell apical membrane (Dow, 1992) that drives an electrophoretic K+/nH+ antiport (Wieczorek et al., 1991). The combined activity of V-ATPase and K+/nH+ antiport in the same membrane results in net K+ secretion. Thus both elements constitute the electrogenic active transport mechanism, which had already been detected in the lepidopteran midgut 30 years ago (Harvey and Nedergaard, 1964). The K+ active transport mechanism not only energizes the absorption of amino acids but also, at least in part, the alkalinization of the midgut lumen; the luminal fluid produced is the most alkaline in a biological system and can exceed pH 12 (Dow, 1984; Harvey, 1992; Dow, 1992). The unique potency of the V-ATPase in lepidopteran midgut, and the ease with which it can be measured by the electrical signature of the transport, render it an attractive model system for studies of regulation of the V-ATPase. Maintaining the very high active K+ transport rates measured must require a huge amount of energy; the minimum cost has been estimated to be 10% of a larva's total ATP production (Dow, 1984). Therefore one would expect, for reasons of economy, that K+ transport should be strongly regulated. However, larvae taken at different times of day or at different nutritional states show uniformly high rates of transport, as assessed by electrical and pH measurements. The only indication for regulation of ion transport was given by Cioffi(1984), who cited her own unpublished evidence that K+ fluxes fell when larvae moulted from one instar to the next. In this investigation, we report on events during a larval/larval moult. We measured a reversible switching off and on of K+ transport that was correlated with active and inactive states of the V-ATPase. These results provide evidence, for the first time, that a V-ATPase activity can be controlled in vivo by the loss of the peripheral V1 domain. M. sexta larvae were reared on a standard artificial diet (Yamamoto, 1969; Bell and Joachim, 1974). Larvae were maintained in a 16-h light/8-h dark photo period at 25-27°C. Eggs were either kindly supplied by Dr. Stuart Reynolds at the University of Bath or were from the Munich laboratory M. sexta culture. Larvae were studied during the final (fourth to fifth instar) larval moult. Staging of larvae was based upon development of external morphological features (Baldwin and Hakim, 1991) as summarized below. Fourth instar intermoult larvae feed and gain mass until they attain the weight of approximately 1.5 g (stage A). They stop feeding upon entry into the moult (stage B). Development of an extensively green head capsule and dropping of the head are the first external indications of entry into the moult (stage C). The following processes up to ecdysis take approximately 24 h in total. The base of the head capsule becomes opaque (stage D) and then the head capsule becomes entirely opaque, and the mandibles are present but unpigmented (stage E). The mandibles become pigmented (stage F), and finally ecdysis occurs. The onset of ecdysis is defined as the point when integument begins to be shed, and the larvae lose their head capsule (stage G). About 2 h after the moult (stage H), the larvae resume feeding and are then considered to be fifth instar intermoult larvae. Where not stated otherwise, moulting stage E larvae weighing about 1.5 g, approximately 12-18 h after development of a green head capsule (“stage E moulting larvae”), were used and compared with feeding fifth instar intermoult larvae of about 5-7 g (“fifth instar feeding larvae”). transepithelial voltage goblet cell apical membranes 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. transepithelial voltage goblet cell apical membranes 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. Voltage measurements were taken at hourly time points during the time course of the fourth to fifth instar moult. TEV across the midgut was measured using an Ussing-type chamber (Dow et al., 1985). Measurements were made on a flat sample of mid-midgut stretched across an aperture 6 mm in diameter. This was inserted into the chamber using a holder. “Manduca saline” (Dow and O'Donnell, 1990) was oxygenated and circulated on either side of the epithelium. Open circuit voltage was measured using silver chloride electrodes and displayed on a chart recorder via a ×1 high impedance preamplifier. Stable TEV readings were obtained 15 min after mounting the midgut in the chamber. Preparation of GCAM from fifth instar feeding larvae was carried out according to Cioffi & Wolfersberger(1983) and Wieczorek et al.(1990). The preparation of membranes from the much smaller stage E moulting larvae required some subtle modifications. After removal of the longitudinal muscles, the tissue pieces from 10 stage E moulting larvae were pooled and sonicated. Sonication time was reduced by approximately 30%. The sample was washed, aspirated, and filtered as described for fifth instar feeding larvae. The filtrate was spun at 250 × g for 2 min, and the resulting supernatant was discarded. Pellets from 30 larvae were accumulated on ice. Following the published protocols, the combined pellets were layered onto a 45:41:37% (w/w) discontinuous sucrose density gradient and spun overnight at 77,000 × g. Band 2 contained partially purified GCAM. Thirty stage E moulting larvae yielded approximately 5 μg of partially purified GCAM protein/100 μg (wet weight) of tissue. This figure was in the same order of magnitude as the protein yield from fifth instar feeding larvae. Preparation of highly purified membranes from partially purified GCAM was as described previously (Wieczorek et al., 1990). Assays of V-ATPase activity in partially purified GCAM were performed at an ambient temperature of 24-27°C and consisted of approximately 25-30 μg of membrane protein/ml, 1 mM Tris-ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM sodium azide, and 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate. The reaction was started by the addition of ATP/MgCl2, incubated for 5 min, and stopped by immersion of the samples in liquid nitrogen. All further conditions, including the determination of inorganic phosphate, were as described previously (Wieczorek et al., 1990). ATP-dependent vesicle acidification was measured by the quench in fluorescence of acridine orange (Wieczorek et al., 1989). Assays had the same composition as for the determination of V-ATPase activity except the inclusion of 0.9 μM acridine orange. Larval midguts were prepared under ice-cold fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 M S⊘rensen phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)) and fixed in the same solution for 1-2 h on ice. Procedures for embedding, cryosectioning, and immunolabeling were modified slightly from those described by Klein et al.(1991). Two protein G-purified monoclonal antibodies to the native V-ATPase, 3U. Klein, M. Timme, F. J. S. Novak, A. Lepier, W. R. Harvey, and H. Wieczorek, unpublished results. one to the 67-kDa subunit of the V-ATPase) and one to the 56-kDa subunit B, and an undefined polypeptide of about 20 kDa) were applied for labeling. Incubations with the primary antibody solutions were carried out overnight at room temperature. The antibodies were visualized by 5-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG, whole molecule, Sigma) diluted as recommended by the producer. For light microscopical inspection, the gold particle labeling was intensified by silver staining (silver enhancement kit, Boehringer Mannheim). The sections were rinsed for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 3 mM KCl, 0.02% NaN3 (pH 7.4)) and desalted by rinsing 6 times for 2 min in distilled water. Silver labeling was completed after about 15 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by rinsing 5 times for 2 min in distilled water. Finally the sections were covered by Mowiol 4-88 (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany) and investigated with a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope by normal or difference interference illumination. To test for unspecific binding of secondary antibody or unspecific silver depositions, control incubations were performed with blocking solution instead of primary antibody or without any antibody incubation but treatment for silver enhancement only. For dot blots and for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, samples were resuspended in 125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 2%β-mercaptoethanol and with additional 5% sucrose and 0.05% bromphenol blue in the case of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples were heated at 95°C for 30 s (see Fig. 4) or 5 min (see Figure 5:, Figure 6:). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting on nitrocellulose membranes (BA85), immunostaining, and protein determination with Amido Black were performed as described previously (Schweikl et al., 1989; Wieczorek et al., 1990, 1991). Silver-stained protein was visualized according to Merril et al.((1Anraku Y. Hirata R. Wade Y. Ohya Y. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 67-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling with N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was performed according to Zheng et al.(1992). As primary antibodies for immunostaining, a polyclonal rabbit immune serum against the native V-ATPase (Wieczorek et al., 1991), monospecific rabbit antibodies to the 14-kDa subunit (Gräf et al., 1994b) or protein G-purified monoclonal mouse antibodies to the 67-kDa subunit A) or to the 28-kDa subunit E) were used.4 The alkaline phospatase-conjugated secondary antibody probe was either goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Fourth instar feeding larvae generated a transepithelial voltage of +91 ± 10 mV (n = 4, mean ± S.D.), lumen side positive (Fig. 1). The high TEV indicated that active electrogenic K+ transport across the GCAM to the midgut lumen was as intense as it is in fifth instar feeding larvae. Approximately 2 h before development of the head capsule, the larvae stopped feeding and purged the gut lumen of food (stage B). This behavior, the first sign of entry into the moult, did not affect the TEV, which remained stable until development of the head capsule (stage C), whereupon it fell abruptly to −5 ± 4 mV (n = 4, mean ± S.D.), lumen side negative. The slightly negative residual voltage, presumably due to unknown ion transport processes in the epithelium, which take longer to shut down, was reproducible and could be inhibited with 1 mM azide (results not shown). Approximately 1 h after head capsule development, the TEV had stabilized at 0 mV and remained at zero until ecdysis (stages D-F). Upon ecdysis, the TEV rose to +32 ± 13 mV (n = 5, mean ± S.D.), lumen side positive. The TEV continued rising steadily until it leveled off at approximately +100 mV some 4 h after ecdysis. The re-establishment of the active K+ transport mechanism after ecdysis was not triggered by the resumption of feeding, as it could be observed in larvae deprived of access to food since the start of the moult. These results provide evidence that the K+ transport mechanism is active during feeding stages and is inactive during moult. To analyze further the differences between active and inactive states, we used fifth instar feeding larvae to produce membranes with active K+ transport mechanisms and stage E moulting larvae to produce membranes with inactive K+ transport mechanisms. Stage E larvae were chosen because these larvae were midway between head capsule development and ecdysis. Membrane-bound V-ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport were assayed on partially purified GCAM preparations. Specific V-ATPase activity was 0.06 ± 0.02 μmol•mg−1•min−1 in stage E moulting larvae compared with 0.39 ± 0.03 μmol•mg−1•min−1 in fifth instar feeding larvae (n = 3, means ± S.D.). Thus there was a significant 84% reduction in V-ATPase activity in moulting larvae. An equally strong decrease was observed for ATP-dependent proton transport (Fig. 2); the maximal specific fluorescence quench obtained by using vesicles from stage E moulting larvae was 8 ± 5% (mean ± S.D., n = 4) that of fifth instar feeding larvae-derived vesicles. Inactivation of V-ATPase activity and proton transport during the moult could be accomplished either by inactivation or by down-regulation of the proton pump. Therefore, cryosections of larval midgut were probed for immunolocalization of the V-ATPase molecule with two monoclonal antibodies to peripheral V1-part subunits. In fourth instar feeding larvae (Fig. 3a) and in fifth instar feeding larvae (Fig. 3c), there was intense labeling in the area of the goblet cell apical membrane, whereas stage E moulting larvae exhibited only faint or undetectable labeling (Fig. 3b, cf. the control, Fig. 3d). This result means that in stage E moulting larvae, the mature goblet cells had lost their immunoreactivity and that the newly developing goblet cells had not yet gained it. To determine whether the V-ATPase holoenzyme or just specific subunits were down-regulated during moult, the polypeptide composition of highly purified GCAM, isolated from either stage E moulting larvae or fifth instar feeding larvae, was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). Although the overall band patterns of the membrane samples were similar, there were significant differences in the subunit profiles of the V-ATPase. GCAM from fifth instar feeding larvae (Fig. 4, lanea) showed the full complement of defined insect V-ATPase subunits: 67, 56, 43, 28, 17, and 14 kDa. By contrast, in GCAM from stage E moulting larvae (Fig. 4, laneb), the peripheral 67-, 56-, 28-, and 14-kDa V1 subunits appeared to be strongly reduced, whereas the bands representing the integral membrane 43- and 17-kDa V0 subunits were stained as strongly or even more strongly as compared with GCAM from fifth instar feeding larvae. Specific labeling of the 17-kDa subunit by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide demonstrated that this subunit was present in both membrane preparations (Fig. 4, lanesc and d). Compared with active membranes from fifth instar feeding larvae, labeling on inactive membranes from stage E moulting larvae was more intense. The stronger appearance of the membrane integral subunits in silver staining and DCCD labeling suggested that these subunits were present as a higher proportion of total membrane protein. To verify that the difference in band patterns on SDS gels accurately reflected differences in the V-ATPase subunit composition, Western blots after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of partially purified GCAM from fifth instar feeding larvae and from stage E moulting larvae were stained with a monoclonal antibody to the 67-kDa subunit and with monospecific antibodies to the 14-kDa subunit (Fig. 5). GCAM from stage E moulting larvae exhibited no (67-kDa subunit) or nearly no (14-kDa subunit) immunoreactivity as compared with GCAM from fifth instar feeding larvae. To quantify the loss of V1 subunits, serial dilutions of partially purified GCAM from fifth instar feeding larvae and from stage E moulting larvae were dot blotted and probed with various antibodies against the V-ATPase. As deduced from staining intensity, binding of polyclonal antibodies against the holoenzyme indicated that GCAM from stage E moulting larvae contained approximately 50% less V-ATPase protein than identical amounts of GCAM from fifth instar feeding larvae (Fig. 6, i.). GCAM blots were also probed with the antibodies used for the Western blots in Fig. 5 and with a monoclonal antibody against the 28-kDa subunit (Fig. 6, ii-iv). All three subunits were at least 5-10-fold reduced in inactive stage E membranes. Taken together, results from silver-stained SDS gels, from Western blots and from dot blots, were consistent with the immunocytochemical results in which monoclonal antibodies had failed to label the peripheral V1 subunits.Figure 6:Dot blots of partially purified goblet cell apical membranes after SDS treatment.

K+ secretion, which is energized by the electrogenic proton pumping V-ATPase via an electrophoretic K+/nH+ antiporter, is switched off temporarily during the moult. The decrease in K+ transporting capability is paralleled by an almost complete loss of plasma membrane V-ATPase activity. Inactivity of ATP hydrolysis and proton pumping corresponds with the transient absence of peripheral V1 subunits from the goblet cell apical membrane, whereas the membrane integral V0 subunits remain. During a moult, the number of midgut cells increases about 4-fold by intercalation of new goblet and columnar cells between the mature differentiated cells already present in the epithelium (Baldwin and Hakim, 1991). The mature cells remain intact and mostly unchanged. In stage E moulting larvae, the newly developing cells have already grown and differentiated to a columnar shape and extend regularly among the mature cells. Therefore, one could argue that lowered specific enzyme activity may be due to the increased tissue mass of the newly emerged cells, especially that of goblet cells, in which the plasma membrane V-ATPase has not yet been assembled. This explanation may be true in part. However, the immunocytochemical results clearly demonstrated that at moulting stage E, antibodies against peripheral subunits do not label the mature goblet membrane. Furthermore, analysis of the protein pattern of inactivated GCAM revealed that only the peripheral subunits were missing from the V-ATPase subunit profile. Both findings strongly suggest that V1 subunits disappear from the membrane in the early moulting stages and that the immunoreactivity, complete subunit pattern, and full pump activity are re-established after ecdysis. Control of pump activity in vivo by regulation of the number of V-ATPase molecules has been described in kidney epithelial cells (Brown et al., 1991). In these cells, pump concentration is increased by integration of vesicles heavily loaded with complete V1V0 holoenzymes. However, there is no ultrastructural evidence that such an endo-exocytotic regulation of V-ATPase occurs in M. sexta midgut. Bovine kidney cells have also been reported to contain a cytosolic inhibitor protein of 6.3 kDa, as well as a cytosolic activator protein of approximately 35 kDa, both affecting V-ATPases specifically (Zhang et al., 1992a, 1992b). So far, we have found no direct evidence that such proteins are associated with the M. sexta plasma membrane V-ATPase. However, we cannot exclude the presence of factors that may stabilize or destabilize the V1V0 holoenzyme. The disassembly of V1 subunits from the V0 domain is well known from in vitro experiments with V-ATPases. The membrane-bound V1V0 holoenzyme is readily dissociated by treatment with chaotropic agents or by cold-inactivation in the presence of ATP (see Nelson, 1992). Dissociation of V1 and V0 renders the enzyme unable to hydrolyze ATP or to transport protons. Upon re-association of the V1 subunits with membranes containing V0 domains, ATP-driven proton transport is restored (Puopolo and Forgac, 1990). In vivo, V0 domains are thought to be present in membranes in excess (Zhang et al., 1992c) and correspondingly, it is thought, there is a cytoplasmic pool not only of V1 subunits (Nelson and Taiz, 1989) but of fully assembled, enzymically inactive, V1 domains of unknown function (Myers and Forgac, 1993). The present study on the plasma membrane V-ATPase in M. sexta midgut is the first clear demonstration of in vivo control of V-ATPase activity by regulation of the association of V1 with V0 domains. The fate of the missing V1 subunits is not known since any unattached subunits will be lost during membrane purification. Preliminary studies using Northern blots have indicated no significant change in mRNA concentration for peripheral subunits over the time course of the moult (results not shown), so we may speculate that the V1 domains remain intact and are re-associated with the apical membrane at ecdysis. The regulatory signals for disassembly or assembly of the V1V0 holoenzyme now need to be elucidated. The switching of V-ATPase activity during the moult demonstrated here occurs in synchrony with hormonal signals (Truman, 1992). V-ATPase activity is turned off during an ecdysone peak in the presence of juvenile hormone and returns when ecdysis is stimulated by eclosion hormone. It seems not unlikely that V-ATPase activity is modulated, either directly or indirectly, by these hormones. The unique transport capabilities, their strict regulation during moult and the ease of biochemical accessibility make M. sexta midgut an exciting system for further studies of regulation of V-ATPase activity. We thank Alexandra Lepier for much help with the N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide labeling, Dr. Ralph Gräf for preparing the anti 14-kDa monospecific antibodies, and Dr. William R. Harvey for critically reading the manuscript."

Recently it has been found that rat hepatic ●NO synthesis results in a decrease in both activity and levels of cytochrome P450 (CYP)( 1The abbreviations used are: CYPcytochrome P450CMEa cytokine mixture (tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-α, interleukin-1β) plus endotoxin/lipopolysaccharideHOheme oxygenaseNMMANG-monomethyl-L-arginineNOxnitrite plus nitratePBSphosphate-buffered salineP420cytochrome P420P450cytochrome P450SNAPS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. )(4Khatsenko O.G.

Understanding the mechanism by which endogenous ●NO inhibits heme-containing proteins is likely to explain such important phenomena as decreased drug tolerance in septic patients(6Kraemer M.J. Furukawa C.T. Koup J.R. Shapiro G.G. Pierson W.E. Bierman C.W. Pediatrics. 1982; 69: 476-480PubMed Google Scholar). We describe here one basis for this phenomenon, which involves ●NO-induced intracellular heme loss and increased heme degradation. cytochrome P450 a cytokine mixture (tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-α, interleukin-1β) plus endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide heme oxygenase NG-monomethyl-L-arginine nitrite plus nitrate phosphate-buffered saline cytochrome P420 cytochrome P450 S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. Williams media E, trypan blue, insulin, penicillin, streptomycin, L-glutamine, and HEPES were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Calf serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Collagenase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) was synthesized as described previously(7Field L. Dilts R.V. Ravichandran R. Lenhert P.G. Carnahan G.E. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1978; : 249-250Crossref Google Scholar), stored frozen as a solid in the dark, and routinely checked for stoichiometric S-nitrosothiol content by the method of Saville(8Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Purified hepatocytes were isolated and treated with a cytokine mixture (tumor necrosis factor-α (Genzyme), interferon-α (Amgen), interleukin-1β (Cistron)) plus endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma) (CME) with or without NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA) for 24 h as described previously(9Stadler J. Bergonia H.A. Di Silvio M. Sweetland M.A. Billiar T.R. Simmons R.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were also exposed for 9 h to 1 mM SNAP in medium. Cell death (measured by crystal violet staining) resulting from the various treatments was found to be minimal. Hepatocytes (1 × 107 cells) were suspended in 750 μl of PBS and homogenized on ice for 2 min by using a glass tissue homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. The solution was centrifuged at maximum speed (14,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4°C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The supernatant was designated as enzyme solution for catalase assay. Catalase activity was measured using a Clark type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments Co.) as described(10Del Maestro R.F. McDonald W. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 291-296Google Scholar). The reaction mixture in a final volume of 1.5 ml of degassed PBS contained 20 μl of the enzyme solution and 50 μl of 400 mM H2O2 in PBS. For isolation of microsomes, crude cytosol (11Kim Y.M. Lancaster Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was spun at 100,000 × g for 90 min to pellet the microsomes. Spectra and quantitation of the reduced versus reduced plus CO complex of CYP were as described(12Estabrook R.W. Werringloer J. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Total extractable heme was quantified according to a previously described method(13Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Microsomes (10 μM total heme) were exposed to dissolved ●NO (88 μM) anaerobically for varying times at room temperature after which the ●NO was removed by gassing with argon, and total CYP heme was assayed as described above. For heme reconstitution of P450, each microsomal fraction (control, CME (24 h), CME + NMMA (24 h), and SNAP (12 h)) was divided between two dialyzing tubes. One tube was dialyzed aerobically for 6 h at 4°C against phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.8), while the other was dialyzed aerobically against the same buffer but contained 50 μM heme (hematin reduced to heme by an equivalent amount of sodium dithionite in a small volume). All samples were dialyzed further against phosphate buffer for 24 h to remove excess heme, and CYP was determined as described above. Total iron was determined using a colorimetric micromethod after acid-permanganate treatment(14Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Nonheme iron is expressed as the difference between the total and heme iron. δ-Aminolevulinate synthetase, heme oxygenase (HO), and ferrochelatase activities were assayed as described(15Cable E.E. Healey J.F. Greene Y. Evans C.O. Bonkovsky H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Bonkovsky H.L. Healey J.F. Pohl J. Eur. J.

Total RNA was extracted from the cultured hepatocytes, electrophoresed, and blotted as described by Geller et al.(18Geller D.A. Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The probe to inducible nitric oxide synthase used was a 2.7-kilobase cDNA obtained by NotI digestion from a mouse macrophage cDNA clone(18Geller D.A. Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Wang S.C. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The HO probe used was a 1.4-kilobase cDNA obtained by EcoRI digestion from a human macrophage (U937 histiolytic lymphoma) cDNA clone(19Yoshida T. Biro P. Cohen T. Müller R.M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Radioactive membranes were quantified with storage phosphor screens (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics), and the relative amount of mRNA is presented as the ratio of mRNA to 18 S RNA. The appearance of total medium NOx (NO2−+ NO3−) was measured as described previously(9Stadler J. Bergonia H.A. Di Silvio M. Sweetland M.A. Billiar T.R. Simmons R.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by Lowry protein assay kit (P5656, Sigma). Results represent means ± S.D. from a minimum of three experiments. Significance between groups was determined using the Student's unpaired t test. Catalase is a heme-containing enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of H2O2 to O2 and H2O. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of hepatocytes with CME (which we have shown previously to induce substantial ●NO synthesis(9Stadler J. Bergonia H.A. Di Silvio M. Sweetland M.A. Billiar T.R. Simmons R.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)) results in a decrease followed by gradual recovery of catalase activity. The minimum activity (65% loss) occurred at approximately the same time as the maximum rate of ●NO synthesis, as we have shown previously(20Nussler A.K. Geller D.A. Sweetland M.A. Di Silvio M. Billiar T.R. Madariaga J.B. Simmons R.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ●NO synthesis by NMMA results in oblation of catalase activity loss, demonstrating that it is due to ●NO production. This result raises the possibility that inhibition of catalase may be a previously unrecognized mechanism of ●NO-induced potentiation of oxidative injury(21Grisham M.B. Reactive Metabolites of Oxygen and Nitrogen in Biology and Medicine. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1992Google Scholar). The CYPs are heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the metabolism of a variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds. We chose this class of enzymes for further studies on the effects of ●NO because they represent the major heme pool in hepatocytes(22Bonkovsky H.L. Zakim D. Boyer T.D. Hepatology. A Textbook of Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1982: 351-393Google Scholar), and inactivation can be monitored by the reduced versus reduced + CO difference spectrum of the microsomal fraction(23Guengerich F.P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the effects of endogenous and exogenous ●NO on microsomal CYP heme and total extractable microsomal heme (13Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) in cultured rat hepatocytes. Exogenous ●NO exposure was accomplished by using SNAP, an ●NO donor. Compared with control cells there is an approximately 60% decrease in basal (uninduced) CYP heme induced by either endogenous or exogenous ●NO, as reported previously for inducible CYP heme(4Khatsenko O.G. Gross S.S. Rifkind A.B. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11147-11151Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 5Stadler J. Trockfeld J. Schmalix W.A. Brill T. Siewert J.R. Greim H. Doehmer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). CYP heme loss is prevented by inhibition of ●NO synthesis (NMMA). The parent compound of SNAP (N-acetylpenicillamine, not containing a nitrosyl group) had no effect (data not shown); that was also true for all other studies below with SNAP. In order to determine whether this effect is due to prevention by ●NO of CO binding to heme (thus masking the appearance of the 450 nm peak(4Khatsenko O.G. Gross S.S. Rifkind A.B. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11147-11151Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar)) or instead loss of CYP protein and/or heme, we assayed total extractable microsomal heme. Fig. 1B shows that both endogenous and exogenous ●NO cause a loss of total microsomal heme that is quantitatively indistinguishable from CYP heme loss. Having established that the effect of ●NO is due to decreased holocytochrome P450 (and not prevention of CO binding), we next determined whether this effect is due to a decrease in CYP protein expression (as reported by Stadler et al.(5Stadler J. Trockfeld J. Schmalix W.A. Brill T. Siewert J.R. Greim H. Doehmer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) for inducible CYP) or to loss of enzyme-bound heme. We first determined if exposure of microsomes from untreated hepatocytes to ●NO induces loss of heme. As shown in Fig. 1C, exposure of microsomes from untreated hepatocytes (I) to ●NO for 20 min (II) results in partial conversion of P450 into P420, indicative of sulfur to nitrogen exchange of proximal axial heme ligand (23Guengerich F.P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). From comparison with the spectrum of free heme (IV), after a further 40-min exposure (III) it can be concluded that a substantial portion of CYP heme is fully detached from its normal binding in the proteins, as judged by the appearance of the peak at 405 nm(24Marden M.C. Hazard E.S. Leclerc L. Gibson Q.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4422-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore it appears that NO exposure induces P450 to P420 conversion followed by release of heme from CYP. In order to determine whether a decrease in CYP is due to decreased CYP protein or loss of heme, we determined whether CYP apoprotein is present after loss of heme. We determined this by isolating microsomes from ●NO-synthesizing hepatocytes (or from hepatocytes treated with SNAP), dialyzing the preparations versus heme, and then measuring the reduced versus reduced plus CO spectrum of the preparations to determine whether heme had reinserted into apocytochrome P450 (Fig. 1D). This method has been used successfully for reconstitution of several cytochrome P450s subsequent to several methods of inducing heme loss/destruction, including P450cam(25Yu C-A. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 107-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), P450SCC(26Pikuleva I.A. Lapko A.G. Chashchin V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1438-1442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the system studied here, rat hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450(27Bonkovsky H.L. Sinclair J.F. Healey J.F. Sinclair P.R. Smith E.L. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Bornheim L.M. Parish D.W. Smith K.M. Litman D.A. Correia M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have documented that the characteristic peak at 450 nm (for which these enzymes are named) is due to proximal cysteine ligation to the heme and that conversion to nitrogenous proximal heme ligation results in a shift in the peak to 420 nm with consequent loss of activity(23Guengerich F.P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in spectra I, dialysis versus heme of microsomes from control hepatocytes did not result in appreciable effects on the total CYP heme and resulted in no appreciable increase in either P420 or P450 heme absorption, as was also true for hepatocytes treated with the cytokine mixture plus NMMA (III). As shown in II, however, the substantial loss of CYP in microsomes from ●NO-synthesizing hepatocytes was restored by dialysis versus heme. Spectra IV show an effect with SNAP-treated cells that is similar to ●NO-producing cells, demonstrating that either endogenous or exogenous ●NO induces comparable effects. These results demonstrate that, in contrast to CYP induced by xenobiotic exposure (5Stadler J. Trockfeld J. Schmalix W.A. Brill T. Siewert J.R. Greim H. Doehmer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the virtually exclusive effect of ●NO on basal CYP is loss of the heme prosthetic group with no appreciable decrease in CYP protein. In addition, the CYP apoproteins are left in a relatively native conformation since P450 (not P420) is reconstituted by heme. We note that while observation of the feature at 450 nm demonstrates that heme has indeed reinserted into the apoproteins (thus showing that CYP apoproteins are present), we have not attempted to determine whether dialysis versus heme results in reconstitution of any specific P450 activity because different CYP isoforms may be differently affected by ●NO (as described below). We next determined whether intracellular heme levels in ●NO-producing hepatocytes change as a result of liberation from CYP, which is known to be the major heme pool in these cells(22Bonkovsky H.L. Zakim D. Boyer T.D. Hepatology. A Textbook of Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1982: 351-393Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated ●NO-induced loss of total cellular iron from cells (including hepatocytes(29Billiar T.R. Curran R.D. Stuehr D.J. Ferrari F.K. Simmons R.L. Surgery. 1989; 106: 364-371PubMed Google Scholar)), although no differentiation of heme versus nonheme iron has yet been made(1Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4128) Google Scholar, 2Hibbs Jr., J.B. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Granger D.L. Drapier J.C. Amber I.J. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Moncada S. Higgs E.A. Nitric Oxide from L-Arginine: A Bioregulatory System. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1990: 189-223Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, there is a selective loss of whole cell total extractable heme iron upon induction of ●NO synthesis with CME, which is prevented by NMMA. Similar loss occurs with SNAP-treated cells. No significant change in total cellular nonheme iron occurs (Fig. 2B), although the total amount of nonheme iron is much more than heme iron. Similar relative changes in heme also occur in the microsomal and cytosolic subcellular fractions. Interestingly, there is a relatively modest but detectable increase in nonheme iron in the cytosolic fraction, which may represent increased iron storage as ferritin(30Leibold E.A. Guo B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 345-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, free heme is known to up-regulate its own degradation (by transcriptionally regulated increase of HO) and down-regulate endogenous synthesis (by decrease of mRNA stability and mitochondrial import of δ-aminolevulinate synthetase(22Bonkovsky H.L. Zakim D. Boyer T.D. Hepatology. A Textbook of Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1982: 351-393Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 3A, induction of ●NO synthesis by hepatocytes results in a decrease in δ-aminolevulinate synthetase and an increase in heme oxygenase activities, consistent with intracellular heme liberation with consequent effects on these two enzymes. This result also indicates that the increase in heme oxygenase and decrease in δ-aminolevulinate synthetase activities in rats injected with LPS (31Bissell D.M. Hammaker L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 176: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Bissell D.M. Hammaker L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 176: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are due to ●NO-induced heme liberation. It is worth noting that even in the presence of NMMA there is still an approximately 2-fold increase in heme oxygenase activity, which may indicate up-regulation by cytokine treatment (33Helqvist S. Polla B.S. Johannesen J. Nerup J. Diabetologia. 1991; 34: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Mitani K. Fujita H. Kappas A. Sassa S. Blood. 1992; 79: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Fukuda Y. Sassa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that is ●NO-independent. Ferrochelatase, recently discovered to contain an Fe2S2 nonheme iron-sulfur center(36Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), catalyzes the insertion of iron into porphyrin. As shown in Fig. 3A, ●NO synthesis also decreases ferrochelatase activity, which represents a newly identified nonheme iron enzymatic target for ●NO. Fig. 3B presents a time course for the changes in the activities of these three enzymes after exposure to SNAP. While a decrease in δ-aminolevulinate synthetase and an increase in heme oxygenase activities require a time lag of 2-3 h (consistent with previously described heme-induced regulatory mechanisms(22Bonkovsky H.L. Zakim D. Boyer T.D. Hepatology. A Textbook of Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1982: 351-393Google Scholar)), the decrease in ferrochelatase activity is virtually complete within 1 h. This indicates that ●NO inhibits activity of this enzyme by a direct effect, perhaps by destruction of its nonheme iron-sulfur cluster(36Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This inhibition will contribute to a decrease in intracellular heme levels in addition to a decrease in δ-aminolevulinate synthetase and an increase in heme oxygenase activities. Finally, Fig. 3C demonstrates that ●NO synthesis results in increased heme oxygenase transcription, as determined by Northern blot analysis using a cDNA probe to human HO1(19Yoshida T. Biro P. Cohen T. Müller R.M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The increase occurs slightly after induction of ●NO synthase and concomitant with ●NO synthesis (appearance of NO2−+ NO3− in the medium, NOx). Heme oxygenase mRNA is induced also by SNAP, without the lag required for induction of ●NO synthase by the cytokine mixture, demonstrating that ●NO alone (without cytokines) can induce heme oxygenase. Although not shown, addition of 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (20 μM) did not induce an increase in heme oxygenase mRNA, indicating that the effect is not due to a cGMP signaling mechanism. With regard to the possible mechanism(s) of ●NO-induced heme loss, previous studies in oxygen-free conditions have shown that ●NO binds to both the reduced and oxidized forms of CYP and that conversion to the inactive P420 form can take place(37O'Keeffe D.H. Ebel R.E. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3509-3516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of oxygen, Wink et al.(38Wink D.A. Osawa Y. Darbyshire J.F. Jones C.R. Eshenaur S.C. Nims R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) have shown that ●NO causes both a transient, reversible inhibition of enzymatic activity and a long lasting irreversible inhibition. The transient reversible inhibition may be due to formation of nitrosyl-heme complexes; the irreversible inhibition is substantially prevented by the addition of albumin, suggesting the formation of a reactive nitrogen oxide species from the reaction of ●NO with O2 (to form nitrosonium ion equivalents [NO+]) or with ●O2− (to produce peroxynitrite, ONOO−). Early work demonstrated the formation of nitrosonium ion equivalents ([NO+]) in activated macrophages synthesizing ●NO, and similar chemical reactivity is exhibited by the reaction of ●NO with O2 in aqueous solution(39Miwa M. Stuehr D.J. Marletta M.A. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 40Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In addition, activated macrophages synthesize peroxynitrite(41Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that both heme and albumin are nucleophilic targets for nitrosation (42Bonnett R. Charalambides A.A. Martin R.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1978; : 974-980Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) and that albumin is a target for peroxynitrite(44Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that all hemoproteins do not respond identically to endogenous nitrogen oxides. For example, as shown in Fig. 1B there appears to be a subpopulation of CYP proteins that are resistant to 60-min exposure to ●NO, and mitochondrial cytochromes are also resistant to enzymatic inhibition(1Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4128) Google Scholar, 2Hibbs Jr., J.B. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Granger D.L. Drapier J.C. Amber I.J. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Moncada S. Higgs E.A. Nitric Oxide from L-Arginine: A Bioregulatory System. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1990: 189-223Google Scholar). In addition, at least two enzymes (cyclooxygenase (45Salvemini D. Misko T.P. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Currie M.G. Needleman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7240-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar) and guanylyl cyclase(46Ignarro L.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar)) are stimulated by ●NO. In the latter case, the results presented here may suggest that nitrosylation of the heme in guanylate cyclase is a transient event, terminated by dissociation of the NO-heme from the enzyme. This may explain the transient nature of stimulation of cGMP synthesis by ●NO. These results also may have relevance to other well known pathophysiological conditions. For example, formation of ●NO by the reticuloendothelial system under conditions of immune activation may result in decreased erythropoiesis, perhaps contributing to the well known anemia of inflammation and infection(47Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Dierich M.P. Wachter H. Eur. J. Haematol. 1991; 46: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We thank Karla Wasserloos and William M.

https://openalex.org/W2081467822,"Considerable evidence supports the involvement of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) in the maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. A number of recently developed ACAT inhibitors may have potential use as pharmacological agents to reduce the development of atherosclerosis. Recently, however, reports arose describing cytotoxic effects following administration of a specific ACAT inhibitor to experimental animals. In order to address the specific intracellular mechanisms involved with the cytotoxic effect, we examined the consequences of ACAT inhibition in cholesterol-enriched mouse peritoneal macrophages. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were cholesterol-enriched by incubation with acetylated low density lipoprotein and free cholesterol:phospholipid dispersions prior to the addition of an ACAT inhibitor, either Sandoz 58-035 or Pfizer CP-113,818. The adenine pool of the macrophages was radiolabeled prior to addition of the ACAT inhibitors, in order to monitor the release of radiolabeled adenine, a technique shown to be a sensitive method to monitor drug-induced toxicity. The ACAT inhibitors were added for up to 48 h and at concentrations up to 2 μg/ml. These conditions resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in adenine release. The increase in cell toxicity paralleled an increase in the cellular free cholesterol content. Reducing the cellular free cholesterol content, by the addition of extracellular acceptors, decreased the cytotoxic effects of the ACAT inhibitors. Addition of an intracellular cholesterol transport inhibitor, either progesterone or U18666A, together with CP-113,818 blocked the toxic effect of CP-113,818. These results suggest that ACAT inhibition of cholesterol-enriched macrophages increases cell toxicity due to the buildup of cellular free cholesterol. Removal of free cholesterol by the addition of extracellular cholesterol acceptors or by blocking intracellular sterol transport relieves the ACAT inhibitor-induced toxicity. Considerable evidence supports the involvement of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) in the maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. A number of recently developed ACAT inhibitors may have potential use as pharmacological agents to reduce the development of atherosclerosis. Recently, however, reports arose describing cytotoxic effects following administration of a specific ACAT inhibitor to experimental animals. In order to address the specific intracellular mechanisms involved with the cytotoxic effect, we examined the consequences of ACAT inhibition in cholesterol-enriched mouse peritoneal macrophages. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were cholesterol-enriched by incubation with acetylated low density lipoprotein and free cholesterol:phospholipid dispersions prior to the addition of an ACAT inhibitor, either Sandoz 58-035 or Pfizer CP-113,818. The adenine pool of the macrophages was radiolabeled prior to addition of the ACAT inhibitors, in order to monitor the release of radiolabeled adenine, a technique shown to be a sensitive method to monitor drug-induced toxicity. The ACAT inhibitors were added for up to 48 h and at concentrations up to 2 μg/ml. These conditions resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in adenine release. The increase in cell toxicity paralleled an increase in the cellular free cholesterol content. Reducing the cellular free cholesterol content, by the addition of extracellular acceptors, decreased the cytotoxic effects of the ACAT inhibitors. Addition of an intracellular cholesterol transport inhibitor, either progesterone or U18666A, together with CP-113,818 blocked the toxic effect of CP-113,818. These results suggest that ACAT inhibition of cholesterol-enriched macrophages increases cell toxicity due to the buildup of cellular free cholesterol. Removal of free cholesterol by the addition of extracellular cholesterol acceptors or by blocking intracellular sterol transport relieves the ACAT inhibitor-induced toxicity. Intracellular esterification of cholesterol is accomplished by the microsomal enzyme, acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)( 1The abbreviations used are: ACATacyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferaseBSAbovine serum albuminPCphosphatidylcholineSandoz 58-035(3-[decyldimethylsilyl]-N-[2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylethyl]propanamide)CP-113,818(-)-N-(2,4-bis(methylthio)-6methylpyridin-3-yl)-2-(hexylthio) decanoic amide)U18666A(3β-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one)LDLlow density lipoproteinHDLhigh density lipoproteinrHDLreconstituted high density lipoproteinapo-HDL/PCapolipoproteins (from high density lipoproteins) and phosphatidylcholine-reconstituted particles. )(1Suckling K.E.

The structural characteristics of these compounds vary considerably, although most inhibit ACAT activity with IC50 values less than 1 μM(7Sliskovic D.R. White A.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 194-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). While the potential benefits of ACAT inhibitors have been widely reported, recent data suggests a potential toxic effect of these compounds(8Dominick M.A. Bobrowski W.F. MacDonald J.R. Gough A.W.

These researchers noted an acute toxic effect of a specific ACAT inhibitor PD132301-2 in adrenal cells of both guinea pigs and beagle dogs. Vernetti et al.(10Vernetti L.A. MacDonald J.R. Wolfgang G.H.I. Dominick M.A. Pegg D.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) concluded that this toxic effect may be linked to ATP depletion of mitochondria. Maintenance of cellular free cholesterol concentrations within small ranges appears to be critical for preservation of cellular functions (11Small D.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 103-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the enzyme catalyzing cholesteryl ester formation, and therefore controlling intracellular free cholesterol concentrations, may have consequences with regard to cell viability. The aim of this study was to more closely examine the intracellular mechanisms that may be responsible for the loss of cell viability as a consequence of ACAT inhibitor treatment. We hypothesize that free cholesterol accumulation, resulting from the blocking the ACAT arm of the cholesteryl ester cycle, is responsible for the observed toxic effects following ACAT inhibitor treatment. Heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, bovine serum albumin (BSA, essentially fatty acid free), phosphatidylcholine (PC), unesterified cholesterol, progesterone, cholesteryl methyl ether, and gentamicin were purchased from Sigma. Organic solvents were purchased from Fisher. Tissue culture plates (12-well with 22-mm well diameter) were obtained from Corning Glass Works (Corning, NY). Culture media was from Life Technologies, Inc. Human LDL (1.019 g/ml < d < 1.063 g/ml) and HDL3 (1.125 g/ml < d < 1.21 g/ml) were fractionated by sequential ultracentrifugation(12Hatch F.T. Lees R.S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1968; 6: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE-containing particles in total HDL preparations were removed by heparin-Sepharose chromatography(13Bamberger M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Human LDL was acetylated by the method of Basu et al.(14Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L.

Free cholesterol and PC dispersions (2-3:1 mol of free cholesterol/mol of PC) were prepared according to Arbogast et al.(15Arbogast L.Y. Rothblat G.H. Leslie M.H. Cooper R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3680-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Human apoAI was prepared as described previously (16Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13844-13850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All lipoproteins, dispersions, and vesicles were sterilized by filtration (0.45 μM) (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) prior to addition to cell culture media. Compound 58-035 (3-[decyldimethylsilyl]-N-[2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylethyl]propanamide) was a gift from Dr. John Heider of Sandoz, Inc. (East Hanover, NJ). Compound 113,818 (-)-N-(2,4-bis(methylthio)-6-methylpyridin-3-yl)-2-(hexylthio)decanoic amide) was provided by Pfizer Central Research (Groton, CT). Compound U18666A (3β-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one) was provided by the Upjohn Co. (Kalamazoo, MI). B6C3F1 mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of sterile 10% thioglycolate solution. Five days after injection, the exudate cells were isolated by peritoneal lavage with 5-ml washes of sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 IU/ml of heparin. The macrophages were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15 min at 22°C and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 50 mM HEPES buffer, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (Buffer A). Cells (1.5 × 106) were plated in 22-mm wells in Buffer A containing 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for 4 h. Following this time, cells were washed 1-3 times with 1 ml of HEPES-buffered minimum essential medium containing 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Buffer B) to remove nonadherent cells. At this point, macrophages were incubated (unless otherwise indicated) with Buffer A containing 250 μg of free cholesterol/ml of free cholesterol:PC dispersions, 100 μg of protein/ml of acetylated LDL, and 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for 24 h. After this cholesterol-enrichment phase, cells were washed 3 times with 1 ml of Buffer B and then incubated for 18 h with Buffer A containing 0.2% BSA. At this point, cells were ready for the addition of ACAT inhibitors. All cells were incubated at 37°C in a humid atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. A complex of bovine serum albumin with sodium [9,10-3H]oleate (9.2 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) was prepared (18Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) and added to the macrophage incubations during the final 2 h of each experiment. Each well received 31 nmol of [3H]oleate complex (molar ratio of oleate/BSA, 6:1) containing ∼23,000 dpm/nmol. Cell monolayers were extracted with isopropyl alcohol containing cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate (∼50,000 dpm, 59.5 mCi/mmol) (DuPont NEN) as an internal standard to correct for losses during extraction. After drying under N2, the lipids were dissolved in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and plated onto Silica Gel G thin-layer chromatography plates (Whatman PE SIL G, Whatman, Ltd, Maidstone, Kent, United Kingdom). Cholesteryl esters were separated from other lipids using hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1) as a developing solvent and visualized by co-migration with nonradioactive cholesteryl oleate. Areas were cut and analyzed for radioactivity by dual isotope liquid scintillation spectroscopy (Beckman LS 3801, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Irvine, CA). Macrophages were isolated and cultured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ACAT inhibitor-induced cell toxicity was quantitated essentially as described by Shirhatti and Krishna (19Shirhatti V. Krishna G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) except as modified by Reid et al.(20Reid V.C. Brabbs C.E. Mitchinson M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 92: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, following the 18-h incubation period of macrophages with 0.2% BSA, either 1 μCi of [8-3H]adenine (23 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Corp.) or 0.5 μCi of [8-14C]adenine (54 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Corp.) was added to each well for 2 h unless otherwise indicated. Following this time, wells were washed 3 times with 1 ml of Buffer B containing 0.2% BSA and then incubated an additional 10 min with 1 ml of Buffer B containing 0.2% BSA. Media were removed, and treatment media were added for 24 h unless otherwise indicated. After the indicated times, triplicate 200-μl aliquots of media were removed and filtered (MultiScreenTM filtration system, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) to remove any cellular debris. Aliquots were analyzed for the release of cellular 3H or 14C by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (Beckman LS 3801, Beckman Instruments Inc., Irvine, CA). Following ACAT inhibitor incubations, cell media were removed, and the macrophage monolayers were washed 3 times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Lipids were extracted with isopropyl alcohol containing 10 μg of cholesteryl methyl ether as an internal standard. Free and total cholesterol contents were quantified by gas-liquid chromatography (21Yancey P.G. Clair St., R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 12: 1291-1304Crossref Google Scholar) using the method of Ishikawa et al.(22Ishikawa T.T. MacGee J. Morrison J.A. Glueck C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for the omission of methyl butyrate from the extraction procedure following saponification. ( 2J. Klansek, personal communication. )Phospholipid phosphorus was determined by the method of Sokoloff and Rothblat(23Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cellular protein content was measured according to the method of Lowry et al.(24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Markwell and colleagues(25Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). [3H]Adenine release from macrophages was expressed as a percentage of release compared with the control treatment (0.2% BSA): (cpm in medium of treatment - cpm in medium of control)/([3H]adenine cpm at time zero) × 100, or as a percent release of total cell [3H]adenine content at time zero. [3H]Oleic acid incorporation into cholesteryl [3H]oleate was expressed as the percent inhibition compared with the control treatment (0.2% BSA): ((cpm control - cpm treatment)/cpm control) × 100. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. for triplicate determinations unless otherwise indicated. GraphPad Prism software package (version 1.0, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to analyze ACAT inhibitor concentration-dependence curves. Data were fitted to a four-parameter logistics equation that generated the best line to the experimental data and calculated the ACAT inhibitor concentrations (EC50) that gave half-maximal [3H]adenine release, ACAT inhibition, and cellular free cholesterol concentrations. The unpaired Student's t test was used to analyze for statistical differences between treatment and controls. Differences were determined to be significantly different at p < 0.05. The goal of this investigation was to establish if the intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol in macrophagederived foam cells could lead to cell toxicity. For this purpose, we used cholesterol-enriched peritoneal macrophages as a model for foam cells and induced free cholesterol accumulation by inhibiting the ACAT arm of the cholesteryl ester cycle. This approach has been used in a number of investigations and results in the cellular deposition of substantial stores of free cholesterol(26Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9344-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27McGookey D.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol.

Our measure of toxicity was based on the established method of monitoring the release of radiolabeled adenine from control and drug-treated cells(19Shirhatti V. Krishna G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a technique that has been demonstrated to accurately quantify cell integrity in cell lines including the cholesterol-loaded macrophage(20Reid V.C. Brabbs C.E. Mitchinson M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 92: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we observed that the release of radiolabeled adenine correlated with the release of lactate dehydrogenase, a well accepted marker of cell toxicity. Therefore, this assay appears to be a reliable marker for ACAT inhibitor-induced toxicity in the cholesterol-loaded macrophage. Fig. 1 illustrates the time course of [3H]adenine release from cholesterolenriched macrophages incubated in the absence and presence of the ACAT inhibitor CP-113,818 (2.0 μg/ml). Adenine leakage increased over time and was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than the control after 12 h of exposure to the drug. By 36 h, the release of [3H]adenine from ACAT inhibitor-treated macrophages was 2-fold greater than the background release of the adenine observed with control macrophages. To establish if a direct correlation existed between the level of free cholesterol that accumulated in macrophages and the leakage of [3H]adenine, it was necessary to design experiments in which the level of accumulated free cholesterol could be varied in a controlled manner. This was achieved in two ways: 1) by varying the extent of cholesteryl ester loading (since the concentration of free cholesterol that results from the inhibition of ACAT is a function of the amount of esterified cholesterol undergoing hydrolysis by the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase(26Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9344-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Krieger M. Ho Y.K. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar)) and 2) by varying the concentration of extracellular acceptors present during the ACAT inhibition phase of the experiment. The presence of increasing concentrations of extracellular acceptors stimulates free cholesterol efflux (31Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus modulates cell free cholesterol content. Fig. 2 shows the results of an experiment in which monolayers of macrophages were loaded with increasing levels of cholesteryl esters and then exposed to the ACAT inhibitor CP-113,818 for 24 h in the absence of any extracellular cholesterol acceptors. The different degrees of cholesteryl ester loading were achieved by prior exposure of the cells to acetylated LDL (100 μg of protein/ml) together with increasing concentrations of a 2:1 (mol/mol) free cholesterol/phospholipid dispersion. As expected(32McCloskey H.M. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this treatment resulted in more than a 4-fold increase in cell total cholesterol above unloaded, control macrophages, with the major accumulation occurring in the cholesteryl ester pool (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the treatment of each group of macrophages with the ACAT inhibitor for 24 h led to a significantly higher (p < 0.001) release of [3H]adenine than observed in parallel cholesterol-loaded cells incubated under identical conditions but in the absence of the inhibitor. In unloaded control macrophages the effect of CP-113,818 (2.0 μg/ml) on cell toxicity was small but statistically significant (p < 0.001). In cells cholesterol-enriched by prior incubation with the highest concentration of dispersion, the ACAT inhibitor CP-113,818 (2.0 μg/ml) increased cell toxicity nearly 5-fold over controls. Fig. 2C illustrates that upon incubation of cholesteryl ester-enriched macrophages with CP-113,818, these cells accumulate free cholesterol. At all levels of added cholesterol/phospholipid dispersion tested, the free cholesterol content of the ACAT inhibitor-treated macrophages was significantly higher than untreated controls (p < 0.05). Maximal [3H]adenine release and cell free cholesterol content (time 24 h) was reached with a concentration of 250 μg of free cholesterol added via free cholesterol/phospholipid dispersion. The removal of cell cholesterol from mouse peritoneal macrophage-derived foam cells can be accomplished by adding to the incubation medium either native HDL (26Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9344-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or reconstituted apo-HDL•phospholipid complexes (rHDL)(33Bernard D.W. Rodriguez A. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a preliminary experiment, cholesterol-loaded macrophages were incubated with CP-113,818, either alone or together with the apoprotein-phospholipid complex or with human HDL3. In addition, a second, extensively used ACAT inhibitor, Sandoz 58-035(34Ross A.C. Go K. Heider J. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 815-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was added to parallel cultures alone or together with the cholesterol acceptors. Incubation with Sandoz 58-035 (2.0 μg/ml) resulted in [3H]adenine release comparable with that observed with 2.0 μg/ml of CP-113,818 (176 and 205% of control, respectively). Co-incubation of either ACAT inhibitor with HDL3 or rHDL blocked this toxic response. The data for [3H]adenine release closely paralleled the free cholesterol content of the cells, with free cholesterol accumulating in cells exposed to either of the ACAT inhibitors and with the deposition of cell free cholesterol prevented by the diversion of the cholesterol to extracellular cholesterol acceptors (data not shown). These data, together with those of Fig. 2, indicate that ACAT inhibitor-induced cell toxicity is the result of free cholesterol buildup. The ability to modulate the extent of free cholesterol accumulation in the drug-treated cells by exposure to graded levels of extracellular cholesterol acceptors provided us the opportunity to more precisely examine the relationship between cell free cholesterol content and cell toxicity as measured by labeled adenine leakage. The data presented in Fig. 3 were obtained from a study in which the cholesteryl ester-enriched macrophages were incubated for 24 h in medium supplemented with CP-113,818 (2.0 μg/ml) together with increasing concentrations of rHDL complexes. In this protocol, the cells had been previously labeled with [3H]cholesterol during the loading phase of the experiment so that the efflux of cell cholesterol could also be measured. Fig. 3 A presents the free cholesterol mass data for the cells after a 24-h exposure to rHDL. As the concentration of rHDL increased, cell free cholesterol decreased until free cholesterol contents reached 40-45 μg/well; levels that were equivalent to untreated control cells. Fig. 3B illustrates that the rHDL particles acted as efficient acceptors of the cell cholesterol and stimulated cholesterol efflux in a dose-dependent manner. The release of [14C]adenine from the treated cells was inversely related to the fractional efflux of cell cholesterol (r2 = 0.95, p < 0.001) and very highly correlated with the actual mass of cell free cholesterol (r2 = 0.92, p < 0.001, Fig. 3C). The correlative data in Fig. 3C indicate that the ability of extracellular cholesterol acceptors to reduce or eliminate the toxicity of ACAT inhibitors is related to their ability to prevent cell free cholesterol accumulation. However, another mechanism that could explain the protective effect of the extracellular cholesterol acceptors could be related to a possible ability to bind the ACAT inhibitors and prevent uptake into cells. Both CP-113,818 and Sandoz 58-035 are hydrophobic compounds that could associate with the cholesterol acceptors and thus have a reduced effective concentration in medium containing HDL or rHDL. Cholesterol esterification was reduced more than 97% compared with controls when cells were exposed to CP-113,818 (2.0 μg/ml) alone or together with rHDL complexes, whereas rHDL alone reduced esterification only 80%. This result indicates that the ACAT inhibitor, at the concentrations used in this study, was equally effective in blocking ACAT activity in both the absence and presence of the cholesterol acceptor. In all of the studies described above, the amount of ACAT inhibitor used was more than sufficient to inhibit greater than 97% of cellular cholesterol esterification activity. To further examine the relationships between ACAT inhibition, cell free cholesterol accumulation and cell toxicity, a series of determinations was conducted examining the dose response of these parameters to increasing concentrations of either CP-113,818 or Sandoz 58-035. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the concentrations of the two ACAT inhibitors and 1) the degree of ACAT inhibition as measured by [3H]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters, 2) cellular free cholesterol content, and 3) the release of [3H]adenine. At the highest levels tested, both ACAT inhibitors reduced the incorporation of [3H]oleate into cholesteryl [3H]oleate by more than 95%, with EC50 values being 10.4 ng/ml for Sandoz 58-035 and 2.5 ng/ml for CP-113,818. The relationships among ACAT inhibition, free cholesterol buildup, and cell toxicity for both inhibitors are similar. The accumulation of free cholesterol is saturable and occurs at concentrations of CP-113,818 and Sandoz 58-035, which do not fully inhibit ACAT after 24 h of incubation. The EC50 values for the cholesterol accumulation process are approximately 40% lower than the EC50 for ACAT inhibition. For CP-113,818 and Sandoz 58-035, the EC50 values for free cholesterol accumulation were 5.5 and 17.5 ng/ml, and for adenine release were 0.7 and 5.5 ng/ml, respectively. The relationships between free cholesterol accumulation, ACAT inhibition, and adenine release are very similar for both inhibitors, with the CP-113,818 compound being approximately 3-5-fold more potent. Progesterone and U18666A have been reported to act as an inhibitors of intracellular cholesterol transport (28Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F.

Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Harmala A.

To determine whether transport of free cholesterol from the site of hydrolysis to another cellular pool was required to induce toxicity, experiments were carried out in which either progesterone or U18666A was added in combination with CP-113,818 to cholesterol-enriched macrophages. As seen in Fig. 5, 1 μg/ml of CP-113,818 caused an approximately 2-fold increase in [3H]adenine release. The addition of 5 μg/ml progesterone or 1 μg/ml U18666A in combination with 1 μg/ml of CP-113,818 reduced the ACAT inhibitor-induced toxicity by 70% (p < 0.01). When increasing concentrations of progesterone were added to medium containing a constant amount of CP-113,818 (1 μg/ml), we observed that the addition of progesterone, together with CP-113,818, decreased cell toxicity in a manner that was dose-dependent on the concentration of progesterone (Fig. 6). The addition of 5 μg/ml of progesterone in combination with 1 μg/ml of CP-113,818 showed no increase in toxicity compared with 5 μg/ml of progesterone alone, or control incubations with no additions. Free cholesterol concentrations in macrophages treated with CP-113,818 alone or in combination with increasing concentrations of progesterone showed similar increases (data not shown). Inhibition of cholesterol esterification may provide a mechanism by which progression of atherosclerosis is reduced(7Sliskovic D.R. White A.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 194-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of ACAT in intact cells, in vitro or in vivo, may result in a redistribution of cellular cholesterol by increasing the free cholesterol and decreasing the cellular cholesteryl ester contents. In this study, using cholesterol-loaded macrophages, we show that such a change in the cellular cholesterol homeostasis resulted in an increased cell toxicity. Subacute adrenal toxicity caused by a specific inhibitor of ACAT has recently been reported(8Dominick M.A. Bobrowski W.F. MacDonald J.R. Gough A.W. Toxicol. Pathol. 1993; 21: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Dominick M.A. McGuire E.J. Reindel J.F. Bobrowski W.F. Bocan T.M.A. Gough A.W. Fundam. Appl.

Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These researchers attributed the toxic effect to a direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in adrenocortical cells. Short term incubation of the ACAT inhibitor with adrenocortical cells resulted in a rapid loss of cell viability. Further examination into the mechanism of cell toxicity showed that cellular ATP levels were severely compromised prior to loss of cell viability. The present cell toxicity data are consistent with these findings. In the present study, we have shown that two specific ACAT inhibitors, Sandoz 58-035 and CP-113,818, induce a free cholesterol accumulation in macrophage-derived foam cells. In each case, the free cholesterol buildup coincides with an increase in cell toxicity. Several lines of evidence suggest that free cholesterol is responsible for this induced toxic effect. First, increasing the cellular content of cholesteryl esters, before ACAT inhibitor treatment, resulted in higher free cholesterol buildup as well as higher [3H]adenine release (Fig. 2). Second, cellular free cholesterol content and the release of 14C-labeled nucleotides were highly correlated, while the latter showed a highly negative correlation with efflux of [3H]cholesterol from macrophages (Fig. 3). Third, the EC50 for cholesterol buildup is lower than that for ACAT inhibition, indicating that only partial inhibition of ACAT will produce cell free cholesterol accumulation in this closed cell system (Fig. 4). Finally, CP-113,818-induced cell toxicity could be blocked by the combined addition of progesterone or U18666A (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6), compounds which inhibit intracellular sterol transport(35Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Harmala A. Porn M.I. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

The inhibition of ACAT by itself is not sufficient to produce the toxic accumulation of free cholesterol as evidenced by the observation that ACAT inhibition by progesterone does not produce toxicity equivalent to that observed with Sandoz 58-035 or CP-113,818. In addition, treatment with progesterone or U18666A, together with the ACAT inhibitor, CP-113,818, eliminates the toxicity. As shown in Fig. 7, we propose that interruption of the cholesteryl ester cycle results in the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. Excess free cholesterol is transported from the site of hydrolysis, and its incorporation into membranes results in the eventual destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7B). We further propose that progesterone or U18666A interferes with the transport of unesterified cholesterol from intracellular sites of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7C). In support of this hypothesis is the observation that the accumulation of free cholesterol in progesterone-treated cells resulted in the formation of membrane-bound vacuoles containing myelin figures(27McGookey D.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of ACAT with pharmacological inhibitors such as Sandoz 58-035 does not induce intracellular storage of cholesterol in intracellular organelles(28Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our data would be consistent with the free cholesterol-induced toxicity resulting from a destabilization of the plasma membrane upon cholesterol enrichment and the protection produced by progesterone and U18666A being a reflection of the retention of the free cholesterol in intracellular pools. Our present observations are relevant to considerations of the development of ACAT inhibitors that function at the level of the vessel wall. Studies have shown that unstable plaques are associated with lipid accumulation and foam cells (39Constantinides P. J. Atheroscler. Res. 1966; 61: 1-17Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 40Lendon C.L. Davies M.J. Born G.V.R. Richardson P.D. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 87: 87-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and suggested that a reduction in the extent of lipid deposition will result in the stabilization of the pathologic processes (for a review, see (41Brown B.G. Zhao X. Sacco D.E. Albers J.J. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Based on our observations, it can be predicted that if ACAT inhibitors are employed to reduce the intracellular levels of cholesteryl esters, cell death could result unless sufficient cholesterol acceptors were present to prevent free cholesterol accumulation.

We have previously presented evidence that mouse p53 is phosphorylated by members of the MAP kinase family in response to serum and also UV radiation(42Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that following UV irradiation of cells, a second p53 kinase, which we have identified as JNK1 (or a highly related kinase), is activated in addition to MAP kinase. This second kinase phosphorylates mouse p53 at serine 34, a major site of phosphorylation in the cell, and its activation is temporally distinct from the activation of MAP kinase. The data suggest that phosphorylation of p53 by UV- or stress-activated protein kinases may be important in the response of cells to DNA-damaging agents. C57MG cells (50Vaidya A.B. Lasfargues E.Y. Sheffield J.B. Coutinho W.G. Virology. 1978; 90: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were a gift from C. Dickson (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories). C57MG cells and simian virus 40-transformed NIH3T3 cells (SV3T3) were routinely used and were maintained in Dulbecco-Vogt's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase-p53 (GST-p53) fusion proteins, expressed using the vector pGEX-2T (Amrad Corp. Ltd.), were used in this study. The following GST-p53 fusions were constructed, and their salient features are summarized in Fig. 1. To express fusion protein 221 (FP221), a 250-base pair NcoI fragment encoding amino acids 1-85 of wild type mouse p53 was purified, and the single-stranded ends were filled in using DNA polymerase I. The fragment was then cloned in the correct reading frame and sense orientation with respect to the GST gene into the SmaI site of pGEX-2T. FP221 contains potential phosphorylation sites for casein kinase I, DNA-activated protein kinase, MAP kinase (ERK2), and the serine 34 protein kinase(51Meek D.W. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, the NcoI fragment was cloned into pGEX-2T in the opposite orientation to express FP222. To construct FP267, the FP221 plasmid was cut with EcoRI and partially with PstI (cutting at p53 codon 65). The single-stranded ends were removed using mung bean nuclease, and the plasmid was recircularized. This fusion encodes a protein that terminates at amino acid 65 of the p53 and therefore lacks the MAP kinase sites (threonines 73 and 83(42Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the FP279 plasmid, the 154-base pair SacI fragment encoding amino acids 11-63 of mouse p53 was cloned into the M13 vector mp18. The p53 sequences were then taken back out of mp18 using BamHI and EcoRI and transferred into pGEX-2T to give the correct reading frame and sense orientation with respect to the GST gene. FP274 was generated by changing the codon for serine 34 in the FP221 plasmid to an alanine codon using an Amersham oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis kit. Similarly, FP294 is a derivative of FP279 in which the serine 34 codon has been mutated to encode alanine. The GST-c-Jun (FP299) fusion protein contains amino acids 1-257 of chicken c-Jun, while the GST-v-Jun protein has amino acids 1-230 of v-Jun. Both were a gift from Dr. D. Gillespie (Beatson Cancer Research Institute, Glasgow). Cells at 80-90% confluency were shifted into medium containing 0.5% calf serum for 48 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and then exposed to a 50 Jm−2 dose of germicidal UV radiation using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). The medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated for various times up to 90 min. Extracts were prepared by washing the cells three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml/plate of ice-cold Nonidet P-40-buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF, and 1 mM benzamidine). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Lysates were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until required. SV3T3 cells were seeded on 15-cm plates and were labeled (at 80% confluency) for 4 h with 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid in 15 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco-Vogt's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested as described above. The polyclonal serum CM5 was a gift from C. Midgley (CRC Cell Transformation Group, University of Dundee). Immunoprecipitation of full-length p53 was carried out as previously described(42Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates of bacterial cells expressing GST-p53 fusion proteins were stored at −70°C. Fusions proteins were isolated by incubation of the lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 4°C for 1 h with rocking. The beads were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and once with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, before being used in kinase assays. Protein samples were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels (for full-length p53) or 12.5% gels (for the fusion protein) in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was carried out at −70°C with Fuji RX film and intensifying screens. c-Jun kinase (JNK1) was prepared as described by Hibi et al.(48Hibi M. Lin A.N. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates prepared from UV-treated cells were rocked at 4°C for 3 h with 10 μg of GST-c-Jun fusion protein immobilized onto 100 μl (wet volume) of reduced glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). The beads were washed five times with 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The Jun kinase was eluted by incubating the beads for 10 min at 4°C in the wash buffer containing 2 M urea. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were dialyzed overnight at 4°C into 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Proteins were separated on a SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nylon filters (Immobilon, Pharmacia). The blots were probed with ER16, an anti-ERK-specific monoclonal antibody (Signal Transduction Laboratories Inc.), and detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. p53 kinase assays were carried out as previously described (42Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using GST-p53 or GST-c-Jun fusion proteins immobilized on Sepharose beads as substrates. The phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography as described above. Phosphorylated p53 was quantitated either as previously described (40Meek D.W. Simon S. Kikkawa U. Eckhart W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) or by using a GS-250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis was carried out as previously described(33Meek D.W. Eckhart W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 52Meek D.W. Eckhart W. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1734-1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis was also carried out as previously described(53Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Thin layer plates were exposed to pre-flashed Fuji RX film at −70°C with intensifying screens. Phosphopeptide maps were quantitated using a GS-250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Phosphorylated p53 was digested with trypsin as previously described(33Meek D.W. Eckhart W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the phosphopeptides were purified by reverse phase chromatography on HPLC. The phosphorylated peptides were covalently coupled to a polyvinylidene difluoride disc using a Sequelon-AA kit (Millipore) as described by the manufacturer. The peptides were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 470A gas phase protein sequencer. The amino acids released at any given cycle were eluted by 90% methanol without loss of protein from the filter. Quantitation of 32P released was carried out after each round of the Edman cycle by liquid scintillation counting. We have previously presented evidence that two sites in the amino-terminal region of mouse p53 (threonines 73 and 83) are phosphorylated in vitro by the MAP kinases p42MAPK and p44ERKI following stimulation of C57MG cells by serum or UV irradiation(42Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether additional p53-directed protein kinase activities were activated in response to UV irradiation, quiescent C57MG cells were treated with 50 Jm−2 of bacteriocidal UV radiation; the cells were harvested at various times following irradiation, and lysates were prepared and used as a source of p53 kinase activity. The ability of these lysates to phosphorylate a GST-p53 fusion protein (FP221) containing the amino-terminal 85 amino acids of mouse p53 was examined; this and other fusion proteins employed in this study are presented in Fig. 1. As a control, the cells were stimulated by the addition of fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 20% (v/v). We have already established that both of these stimuli activate MAP kinases under the conditions employed here (42Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data (Fig. 2A) show that there was already a p53 kinase activity present in the unstimulated cells. Following UV treatment, a substantial increase in p53 kinase activity occurred within 10 min and persisted until the 90-min time point. This kinase activity peaked at 10-20 min post-irradiation and decayed slowly over the time course. Closer examination of the data in Fig. 2A revealed that two closely migrating bands corresponding to phosphorylated FP221 were discernible, especially at the 10- and 20-min time points. Strikingly, the lower of these two bands (which was absent at the 0-min time point) peaked at 10 min, while the upper band did not reach a maximum value until 20-30 min post-irradiation. Myelin basic protein kinase activity peaked at 10 min (data not shown), suggesting that the lower band might arise from phosphorylation of FP221 by MAP kinase. Kinase activities were also present in the lysates of cells treated with 20% serum for 5 min, but in this case the lower band was strikingly predominant (Fig. 2A, laneSER), even at later times after serum stimulation (data not shown). To control for the possibility that the kinases were phosphorylating GST sequences and not the p53 domain, the kinase reactions were carried out using a control fusion protein (FP222, Fig. 1) expressed from a plasmid in which the amino-terminal 85 codons of p53 were fused to the GST gene in the antisense orientation (Fig. 2C). Using this fusion protein, no significant GST kinase activity could be detected, even after prolonged exposure. The data therefore indicate that UV radiation induces two protein kinases that peak at different times after irradiation and that phosphorylate p53 at different amino-terminal sites. Since we had previously shown that MAP kinases are activated under these conditions(42Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the kinase assays were carried out using a p53 substrate that lacked the MAP kinase phosphorylation sites (FP267; Fig. 1). The data once again indicated that a p53 kinase was induced by UV treatment of the cells, but in this case the peak of activity clearly occurred at 20-30 min post-irradiation, and there was no indication of any differential mobility shifting on the gel. The data therefore suggest that there is a UV-induced protein kinase, distinct from the p42MAPK and p44ERKI MAP kinases, that can phosphorylate mouse p53 within its amino-terminal 63 amino acids. To identify the site at which p53 was phosphorylated by this novel protein kinase, fusion protein FP267 was phosphorylated using a C57MG cell lysate, which had been irradiated with 50 Jm−2 UV 20 min prior to cell lysis. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated protein revealed that only phosphoserine was present (data not shown). The phosphorylated protein was then digested with trypsin, and the phosphopeptides were purified by reverse phase chromatography on the HPLC, using a 0-100% acetonitrile gradient. One major phosphopeptide was observed, eluting at about 24% acetonitrile, together with several minor phosphopeptides (data not shown; the FP267 protein also contains phosphorylation sites for casein kinase I and the double-stranded DNA-activated protein kinase(51Meek D.W. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar). Radiosequence analysis of this major phosphopeptide showed the release of radioactive material at cycle 10 of the Edman degradation (Fig. 3). Taken together with the phosphoamino acid analysis and the predicted cleavage sites for trypsin within the p53 domain (Fig. 1), these data indicated that the UV-stimulated kinase phosphorylated serine 34, which is a major site of phosphorylation of mouse p53 in the cell(33Meek D.W. Eckhart W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Wang Y. Eckhart W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4231-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To confirm that serine 34 was the residue targeted by the UV-stimulated kinase, the codon for serine 34 was changed to alanine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and substituted into the FP221 plasmid. FP221 and the new fusion protein, FP274 (Fig. 1), were then phosphorylated in vitro using extracts from untreated and UV-irradiated cells, after which the proteins were analyzed by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. The data (Fig. 4) showed that there were no differences in the phosphopeptide patterns of the mutant fusion protein FP274 whether phosphorylated with the unstimulated cell lysate or the lysate from the cells prepared at 20 min post-irradiation (compare panelsC and D). However, when fusion protein FP221 (containing the wild type p53 amino-terminal 85 amino acids) was used as substrate, a novel major phosphopeptide appeared only after phosphorylation by the lysate from the UV-treated cells (compare panelsA and B). This new phosphopeptide is very hydrophobic and migrates to the position characteristic of the phosphoserine 34-containing tryptic peptide (see Fig. 9). Taken together, these data clearly identify serine 34 as the target of the UV-stimulated protein kinase.Figure 9:Phosphorylation of p53 at serine 34 is stimulated in SV3T3 cells following UV irradiation. 2 × 15-cm plates of 80% confluent SV3T3 cells were placed in medium containing 0.1% serum for 24 h and then labeled for 4 h with 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate per plate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Prior to harvesting the cells, one plate was exposed to 50 Jm−2 of UV radiation. The other plate was left untreated as control. The cells were incubated for a further 30 min, after which they were harvested. The p53 proteins immunopreciptated and analyzed by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The panels are as follows: A, control cells; B, UV-irradiated cells; C, the fusion protein FP279 phosphorylated by the UV-stimulated protein kinase in vitro; and D, a mix of the phosphopeptides from panelsA and C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the UV-stimulated kinase, C57MG cells were placed in 0.1% serum for 48 h and then irradiated with 50 Jm−2 of UV radiation followed by incubation in medium for a further 20 min. Untreated cells were used as controls. Lysates prepared from the UV-treated and untreated cells were mixed with marker proteins of known molecular weight and fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superose 6 (gel filtration) column. The fractions were assayed for p53 kinase activity using the fusion protein FP221 as substrate. The data show that there were low levels of p53 kinase activity present in the fractionated lysates of the untreated cells (Fig. 5A). However, 20 min following UV irradiation, a single major peak of p53 kinase activity was detected (Fig. 5B). When compared with the standard markers, the molecular weight of the UV-activated protein kinase was estimated to be 45,000. Western analysis of the Superose 6 fractions, using the anti-MAP kinase antibody ER16 (Signal Transduction Laboratories Inc.) as probe, showed that the peak of p53 kinase activity eluted before the p42 isoform of MAP kinase (p42MAPK; Fig. 5C). The UV-stimulated p53 (serine 34) kinase could also be resolved from p42MAPK on DEAE-cellulose (data not shown), confirming that the UV-stimulated kinase was not the p42 isoform of MAP kinase. The fusion protein FP221 has phosphorylation sites for other kinases in addition to serine 34 (Fig. 1). The fractions were therefore assayed against the fusion protein FP279 (Fig. 1) in which the CK1 and MAP kinase phosphorylation sites are absent. Once again, a sin"

In this biological system, the m1 class of mAChRs can effectively transduce mitogenic signals (Stephens, E. V., Kalinec, G., Brann, M. R., and Gutkind, J. S.(1993) Oncogene 8, 19-26) and induce [Medline] malignant transformation if persistently activated (Gutkind, J. S., Novotny, E. A., Brann, M. R., and Robbins, K. C.(1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 4703-4708). Moreover, available evidence suggests that the m1-signaling pathway converges at the level of p21ras with that emerging from tyrosine kinase receptors (Crespo, P., Xu, N., Simonds, W. F., and Gutkind, J. S.(1994) Nature 369, 418-420). To explore nuclear events involved in growth regulation by G protein-coupled receptors in this setting, we compared the effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, on the expression of mRNA for members of the jun and fos family of nuclear proto-oncogenes. We found that activation of m1 receptors by carbachol induces the expression of a distinct set of nuclear transcription factors. In particular, carbachol caused a much greater induction of c-jun mRNA and AP-1 activity. These responses did not correlate with protein kinase C stimulation nor with the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Recently, it has been shown that a novel family of kinases structurally related to MAP kinases, stress-activated protein kinases, or Jun kinases (JNKs), phosphorylate in vivo the amino-terminal transactivating domain of the c-Jun protein, thereby increasing its transcriptional activity. In view of our results, this observation prompted us to ask whether m1 and PDGF can differentially activate JNKs. Here, we show that m1 mAChRs can induce a remarkable increase in JNK activity, which was temporally distinct from that of MAP kinase and was entirely protein kinase C independent. In contrast, PDGF failed to activate JNK in these cells, although it stimulated MAP kinase to an extent even greater than that for carbachol. These findings demonstrate that G protein-coupled receptors can signal through pathways leading to the activation of JNK, thus diverging at this level with those signaling routes utilized by tyrosine kinase receptors.

Exoenzyme S ADP-ribosylates Ras and other GTP-binding proteins. 14-3-3 isoforms associate with polyoma virus middle T antigen, which in turn associates with other proteins involved in the regulation of cell proliferation(20Pallas D.C.

The authors suggest a role for 14-3-3 in regulation of Ras and G protein function. The proteins that interact with middle T antigen include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which itself modifies Raf activity.

The principal region of Raf with which 14-3-3 isoforms interact, is contained in a construct which includes the zinc finger domain(21Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R. Science. 1994; 265: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Raf plays a key role in the “mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade” and is at a convergent point for different signals, which regulate growth factor and hormone effects on differentiation and proliferation (reviewed in (25Morrison D. Science. 1994; 266: 56-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar)). Raf exists as a multiprotein complex, which can be translocated to the plasma membrane in the presence of Ras-GTP. The focus of many of the recent publications on 14-3-3 proteins is that the β and ζ isoforms are part of this complex and have been shown to activate Raf. We have previously established that α and δ are the post-translationally modified forms of β and ζ, respectively(26Aitken A. Patel Y. Martin H. Jones D. Robinson K. Madrazo J. Howell S. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 463-465Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) revealed that each pair of sheep and chicken α/β and δ/ζ brain isoforms were different in mass by 80 Da(27Patel Y. Martin H. Howell S. Jones D. Robinson K. Aitken A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1222: 405-409Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This was suggestive of phosphorylation (or sulfation on tyrosine). In a variety of other tissues(28Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Martin H. Patel Y. Robinson K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar), we found no evidence for α and δ isoforms. It should be noted that approximately 40%β 14-3-3 is expressed in mammalian species using an alternative initiator methionine codon 6 nucleotides upstream of the major initiation site (26Aitken A. Patel Y. Martin H. Jones D. Robinson K. Madrazo J. Howell S. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 463-465Google Scholar). With Thr (residue mass 101 Da) as the second amino acid, this initiator Met is removed as predicted (29Aitken A. Identification of Protein Consensus Sequences. Ellis-Horwood, Chichester1990: 1-167Google Scholar) and α and β forms with masses approximately 100 Da higher are detected, which provides additional evidence that they arise from the same gene product. The presence of ∼0.2 mol/mol alkali-labile phosphate was observed after two separate prolonged incubations with 1 M NaOH (in retrospect, the identification of the site of phosphorylation on a serine residue adjacent to proline is consistent with the observed relatively high alkali stability; (30Hardie D.G. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Haystead T.A.J. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 61-85Google Scholar)). Together α and δ 14-3-3 constitute 19% of total brain isoforms(27Patel Y. Martin H. Howell S. Jones D. Robinson K. Aitken A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1222: 405-409Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The nature of the modification was also analyzed by incubation of mixed brain 14-3-3 with a range of phosphatases and sulfatases. However, in no case was significant loss of the modified form observed. This may also have been due, in retrospect, to the poor phosphatase specificity for the site adjacent to proline. 14-3-3 isoforms separated in trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (pH ∼2) on reverse phase HPLC were not restored to their native state, when simply neutralized. A method was developed to renature 14-3-3 isoforms to the native state judged by two criteria: circular dichroism (which measures secondary structure) and dimeric structure(31Robinson K. Jones D. Patel Y. Martin H. Madrazo J. Martin S. Howell S. Elmore M. Finnen M. Aitken A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We subsequently showed that the phospho-form (δ) interacted more strongly with kinase C than the unmodified ζ isoform (28Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Martin H. Patel Y. Robinson K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar). This was measured by the level of inhibition of protein kinase C when assayed in the absence of diacylglycerol or phorbol ester (which will overcome this inhibition; (2Toker A. Ellis C.A. Sellers L.A. Aitken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and (31Robinson K. Jones D. Patel Y. Martin H. Madrazo J. Martin S. Howell S. Elmore M. Finnen M. Aitken A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). In the present study, the site of phosphorylation on 14-3-3 α and δ isoforms was identified. All reagents were analytical grade, from BDH, Sigma, or Boehringer Mannheim. Protein assay reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad. HPLC and fast protein liquid chromatography solvents and water were obtained from Romil. 14-3-3 was isolated from sheep and chicken brain by a combination of anion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, according to the methods in (2Toker A. Ellis C.A. Sellers L.A. Aitken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and (27Patel Y. Martin H. Howell S. Jones D. Robinson K. Aitken A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1222: 405-409Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified proteins was estimated by amino acid analysis (on a Beckman 121MB or a Beckman 6300 analyzer with post column ninhydrin detection), and by the Bio-Rad protein assay (according to manufacturer's instructions). Pure 14-3-3 was separated into individual isomers on reverse-phase HPLC, using Aquapore RP300 (C8, 4.6 × 100 mm (Refs. 3, 4, and 27), and Bakerbond WP-C4 (4.6 × 250 mm and 10 × 250 mm) wide pore columns. The separations employed shallow water/acetonitrile gradients containing trifluoroacetic acid. The isoforms eluted between approximately 50-56% (v/v) acetonitrile. ESMS was performed on a Fisons VG Platform instrument. On-line trapping was used to purify and desalt proteins before introduction to the ESMS source(26Aitken A. Patel Y. Martin H. Jones D. Robinson K. Madrazo J. Howell S. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 463-465Google Scholar), which resulted in a very large increase (down to fmol/μl level) in sensitivity(32Kay I. Mallet A.I. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 744-746Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This comprised a Polymer Laboratories (UK) poly(styrene/divinylbenzene) PLRP-S, 8-μm particle, 300-Å pore size, 0.7-mm microbore column (slurry-packed in house). The sample was loaded on this trapping column in a low concentration of organic modifier, washed free of interfering salts, etc., with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid 15:84:1 (v/v/v) at a flow rate of 2-500 μl min−1. Proteins were eluted with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid 50:49:1 (v/v/v) at a flow rate of 10 μl min−1 by switching a Rheodyne valve to put this column on-line with the source. This was carried out as described in (33Aitken A. Geisow M.J. Findlay J.B.C. Holmes C. Yarwood A. Geisow M.J. Findlay J.B.C. Protein Sequencing: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 43-68Google Scholar) with the modification of the use of acetonitrile instead of the normal solvents. This minimized subsequent manipulations. Extended reaction time (18 h at 50°C) was used, since the β-elimination step of derivatization of a phosphoserine adjacent to a proline residue is slow. Sheep brain 14-3-3 α and δ isoforms that had been separated on the wide pore reverse phase HPLC columns were digested with cyanogen bromide and with trypsin as described previously(2Toker A. Ellis C.A. Sellers L.A. Aitken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 34Geisow M.J. Aitken A. Geisow M.J. Findlay J.B.C. Protein Sequencing: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 85-98Google Scholar). All resulting peptides were screened by ESMS to search for the modified site (which would have a mass 80 Da higher than predicted by its amino acid composition). The tryptic peptide containing the site of phosphorylation was subdigested with Glu-C proteinase (4 μg) overnight in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, to ensure that cleavage at the Glu-Ile bond was as complete as possible. The unmodified β and ζ isoforms and recombinant ζ isoform were also digested separately as controls. Peptides were fractionated on HPLC using a water/acetonitrile gradient (0-50% in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) on a Vydac reverse-phase C18 column (25 × 0.46 cm). Peaks (A215) were collected, concentrated and the peptides sequenced on Applied Biosystems 470A gas-phase and 477A pulsed liquid-phase protein sequencers with Applied Biosystems 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acid analyzers (34Geisow M.J. Aitken A. Geisow M.J. Findlay J.B.C. Protein Sequencing: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 85-98Google Scholar). Data collection and analysis were performed with an Applied Biosystems 900A module calibrated with 25 pmol of PTH-amino acid standards. The presence of alkali-labile phosphate (protein-linked O-phosphoester) was tested by incubation with 1 M NaOH at 37°C for 16 h. The phosphate liberated from sheep brain 14-3-3 was measured as follows. The solution was neutralized with trichloracetic acid. Centrifugation removed unhydrolyzed protein, and the phosphate was measured by the color formed with molybdate-ascorbate reagent against a standard curve of phosphate solutions tested at the same time(35Parker P.J. Embi N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have previously established by protein sequencing that the α and β (as well as the δ and ζ) isoforms of mammalian and avian brain 14-3-3 are identical in primary structure but differ only in a post-translational modification(6Martin H. Patel Y. Jones D. Howell S. Robinson K. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Aitken A. Patel Y. Martin H. Jones D. Robinson K. Madrazo J. Howell S. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 463-465Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified the site of phosphorylation in α/β and δ/ζ 14-3-3 isoforms in mammalian brain by ESMS with on-line trapping(26Aitken A. Patel Y. Martin H. Jones D. Robinson K. Madrazo J. Howell S. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 463-465Google Scholar, 32Kay I. Mallet A.I. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 744-746Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since the site of phosphorylation was endogenous to the 14-3-3 isoforms in protein purified from brain, there was no 32P radioactivity present. No attempt was made, in the present study, to incubate brain homogenate protein with [32P]phosphate. This could have led to the labeling of these isoforms by the endogenous kinase and so facilitate identification of the site. There is, however, a great danger of trace labeling by another (or the same kinase) on another site. This study therefore has led undoubtedly to the identification of an intrinsic high stoichiometry site of phosphorylation. The site of phosphorylation was identified on the CNBr, tryptic, and Glu-C peptides (CN6, T2, and Glu-C2). Except for T2 (Fig. 1), ESMS data from the tryptic peptides which are included within CN6 revealed no masses that were 80 Da higher than predicted from their sequences. In most cases, the unphosphorylated CNBr, tryptic, and Glu-C peptides (from unmodified β and ζ forms) were also analyzed by ESMS and by sequencing after reaction with ethanethiol, as controls. Yields of PTH-amino acids from sequencing of CN6 were lower than normal, due to partial cyclization of the NH2-terminal glutamine residue to form pyroglutamic acid (29Aitken A. Identification of Protein Consensus Sequences. Ellis-Horwood, Chichester1990: 1-167Google Scholar). Both this peptide and T2 were poorly soluble in HPLC buffers and low recovery from the reverse phase columns was the norm. Lyophilization was avoided if at all possible. This resulted in greatly improved amounts of these peptides. There was no indication of 80 Da higher mass CNBr and tryptic peptides elsewhere in peptides derived from other regions of α and δ 14-3-3. The presence of phosphotyrosine was eliminated by lack of cross reaction with specific anti-phospho-Tyr antisera (data not shown). Additionally, as further proof, the expected levels of PTH-Tyr were seen at cycles 11 and 12 and cycles 18 and 19 of T2 and CN6, respectively. This suggests the site is one of two serines in these peptides. The precise location of the phosphate group at cycle 17 of peptide T2 (Ser185 in the protein) was verified by derivatization with ethanethiol, which converts phosphoserine (but no other phosphoamino acid) to S-ethyl cysteine(34Geisow M.J. Aitken A. Geisow M.J. Findlay J.B.C. Protein Sequencing: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 85-98Google Scholar). This was followed by automated peptide sequencing. Normal levels of PTH-Ser and the DTT adduct of dehydroserine, ΔSer, were seen at cycle 8 of peptide T2 (data not shown). Subdigestion of T2 with Glu-C proteinase for an extended time resulted in cleavage of the Glu-Ile bond (anticipated to be slow) in excellent yield. As expected the COOH-terminal Glu-Lys bond was not cleaved, since Glu-C is not an exopeptidase. There is a large amount of additional evidence for absence of phosphorylation on any other residue in the entire sequence of both isoforms which can only be summarized here. This includes the direct identification of the PTH-derivatives of serine, threonine, and tyrosine (not just the DTT adduct of the dehydro derivatives of the first two) on all the alternative sites during separate sequence analysis of CNBr peptides derived from HPLC-purified α and δ isoforms. Accurate ESMS data was obtained for all CNBr peptides from all regions of α and δ isoforms except for CN4, which is also very hydrophobic. However, none of the tryptic peptides from this region that are included within CN4 showed additional mass. Peptide sequence data from all regions of α and δ isoforms were also examined retrospectively from previous studies. Our findings are summarized as follows. (a) Brain 14-3-3 proteins contained the expected amount of alkali-labile phosphate. This indicated the presence of phosphoserine or phosphothreonine. Phosphotyrosine is alkali-stable. (b) The absence of any phosphate anywhere in the proteins except in CN6, T2 and Glu-C2 was conclusive. (c) Phosphotyrosine was ruled out by specific antisera and the presence of PTH-tyrosine in the phosphorylated forms of peptides CN6 and T2 (as well as its presence at normal levels at the position of all other tyrosines in all other peptides sequenced). (d) The first serine residue in CN6 (from separate sequencing analyses of α and δ isoforms) and T2 was detected with the normal levels of PTH-Ser, in contrast to the second serine (Ser185). (e) S-Ethyl-Cys was detected only at Ser185. (f) ESMS on the intact HPLC-separated isoforms never gave any indication of more than one site of phosphorylation, at least on the same polypeptide chain. (g) ESMS data on subdigest peptide Glu-C2 which contains only one phosphorylatable residue, accurately locate the modification. Peptide Glu-C1 was not modified. The evidence for Ser185 as the only site of phosphorylation on 14-3-3 α and δ isoforms is therefore conclusive. The evidence for this site of phosphorylation on the CNBr, tryptic, and Glu-C peptides (CN6, Glu-C2, and T2) is summarized in Fig. 2. The focus of much of the recent excitement about 14-3-3 proteins is that the β and ζ isoforms are part of the GTP-Ras/Raf complex and have been shown to activate Raf(25Morrison D. Science. 1994; 266: 56-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Is it simply a coincidence that two of the abundant mammalian brain isoforms (α and δ) are in fact in vivo phosphorylated forms of β and ζ, respectively? The fact that these two isoforms are specifically modified gives the identification of the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation and the study of a potential regulatory function in the 14-3-3/Raf interaction a high priority. It cannot yet be ruled out that the 14-3-3 isoforms that have been observed to interact with Raf are in fact the phosphoforms (α and δ). c-Raf, which was specifically immunoprecipitated from 3T3 cells, did not phosphorylate either HPLC-purified and renatured 14-3-3 or brain and placenta 14-3-3 isoform mixture. ( 2D. Schoenwasser, P. J. Parker, and A. Aitken, unpublished data. )Significant levels of the phosphoforms are absent from the latter(28Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Martin H. Patel Y. Robinson K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar). There remains, of course, the possibility that this Raf kinase was already complexed with 14-3-3 and the phosphorylation may be non-catalytic. The site of phosphorylation in brain 14-3-3 at a Ser-Pro-Xaa-Lys motif is reminiscent of the specificity of cyclin-dependent kinases(36Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 265-291Google Scholar). This SPEK motif is unique to the β and ζ isoforms. The ability of this and other kinases to phosphorylate specific isoforms in vitro is now being tested. The brain homologue of the Raf family of kinases, B-Raf, may be a candidate. The human T-cell 14-3-3 isoform (τ), called Bap-1 in that study, associates with and is phosphorylated on serine by Bcr kinase(37Reuther G.W. Fu H. Cripe L.D. Collier R.J. Prendergast A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Our structural studies on this family of dimeric proteins are being extended to three dimensional x-ray crystallography, which will indicate more clearly the sites of interaction with kinases and mechanism of inhibition. In brain, the levels of the phosphorylated 14-3-3 forms approach 1:1 with the unmodified isoform. There is the possibility, therefore, that these proteins are phosphorylated to their maximum extent of one phosphate per dimer. The tertiary structure of 14-3-3 will reveal the relative location of this phosphate group on each subunit and should reveal if the site is able to be occupied by more than one phosphate in the dimer.

In human 293 cells stably transfected with the MCP-1 receptor, MCP-1 bound specifically with high affinity (Kd = 260 pM) and induced a rapid mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores. The closely related chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, interleukin 8 (IL-8), and Gro-α were inactive at concentrations as high as 300 nM. Activation of the MCP-1 receptor potently inhibited adenylyl cyclase with an IC50 = 90 pM.

Mobilization of intracellular calcium and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase were blocked by pertussis toxin, suggesting that the MCP-1 receptor coupled to Gαi.

INTRODUCTIONThe molecular basis for the selective recruitment of monocytes into sites of inflammation and early atherosclerotic lesions is incompletely understood, but may involve locally generated cytokines that mediate leukocyte chemotaxis and binding.

Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 292-297PubMed Google Scholar) and is a member of a rapidly growing family of chemotactic cytokines known as the chemokines(3Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar, 4Rollins B.J. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 517-524PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schall T.J.

The chemokine family can be divided into two subfamilies, based on the arrangement of the first 2 of 4 conserved cysteines. In the α, or C-X-C subfamily, these two cysteines are separated by 1 amino acid, whereas in the β, or C-C branch, they are adjacent. The chemokines form dimers in solution, and while the structure of the monomeric form of the α- and β-chemokines is quite similar(7Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the quarternary structures of the α- and β-dimers are quite different(8Lichter P. Tang C.J.-C. Call K. Hermanson G. Evans G.A. Housman D. Ward D.C. Science. 1990; 247: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Interleukin 8 (IL-8) and Gro-α are examples of C-X-C branch chemokines, and MCP-1, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and 1β (MIP-1α, MIP-1β) are C-C chemokines. MCP-2 and MCP-3 are recently described homologs of MCP-1 and are also potent monocyte chemoattractants(9Van Damme J. Proost P. Lenaerts J.-P. Opdenakker G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 10Opdenakker G. Froyen G. Fiten P. Proost P. Van Damme J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In general, chemokines in the C-X-C family are neutrophil-specific, whereas C-C chemokines are monocyte-specific agonists. Recent data indicate that T lymphocytes of the memory phenotype (CD45RO+) also undergo chemotaxis in response to MCP-1, indicating a possible role for MCP-1 in cell-mediated immunity(11Carr M.W. Roth S.J. Luther E. Rose S.S. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar).MCP-1 induces monocyte chemotaxis at subnanomolar concentrations and also activates host defense mechanisms such as superoxide production (12Zachariae C.O.C. Anderson A.O. Thompson H.L. Appella E. Mantovani A. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 2177-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and the oxidative burst(13Vaddi K. Newton R.C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MCP-1 also up-regulates the adhesion molecule Mac-1 (CD11b/CD11c)(14Jiang Y. Beller D.I. Frendl G. Graves D.T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2423-2428PubMed Google Scholar), and this up-regulation may contribute to the tissue extravasation of monocytes at sites of inflammation. It is unclear how MCP-1 and other chemokines induce chemotaxis and activation of adhesion receptors; and this question constitutes an important area of investigation in leukocyte biology.We have recently cloned two alternatively spliced seven-transmembrane-domain receptors that mediate MCP-1dependent calcium mobilization in Xenopus oocytes(15Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the ligand specificity and signal transduction pathways of one of these MCP-1 receptors and compared it with the recently cloned receptor for MIP-1α and RANTES. Our results demonstrate that the MCP-1 receptor binds and signals in response to picomolar concentrations of MCP-1 in a highly specific manner. Signaling in 293 cells is manifested as both calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and is mediated via activation of a pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive G-protein(s).MATERIALS AND METHODSReagentsThe chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, IL-8, and Gro-α were obtained from R& Systems, Inc.

The expression vector pcDNA3 was purchased from Invitrogen Inc. (San Diego, CA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim.Tissue Culture and Stable TransfectionsHuman embryo kidney (HEK)-293 (CRL 1573) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD) and were grown in minimal essential media with EBSS supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. cDNAs for the MCP-1 receptor (MCP-1RB) and the MIP-1α/RANTES receptor were cloned into the polylinker of the mammalian cell expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and transfected into 293 cells (50-80% confluent) with a DNA/Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions. After selection for 2-3 weeks in the presence of G418 (0.8 mg/ml), colonies were picked and stable cell lines were screened by Northern blot analysis for receptor expression. In general, there was a strong correlation between the level of receptor expression as judged by Northern blot analysis and the strength of the receptor signals obtained in the functional assays. Transfected cells that failed to express the receptor on Northern blots were used as negative controls in the binding and signaling experiments.Binding AssaysEquilibrium binding assays were performed using the method of Ernst et al.(18Ernst C.A.

Briefly, varying amounts of 125I-labeled MCP-1 (DuPont NEN) were incubated with 6 × 106 cells resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% BSA) in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled chemokines. Competition experiments were performed using 500 pM125I-labeled MCP-1 and the indicated concentrations of unlabeled chemokines. Each data point was determined in triplicate. Equilibrium binding data were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard using the program “LIGAND” (19Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar) (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) on a Macintosh computer.Calcium FluorimetryTransfected HEK-293 cells were grown until confluent, trypsinized briefly, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml BSA (PBS-BSA), and resuspended in serum-free MEM-EBSS supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were incubated in the dark at 37°C for 20 min in the presence of 5-10 μg/ml indo-1 AM. Nine volumes of PBS-BSA were added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 10 min at 37°C, pelleted by centrifugation, and washed twice with 50 ml of the PBS-BSA solution. Washed, indo-1-loaded cells were then resuspended in Hank's balanced salt solution (1.3 mM Ca2+) supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA at a density of approximately 0.5 × 106 cells/ml at room temperature. To measure intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), 0.5 ml of the cell suspension was placed in a quartz cuvette in a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Chemokines dissolved in Hank's balanced salt solution-BSA were injected directly into the cuvette in 5 μl volumes. Intracellular calcium was measured by excitation at 350 nm and fluorescence emission detection at 490 nm (F1) and 410 nm (F2) wavelengths. The [Ca2+]i was estimated by comparing the 490/410 fluorescence ratio after agonist application (R) to that of calibration ratios measured at the end of each run, according to the equation: [Ca2+]i=Kd×[(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)]×(Sf2/Sb2)(Eq. 1) where Rmax and Rmin represent the fluorescence ratio under saturating (1.3 mM Ca2+) and nominally free (10 mM EGTA) calcium conditions, Kd is the dissociation constant of calcium for indo-1, R is the fluorescence ratio, and Sf2/Sb2 is the fluorescence ratio of free and bound indo-1 dye at 410 nm(20Thomas A.P. Delaville F. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 1-54Google Scholar). For quantitation of the calcium responses, full MCP-1 dose-response curves were generated in each experiment and the results were expressed as a percent of the maximum calcium signal (at 300 nM MCP-1) measured in that experiment. The changes in [Ca2+]i levels in response to each concentration of agonist were determined by subtracting the base line from peak [Ca2+]i levels, which were determined by averaging 5 s of data prior to agonist addition and surrounding the peak response, respectively. In experiments done to determine the role of extracellular calcium, 3 mM EGTA was added 60-90 s prior to MCP-1. Subsequent lysis of the cells with Triton X-100 caused no change in indo-1 fluorescence, indicating that EGTA had reduced the extracellular calcium concentration below that of intracellular basal levels (approximately 70-100 nM). All experiments were performed at room temperature, and each data point was determined in duplicate.Adenylyl Cyclase AssaysHEK-293 cells stably transfected with the MCP-1RB and the MIP-1α/RANTES receptors were grown until confluent in 24-well tissue culture dishes and labeled overnight with 2 μCi/ml of [3H]adenine (25-30 Ci/mmol) in MEM-EBSS supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The next day, the cells were washed by incubation at room temperature with 0.5 ml of serum-free MEM-EBSS media supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 5 min. After removal of the wash media, the cells were stimulated by addition of fresh media containing either chemokine alone, forskolin alone (10 μM), or chemokine plus forskolin, all in the presence of 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, for 20 min at room temperature. The incubation was terminated by replacement of the media with 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1 mM cAMP, and 1 mM ATP. Following incubation at 4°C for 30 min, the labeled [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP pools were separated and quantitated by chromatography on Dowex 50W and neutral alumina columns, essentially as described(21Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wong Y.H. Federman A. Pace A.M. Zachary I. Evans T. Pouysségur J. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The 1-ml acid supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml Dowex 50W column and the ATP pool eluted with 3 ml of H2O. The Dowex 50W columns were then placed over 1-ml alumina columns, and 10 ml of H2O was added to the Dowex resin and the eluant allowed to drip directly onto the neutral alumina. The cAMP pool was then eluted directly from the alumina with 5 ml of 0.1 M imidazole, 0.01 mM sodium azide. The [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP fractions were counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. The cAMP pool for each sample was normalized to its own ATP pool and expressed as a ratio by the equation (cAMP counts/min/ATP counts/min) × 100. In each experiment full dose-response curves were generated and expressed as a percent of the forskolin control. All data points were determined in duplicate. In all experiments, the maximum inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity mediated by the MCP-1RB or MIP-1α/RANTES receptor was ∼80 and ∼55%, respectively.Phospholipase C AssaysTotal inositol phosphate accumulation was determined essentially as described(23Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were grown until confluent in 24-well tissue culture dishes and labeled overnight with 2 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol (23 Ci/mmol) in inositol-free MEM-EBSS supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Following labeling, the media were removed, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 5-10 min in 0.5 ml of serum-free MEM-EBSS media supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 10 mM LiCl. The washed cells were then incubated with chemokines for 1-30 min at room temperature in the presence of 10 mM LiCl. The incubation was terminated by removal of the incubation media and addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mM formic acid. Plates were incubated at 4°C for 30 min before the supernatants were applied to 1-ml Dowex AG1-X8 chromatography columns. Columns were washed with 8 ml of water followed by 5 ml of 40 mM sodium formate. Total [3H]inositol phosphates were eluted with 5 ml of 2 M ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy.Pertussis Toxin TreatmentPertussis toxin was dissolved in 0.01 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.05 M sodium chloride and diluted into normal serum containing media at final concentrations of 0.1-100 ng/ml and incubated with cells overnight (14-16 h) at 37°C. The conditions of the PT treatment of the 293 cells were identical for calcium fluorimetric and adenylyl cyclase experiments. In the adenylyl cyclase experiments, the PT was added at the same time as [3H]adenine.Analysis of DataFull dose-response curves were generated in both the calcium fluorimetric assays and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase assays. All dose-response curves were then fit by a nonlinear least-squares program to the logistic equation: Effect =maxeffect⁡/[1+(EC50/( agonist )n)](Eq. 2) where n and EC50 represent the Hill coefficient and the agonist concentration that elicited a half-maximal response, respectively, and were derived from the fitted curve. Curve fitting was done with the computer program “Prism” (by Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). All results shown represent the mean ± S.E. All data points were determined in duplicate. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the EC50 and IC50 values, when given, were calculated from the log EC50 and IC50 values, respectively.RESULTSBinding of MCP-1 to MCP-1RB/293 CellsA cell line stably expressing the MCP-1 receptor was produced by transfection of MCP-1RB into HEK-293 cells. Transfected cells bound 125I-labeled MCP-1 specifically and with high affinity (Fig. 1A). The closely related C-C chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES, as well as the C-X-C chemokine IL-8 did not compete for binding. No specific binding was detected using transfectants that expressed little or no MCP-1RB on Northern blots (data not shown). Analysis of equilibrium binding data indicated a dissociation constant (Kd) of 260 pM (Fig. 1B). This Kd is in good agreement with that reported for the binding of MCP-1 to monocytes (2Yoshimura T. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 292-297PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15918-15924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and THP-1 cells(25Van Riper G. Siciliano S. Fischer P.A. Meurer R. Springer M.S. Rosen H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These data indicate that 125I-MCP-1 bound specifically and with high affinity to the MCP-1RB receptor expressed in 293 cells.Calcium Mobilization by MCP-1MCP-1 stimulated robust calcium mobilization in the stably transfected MCP-1RB/293 cells in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Small but reproducible signals were seen with as little as 100 pM MCP-1, and the average EC50 from four full dose-response curves to MCP-1 was 3.4 nM (2.7-4.4 nM; Fig. 2, A and B). The MCP-1RB receptor was selectively activated by MCP-1 in that RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, Gro-α, and IL-8 failed to stimulate significant calcium signals in these same cells, even when present at high concentrations (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, these chemokines also failed to block stimulation of the cells by MCP-1, indicating that they are unlikely to act as endogenous antagonists of the MCP-1RB receptor (data not shown). The MCP-1-dependent intracellular calcium fluxes were characterized by short lag times, followed by a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i that returned to near basal levels within 80-90 s of the addition of MCP-1 (Fig. 2A). The cells demonstrated homologous desensitization in that they were refractory to activation by a second challenge with MCP-1 (Fig. 2C). These pharmacological, kinetic, and desensitization properties of MCP-1-stimulated calcium mobilization in the MCP-1RB/293 cells are similar to those reported previously in monocytes (25Van Riper G. Siciliano S. Fischer P.A. Meurer R. Springer M.S. Rosen H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and monocyte-like cell lines(15Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A.

Stably transfected 293 cells were loaded with indo-1 AM, and intracellular calcium levels were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, intracellular calcium flux as a function of MCP-1 concentration (nM). Calcium transients peaked at 4-8 s after addition of MCP-1 and returned to base line within 90 s of activation. B, MCP-1 stimulated calcium mobilization with an EC50 of 3.4 nM (2.7-4.4). MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, IL-8, and Gro-α had no appreciable effect on calcium mobilization (n = 2-3). The average maximal peak calcium concentration was 673 ± 13 nM. Results are the mean ± S.E. of four separate experiments and are expressed as a percent of the maximal calcium response to MCP-1. C, MCP-1 desensitized the cells to a second addition of MCP-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Source of Calcium MobilizedTo determine the source of the intracellular calcium flux, the MCP-1RB/293 cells were challenged with MCP-1 in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium. The rise in cytoplasmic calcium was largely unchanged by the chelation of extracellular calcium with 3 mM EGTA (Fig. 3). Similar results were seen when the cells were washed and resuspended in calcium-free PBS supplemented with 1 mM EGTA, or when 5 mM Ni2+ was added to the cuvette to block the influx of extracellular calcium (27Sozzani S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 16364-16369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). The fall in cytoplasmic calcium to base line was slightly prolonged in the presence of extracellular calcium, suggesting that calcium influx may contribute to maintaining the response to MCP-1 after intracellular stores are depleted. These data suggest that the primary means of calcium mobilization in these transfected 293 cells is through release of intracellular calcium. Inositol(1Furutani Y. Nomura H. Notake M. Oyamada Y.

Activation of the MCP-1 receptor in transfected 293 cells, however, induced little or no hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol (data not shown). In control experiments activation of the muscarinic or oxytocin receptor, co-transfected into these same 293 cells, led to a 5-9-fold increase in PI turnover.Figure 3MCP-1RB mobilizes intracellular calcium. MCP-1RB stably transfected 293 cells were loaded with indo-1 AM, and changes in intracellular calcium concentrations in response to MCP-1 (100 nM) were measured as described in Fig. 1. EGTA (3 mM) was added to the cuvette 60-90 s prior to the addition of MCP-1. The results shown are representative traces from one of four experiments in the absence and eight experiments in the presence of EGTA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Adenylyl Cyclase InhibitionActivation of the MCP-1 receptor resulted in a potent and dose-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. MCP-1 significantly reduced basal cAMP accumulation in these cells by 55% (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (Fig. 4A). Forskolin activation of adenylyl cyclase increased cAMP levels 16-fold, and co-addition of MCP-1 blocked this increase by 78%, with an IC50 of 90 pM (70-140 pM) (Fig. 4, A and B). The magnitude and potency of MCP-1 inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity was independent of the forskolin concentration (3-30 μM; data not shown). MCP-1 neither stimulated nor inhibited cAMP formation in untransfected or pcDNA3 transfected 293 cell controls (data not shown). Together these results demonstrate that inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity provides a sensitive and quantitative assay for MCP-1RB receptor activation in 293 cells. Virtually no activation of the MCP-1 receptor could be detected in this assay in response to high concentrations of RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, IL-8, or Gro-α (Fig. 4B), which is consistent with our observations in the calcium fluorimetric assay (Fig. 2B) and in Xenopus oocytes(15Charo I.F.

HEK-293 cells expressing MCP-1RB (4, A and B) or the MIP-1α/RANTES (C) receptor were labeled with [3H]adenine and stimulated with 10 μM forskolin in the presence or absence of chemokines. [3H]cAMP pools were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, cAMP accumulation in MCP-1RB transfected cells. MCP-1(100 nM) inhibited basal cAMP accumulation by 55 ± 4.3%. Forskolin stimulated a 16.5 ± 2.1-fold increase in cAMP accumulation over untreated cells, and this was blocked by 78.4 ± 1.8% by MCP-1. The inhibition of cAMP accumulation was significant at p < 0.01, in both cases. B, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by MCP-1RB. The IC50 for MCP-1 was 90 pM (66-143 pM). MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, IL-8, and Gro-α were inactive at doses up to 100 nM. C, the MIP-1α/RANTES receptor mediates inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in transfected 293 cells. MIP-1α and RANTES blocked the forskolin-stimulated accumulation of cAMP by 52.3 ± 2% and 54.9 ± 2%, respectively. The calculated IC50 values were MIP-1α = 110 pM (80-160 pM), RANTES = 140 pM (90-200 pM), MIP-1β = 10 nM (4-30 nM), and MCP-1 = 820 nM. IL-8 and Gro-α did not inhibit adenylyl cyclase at up to 1 μM.

Unlike the MCP-1RB receptor, however, the MIP-1α/RANTES receptor was activated by multiple chemokines with varying degrees of potency. MIP-1α and RANTES were virtually equipotent in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity with IC50 values of 110 and 140 pM, respectively. MIP-1β (IC50 = 10 nM) and MCP-1 (IC50 = 820 nM) also inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity, though only at much higher concentrations, and neither blocked cAMP accumulation to the same extent as MIP-1α and RANTES. The C-X-C chemokines IL-8 and Gro-α did not activate the MIP-1α/RANTES receptor.Table 1 compares the activation of the MCP-1 receptor and the MIP-1α/RANTES receptor by a variety of chemokines and demonstrates the specificity of the MCP-1RB receptor for MCP-1, and the MIP-1α/RANTES receptor for MIP-1α and RANTES.

INTRODUCTIONThe mechanical properties of deformability and mechanical stability of human erythrocytes are largely regulated by the submembranous protein skeleton(1Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). Spectrin, actin, protein 4.1, adducin, and dematin are the principal components of the membrane skeleton. Lateral interactions among these proteins constitute the composite structure designated as the membrane skeletal network. This network is anchored to the bilayer through vertical interactions, one involving β-spectrin, ankyrin, and band 3, and the other through an interaction between protein 4.1 and glycophorin C(2Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 3Gilligan D.M. Bennett V. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 74-83PubMed Google Scholar).All of the components, except actin, of the membrane skeleton are phosphoproteins(4Cohen C.M. Foley S.F. J. Biol.

The phosphate groups of these proteins undergo turnover in the intact cell as a result of the action of multiple kinases and phosphatases that have been identified in erythrocytes. Based on in vitro studies using purified skeletal proteins and kinases, there is a strong suggestion that phosphorylation may modify binary and ternary interactions between proteins in solution, leading in most cases to a reduced affinity for the interaction(s) (6Lu P.W.

However, the effect of protein phosphorylation on mechanical function of intact membrane has not previously been unequivocally documented. In the present study, we explored the involvement of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of β-spectrin in modulating membrane mechanical stability of intact human erythrocyte membranes. In order to obtain unambiguous information on the influence of protein phosphorylation on membrane function, it is necessary to relate the documented changes in membrane function to the measured changes in the phosphate bound to the protein and not just the turnover of phosphate. To achieve this objective we considered the following conditions to be requisite for determining the effects of phosphorylation of a membrane protein on membrane properties: 1) an intact membrane instead of an isolated protein or a kinase must be used in the experiments, 2) the specimen must not possess any protein phosphatase activity, 3) only a phosphate radical donor should be used for phosphorylation, 4) the type of kinase involved in the phosphorylation of protein(s) must be specified, 5) the amount of phosphate incorporated must be quantitated, and 6) all phosphorylation-induced changes in membrane function must be reversed by dephosphorylation with the addition of protein phosphatase. In this context, we developed experimental conditions in which β-spectrin was the primary protein phosphorylated in intact membranes and demonstrated that the degree of β-spectrin phosphorylation modulates the membrane mechanical stability of intact red cell membranes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsVanadate-free ATP obtained from Sigma was used in all experiments. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from DuPont NEN. Sodium orthovanadate (vanadium (V) as Na3VO4) was dissolved in deionized water to a final concentration of 0.1 M. This stock solution of vanadate was diluted to 0.1 mM in 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM KCl (5T5K buffer). N-(2-Aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide (CKI-7), 1The abbreviations used are: CKI-7N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamidePVDFpolyvinylidene difluoride. the casein kinase I inhibitor, was purchased from Seikagaku Co. Okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, was obtained from Sigma. These reagents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. PVDF membrane (Immobilon P) was purchased from Millipore Corp. The antibodies against phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were obtained from Sigma. The chemiluminescence reagent was obtained from Dupont NEN.Methods Erythrocyte Ghosts PreparationAfter obtaining informed consent, human venous blood was freshly drawn from healthy volunteers and was used in all the studies outlined. Erythrocytes were collected and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline. Intact cells were lysed and washed five times in 35 volumes of 5T5K buffer at 4°C to remove cytosolic components including ATP, cytosolic protein kinases, and phosphatases. The white membranes thus obtained were incubated at 0°C for 10 min with MgATP at various concentrations and additives such as vanadate, CKI-7, and protein phosphatase. The mixture was gently stirred during this 10-min incubation period. The ghost membranes were subsequently resealed by adding a mixture of KCl, MgCl2, and dithiothreitol (final concentrations: 150, 1, and 1 mM, respectively) followed by incubation at 37°C for 40 min as described previously(14Mohandas N.

Blood. 1982; 59: 768-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Measurement of Membrane StabilityThe resealed ghosts were suspended in 45% dextran, and the membrane mechanical stability was quantitated using an ektacytometer, as described previously(14Mohandas N. Clark M. Heath B.P. Rossi M. Wolfe L.C. Lux S.E. Shohet S.B. Blood. 1982; 59: 768-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bessis N. Mohandas N. Blood Cells (Berl.). 1977; 3: 209-221Google Scholar). Briefly, the suspended ghosts were subjected to a constant shear stress of 750 dynes/cm2, and changes with time in laser diffraction patterns were measured by recording the rate of change of the deformability index. The rate of decrease of the deformability index is a measure of the rate of membrane fragmentation and thus a quantitative measure of membrane mechanical stability(15Bessis N. Mohandas N. Blood Cells (Berl.). 1977; 3: 209-221Google Scholar). The time required for the deformability index to reach half-maximum value is designated as T50. To examine changes in membrane mechanical stability, T50 values were compared for variously phosphorylated membrane preparations. A decrease in T50 value represents mechanical destabilization of the membrane while an increase in T50 value reflects improved mechanical structural integrity.Phosphorylation of Erythrocyte GhostsTo study the phosphorylation of membrane protein, ghosts were prepared as described above except that 32P-labeled ATP (400-600 cpm/pmol) was used instead of unlabeled ATP. All reactions were terminated by adding an electrophoresis sample buffer. Radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) on 7.5% acrylamide gel containing 1% SDS. The gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and dried. Phosphorylated membrane proteins were identified by autoradiograghy. Radioactivity on membrane proteins was determined by excising protein bands from dried gels and counting in a liquid scintillation counter.Phosphorylated membrane proteins separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were also blotted on PVDF membranes using semi-dry transblots (Nihon Eido Co). Briefly, electrotransfer of the proteins was carried out in 25 mM Tris containing 20% methanol and 40 mM ∊-amino-n-caproic acid for 1 h at 250 mA. The membranes were washed once in 0.05% Tween 20 and blocked with skim milk solution (Block-Ace, Yukijirushi Co) for 1 h, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with antiphosphoserine antibody (1/5000 dilution) in skim milk solution. Antigen-antibody complexes were developed using a peroxidase conjugate substrate kit from Dupont NEN. Briefly, the immunoblots were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rabbit anti-mouse IgG-conjugated peroxidase and developed using the substrate solution of a chemiluminescence reagent kit. The membranes were exposed to Kodak x-ray film.Preparation of Protein Phosphatase in Human ErythrocytesProtein phosphatase IV was purified from human erythrocyte cytosol and treated with 80% ethanol to derive the catalytic subunit (Mr = 31,000) from the enzyme according to Usui et al.(17Usui H.

Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3752-3761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoprotein phosphatase activity was monitored with 32P-labeled H1-histone phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylated 32P as substrates under the conditions of this study. One unit of enzyme was defined as that amount which would catalyze the release of 1 mol of phosphate from 1 mol of spectrin per h.Measurement of Dephosphorylation of Spectrin DimerFresh ghosts were dephosphorylated with various amounts of protein phosphatase under the resealing conditions. The spectrin dimer was isolated by the method of Harris and Lux (19Harris Jr., H.W. Lux S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11512-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Harris et al.(20Harris Jr., H.W. Levin N. Lux S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11521-11525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Dephosphorylated ghosts were washed once in 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and collected by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. To extract spectrin and actin, the ghosts were washed once in 0.1 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The ghosts in the pellet were collected and incubated at 37°C for 10 min in a shaking water bath. Spectrin-depleted ghost membranes were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatant containing spectrin and actin was collected. These two proteins were separated by molecular sieving on a Sepharose 4B column (2.6 × 35 cm) in 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After measuring the protein concentration of the pooled spectrin dimer fraction by the method of Lowry et al.(21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an aliquot (20-300 ml) was dot-blotted on a PVDF membrane, and dephosphorylated spectrin was analyzed using antiphosphoserine antibody specified above. The membrane was exposed to Kodak x-ray film, and the reactive spots were quantitated by densitometric scanning (ATTO AE-6900M). Density was found to increase linearly with the amount of spectrin dimer up to 5 μg (data not shown).RESULTSEffects of MgATP on Membrane StabilityRepresentative data for membrane mechanical stability of ghosts prepared in the presence and absence of MgATP are shown in Fig. 1A. In ghosts, 10 μM vanadate was present to prevent a change in shape induced by MgATP. When the control resealed ghosts (without vanadate and MgATP) were subjected to shear stress of 750 dynes/cm2, the membranes underwent deformation and fragmented, resulting in a T50 value of 40 s. Ghosts prepared with MgATP in the absence of vanadate underwent extensive endocytosis with concomitant loss of surface area and hence did not deform in the fluid shear field. As such, these membranes did not fragment. Treatment with vanadate inhibited endocytosis and loss of surface area, and such membrane preparations exhibited deformability characteristics identical with resealed ghosts prepared in the absence of vanadate and MgATP. Ghosts prepared with MgATP and vanadate fragment at a faster rate than the control ghosts, so that the T50 value decreased to 28 s. Vanadate by itself had no effect on membrane mechanical stability. The correlation between membrane mechanical stability (T50 values) and MgATP concentration used during the resealing step is shown in Fig. 1B. With increasing MgATP concentration, T50 decreased to 60% of the control value.Phosphorylation of Erythrocyte Ghosts with [γ-32P]MgATPThe time-dependent incorporation of 32P into membrane proteins is shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Membranes were incubated under the same conditions as those used for determining membrane mechanical stability, with [γ-32P]MgATP being used instead of unlabeled MgATP. Several membrane proteins incorporated 32P, and the extent of incorporation increased with time. After a 30-min incubation, β-spectrin exhibited the highest degree of phosphorylation, attaining a maximal level of 0.6 mol of 32P/mol of β-spectrin at an MgATP concentration of 0.5 mM. As β-spectrin and ankyrin migrate close together on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by the Laemmli method (7.5% acrylamide concentration)(22Hosey M.M. Tao M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1561-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Plut D.A. Hosey M.M. Tao M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it could be argued that a small degree of 32P incorporation into spectrin could potentially be attributed to ankyrin. To resolve this issue, we used the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system of the Fairbanks method (3.5-17% acrylamide concentration linear gradient gel) (24Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (6158) Google Scholar) in which β-spectrin is well separated from ankyrin. In this system we found that the 32P was indeed associated with β-spectrin. Furthermore, we showed that ankyrin purified from phosphorylated ghosts contained less than 0.1 mol of 32P/mol of ankyrin. To determine the concentration dependence of MgATP on 32P incorporation, ghosts were incubated in the presence of various concentrations of [γ-32P]MgATP for 40 min. With MgATP concentrations up to 1.0 mM, 32P incorporation into β-spectrin increased, becoming maximal at 0.9 mol/mol (Fig. 2C). Incorporation ranged from 0.75 to 0.98 mol of 32P/mol at an MgATP concentration of 1.0 mM, depending on the membrane preparation used. In contrast to β-spectrin, 32P incorporation into band 3, protein 4.1, protein 4.2, and dematin was less than 0.1 mol of 32P per mol of each of the proteins (Fig. 2, B and C). In this region of the gel where band 3 is stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue, two phosphorylated bands were noted. These are likely to be α- and β- adducin (Fig. 2A).Figure 2:Phosphorylation of membrane proteins. A, time course of incorporation of 32P into membrane proteins.

T50 decreased linearly with increased net incorporation of 32P into β-spectrin, indicating that the phosphorylation of β-spectrin decreases membrane mechanical stability.Identification of the Kinase Responsible for β-Spectrin PhosphorylationMembrane-associated protein kinases have been shown to be casein kinases(25Avruch J.

In this study, we focussed our attention on membrane-bound casein kinases I and II since cAMP, an activator of cAMP-dependent kinase, is not present in our membrane preparations. Phosphorylation of β-spectrin increased with increasing salt concentrations (Fig. 3A), a characteristic of casein kinases suggesting that the kinase involved in β-spectrin phosphorylation should belong to this family of kinases. To directly test this thesis, we examined the effects of inhibitors of casein kinases, CKI-7 (37Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for casein kinase I and heparin (31Wei T. Tao M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Yan T.F.J. Tao M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7037-7043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quercetin (39Friedman D.L. Kleiman N.J. Campbell F.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 847: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for casein kinase II on protein phosphorylation and membrane function. The most effective inhibitor of MgATP-induced β-spectrin phosphorylation and associated decreases in membrane mechanical stability was CKI-7 (Fig. 3B). Quercetin had no effect on β-spectrin phosphorylation (data not shown), indicating that the phosphorylation of β-spectrin is not likely to be due to casein kinase II. Heparin was effective at very high concentrations in inhibiting β-spectrin phosphorylation (data not shown), but this inhibition was most likely due to competition with ATP and not through inhibition of casein kinase II. 32P incorporation into spectrin was not affected by okadaic acid (124 mM)(40Ishihara H. Mertin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The 32P incorporation we observed must thus reflect a net increase in 32P incorporation into β-spectrin by membrane-bound casein kinase I and not the result of replacement of the intrinsic phosphate associated with β-spectrin in the isolated membranes prior to our experimental manipulations.Figure 3:Identification of the kinase responsible for spectrin phosphorylation.

B, inhibition of casein kinase I inhibitor (CKI-7) on membrane mechanical stability and 32P incorporation into β-spectrin. Fresh ghosts were first incubated for 10 min with 1 mM [γ-32P]ATP and various concentrations of CKI-7 at 0°C as shown on the graph. Subsequent incubation was conducted at 37°C under resealing conditions, and membrane stability (•) and 32P incorporation into β-spectrin (○) were quantitated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of the Phosphorylated Amino Acid Residue in β-SpectrinTo identify the amino acid residue in β-spectrin phosphorylated under the experimental conditions employed, antiphosphoserine antibody was used for Western blot analysis of membrane proteins (Fig. 4A). This antibody reacted with β-spectrin from ghosts prepared in the absence of MgATP, indicating that β-spectrin is natively phosphorylated. Densitometric analysis showed increased staining of the serine residue of β-spectrin with increasing MgATP concentrations. βSpectrin also reacted with the antiphosphothreonine antibody, but the reactivity was weak, and, most importantly, there was no change in the extent of this reactivity with an increase in MgATP (data not shown). The antiphosphotyrosine antibody did not react with β-spectrin (data not shown).Figure 4:Chemiluminescence analysis of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of β-spectrin. A, chemiluminescence profiles of the phosphorylation of spectrin at various MgATP concentrations. Resealed ghosts were prepared in the presence of vanadate and various concentrations of MgATP (0-1 mM). Membrane proteins were separated on SDS gels in 7.5% polyacrylamide by the Laemmli method, blotted onto PVDF membranes, and probed with antiphosphoserine antibody to detect phosphoserine groups in spectrin. B, spectrin dimer from phosphorylated or dephosphorylated ghosts were isolated by the method described by Harris and Lux(19Harris Jr., H.W. Lux S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11512-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent quantities of spectrin dimer from various experiments were applied to PVDF membrane with a dot-blot template and probed with antiphosphoserine antibody. The membranes were fluorographed on Kodak x-ray film, and luminated bands were quantitated by densitometric scanning as described under Methods.

To dephosphorylate membrane-associated β-spectrin, partially purified protein phosphatase was incorporated into ghosts followed by incubation at 37°C for 40 min. The spectrin dimer isolated from these ghosts with antiphosphoserine antibody showed decreased phosphoserine (Fig. 4B). There was a progressive decrease in β-spectrin phosphorylation with increasing amounts of protein phosphatase incorporated. This decrease in phosphorylation was accompanied by an increase in membrane mechanical stability. To estimate the extent of the decrease of β-spectrin phosphorylation, we first quantitated the net increase in the amount of phosphoserine in the spectrin dimer isolated from ghosts prepared with 1 mM MgATP (lane 2), compared to that present in ghosts prepared with no MgATP (lane 1). This net increase in spectrin phosphorylation (b in Fig. 4B) was taken to reflect the 0.75 to 0.98 mol of phosphate incorporated/mol of β-spectrin previously shown using 32P incorporation (Fig. 2C). Based on these estimates, it can be estimated that the spectrin dimer in the control ghosts should contain roughly 2.12 to 2.77 mol of phosphoserine (a in Fig. 4B). β-Spectrin contains 4 mol of exchangeable phosphate per β chain(19Harris Jr., H.W. Lux S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11512-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dunbar J.C. Ralston G.B. Biochim. Biophys.

The present results agree with those reported earlier, about 3 mol for native spectrin and incorporation of a maximum of 1 mol by phosphorylation due to MgATP for a total of 4 mol. In a similar manner, the extent of dephosphorylation of β-spectrin by phosphatase (c, d, and e in Fig. 4B) was also estimated. Fig. 5 shows the correlation between membrane mechanical stability and amount of phosphoserine in the β-spectrin dimer. It can be seen that the membrane mechanical stability is related to the extent of β-spectrin phosphorylation. Increased β-spectrin phosphorylation results in decreased membrane mechanical stability, while decreased β-spectrin phosphorylation results in increased mechanical stability. These data conclusively demonstrate that the state of β-spectrin phosphorylation does modulate membrane mechanical cohesion.Figure 5:Correlation between membrane mechanical stability and phosphate content of β-spectrin. Phosphorylated and dephosphorylated ghosts were obtained using various concentrations of MgATP and protein phosphatase, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1984839844,"Members of the serine proteinase inhibitor or serpin superfamily have a common molecular architecture based on a dominant five-membered A β-pleated sheet and a mobile reactive center loop. The reactive center loop has been shown to adopt a range of conformations from the three turn α-helix of ovalbumin to the cleaved or latent inhibitor in which the reactive center loop is fully inserted into the A sheet of the molecule. While the cleaved state can be achieved in all inhibitory serpins only plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and, more recently, antithrombin have been shown to adopt the latent conformation. We show here that the archetypal serpin, α1-antitrypsin, can also be induced to adopt the latent conformation by heating at high temperatures in 0.7 M citrate for 12 h. The resulting species elutes at a lower sodium chloride concentration on an anion-exchange column and has a more cathodal electrophoretic mobility on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing than native M antitrypsin. Latent antitrypsin is inactive as an inhibitor of bovine α-chymotrypsin, is stable to unfolding with 8 M urea, and is more resistant to heat-induced loop-sheet polymerization than native but less resistant than cleaved antitrypsin. The reactive center loop of latent antitrypsin is inaccessible to proteolytic cleavage, and its occupancy of the A sheet prevents the molecule accepting an exogenous reactive center loop peptide. The activity of latent antitrypsin may be increased from <1% to approximately 35% by refolding from 6 M guanidinium chloride.

Dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex may result in the release of the intact serpin (20Longstaff C. Gaffney P.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or cleavage of the loop at the P1-P1′ residues(21Matheson N.R. van Halbeek H. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13489-13491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactive center loop cleavage results in a profound conformational rearrangement in which the loop is fully inserted into the A sheet of the molecule(3Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 22Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol.

The cleaved species is inactive, has increased thermostability (24Carrell R.W. Owen M.C. Nature. 1986; 322: 730-732Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and is more resistant to unfolding with denaturants (25Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) when compared to the native protein. It is clear that the sequence of events involved in proteinase inhibition requires the loop to be mobile and to adopt a variety of conformations. A consequence of the mobility of the loop is the formation of loop-sheet polymers in which the reactive center loop of one molecule is inserted into a β-pleated sheet of a second. This interaction accounts for the biologically important retention of Z (26Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) and Siiyama (27Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol.

Hepatology. 1993; 18: 313-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have also been shown to spontaneously polymerize in vivo and a loop-sheet dimer has been identified in the crystal structure of antithrombin(9Schreuder H.A. de Boer B.

Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A second consequence of the mobile reactive center loop is the latent conformation seen in the crystal structures of plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1)1(7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and antithrombin(10Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In both cases the uncleaved loop of the inhibitor is stably incorporated into the A sheet of the inhibitor to form an inactive, thermostable molecule that shares immunological epitopes with the cleaved species(33Munch M. Heegaard C. Jensen P.H. Andreasen P.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This conformation occurs spontaneously in plasma PAI-1, but inhibitory activity may be restored by denaturant unfolding and refolding (34Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Levin E.G. Santell L. Blood. 1987; 70: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundstrom T.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational change in PAI-1 had been predicted prior to its structural confirmation. There was also an accompanying prediction (38Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) that the same latent conformation could be induced in other serpins by denaturant stress. However, the first attempts to demonstrate this with antithrombin and antitrypsin were later shown to be negated by the predominant formation of short chain polymers(39Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 737Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that latent antithrombin could be quantitatively prepared and isolated by pasteurization with 0.25 M citrate at 60°C(10Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 31Bruce D. Perry D. Borg J.-Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2265-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We report here the preparation, purification, and characterization of latent antitrypsin prepared in vitro using a similar protocol. As for PAI-1, latent antitrypsin is inactive as an inhibitor and has a reactive center loop that is inaccessible to proteolytic cleavage. The latent form is more thermostable and resistant to unfolding in urea than the native protein suggesting that the molecule has been stabilized by the incorporation of the reactive center loop into the A sheet of the molecule. Bovine α-chymotrypsin, succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-prolyl-L-phenylanalyl-p-nitroanilide (Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide), Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, papain type IV, and trisodium citrate were from Sigma, Dorset, U.K. M antitrypsin was freshly isolated from both fresh and stored plasma from confirmed M homozygotes by 50 and 75% ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by thiol exchange and Q-Sepharose chromatography as detailed previously (40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The protein was stored in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, pH 7.4, with 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and total protein was determined from the A280(41Travis J. Johnson D. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 754-765Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The resulting protein was always more than 75% active as an inhibitor of bovine α-chymotrypsin (40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and migrated as a single species on SDS and non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Latent antitrypsin was prepared by incubating isolated antitrypsin (final concentration 0.05-0.75 mg/ml) at 65-68°C for 6-24 h in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.7 M sodium citrate. The citrate was removed by dialysis against 20 mM Tris, pH 8.6 (3 × 5 liters), at 4°C and the antitrypsin concentrated to 0.8-1.0 mg/ml. This material was then heated at 60°C for 3 h to convert any residual active antitrypsin to polymer(40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Monomeric antitrypsin was separated from polymer by anion-exchange chromatography on a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) Mono-Q column. The protein was loaded in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.6 at 1 ml/min and latent antitrypsin separated from polymer and aggregates by a 0-1.0 M sodium chloride gradient in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.6 over 60 min. The peaks were pooled, protein concentration was determined by absorbence(41Travis J. Johnson D. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 754-765Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and activity by titration against bovine α-chymotrypsin(40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The conformation of antitrypsin in each peak was assessed by SDS and non-denaturing PAGE and transverse urea gradient (TUG) gel electrophoresis. Antitrypsin polymers were prepared by incubating M antitrypsin (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml) in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, pH 7.4, with 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol at 60°C for 3 h. Polymers were confirmed by non-denaturing PAGE and a concomitant loss of inhibitory activity against bovine α-chymotrypsin. The molecular mass of proteins was assessed on a 7.5-15% (w/v) linear gradient gel in 190 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris pH 8.8 buffer with 1% (w/v) SDS. All samples were heated in boiling water for 2 min in 1% (w/v) SDS prior to electrophoresis. This was performed on a 7.5-15% (w/v) linear gradient gel with a discontinuous buffer system containing 53 mM Tris, 68 mM glycine, pH 8.9, cathodic buffer in the upper chamber and 100 mM Tris pH 7.8 anodic buffer in the lower chamber(27Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 225-250Google Scholar). 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels were cast with a double lumen tube and a peristaltic pump to give a linear gradient from 0 to 8 M urea using the non-denaturing-PAGE buffer system(17Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 42Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 225-250Google Scholar). The gels were rotated through 90°, the stacking gel poured, and the gels run using the discontinuous buffer system described above. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature with a constant current of 15 mA until the front reached the end of the gel (approximately 2 h). The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Antitrypsin was cleaved at the reactive center loop by incubating with S. aureus V8 proteinase in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 37°C. Samples that were mixed with native antitrypsin for TUG gel analysis were treated with the inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin to a final concentration of 1 mM to prevent cleavage of the native protein. Cleavage with papain type IV was achieved by incubating with antitrypsin in 50 mM Tris, 20 mM imidazole, 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.5, for 2 h at 37°C. In all cases complete reactive center loop cleavage was confirmed by a characteristic band shift on 7.5-15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. Isoelectric focusing was performed on a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel with a pH gradient of 3.5-10 as described previously(40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The gels were prefocused at 500 V for 30 min before loading 15 μg of protein in each lane. The samples were run into the gel at 500 V for 30 min, and focusing was continued at 800 V for 2-3 h and then at 1200 V for 20 min. All samples were compared with an MM antitrypsin standard. Proteins in solution were adhered to a charged carbon membrane, washed with 50 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, pH 7.4, and negatively stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate. The individual molecules were visualized at × 57,000 magnification, with the images being subsequently magnified by photographic enlargement. Native, latent, and reactive center loop cleaved antitrypsin were incubated at 0.2 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, or 75 mM Tris, 75 mM glycine, 75 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, (40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) at constant temperatures between 30 and 100°C for 2 h. The solutions were rapidly cooled on ice and aliquots removed for analysis by non-denaturing PAGE. The remaining antitrypsin was then filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane and residual protein determined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. The patency of the A sheet of native and latent antitrypsin was probed with an 11 mer peptide (Ac-Ser-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser-Thr-Ala-Val-Val-Ile) representing the sequence P14-P4 of the reactive center loop of antithrombin. The synthetic peptide was purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column with a 30-50% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient in 50 mM ammonium acetate. The peptide was freeze-dried and dissolved in 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.6. Fifty μg of native or latent antitrypsin (1 mg/ml in storage buffer) were incubated with an equal volume of 100-fold molar excess of the peptide in a water bath at 37°C for 72 h(43Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.-B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Aliquots of protein were removed at various time points, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until required. The rate of binary complex formation was then assessed by separating the proteins on 7.5-15% (w/v) non-denaturing PAGE as described above. The optimum conditions for the formation of latent antitrypsin were assessed by incubating M antitrypsin (final concentration 0.25 mg/ml) in a range of concentrations of sodium citrate over a variety of temperatures for 4-24 h. The resulting material was then separated by non-denaturing-PAGE and residual activity assessed by titration against bovine α-chymotrypsin. Higher concentrations of citrate were required to prevent polymerization than described previously for antithrombin (10Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Incubation of antitrypsin in 0.7 M sodium citrate at 60°C resulted in the loss of only 25% activity over a period of 24 h, a temperature of 70°C favored polymerization rather than monomer formation; the optimum temperature was 65-68°C. Heat treatment of native M antitrypsin at 67°C for 4 h in the absence of citrate resulted in polymerization of all the protein and a complete loss of inhibitory activity against bovine α-chymotrypsin (data not shown). Further heating at this temperature favored elongation of the polymer chain as determined by non-denaturing-PAGE. The presence of 0.7 M sodium citrate resulted in the preservation of inhibitory activity against bovine α-chymotrypsin although this fell from a starting value of 80% to 13% after heating at 67°C for 4 h, 9% after 8 h, 5% after 12 h and 4% after 24 h. In all cases there was demonstrable polymer and monomer on non-denaturing-PAGE, the latter having a more cathodal electrophoretic mobility than native antitrypsin (data not shown); electron micrographs confirmed that antitrypsin polymers were significantly shorter than those formed in the absence of citrate. For all further experiments latent antitrypsin was prepared by incubating M antitrypsin at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml in 0.7 M sodium citrate at 67°C for 12 h although protein concentrations of 0.05-0.75 mg/ml and incubations for 24 h gave similar results. Citrate was removed by extensive dialysis into 20 mM Tris, pH 8.6 and the protein concentrated to approximately 1.0 mg/ml and reheated at 60°C for 3 h to convert any residual active antitrypsin to polymer(40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The inactive monomer was separated from polymer by ion exchange on a mono-Q column in 20 mM Tris pH 8.6. Higher concentrations of Tris, such as those used to purify native M and Z antitrypsin(40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), reduced monomer binding to the resin. Pasteurized antitrypsin was separated into four fractions by anion exchange as shown in Fig. 1; the specific activity of each fraction against bovine α-chymotrypsin was 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.3% and 0% for peaks 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Omission of the reheating step resulted in an increase in the specific activity of peak 2, representing residual active monomeric antitrypsin. Antitrypsin polymers and aggregates were converted to monomer by boiling for 2 min with 1% w/v SDS. No fraction contained reactive center loop cleaved antitrypsin when assessed by SDS-PAGE and, in particular, N-terminal sequencing of fraction 1 confirmed only N-terminal, but not reactive center loop cleavage (1EDPQGDAAQK- and 6DAAQK-) as described previously(40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The fraction that eluted before peak 1 was concentrated and 5 μg loaded onto SDS and non-denaturing-PAGE; no antitrypsin was visualized on either gel. Non-denaturing-PAGE analysis revealed fraction 1 to be monomeric, fraction 2 was a mixture of monomer and polymer and fraction 3 was short chain polymers, fraction 4 represented antitrypsin aggregates (Fig. 2). As fractions 1 and 3 were homogeneous these were further characterized by transverse urea gradient (TUG) gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Fraction 1 had a TUG gel profile similar to cleaved antitrypsin and significantly different from that of native M antitrypsin (Fig. 3); this represented the latent conformation. Isoelectric focusing confirmed the more cathodal migration seen on native-PAGE along with a new band pattern when compared to native M antitrypsin (Fig. 4). Fraction 3 had the characteristic profile of polymers on a TUG gel although these were significantly different from M antitrypsin polymers formed by incubating antitrypsin at 67°C for 12 h in the absence of 0.7 M sodium citrate. In the latter case the polymers were much longer with relatively few entering the separating gel and most remaining in, or on top of, the stacking gel. The polymers shown, for comparative purposes, in Fig. 3 were prepared by heating M antitrypsin (0.2 mg/ml) at 60°C for 3 h as described in the Methods section. Although latent antitrypsin represented approximately 30% of the pasteurized material when visualized by non-denaturing PAGE, the yield following chromatography was typically 200-900 μg from 8 mg starting M antitrypsin.Figure 3:7.5% w/v transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis of native and latent antitrypsin.

There was no change in the electrophoretic mobility on non-denaturing PAGE. Latent antitrypsin was inactive as an inhibitor of bovine α-chymotrypsin suggesting that the reactive center loop is inaccessible for complex formation. The reactive center loop was inaccessible to cleavage with Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase, which cleaves at the P4-P5 bond of the reactive center loop, and papain which cleaves at P6-P7 and P1-P1′ residues (17Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 a and b). Native and cleaved antitrypsin showed a heat stability profile (Fig. 6) similar to those described previously (24Carrell R.W. Owen M.C. Nature. 1986; 322: 730-732Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) whether performed in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 or 75 mM Tris, 75 mM glycine, 75 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5. Latent antitrypsin was stable to 70°C but then precipitated resulting in a fall in rocket height (Fig. 6). As loop-sheet polymerization accounts for the thermal precipitation of antitrypsin (40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) all fractions were separated by non-denaturing-PAGE. Native antitrypsin formed polymers after heating at 60°C for 2 h, cleaved antitrypsin did not polymerize even after heating at 100°C for 2 h. Latent antitrypsin remained monomeric until 70°C; heating for 2 h at higher temperatures resulted in some polymerization (80°C) and then aggregation (90 and 100°C). The antithrombin reactive center loop peptide BC11 annealed with native antitrypsin with a half-time of 30-60 min. Latent antitrypsin did not accept the peptide even after incubation for 72 h at 37°C (Fig. 7). Previous work has suggested that serpins may be induced to adopt a latent conformation by treatment with mild denaturants at 4°C(38Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It is now apparent that such treatment favors the formation of loop-sheet polymers in antithrombin(10Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Antitrypsin was therefore incubated at 1 mg/ml with 0, 1.1 and 1.5 M guanidinium chloride at 4°C for 16 h as described previously(40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The protein was dialyzed into 5 liters 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 with 3 changes and heated at 60°C for 3 h to convert any active monomer to polymer. Analysis of the preparations by non-denaturing-PAGE showed that incubation with both 1.1 and 1.5 M guanidinium chloride resulted in the formation of dimer as well as monomer. There was no residual monomeric band after heating at 60°C for 3 h suggesting that, as with antithrombin, this treatment does not induce thermostable latency in antitrypsin. The partial loss of activity that was previously attributed to formation of the latent conformation is likely to represent a combination of partial denaturation and loop-sheet dimerization, the latter being undetected by gel filtration (40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). 100 μg native and latent M antitrypsin (specific activities 97% and 0.7% respectively) were incubated in 6 M guanidinium chloride (final concentration 0.33 mg/ml) for 10 min before being refolded by twenty fold dilution with 200 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0 as described by Powell and Pain(25Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken 0, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after dilution and incubated with 5 pmol bovine α-chymotrypsin to assess activity. M antitrypsin regained approximately 70% of inhibitory activity against bovine α-chymotrypsin (Fig. 8). Refolding latent antitrypsin increased the specific activity from <1% to a value that differed between batches but ranged from 10-35%. The refolding curves shown in Fig. 8 are duplicates from the same preparation of latent antitrypsin and show an increase in inhibitory activity from 0.7% to approximately 35%. Alpha1-antitrypsin is the archetypal member of the serine proteinase inhibitor or serpin superfamily. Crystallographic and biochemical data suggest that members of this family are able to adopt a variety of conformations as a result of a mobile reactive center loop: native, cleaved at the reactive center loop, complexed with enzymes, polymerized and latent(44Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L211-L219PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the preparation and characterization of a stable conformation of antitrypsin which has the same properties as the prototypic latent serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(7Mottonen J.

Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This latent form of antitrypsin, like latent antithrombin(10Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), can be prepared by heating at high temperatures in stabilizing sodium citrate for 12-24 h. The conformation is induced less readily in antitrypsin and requires higher temperatures and higher concentrations of sodium citrate. The resulting mixture contains thermostable monomer and short chain polymers that are strikingly different from those of antitrypsin heated for the same length of time in the absence of citrate. The short length of citrate buffered polymers most likely reflects the incorporation of a latent species which terminates polymer chain extension. Latent antitrypsin can be purified from the short chain polymers by anion exchange. It elutes from the column at a lower sodium chloride concentration than native M antitrypsin and has a more cathodal electrophoretic mobility on non-denaturing PAGE and isoelectric focusing. The latent conformation is inactive as an inhibitor of bovine α-chymotrypsin indicating that the loop is inaccessible for enzyme:inhibitor interaction. This is confirmed by limited proteolysis with Staph. aureus V8 proteinase and papain type IV which are unable to cleave latent antitrypsin at the P4-P5 and P6-P7/P1-P1′ bonds respectively(17Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Latent antitrypsin is resistant to unfolding with 8 M urea suggesting that, as with the cleaved species, the reactive center loop is inserted into the A sheet to stabilize the antitrypsin molecule. Moreover the occupancy of the A sheet by the reactive center loop accounts for the abolition of peptide annealing even after incubation at 37°C for 72 h. Latent antitrypsin is more thermostable than native antitrypsin but less so than the cleaved species. We have previously shown that the thermal lability of antitrypsin reflects loop-sheet polymerization (40Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and for this reason the three conformations: native, latent and cleaved were assessed by non-denaturing PAGE after heating for 2 h at 30-100°C. Native antitrypsin formed polymers at heating above 60°C but formed aggregates at 90 and 100°C, cleaved antitrypsin was stable after heating at 100°C for 2 h. Latent antitrypsin was stable at temperatures up to 70°C but at 80°C there was evidence of polymer formation (based on the presence of precise bands on non-denaturing PAGE) and at 90 and 100°C nonspecific aggregation. It is of interest that heating latent antitrypsin at 80°C must expel the reactive center loop from the A sheet allowing the formation of loop-sheet polymers. Others have shown that latent bovine plasminogen activator inhibitor can be activated by high temperatures presumably by the same mechanism involving the expulsion of the reactive center loop from the A sheet allowing it to adopt an active conformation(45Katagiri K. Okada K. Hattori H. Yano M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cardinal feature of latent PAI-1 is the restoration of activity following treatment with denaturants(34Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of latent antitrypsin may be increased up to 50 fold by incubation with 6 M guanidinium chloride under conditions that unfold even cleaved antitrypsin(25Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The resulting material is, at most, 35% active and is therefore less susceptible to reactivation with denaturants than PAI-1(34Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may indicate that despite treatment with high concentrations of guanidinium chloride latent antitrypsin retains some elements of secondary structure that affects its refolding following the dilution of guanidinium with buffer. The biochemical data provide strong evidence that pasteurization of antitrypsin in high concentrations of citrate induces a latent conformation that has many similarities to the latent form of PAI-1 (33Munch M. Heegaard C. Jensen P.H. Andreasen P.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal analysis has shown that the structural basis of native latency in PAI-1 and induced latency in antithrombin is the incorporation of the whole reactive center loop, to P3, into the A sheet of the molecule(7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 10Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The degree of insertion of the reactive center loop into the A sheet in latent antitrypsin cannot be assessed precisely but is clearly sufficient to stabilize the molecule against denaturation with 8 M urea and render it more thermostable than native antitrypsin. The recent crystal structure of an antithrombin dimer (10Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) in conjunction with the antithrombin variant Rouen VI (31Bruce D. Perry D. Borg J.-Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2265-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) provides evidence for a link between the latent and polymerized species. The results indicate that opening of the A sheet may allow overinsertion of the reactive center loop to give the latent conformation, with an accompanying displacement of strand 1C. This allows the insertion of the reactive center loop of a second, active molecule to produce a loop-C sheet dimer. For the inhibitory serpins in general the partial insertion of the reactive center loop with release of strand 1C is likely to represent the conformational change that normally takes place to lock the inhibitor in the complex with its target proteinase. If this locked conformation is induced in the absence of the proteinase then it would predictably lead either to subsequent complete insertion of the reactive loop, to give the latent form, or to sequential linkage of the incompletely inserted loop of one molecule to the C sheet of the next to give loop-C sheet polymerization. This C sheet mechanism fits with the short chain polymers seen upon incubating antitrypsin with 0.7 M citrate at 67°C for 12 h. Citrate appears to act as a stabilizing agent preventing polymerization and allowing the chaotropic effects of temperature to induce the stable incorporation of the reactive center loop into the A sheet of the antitrypsin molecule. The incorporation of a latent molecule into extending polymers would predictably lead to chain termination and so account for the short polymers visualized by electron microscopy and non-denaturing PAGE. Heating in the absence of citrate produces polymers of up to 20 antitrypsin molecules in length. Although we have used the terminology latent antitrypsin there is, as yet, no evidence that this form occurs physiologically as does latent PAI-1. It is likely however that latent antitrypsin will be observed in vivo at least under the exceptional circumstances recently reported for latent antithrombin(31Bruce D. Perry D. Borg J.-Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2265-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). From a practical viewpoint the existence of the latent form of antitrypsin is of pharmaceutical significance as it forms under similar conditions to those used industrially to pasteurize plasma products for human administration.

https://openalex.org/W2077724681,"The structural basis for the biological specificity of human cystatin C has been investigated. Cystatin C and other inhibitors belonging to family 2 of the cystatin superfamily interact reversibly with target peptidases, seemingly by independent affinity contributions from a wedge-shaped binding region built from two loop-forming inhibitor segments and a binding region corresponding to the N-terminal segment of the inhibitor. Human cystatin C variants with Gly substitutions for residues Arg-8, Leu-9, and/or Val-10 of the N-terminal binding region, and/or the evolutionarily conserved Trp-106 in the wedge-shaped binding region, were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and Escherichia coli expression. A total of 10 variants were isolated, structurally verified, and compared to wild-type cystatin C with respect to inhibition of the mammalian cysteine peptidases, cathepsins B, H, L, and S. Varying contributions from the N-terminal binding region and the wedge-shaped binding region to cystatin C affinity for the four target peptidases were observed. Interactions from the side chains of residues in the N-terminal binding region and Trp-106 are jointly responsible for the major part of cystatin C affinity for cathepsin L and are also of considerable importance for cathepsin B and H affinity. In contrast, for cathepsin S inhibition these interactions are of lesser significance, as reflected by a Ki value of 10−8M for the cystatin C variant devoid of Arg-8, Leu-9, Val-10, and Trp-106 side chains. The side chain of Val-10 is responsible for most of the affinity contribution from the N-terminal binding region, for all four enzymes. The contribution of the Arg-8 side chain is minor, but significant for cystatin C interaction with cathepsin B. The Leu-9 side chain confers selectivity to the inhibition of the target peptidases; it contributes to cathepsin B and L affinity by factors of 200 and 50, respectively, to cathepsin S binding by a factor of 5 only, and results in a 10-fold decreased affinity between cystatin C and cathepsin H.

The contribution of the Arg-8 side chain is minor, but significant for cystatin C interaction with cathepsin B.

Cystatin C is comprised of one nonglycosylated 120-residue polypeptide chain (Grubb and Löfberg, 1982). It is ubiquitous in human tissues and body fluids (Abrahamson et al., 1986, 1990) and efficiently inhibits endogenous cysteine peptidases such as cathepsins B, H, L, and S (Barrett et al., 1984; Brömme et al., 1991). Cystatin C therefore appears to have a general protective function, to prevent connective tissue from destruction by intracellular enzymes leaking from dying cells or being misrouted for secretion from malignant cells (reviewed by Keppler et al.(1994)). Together with the other family 2 cystatins, cystatin D, S, SN, and SA, which have a more restricted distribution in human body fluids (Isemura et al., 1991; Freije et al., 1993), it may also be involved in defense against microbial infections. This seems likely because several parasitic protozoa, including, for example, the dysentery-causing Entamoeba histolytica and the pathogen in Chagas' disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, synthesize cysteine peptidases with crucial functions in parasite-host interaction (Luaces and Barrett, 1988; North et al., 1990). In addition, an antiviral function of cystatins is suggested from experiments with polio, herpes simplex, and corona virus-infected cell cultures (Korant et al., 1985; Björck et al., 1990; Collins and Grubb, 1991). Cystatin C forms reversible 1:1 complexes with target enzymes in competition with their substrates (Abrahamson et al., 1987a). From functional studies of cystatin C with truncated N-terminal segments, it is clear that an enzyme binding region located near the N-terminal end of the inhibitor is of major importance for its typical tight-binding properties (Abrahamson et al., 1987a, 1991). This region contains an evolutionarily conserved glycine residue (Gly-11) that confers flexibility to the preceding N-terminal segment, which is a prerequisite for optimal enzyme binding of the segment (Hall et al., 1993). The N-terminal region appears to contribute to endopeptidase binding via interactions between side chains of the residues preceding the evolutionarily conserved Gly-11 residue, Val-10, Leu-9, and, to a smaller extent, Arg-8, and target enzyme substrate-binding subpockets S2, S3 and S4, respectively (Hall et al., 1992; Lindahl et al., 1994). A similar important effect of the corresponding residues in the N-terminal segment of the avian family 2 homologue to human cystatin C, chicken cystatin, has been reported (Abrahamson et al., 1987a; Machleidt et al., 1989; Lindahl et al., 1992b). Computer docking based on the three-dimensional structures of chicken cystatin and papain, in addition, strongly suggests that two loop-forming cystatin segments, one located in the central part and the other close to the C-terminal end of the cystatin polypeptide chain, together form a second, wedge-shaped enzyme binding region (Bode et al., 1988). These segments also contain residues that have been conserved during the evolution of family 2 cystatins and correspond to the human cystatin C segments Gln-55-Gly-59 and Pro-105-Trp-106. Although the mechanism of cystatin interaction has been studied in some detail, it is still obscure what determines the biological specificity of the individual cystatins. Compared to cystatin C, cystatin S has for example 10,000,000-fold lower affinity for papain (Isemura et al., 1986; Lindahl et al., 1992a), and, unlike other human family 2 cystatins, cystatin D does not inhibit cathepsin B at all (Balbín et al., 1994). In the present study, we have used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to evaluate the relative importance of the N-terminal binding region to that of the wedge-shaped binding region for cystatin inhibition of mammalian cysteine peptidases, as well as to pinpoint which residues contribute most to target enzyme affinity by interactions with their substrate-binding subpockets. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392A synthesizer using phosphoramidites and other chemicals from Applied Biosystems. Biotin was added to the 5′-end of oligonucleotides to be used for direct sequencing of PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. products, directly at synthesis by use of Biotin-ON Phosphoramidite (Clontech). Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads) were from Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway.

Guanidinium chloride of high purity (Aristar quality) was purchased from British Drug Houses Ltd., Poole, UK. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma. polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A cDNA encoding human cystatin C (Abrahamson et al., 1987b), modified by replacement of the DNA segment encoding the wild-type signal peptide with one encoding the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein A (OmpA) signal peptide, has earlier been used in the construction of an expression plasmid called pHD313. The expression from this plasmid is under control of the temperature-regulated phage λ cI repressor and PR promoter (Dalb⊘ge et al., 1989). When introduced in E. coli, it gives high level expression and periplasmic space transport of cystatin C with properties identical with those of cystatin C isolated from human urine (Abrahamson et al., 1988). To set up a mutagenesis protocol allowing rapid generation of cystatin C variants with amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal segment, two unique recognition sites in pHD313, for the restriction endonucleases ClaI and NcoI, were used. The ClaI-NcoI fragment, which includes the coding sequence for the OmpA signal peptide as well as cystatin C residues 1-15 (Fig. 1), was excised from the plasmid. Corresponding fragments containing predetermined mutations were generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primer pairs hybridizing to sequences upstream from the ClaI site and encompassing the NcoI site, respectively (Fig. 1). The target sequence for the downstream primer was chosen to also include the codons for cystatin C residues 8-10, thereby allowing the desired mutations to be introduced in the PCR fragment by choosing a primer with appropriate nucleotide substitutions introduced at synthesis. The sequences of the upstream primer (206) and the downstream mutagenesis primers (209-214) are given in Table 1. PCR amplifications were performed in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA Thermal Cycler using DNA polymerase and other reagents from the AmpliTaq kit (Perkin-Elmer Cetus), primers at 0.6 μM concentration, and 0.6 ng of uncleaved pHD313 DNA as template in a 100-μl reaction. The PCR cycle (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, 1 min at 72°C) was repeated 30 times. PCR products were purified by phenol/chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation, cleaved with ClaI/NcoI, and ligated into ClaI/NcoI cut and dephosphorylated pHD313. Thereby mutated plasmids (named after the corresponding mutagenesis primer, e.g. pCmut209 for the V10G-cystatin C expression vector constructed with the aid of mutagenesis primer 209) were introduced in E. coli MC1061 (Casadaban and Cohen, 1980) that had been made competent for transformation by treatment with calcium chloride (Sambrook et al., 1989). Subclones of bacteria containing the expression plasmids were selected on ampicillin culture plates and grown overnight in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the cultures by a standard alkaline lysis procedure (Sambrook et al., 1989).Table I Open table in a new tab The same principle as described above for the generation of cystatin C variants with substitutions in the N-terminal region was applied for mutagenesis to give an expression vector for W106G-cystatin C. Unique recognition sites for the restriction enzymes BglII and EcoRI were taken advantage of (Fig. 1). The upstream, mutagenesis primer (called 219, Table 1) was designed to include the BglII site and span over the codon for cystatin C residue 106, allowing direct oligonucleotide introduction of the appropriate nucleotide substitution. The downstream primer used (“220,”Table 1) corresponds to a vector sequence downstream from the EcoRI site (Fig. 1). Conditions for PCR amplification of a 357-base pair segment with this primer pair were the same as described above. Purification, digestion, and ligation of the PCR product into BglII/EcoRI cut and dephosphorylated pHD313, subsequent transformation of E. coli with the resulting plasmid (pCmut219), and plasmid isolation from selected subclones were also performed as above. Expression vectors for cystatin C variants with both substitutions in the N-terminal region and the C-terminal substitution Trp-106 → Gly, were constructed by ligating the NcoI-ClaI-cut PCR fragments used for generation of the N-terminal variants into the expression vector for W106G-cystatin C, pCmut219, that previously had been digested with NcoI/ClaI and dephosphorylated. The resulting expression plasmids were named pCmut209/219, pCmut210/219, etc., and were introduced into E. coli MC1061 as described above. Selection of bacterial subclones containing the mutation corresponding to the amino acid substitution Trp-106 → Gly was aided by restriction analysis of plasmids isolated from the subclones, since the mutation creates a novel MvaI site (Fig. 1). Furthermore, all expression plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing of the plasmid isolated from bacterial subclones obtained after transfection and selection. For the various expression plasmids, a 569-base pair segment including the entire coding sequence for cystatin C was amplified by PCR using a biotinylated upstream primer (206) and a nonbiotinylated downstream primer (220) as indicated in Fig. 1. Primer concentrations were 1.2 μM but otherwise the PCR conditions were the same as for the mutagenesis PCRs above. The coding strand of the PCR product was separated from the noncoding strand after binding to streptavidin-coated beads, as described by the supplier (Dynal). The coding strand on the streptavidin beads was used as template in dideoxy sequencing using reagents in the Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (United States Biochemical) and oligonucleotide 011 or 078 (Fig. 1 and Table 1) as primer. The noncoding strand served as template in sequencing reactions with nonbiotinylated oligonucleotide 206 as primer. Growth conditions for cultures of bacterial subclones containing the various expression plasmids, as well as conditions for induction of expression of the recombinant genes, were exactly as described previously (Hall et al., 1993). From two 450-ml cultures of each bacterial subclone, a total volume of 20 ml of periplasmic extract was obtained by cold osmotic shock (Dalb⊘ge et al., 1989; Hall et al., 1993). Isolation of the different cystatin C variants from periplasmic extracts was accomplished by a previously detailed two-step procedure, including ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.5 or 9.0, and gel chromatography on a Pharmacia FPLC Superdex 75 column in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (Hall et al., 1993). The salt-free solutions of the isolated protein variants were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon 3; Amicon Corp.) to approximately 0.2 mg/ml when necessary and were stored frozen at −20°C until used. The isolated recombinant cystatin C variants were characterized by charge-separating agarose gel electrophoresis at pH 8.6 (Jeppsson et al., 1979), SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis after reduction in 16.5% gels with the buffer system described by Schägger and von Jagow (1987), and by automated N-terminal sequencing (Olafsson et al., 1990) using equipment and detailed procedures described earlier (Hall et al., 1993). The unfolding of recombinant wild-type cystatin C and the variant Cmut214 in guanidinium chloride was followed by measurements of fluorescence emission spectra, essentially as described by Björk and Pol (1992). Two equal dilution series of 0-6 M guanidinium chloride with 0.5 M increments, in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, were set up for each variant. The exact concentration of guanidinium chloride in the stock solution used was determined by densitometry (Kawahara and Tanford, 1966). To one of the dilution series, equal portions of the protein variant under study was added to give a final concentration of approximately 2 μM. Samples in the other series, without protein, served as blanks at fluorescence measurements. The solutions were incubated at room temperature for at least 20 h before measurements of their tryptophan emission spectra. A Perkin-Elmer LS-50 fluorimeter was used at excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 350 nm, respectively. The corresponding bandwidths were 3 and 10 nm, the path lengths of the cells were 1 cm, and the temperature in the cell was 26°C during measurements. To evaluate the data, the height of the emission peak at 350 nm after subtraction of the corresponding blank was related to that of the protein sample with no guanidinium chloride present. Temperature stability measurements of recombinant wild-type cystatin C and the variants Cmut214, Cmut219, and Cmut219/214 were performed essentially as earlier described (Abrahamson and Grubb, 1994). Solutions of the cystatin C variants at 0.2-0.3 mg/ml concentration in 0.05 M NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.0, were incubated for 30 min at temperatures ranging from 30 to 95°C. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatants were thereafter analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and their relative immunoreactivity was measured. The immunoreactivity was measured by single radial immunodiffusion (Mancini et al., 1965) in plates containing 0.4% of the IgG fraction from a rabbit antiserum raised against human cystatin C (DakoPatts, Copenhagen, Denmark). The degree of temperature-caused denaturation was expressed as the ratio between the immunoprecipitate area for each sample related to that formed by a co-analyzed sample of the variant under study that had been kept at 4°C during the heat incubation of other samples. Sheep liver cathepsin L was purified as described previously (Mason, 1986a). The purified enzyme was freeze-dried in aliquots and resuspended in assay buffer immediately before use. Bovine cathepsins S and H were purified according to earlier described procedures (Xin et al., 1992) and stored at −20°C until required. Affinity-purified human cathepsin B was purchased from Calbiochem. Due to difficulties in purification and procurement of tissues, human tissues could not be utilized to isolate cathepsins H, L, and S. However, comparative data available for the mammalian cysteine peptidases have shown no major differences in catalytic specificity in species variants of cathepsins B, H, L, or S (Mason, 1986a, 1986b; Shi et al., 1992; Xin et al., 1992). Papain was used for active site titrations of the different cystatin C variants, as has been described in detail elsewhere (Hall et al., 1993). The active enzyme was purified from a commercial papain preparation (Sigma, type III) by affinity chromatography, at 4°C, using the peptide H-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Arg-OH coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia), according to the protocol described by Blumberg et al.(1970). The purified enzyme was approximately 75% active as determined by E-64 titrations (Barrett et al., 1982) and was stored frozen at −20°C, resulting in no more than a 5% reduction of activity even after storage for 6 months. The method used for determination of equilibrium constants for dissociation (Ki) of complexes between the cystatin C variants and cysteine peptidases has been described in detail earlier (Hall et al., 1993). In brief, continuous rate assays with fluorogenic substrates were employed (Nicklin and Barrett, 1984), and the buffer used was 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 2 mM EDTA. The substrates were Z-PheArg-NHMec (10 μM) for cathepsins B, L, and S and H-Arg-NHMec (10 μM) for cathepsin H. Steady state velocities before (vo) and after (vi) addition of inhibitor were found with computer-aided linear regression, using FLUSYS (Rawlings and Barrett, 1990). Apparent Ki values (Ki(app)) were calculated as the slope from plots of [I]/(1 - vi/vo) versus vo/vi (Henderson, 1972). Obtained Ki(app) values were corrected for substrate competition using Ki values of 150 μM and 7 μM for cathepsins B and L, respectively (Barrett and Kirschke, 1981), 15 μM for cathepsin S, and 40 μM for cathepsin H (Xin et al., 1992). All determinations of vo and vi were based on assays with less than 2% substrate hydrolysis and a linear regression coefficient at steady state greater than 0.990. In order to study the relative importance of amino acid side chains in the N-terminal cystatin segment for the inhibition of target cysteine peptidases, cystatin C variants with Gly substitutions for Arg-8, Leu-9, and/or Val-10 were produced. A recombinant cystatin C gene, containing the coding sequence for native human cystatin C and the E. coli OmpA signal peptide (Dalb⊘ge et al., 1989), was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to create genes for V10G-, L9G-, and R8G-cystatin C, as well as for (L9G,V10G)-cystatin C with a double substitution, and (R8G,L9G,V10G)-cystatin C with Gly substitutions for all three relevant residues (Fig. 1). The mutated cystatin C genes were inserted in an expression vector and introduced in E. coli, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DNA sequencing was used to verify that selected bacterial subclones contained plasmids with the appropriate mutations. The five cystatin C variants were isolated from the periplasm of the bacterial subclones after expression had been induced, by a gentle two-step procedure comprising anion exchange chromatograpy at pH 9.5 or 9.0 followed by gel chromatography. This resulted in preparations of the variants with a purity of at least 95%, as assessed by agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses (Fig. 2). The charge difference expected for the recombinant R8G- and (R8G,L9G,V10G)-variants compared to the wild-type inhibitor, due to loss of the Arg-8 side chain, could be verified by a more anodal mobility in agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions demonstrated that all variants had the same mobility as wild-type recombinant cystatin C. For all, the SDS-PAGE estimated Mr was slightly higher than the Mr calculated from their sequences (13,017-13,343), but identical with that obtained by the same SDS-PAGE system for the native protein isolated from human urine (Abrahamson et al., 1988). All variants and wild-type recombinant cystatin C eluted by gel chromatography on a calibrated Superdex 75 column at a position corresponding to a Mr of 12,400. The five recombinant cystatin C variants were subjected to 15 steps of automated Edman degradation. The released phenylthiohydantoins verified in every position the expected N-terminal sequences (data not shown). The combined results of the physiochemical characterization of the variants, along with DNA sequencing of the coding regions of the expression vectors present in the same bacterial cultures as were used for expression, thus gave strong support for the variants produced being those intended. Preliminary investigations of the inhibitory properties of the five cystatin variants with Gly substitutions in their N-terminal segments revealed that, despite these substitutions, the cystatin C affinity for cathepsins L and S was still too high to be measured by an equilibrium method based on dissociation of the formed cystatin-enzyme complex. In order to lower the overall cystatin affinity for these target peptidases and thereby allow a comparative study of the contributions of individual N-terminal cystatin C residues to the binding of cathepsins L and S, a plasmid for expression of a sixth cystatin C variant having Gly substituted for the normal Trp-106 residue was produced by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). This plasmid was then used as backbone for the construction of expression plasmids for four additional cystatin C variants (Table 2) with both Gly substitutions in the N-terminal segment and the Trp-106 → Gly substitution, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Table II Open table in a new tab Expression of the five variants containing the Trp-106 → Gly substitution was induced in bacterial subclones containing the corresponding plasmids, as verified by DNA sequencing, and periplasmic extracts were collected. The five isolated Trp-106 → Gly-containing variants are shown in Fig. 2(lanes g-k). Again, the expected mobility difference due to removal of the Arg-8 side chain, in the (R8G,W106G)- and (R8G,L9G, V10G,W106G)-variants, could be verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Also, the SDS-PAGE mobilities and the elution profiles from the calibrated Superdex 75 column coincided with those for wild-type recombinant cystatin C, demonstrating that no proteolytic degradation had occurred during the isolation procedure. To examine the possibility that the introduced amino acid substitutions affected the normal tertiary structure of cystatin C, the stability of the variants produced was analyzed by two procedures. A temperature stability assay revealed that all variants, like the wild-type inhibitor, were very resistant to heat. Incubation of the variants for 30 min at 70°C and pH 8 resulted in less than 10% reduction of soluble protein, and no significant differences were observed for the different recombinant cystatin C variants (Fig. 3). In contrast, a significantly lowered heat stability is apparent for the cystatin C variant with the cerebral hemorrhage causing amino acid substitution Leu-68 → Gln, which influences the structural properties of the protein to a great extent, leading to rapid destabilization, aggregation, and a parallel loss of inhibitory activity (Abrahamson and Grubb, 1994). Fluorescence emission spectra in the presence of varying concentrations (0-6 M) of guanidinium chloride were analyzed for wild-type cystatin C and the variant with most extensive N-terminal substitution, (R8G,L9G,V10G)-cystatin C. For every guanidinium chloride concentration analyzed, the spectra for wild-type cystatin C and the variant were highly similar (data not shown). The calculated denaturation curves revealed an unfolding event between 3 and 4 M guanidinium chloride for both, but due to a large solvent effect resulting in a more than 4-fold tryptophan fluorescence increase at 350 nm for samples equilibrated in 6 M guanidinium chloride compared to those analyzed with no guanidinium chloride present, the transition midpoints for the denaturation process could just be approximated. The estimated midpoints were in 3.75 M and 3.25 M guanidinium chloride for wild-type and (R8G,L9G,V10G)-cystatin C, respectively. Taken together, the stability tests indicated that neither extensive substitutions in the N-terminal segment nor removal of the Trp-106 side chain significantly affect the overall structure of cystatin C. The equilibrium constants for dissociation (Ki) of wild-type cystatin C and the recombinant variants from complexes with cathepsins B, H, L, and S were determined from continuous-rate enzyme assays and are given in Table 2. The preparations of wild-type cystatin C and the 10 variants used in the inhibition experiments were all at least 70% active, as determined by papain titration. The major conclusions on the structural basis for the function of cystatin C (based upon results for wild-type cystatin C, for the variant with Gly substitutions for all 3 residues in the N-terminal binding region, (R8G,L9G,V10G)-cystatin C, for the W106G variant, and for the hybrid (R8G,L9G,V10G,W106G)-variant) are as follows. 1. The N-terminal enzyme binding region of cystatin C is generally important for inhibition, but its contribution to target enzyme affinity varies for the different peptidases. It is essential for cathepsin B inhibition (removal of Arg-8, Leu-9, and Val-10 side chains results in a >4000-fold affinity decrease, and the resulting Ki value is >1 μM), also of considerable importance for cathepsin L inhibition (corresponds to 4 orders of magnitude in affinity contribution), but of relatively low importance for cathepsin H and S inhibition (affinity contribution approximately 2 orders of magnitude for both). Cystatin C lacking the N-terminal binding region retains a considerable affinity for cathepsins H, L, and S (Ki 10−10-10−8M). 2. The evolutionarily conserved Trp-106 residue is generally important for the enzyme affinity of cystatin C. Its affinity contribution to cystatin C inhibition corresponds to 3 orders of magnitude or more for cathepsins B, H, and L, but it contributes less to the interaction with cathepsin S (affinity contribution approximately 2 orders of magnitude). The relative contribution of the Trp-106 side chain is 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the entire N-terminal binding region in the cystatin C inhibition of cathepsin L, 1 order of magnitude higher for cathepsin H, and equally important as that of the N-terminal binding region for the inhibition of cathepsin S and probably also cathepsin B (Ki values >1 μM regardless of side chain removal for Trp-106 or for all residues in the N-terminal binding region). 3. For the enzyme affinity conferred by the wedge-shaped binding region, the Trp-106 residue contributes differently in interactions with the four enzymes studied. In the cystatin C inhibition of cathepsin B, the Trp-106 side chain is responsible for a substantial fraction of the affinity contribution by this region, but for the inhibition of cathepsin S it is of less importance. Consequently, the remainder of the wedge-shaped binding region including the evolutionarily conserved loop-forming segment Gln-55-Gly-59 is of considerable importance for the cystatin C inhibition of cathepsin S (Ki = 9 nM for (R8G,L9G,V10G,W106G)-cystatin C inhibition of cathepsin S, compared to >1 μM for all other enzyme interactions), but its direct contribution to the inhibitor's affinity for cathepsin B seems minor. Thus, the structural basis for the differences in cystatin C affinity for the four target peptidases is complex, with varying binding contributions from the N-terminal binding region and the wedge-shaped binding region for the investigated peptidases, and also with different parts of the wedge-shaped binding region contributing to varying extents for the different enzymes. The observed variation probably reflects decisive general differences in the three-dimensional structures of the active site clefts of the enzymes (Björk et al., 1994) and indicates that the general orientation of cystatin C at enzyme interaction differs with the enzyme. Concerning individual residues in the N-terminal binding region, the main conclusions from the inhibition results for the cystatin C variants with single substitutions in the N-terminal binding region (Table 2) are as follows. The Val-10 side chain is responsible for the major part of the enzyme affinity conferred by the N-terminal binding region of cystatin C. Its affinity contribution is relatively constant (corresponds to 2-3 orders of magnitude for all four peptidases). The Leu-9 side-chain is responsible for a significant affinity contribution to the interaction between cystatin C and cathepsins B and L (more than 2 and slightly less than 2 orders of magnitude, respectively), but is of little importance for the inhibitor's affinity for cathepsin S (affinity contibution of a factor 5, only). By contrast, the Leu-9 side chain has a significant negative effect on the affinity between cystatin C and cathepsin H, since side chain removal results in a 10-fold affinity increase between inhibitor and enzyme. Thus, the Leu-9 residue affects the inhibitory specificity of cystatin C, rendering the inhibitor more selective for cathepsin B and L inhibition at the expense of its effectiveness as a cathepsin H inhibitor. The Arg-8 side chain significantly (7-fold) increases the affinity of cystatin C for cathepsin B, but its contribution to cathepsin L and H binding is small (2-fold) and not significant to cathepsin S binding. The functional results for the cystatin C variants with double or triple substitutions in the N-terminal binding region support the data obtained for the variants with single substitutions and, hence, demonstrate that the side chains of the Arg-8, Leu-9, and Val-10 residues contribute to target enzyme affinity in a simple additive fashion. For the cathepsin S interaction, for example, the Val-10 → Gly, Leu-9 → Gly, and Arg-8 → Gly substitutions in cystatin C results in affinity decreases of factors 30, 5, and 1.3, respectively, while the triple substitution results in a 150-fold affinity decrease, approximately equal to the product of the factors for the three variants with single substitutions. In the present investigation, we have tried to elucidate the structural basis for the biological specificity of cystatin C by functional studies of inhibitor variants with Gly substitutions for residues Arg-8, Leu-9, Val-10, and/or Trp-106. The Arg-Leu-Val residues were investigated because they, by several lines of evidence, seem to be responsible for the important contribution to target peptidase affinity that is conferred by an N-terminal binding region of family 2 cystatins like human cystatin C and chicken cystatin (Abrahamson et al., 1987, 1991; Bode et al., 1988, 1990; Machleidt et al., 1989; Hall et al., 1992; Lindahl et al., 1992b). They are also good candidates for residues conferring specificity to the inhibitory reaction, since their side chains interact with the nonprimed substrate-binding subpockets of several cysteine peptidases (Hall et al., 1992; Lindahl et al., 1994) and, hence, should have the capacity to reflect an enzyme's specificity for substrates. Studies of low molecular weight substrates and peptidyl inhibitors have indicated that the residues offering greatest discrimination between the four cysteine peptidases studied in the present work are located in P1, P2, and P3 (Mason and Wilcox, 1993). At target enzyme interaction, cystatin C should have the evolutionarily conserved Gly-11 residue in the P1 position (Bode et al., 1988, 1990) and thus lacks the major determinant for discrimination between cathepsins B, L, and S. For substrate interactions, Val is accepted in P2 by all four enzymes, as is Leu in P3. Thus, the N-terminal segment of wild-type cystatin C with its Val-10 and Leu-9 residues could be regarded as a valuable sequence conferring general cysteine peptidase inhibitory properties to the protein, provided that it interacts with all target enzymes. Indeed, our present results (Table 2) demonstrate that the N-terminal segment can interact with all four mammalian cysteine peptidases. The Trp-106 → Gly substitution was included in the present investigation primarily to enable studies of the effects of substitutions in the N-terminal segment of cystatin C for its interactions with cathepsins L and S, because the affinities of wild-type cystatin C for these enzymes are too high to allow reliable measurement of complex dissociation. It seemed likely that removal of the Trp-106 side chain would lower the overall enzyme affinity of cystatin C as this residue is directly involved in cystatin binding to several plant cysteine peptidases (Lindahl et al., 1988, 1992a), but without affecting interactions from the seemingly independent N-terminal binding region of the inhibitor (Hall et al., 1993). Our present data (Table 2) demonstrate that this approach was fruitful. The strategy to completely remove the side chains of the residues studied by Gly substitutions seemed plausible since the N-terminal segment of human cystatin C, as well as that of chicken cystatin, has no ordered structure according to NMR studies (Dieckmann et al., 1993). 2I. Ekiel, personal communication. Furthermore, the Trp residue is located in a hairpin loop and has a side chain that is solvent-exposed according to x-ray crystallography and NMR (Bode et al., 1988; Dieckmann et al., 1993),2 meaning that increased polypeptide chain flexibility caused by total removal of these side chains by Gly substitutions would be unlikely to affect the overall structure of the inhibitor. Our protein stability studies of the generated cystatin C variants indicate that the latter assumption is valid; no gross stability differences could be seen by comparison with wild-type cystatin C. Our functional data for the 10 cystatin C variants indicate general differences in the modes of interaction with the four mammalian cysteine peptidases. Cathepsins L and S, for example, are both very tightly bound by wild-type cystatin C with Ki values < 10−11M (Barrett et al., 1984; Brömme et al., 1991). In the cystatin C interaction with cathepsin L, the N-terminal binding region and the Trp-106 residue of the wedge-shaped binding region both contribute considerably, resulting in affinity contributions corresponding to more than 3 orders of magnitude for each and a poor inhibitory activity of (R8G, L9G,V10G,W106G)-cystatin C (Ki≫ 1 μM). For the inhibition of cathepsin S, both the N-terminal binding region and Trp-106 of cystatin C are of lesser significance, and retained good inhibition by the (R8G,L9G,V10G,W106G)-variant (Ki 9 nM) shows that the remainder of the wedge-shaped binding region including the conserved loop-forming segment Gln-55-Gly-59 is of considerable importance. A relatively low importance of the loop-forming Gln-55-Gly-59 segment of the wedge-shaped binding region for the cystatin C interaction with cathepsin L can thus be inferred. This conclusion is supported by results from a site-directed mutagenesis study of residues in the corresponding first hairpin loop of the wedge-shaped binding region of chicken cystatin, demonstrating that a number of different substitutions in this region had almost no effect on cathepsin L inhibition (Auerswald et al., 1992). However, such substitutions significantly affected the chicken cystatin inhibition of cathepsin B. Since the cathepsin B affinity for wild-type cystatin C is at least 100-fold lower than those displayed by cathepsins L and S, our results for this enzyme do not allow any general conclusions beyond the statement that both the N-terminal binding region and the Trp-106 residue are of crucial importance for the cystatin C inhibition of cathepsin B. But it seems likely that the mode of cystatin interaction with cathepsin B is different and probably follows a two-step binding mechanism, because of the extra occluding loop of the enzyme that covers the S′3 substrate pocket and which needs to be displaced in order to allow optimal inhibitor binding (Musil et al., 1991; Björk et al., 1994). Our previous studies of a cystatin C variant devoid of the 10 N-terminal residues ([des-1-10]cystatin C) have demonstrated that the N-terminal binding region contributes decisively to cathepsin B and L affinity (by 3 orders of magnitude) but not to that for cathepsin H (6-fold affinity decrease at removal of the N-terminal decapeptide, only) (Abrahamson et al., 1991). The data from the Gly-substituted cystatin C variants in the present study are fully consistent with these earlier results for cathepsins B and L, demonstrating that conclusions concerning the importance of an N-terminal binding region deduced from studies of N-terminally truncated forms of different cystatins should be valid at least for these two enzymes. For cathepsin H, however, the small functional difference between [des-1-10]- and wild-type cystatin C previously noted seems to underestimate the importance of the N-terminal binding region in intact cystatin C for this peptidase. The data of the present study rather indicate that the N-terminal binding region of cystatin C contributes significantly to cathepsin H inhibition (120-fold) and agrees well with recent data demonstrating that cathepsin H has endopeptidase activity (Xin et al., 1992) and therefore should have an extended substrate cleft with the capacity to accommodate the N-terminal binding region of cystatins. Although this interaction of the N-terminal region is of less importance for inhibition of cathepsin H than for inhibition of cathepsins B and L, it seems to be physiologically relevant since it improves inhibition from a Ki of 10−8 to 10−10M, i.e. to considerably below the cystatin C concentration in all investigated human body fluids (Abrahamson et al., 1986). The purpose of the present study was to collect structure-function data for cystatin C, with the long-term goal to use protein engineering methodology for development of protein inhibitors specific for physiologically relevant cysteine peptidases. Access to specific cystatins should be of importance to allow studies of the importance of individual cysteine peptidases in biological systems and would have the advantage over synthetic low molecular inhibitors designed for this purpose that they also could be used in transfection experiments to establish overproducing cell lines or transgenic animals. Specific cystatins will, in addition, most probably be devoid of the general cytotoxic properties displayed by several low molecular weight inhibitors. The present work has produced some practically useful results for the cystatin engineering work. For example, the N-terminal binding region should be the primary target for modifications aiming at selectivity. Especially Leu-9 seems to be a most promising target for such selectivity-determining substitutions. A systematic exploration with guidance of data for enzyme specificity for the P3 position in substrates to generate specific inhibitors for cathepsin B, H, and L might be rewarding. In addition, a recent study indicates that selectivity for cathepsin B inhibition can be achieved by the P2 substitution Val-10 → Arg (Lindahl et al., 1994). For specific cathepsin S inhibition, the properties of (R8G,L9G, V10G,W106G)-cystatin C produced in the present work demonstrate that this variant is more selective for cathepsin S than any known wild-type cystatin and might be useful for studies in complex biological systems.

https://openalex.org/W2166540608,"Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) have been identified in eukaryotic cells: a constitutively expressed COX-1 and mitogen-inducible COX-2, which is selectively expressed in response to various inflammatory stimuli.

We report here that radicicol, a fungal antibiotic, is a potent protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and that it inhibits the expression of COX-2 without affecting COX-1 expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages with the IC50 value of 27 nM. Radicicol inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of p53/56lyn, a Src family tyrosine kinase and one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Radicicol also inhibited COX-2 expression in vivo in glomeruli of rats with experimental glomerulonephritis induced by the anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, in which COX-2 expression is known to be enhanced. The enzyme activity of COX-1 or COX-2 was not affected by radicicol in macrophages. Radicicol also suppressed the COX-2 expression induced by IL-1β in rat smooth muscle cells. Other protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors suppressed the LPS-induced COX-2 expression in macrophages but at much higher concentrations than needed for radicicol. Radicicol did not inhibit the COX-2 expression induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in macrophages. These results suggest that the activation of tyrosine-specific protein kinases is the proximal obligatory step in the LPS-induced signal transduction pathway leading to the induction of COX-2 expression in macrophages. The magnitude of the inhibition of COX-2 protein synthesis by radicicol was much greater than that of the steady state levels of COX-2 mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W1999405592,"Phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in signal transduction and membrane traffic. We have previously shown that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) stimulates in vitro partially purified brain membrane PLD activity, defining a novel function of PtdIns-4,5-P2 as a PLD cofactor. In the present study we extend these observations to permeabilized U937 cells. In these cells, the activation of PLD by guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) is greatly potentiated by MgATP. We have utilized this experimental system to test the hypothesis that MgATP potentiates PLD activation by G proteins because it is required for PtdIns-4,5-P2 synthesis by phosphoinositide kinases. As expected, MgATP was absolutely required for maintaining elevated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P) and PtdIns-4,5-P2 levels in the permeabilized cells. In the presence of MgATP, GTPγS further elevated the levels of the phosphoinositides. The importance of PtdIns-4,5-P2 for PLD activation was examined by utilizing a specific inhibitory antibody directed against phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PtdIns 4-kinase), the enzyme responsible for the first step in the synthesis of PtdIns-4,5-P2. Anti-PtdIns 4-kinase completely inhibited PtdIns 4-kinase activity in vitro and reduced by 75-80% PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2 levels in the permeabilized cells. In parallel, the anti-PtdIns 4-kinase fully inhibited the activation of PLD by GTPγS and caused a 60% inhibition of PLD activation by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, indicating that elevated PtdIns-4,5-P2 levels are required for PLD activation. This conclusion is supported by the fact that neomycin, a high affinity ligand of PtdIns-4,5-P2, also blocked PLD activation. Furthermore, the activity of PLD in U937 cell lysate was stimulated by PtdIns-4,5-P2 in a dose-dependent manner.

Quantitation of the surface-localized galectin-1 was achieved by metabolically radiolabeling cells with [35S]Met/Cys and measuring the amount of lectin (i) sensitive to trypsin, (ii) accessible to biotinylating reagents, and (iii) accessible to the haptenic disaccharide lactose. By all three procedures, ≈1/2 of the radiolabeled galectin-1 associated with cells was shown to be on the cell surface with the remainder intracellular. The kinetics of externalization of galectin-1 was monitored by pulse-chase radiolabeling, and it was shown that cells secrete the protein with a t1/2≈ 20 h. The cell surface form of galectin-1 in CHO cells was active and bound to surface glycoconjugates, but lectin accumulating in the culture media was inactive. Lectin synthesized by mutant Lec8 CHO cells, which are unable to galactosylate glycoproteins, was not found on the surface and quantitatively accumulated in the media in an inactive form. Taken together, our results demonstrate that galectin-1 is quantitatively externalized by CHO cells and can associate with surface glycoconjugates where the lectin activity is stabilized. In the accompanying study (Cho, M., and Cummings, R. D.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 5198-5206), we reported that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells synthesize galectin-1. We have now used several approaches to define the subcellular location and biosynthesis of galectin-1 in these cells. Galectin-1 was present on the cell surface, as assessed by immunofluorescent staining with monospecific antibody to the protein.

Taken together, our results demonstrate that galectin-1 is quantitatively externalized by CHO cells and can associate with surface glycoconjugates where the lectin activity is stabilized. INTRODUCTIONMany vertebrate and invertebrate tissues contain soluble, so-called S-type β-galactoside-binding lectins, which are now known to represent a class of related carbohydrate-binding proteins termed galectins (Gitt and Barondes, 1986; Barondes et al., 1994). Galectin-1 is an ∼14-kDa subunit protein originally found in electric eels by Teichberg et al.(1975) and subsequently in bovine heart and other tissues by DeWaard et al.(1976) and Nowak et al.(1976).The proposed biological functions of galectin-1 in possibly mediating cellular interactions with extracellular matrix have been difficult to reconcile, however, with the original observation that in fibroblasts the lectin is found primarily in the cytoplasm and the isolated lectin is completely unstable in the absence of reducing agents (DeWaard et al., 1976). Galectin-1 lacks a recognizable signal sequence, contains free sulfhydryl residues, and lacks disulfide bonds (Hirabayashi et al., 1987; Clerch et al., 1988; Whitney et al., 1986; Tracey et al., 1992). Interestingly, in differentiating myoblasts, but not actively replicating myoblasts, galectin-1 appears to be externalized from the cells, and this externalization may involve a novel mechanism independent of the normal secretory process (Cooper and Barondes, 1990). In many cells and tissues, galectin-1 is found to be in both the cytoplasm of cells and localized in the extracellular matrix (Allen et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 1991; Harrison and Wilson, 1992). No studies have been reported on the biosynthesis of galectin-1 in fibroblasts nor in cells in which it may be secreted constitutively.These observations prompted us to analyze the structure, cellular location, and biosynthesis of galectin-1 in a commonly studied cell line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovaryPBSphosphate-buffered saline (6.7 mM KH2PO4, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.2)TPBSphosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20SPBPBS containing 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNHSN-hydroxysulfosuccinimideBSAbovine serum albumin. cells. We reported that galectin-1 from CHO cells occurs in an active monomeric form that can reversibly dimerize with a Kd≈ 7 μM (Cho and Cummings, 1995). Moreover, we found that the lectin is stable in the absence of reducing agents when bound to ligands, but the lectin rapidly loses activity when not complexed with ligand. In the present report, we demonstrate that galectin-1 is constitutively and quantitatively externalized by CHO cells and binds to plasma membrane glycoconjugates where the lectin retains activity. In contrast, in the absence of surface ligands, secreted galectin-1 is inactive. The results are discussed in terms of the overall structure and biosynthesis of galectin-1 in animal cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMolecular mass marker (14-200 kDa) for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Immunoprecipitin, and tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V), asialofetuin, alkaline phosphatase, conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate-mouse anti-rabbit IgG, Sephadex G-25, 2-mercaptoethanol, leupeptin, trifluoroacetic acid, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, aprotinin, ethanolamine, and Protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Sigma. Lactose, acetone, EDTA (disodium salt), and sodium bicarbonate were obtained from J. T. Baker. 35S-Protein Labeling Mix (1200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. NHS-biotin and streptavidin-Sepharose were obtained from Pierce Chemical. R-PE-conjugated F(ab)2 goat anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Zymed. Alkaline phosphatase color developing kit was obtained from Bio-Rad.Cell Culture, Metabolic Radiolabeling, and BiotinylationChinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were cultured as described previously (Smith et al., 1990). To metabolically radiolabel proteins, CHO cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes, incubated for 30 min at 37°C in methionine-free media, pulse-labeled for 40 min at 37°C in the same media with 250 μCi of 35S-Protein Labeling Mix, and chased with 15 ml of normal growth media. At each time point, the culture medium was gently collected, and the cell layers were washed with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS (150 mM NaCl, 6.7 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4). They were then incubated with 100 mM lactose/PBS for 5 min for lactose-washed cells or incubated with 100 mM maltose/PBS for control cells. After all the wash solutions were collected, the cells were scraped from the dish into 1 ml of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 mg/ml BSA. The dishes were washed with another 1 ml of PBS and pooled with the first milliliter collected. Media, wash solutions, and cell samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For biotinylation experiments, cells were cultured overnight in media containing 35S-Protein Labeling Mix (250 μCi), washed twice with PBS, and 2 ml of 10 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin in PBS was added. After a 30-min incubation at 4°C, another 2 ml of sulfo-NHS-biotin was added and incubated for an additional 30 min.Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingFor each 1 ml of sample, 50 μl of immunoprecipitin was added and incubated for 1 h at 4°C and then centrifuged to remove the immunoprecipitin and cell debris. One hundred microliters of affinity-purified monospecific antigalectin-1 antibody (80 μg/ml) (Cho and Cummings, 1995) was added to the supernatant, and this mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4°C. After a 1-h incubation with Protein A-Sepharose, the mixture was centrifuged to pellet immunoprecipitated complexes. The galectin-1-antibody complexes immobilized on the Protein A-Sepharose were washed five times with washing buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% BSA in PBS), and galectin-1 was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) by boiling for 5 min. In the case of biotinylated cells, immunoprecipitated galectin-1 was eluted with 0.1 M glycine buffer (pH 2.5) and separated from Protein A-Sepharose by centrifugation. The pH of the galectin-1-containing supernatant was adjusted by adding one-tenth volume of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and biotinylated galectin-1 was precipitated from the supernatant with streptavidin-Sepharose. The streptavidin-Sepharose was separated from the supernatant and washed twice with PBS, and the wash solutions were combined with the supernatant and precipitated by trichloroacetic acid. The galectin-1 bound to streptavidin-Sepharose was eluted with Laemmli buffer. This eluent and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated material were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 13.5% acrylamide under reducing conditions. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (50% MeOH, 20% acetic acid, 0.1% Coomassie blue) and destained (30% MeOH, 7% acetic acid). For fluorography, the gels were agitated in the En3Hancer (DuPont NEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions, then dried and exposed to x-ray film at 70°C using Kodak X-OMAT AR. After development, exposed areas of film were quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics Model 3008 computing densitometer). For Western blotting, proteins were electrotransferred overnight at 4°C onto nitrocellulose membranes, as described (Cho and Cummings, 1995). Membranes were blocked for 2 h with PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation). All additional immunostaining steps were performed in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (TPBS) at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. After three washes with TPBS, membranes were incubated with 1:3,000 diluted alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG mouse antibody) for 1 h. Membranes were washed in TPBS five times for 5 min and were developed with alkaline phosphatase color developing solution.ImmunohistochemistryCells were cultured as above on chamber slides (Nunc Inc.) for immunohistochemistry. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 30 min at 4°C with PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized by treatment for 1 h with PBS containing 0.05% saponin at 37°C (from this point on, all solutions for permeabilized cells contain 0.025% saponin). Cells were stained with monospecific anti-galectin-1 antibody diluted to 8 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h, washed with three times with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) diluted 1:200 in PBS, 1% BSA. The samples were washed three times for 5 min each with PBS, mounted in mounting medium (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), and analyzed in a fluorescence microscope.Trypsin SensitivityOne 10-cm dish of CHO cells was labeled overnight with 250 μCi of 35S-Protein Labeling Mix. The radiolabeled cells were treated with 2 ml of trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA) for 20 min at 37°C, followed by addition of trypsin inhibitor 10 times the concentration of trypsin to stop the reaction. The cells were lysed in 2 ml of ice cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin). The soluble lysate was analyzed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation.Asialofetuin-Sepharose ChromatographyAsialofetuin (5 mg/ml) was dissolved in 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.0) and immediately coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (1 ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The coupling efficiency was estimated to be 5 mg/ml by determining the amount of uncoupled protein by BCA assay. The media collected in pulse-chase experiments were applied to this asialofetuin-affinity chromatography column. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of SPB (PBS containing 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) followed by elution with 0.1 M lactose in SPB. The unbound and lactose-eluted materials were collected for immunoprecipitation.RESULTSImmunohistochemical Localization of Galectin-1 in CHO CellsIn the accompanying study (Cho and Cummings, 1995), we described the preparation of monospecific polyclonal antisera to galectin-1 and demonstrated that by Western blot the purified antibody reacted with only galectin-1. In studies described below, we also found that the purified antibody immunoprecipitated only galectin-1 from metabolically radiolabeled cells. This purified antibody was used to probe the subcellular distribution of the lectin in wild-type CHO cells and a mutant cell line termed Lec8 CHO. Lec8 CHO cells are unable to galactosylate their glycolipids or glycoproteins due to a defective transport of UDPGal into the Golgi apparatus (Briles et al., 1977; Stanley, 1984; Deutscher and Hirschberg, 1986). Lec8 CHO cells do not contain glycoconjugate ligands for the galectin-1 (Zhou and Cummings, 1993).To study the distribution of galectin-1, CHO cells were cultured on glass chamber slides to 50-70% confluence. The cultured cells were fixed and incubated with the antibody to galectin-1 without permeabilization. Both intracellular and extracellular galectin-1 were stained by initially fixing the cells, permeabilizing with 0.05% saponin, and incubating with antibody. Preimmune IgG did not react with permeabilized CHO cells (Fig. 1A). Galectin-1 was widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but it was absent from nuclei in both CHO and Lec8 CHO cells (Fig. 1, B and C), which is characteristic of cytoplasmic proteins. However, in nonpermeabilized CHO cells, the edges of the cells were strongly stained, which is typical for cell surface protein (Fig. 1D). We hypothesized that galectin-1 on the surface of CHO cells might be present there because of its interaction with surface glycoconjugates.To test this possibility, nonpermeabilized Lec8 CHO cells were immunostained with the same antibody. In the nonpermeabilized Lec8 CHO cells there was no significant surface antigen detectable (Fig. 1E). These results demonstrate that wild-type CHO cells contain surface-bound galectin-1 and that it is present there as a complex with membrane glycoconjugates containing galactose.Cell Surface Galectin-1 Is Trypsin-sensitiveTo further investigate the presence and amount of galectin-1 associated with the cell surface, we assessed the susceptibility of surface lectin to trypsin. In one approach, wild-type CHO cells attached to Petri dishes were exposed to trypsin-EDTA for 20 min, followed by solubilization, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting with antibody to galectin-1 (Fig. 2A). Galectin-1 was readily detectable in total cell extracts, and approximately one-half of the lectin was lost upon treatment of the cells with trypsin. The trypsin-resistant lectin was intracellular, as shown by the fact that when 1% Triton X-100 was added prior to trypsin treatment to solubilize them and expose the cytosolic lectin, most of the galectin-1 was destroyed by the protease (Fig. 2A). In another approach, total proteins in CHO cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]Met/Cys. The radiolabeled cells attached to Petri dishes were exposed to trypsin-EDTA for 20 min, followed by solubilization, immunoprecipitation with antibody to galectin-1, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. Compared to cells not treated with trypsin, the trypsin-treated cells showed a reduction of galectin-1 band intensity (Fig. 2B). Densitometric analysis of the lanes in Fig. 2B indicated that about one-half of the lectin was lost upon trypsin treatment of intact cells. As a measurement of cell integrity in this experiment, we determined both the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in the cell extract and media and trypan blue staining of the cells. Both approaches demonstrated that over 90% of the cells were intact after a 3-h incubation in the trypsin-EDTA solution (data not shown). These data demonstrate that about one-half of the galectin-1 associated with CHO cells is located on the cell surface and is sensitive to trypsin.Figure 2:Trypsin sensitivity of galectin-1 in intact CHO cells. One 10-cm dish of CHO cells were labeled overnight with 250 μCi of 35S-Protein Labeling Mix and then treated, as indicated, with trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA) for 20 min at 37°C. Trypsin was inactivated by addition of a 10-fold excess of trypsin inhibitor over the enzyme. The cells were lysed in 2 ml of PBS containing 1% of Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. The soluble lysate was analyzed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, immunoblots after SDS-PAGE with monospecific anti-galectin-1 antibody. B, immunoprecipitates of 35S-labeled galectin-1 with monospecific anti-galectin-1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Surface-localized Galectin-1 Can Be BiotinylatedTo confirm the cell surface distribution of the galectin-1, wild-type CHO cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]Met/Cys, and the cells were treated with sulfo-NHS-biotin to biotinylate surface proteins. Because sulfo-NHS-biotin cannot penetrate cell membranes (Orr, 1981), it only can react with amino groups on proteins exposed extracellularly.An excess amount of sulfo-NHS-biotin was used to quantitatively biotinylate CHO cell surface proteins. After biotinylation, cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitated antibody-galectin-1-Protein A-Sepharose complexes were dissociated by adding low pH elution buffer, and Protein A-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation. After adjusting the pH to neutral, the supernatant was incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose to isolate the biotinylated galectin-1 from the total immunoprecipitated galectin-1. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE fluorography, and the bands of galectin-1 on the fluorograms were quantified by densitometric scanning. As shown in Fig. 3A, 45% of galectin-1 was biotinylated on intact cells and subsequently bound to streptavidin-Sepharose, with the remainder occurring in the supernatant. These results are consistent with those obtained through trypsinization above and indicate that ≈1/2 of galectin-1 is surface-localized in wild-type CHO cells.Figure 3:Surface localization of galectin-1 by biotinylation. CHO cells (A) and Lec8 CHO cells (B) were labeled overnight with 250 μCi of 35S-Protein Labeling Mix. One set of each cell type was reserved, and the total galectin-1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation. A second set of cells was biotinylated with 10 mg/ml of the membrane-impermeable reagent sulfo-NHS-biotin by two treatments for 1 h at 4°C. The biotinylated cells were lysed, and galectin-1 was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were dissociated by low pH treatment, and the biotinylated galectin-1 was recovered by absorption to streptavidin-Sepharose. Material unbound and bound to streptavidin-Sepharose was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The lanes are designated as follows: Total imm.ppt, total immunoprecipitated surface plus intracellular galectin-1; Avidin unbound, intracellular galectin-1; Avidin bound, cell surface galectin-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biotinylation experiments were also performed using Lec8 CHO cells. Interestingly, galectin-1 from Lec8 CHO cells was found quantitatively in the streptavidin-Sepharose unbound material, proving that galectin-1 was located inside the cells, but not at the cell surface (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, this result demonstrates that intracellular galectin-1 is inaccessible to sulfo-NHS-biotin. In experiments described below, it is shown that Lec8 CHO cells do secrete galectin-1 to the outside.Galectin-1 Binds to the Cell Surface through Carbohydrate-Lectin InteractionsTo further demonstrate that galectin-1 on the surface of wild-type CHO cells is bound to carbohydrate determinants, CHO cells in Petri dishes were washed with 0.1 M lactose in PBS or PBS for 5 min. The lactose wash solution and the lactose-washed cells were analyzed for galectin-1 by Western blot analysis. Galectin-1 was present in the lactose wash (Fig. 4, lane 1), and there was a decrease of galectin-1 in the lactose-washed cells compared to control treated cells (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). These results, together with those above using Lec8 CHO cells, confirm that galectin-1 is present on the surface of wild-type CHO cells and is bound in a lactose-inhibitable fashion to surface glycoconjugates.Figure 4:Western blot analysis of total galectin-1 in CHO cells before and after washing cells with lactose. CHO cells were grown to 80% confluency, and the culture medium was gently collected. The cell layer was washed with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS, and surface galectin-1 was eluted by treatment with 100 mM lactose/PBS for 5 min. The treated cells were lysed. One-tenth of the total lysate and two-tenths of the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material from the lactose eluted sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The lanes are designated as follows: lane 1, galectin-1 eluted from cell surfaces by lactose washing; lane 2, intracellular form of galectin-1 following lactose washing of intact cells; lane 3, total cell-associated galectin-1 prior to lactose washing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biosynthesis of Galectin-1We considered that the surface localization of galectin-1 could arise by lectin either leaking from damaged cells or secreted through a biosynthetic process. To evaluate these possibilities, wild-type CHO cells were pulse-labeled for 40 min with [35S]Met/Cys in low methionine media and chased for up to 30 h in normal media lacking [35S]Met/Cys. At each time point, one set of cells were washed with lactose (50 mM) just before immunoprecipitation with antibody to galectin-1, and the other set was washed with either maltose or PBS as controls. Radiolabeled galectin-1 was immunoprecipitated from culture media and cells and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The amount of galectin-1 immunoprecipitated was quantified by densitometric scanning of the fluorogram. This experiment was repeated three separate times, and the results were similar in each case. One of these experiments is summarized in Fig. 5.Figure 5:Pulse-chase kinetics of galectin-1 biosynthesis in CHO cells. CHO cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and were pulsed with 250 μCi of 35S-Protein Labeling Mix for 40 min followed by a chase period extending up to 30 h. At each time point, the culture medium was gently collected and the cell layer was washed with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. The cells were then incubated with 100 mM lactose/PBS for 5 min for lactose-washed cell or incubated with 100 mM maltose/PBS as a control. Galectin-1 was immunoprecipitated from lactose-washed cells, control cells (maltose-washed), and media. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (bottom panel). The top panel shows the amount of lectin (as a percentage of the total amount) at each time point during the chase period. Lactate dehydrogenase activity in the media versus total lactate dehydrogenase activity in the cells was monitored as a function of time to assess the integrity of cells. •, galectin-1 remaining in maltose-washed cells; □, galectin-1 remaining in lactose-washed cells; ○, galectin-1 occurring in media; ▵, lactate dehydrogenase activity in media as a percent of total activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Most of the newly synthesized galectin-1 was externalized and found in the media after 30 h (Fig. 5, bottom panel), and this secretion is quantified in the graph (Fig. 5, top panel). However, up to 11 h, most of the galectin-1 was found in the cell extract (Fig. 5). Over the same time period, differences were observed in lectin recovered between PBS- or maltose-washed cells and lactose-washed cells (Fig. 5). More lectin was eluted from intact cells using lactose versus maltose washing conditions in the times before 11 h. Both the maltose-wash and PBS-wash gave similar results. Neither maltose nor PBS would be expected to elute lectin specifically bound to glycoconjugates, since maltose does not inhibit hemagglutination by galectin-1.These results demonstrate that newly synthesized galectin-1 is externalized, attaches to cell surface glycoconjugates, and remains there for several hours before being released into the media. Furthermore, secretion of galectin-1 by CHO cells is quantitative and occurs at a rate of about 3-4% per h. By 30 h of chase, at least 80% of galectin-1 was secreted by the cells into the media. During the chase time, the intactness of the cells was determined by measuring the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in the media and plotted as a relative percentage to that present in the extract of cells at the 30-h time point (the 0 h extract set to 100%) (Fig. 5). Throughout the chase time, less then 2% of total lactate dehydrogenase activity could be found in the media. These results demonstrate that galectin-1 is quantitatively secreted by CHO cells and does not gain access to the extracellular space through cell lysis.Galectin-1 Found in Media Is InactiveTo investigate lectin activity of galectin-1 secreted into media, 30-h chase media from CHO cells, as in Fig. 5, was collected and applied to a column containing asialofetuin-Sepharose. Galectin-1 was immunoprecipitated from the unbound fractions and lactose-eluted fractions. Galectin-1 found in CHO culture media after a 30-h chase was inactive in binding to asialofetuin-Sepharose (Fig. 6A).Figure 6:Inactivity of galectin-1 in the media in Lec8 CHO cells. CHO and Lec8 CHO cells were grown on a 10-cm dish until 90% confluency and radiolabeled with 250 μCi of 35S-Protein Labeling Mix for 30 min and chased for 3 h. Each medium was collected and applied to an asialofetuin column. Galectin-1 was immunoprecipitated from asialofetuin-Sepharose (ASF-SEP) bound and unbound fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We performed a similar experiment using both wild-type CHO cells and Lec8 CHO cells, except that the chase time was reduced from 30 to 3 h to enhance the possibility of finding active galectin-1. This was based on the accompanying study (Cho and Cummings, 1995) in which we found that galectin-1 in solution lacking either reducing agent or glycoconjugate ligand had a t1/2 of 6-10 h. The galectin-1 secreted into the media of wild-type CHO cells during a 3-h chase was unable to bind asialofetuin-Sepharose (Fig. 6B). In media from Lec8 cells, following the 3-h chase, more galectin-1 could be recovered as expected, but it too was unable to bind asialofetuin-Sepharose (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate that galectin-1 secreted into the media by either wild-type CHO or Lec8 CHO cells is unstable and inactive.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that galectin-1 is synthesized in CHO cells in the cytosol and can be externalized and remains at the cell surface through carbohydrate-lectin interactions. We chose to study galectin-1 in CHO cells based on preliminary screening using Western blot analysis of various cell lines. The results demonstrated that CHO cells, compared to other common cell lines, produced high amounts of galectin-1. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the Lec8 mutant of CHO cells generates and secretes galectin-1 as do normal CHO cells, but the lectin is not bound to the Lec8 CHO cell surface and accumulates in the media in an inactive form. The combined results of trypsin sensitivity, biotinylation, and haptenic sugar release demonstrate that about one-half of the total cell-associated galectin-1 in CHO cells is on the cell surface and the remainder is in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the results show that galectin-1 is quantitatively secreted to the outside of the cell.Previous studies on the localization of galectin-1 in cultured cells have provided conflicting evidence. In the original studies by Briles et al.(1979), it was found that galectin-1 in chick embryo fibroblast cells was cytosolic, and, in nonpermeabilized cells, no lectin was detectable on the cell surface. While we have not retested these cells for the presence of surface galectin-1, we have noticed that extensive washing of cells and the fixation process can result in loss of surface galectin-1. Galectin-1 on the surface of CHO cells is bound only by its reversible interactions with carbohydrate ligands. Thus, extensive washing of cells before fixation can cause significant losses of surface lectin. The pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that the surface-localized galectin-1 does not arise through release from the cytoplasm of damaged cells and binding of the lectin to surface glycoconjugates.Cooper and Barondes(1990) reported that galectin-1 is neither secreted nor is present on the cell surface of actively replicating mouse myoblasts. They did find, however, that galectin-1 is secreted by differentiated mouse myoblasts, and that, during secretion, the lectin is observed by immunofluorescence to be within vesiculated structures closely underlying the plasma membrane (Cooper and Barondes, 1990). In contrast to this study, Harrison and Wilson(1992) reported that an undefined amount of galectin-1 was present on the cell surface of migrating myoblasts using immunofluorescent techniques and was concentrated in the ruffled edge. However, in that case, the lectin was neither susceptible to trypsin nor was it eluted from the cells by treatment with lactose, thus raising questions about the interpretation that the lectin is truly surface-localized. In our experiments, galectin-1 in CHO cells appears diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm, and there was no evidence for a vesiculated form of the lectin and lectin was constitutively secreted. Furthermore, the lectin was sensitive to trypsinization and eluted from the cell surface with lactose. In the case of mouse myoblasts, the vesiculated forms of galectin-1 were seen upon induced differentiation of the cells and thus may represent a special secretory mechanism for these cells (Cooper and Barondes, 1990).Our studies strongly suggest that the carbohydrate-lectin interactions are the primary mechanism to both localize galectin-1 on the surface of cells and allow generation of an active form of the extracellular lectin. Galectin-1 is unstable in oxidizing conditions such as those likely to exist in the extracellular matrix. In the accompanying manuscript (Cho and Cummings, 1995), we demonstrated that galectin-1 was highly stable in the absence of reducing agent when the lectin is bound to a glycoconjugate ligand.Pulse-chase experiments coupled with the lactose wash experiments showed that newly synthesized galectin-1 is externalized slowly (about 3% per h), and galectin-1 stays associated at the surface of plasma membrane for a period (about 10 h) through carbohydrate-lectin interactions. However, the amount of time galectin-1 remains bound to the cell surface could be longer in vivo than in vitro, due to the potentially large artificial dilution of the lectin in the media of in vitro cultured cells. During biosynthesis and secretion of the lectin, the surface-bound galectin-1 may be displaced by newly synthesized lectin and move to the media where it rapidly loses activity. These possibilities are summarized in Fig. 7, which illustrates some of the possible fates of galectin-1 during its biosynthesis and movement to the cell surface and media. This pathway incorporates also the findings of the accompanying manuscript (Cho and Cummings, 1995) in which galactin-1 is shown to occur in a reversible and active monomer/dimer form.Figure 7:Proposed biosynthetic pathway for galectin-1 in CHO cells. This illustration depicts the biosynthesis of galectin-1 in CHO cells and some of the possible equilibria of the galectin-1 between monomer and dimer forms and complexation with carbohydrate ligands. Lectin in the cytosol is in both monomer and dimer forms. Following secretion, a metastable intermediate form of the lectin is depicted, which must either associate with carbohydrate ligands or become inactivated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our observation that the galectin-1 secreted by Lec8 CHO cells in a 3-h chase experiment is inactive may also have implications in regard to the mechanism of secretion. It is possible that galectin-1 is secreted in a metastable form (the postulated intermediate in Fig. 7) that requires immediate association with glycoconjugate ligand to stabilize the protein and allow correct protein folding. Possibly, this metastable form of galectin-1 synthesized in Lec8 CHO cells is rapidly inactivated by the oxidizing conditions which may lead to incorrect inter- or intradisulfide bonds. In wild-type CHO cells, this problem is averted by the association of secreted lectin with poly-N-acetyllactosamine-containing glycoproteins (Merkle and Cummings, 1988), such as lysosome-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 on the cell surface (Do et al., 1990). In some cell types that synthesize basement glycoproteins, such as laminin, secreted galectin-1 may associate with those glycoconjugates and also be stabilized in the extracellular environment. In the accompanying report (Cho and Cummings, 1995), we found that galectin-1 binding to laminin highly stabilizes the activity of the lectin. Laminin has been found to be a high affinity ligand for galectin-1 (Zhou and Cummings, 1990, 1993), and several reports demonstrate that galectin1 can be found by immunohistochemical methods to be colocalized with laminin (Cooper and Barondes, 1990; Cooper et al., 1991).Our studies reveal a potentially unique mechanism of regulating the activity of galectin-1. The activity of the protein may be regulated by its binding to available surface or extracellular matrix glycoconjugates. When none are available, or when the lectin is dissociated from glycoconjugates and cannot rebind readily, it is rapidly inactivated in the nonreducing extracellular environment. In addition, our finding of monomer-dimer forms of the lectin may also indicate that a complex process occurs whereby monomers bind to glycoconjugates and serve as sites for other monomers to bind, thereby facilitating multivalent activity of the lectin. The binding affinity of lectin to laminin is approximately 1-2 μM (Zhou and Cummings, 1990, 1993) and is in the same range as the binding affinity of monomers to each other (Cho and Cummings, 1995). It will be interesting in future studies to determine whether the monomer or dimer forms are secreted from cells and the mechanism(s) by which these forms pass through the plasma membrane and associate with extracellular ligands. INTRODUCTIONMany vertebrate and invertebrate tissues contain soluble, so-called S-type β-galactoside-binding lectins, which are now known to represent a class of related carbohydrate-binding proteins termed galectins (Gitt and Barondes, 1986; Barondes et al., 1994). Galectin-1 is an ∼14-kDa subunit protein originally found in electric eels by Teichberg et al.(1975) and subsequently in bovine heart and other tissues by DeWaard et al.(1976) and Nowak et al.(1976).The proposed biological functions of galectin-1 in possibly mediating cellular interactions with extracellular matrix have been difficult to reconcile, however, with the original observation that in fibroblasts the lectin is found primarily in the cytoplasm and the isolated lectin is completely unstable in the absence of reducing agents (DeWaard et al., 1976). Galectin-1 lacks a recognizable signal sequence, contains free sulfhydryl residues, and lacks disulfide bonds (Hirabayashi et al., 1987; Clerch et al., 1988; Whitney et al., 1986; Tracey et al., 1992). Interestingly, in differentiating myoblasts, but not actively replicating myoblasts, galectin-1 appears to be externalized from the cells, and this externalization may involve a novel mechanism independent of the normal secretory process (Cooper and Barondes, 1990). In many cells and tissues, galectin-1 is found to be in both the cytoplasm of cells and localized in the extracellular matrix (Allen et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 1991; Harrison and Wilson, 1992). No studies have been reported on the biosynthesis of galectin-1 in fibroblasts nor in cells in which it may be secreted constitutively.These observations prompted us to analyze the structure, cellular location, and biosynthesis of galectin-1 in a commonly studied cell line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovaryPBSphosphate-buffered saline (6.7 mM KH2PO4, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.2)TPBSphosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20SPBPBS containing 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNHSN-hydroxysulfosuccinimideBSAbovine serum albumin. cells. We reported that galectin-1 from CHO cells occurs in an active monomeric form that can reversibly dimerize with a Kd≈ 7 μM (Cho and Cummings, 1995). Moreover, we found that the lectin is stable in the absence of reducing agents when bound to ligands, but the lectin rapidly loses activity when not complexed with ligand. In the present report, we demonstrate that galectin-1 is constitutively and quantitatively externalized by CHO cells and binds to plasma membrane glycoconjugates where the lectin retains activity. In contrast, in the absence of surface ligands, secreted galectin-1 is inactive. The results are discussed in terms of the overall structure and biosynthesis of galectin-1 in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998624305,"The motor protein kinesin is implicated in organelle movement toward the plus ends of microtubules, but little is known about its interaction with organelle membranes or about the physiological role of the phosphorylation of kinesin and its associated protein kinectin seen in neurons in vivo (Hollenbeck, P. J. (1993) J. Neurochem. 60, 2265-2275). Here we have demonstrated that the kinesin heavy chain (KHC), light chain, and kinectin isolated from chick brain or sympathetic neurons exist in several isoelectric forms. Metabolic labeling followed by phosphatase treatment showed that these are phosphoisoforms, and that phosphorylation is reversible in vitro. To assess the capability of phosphorylation to regulate kinesin's state and/or activity, we performed 32P and 35S pulse-chase experiments with neuronal cultures and determined that kinesin-associated phosphate turns over 3-4 times faster than the proteins themselves. When the phosphoisoform distributions for different kinesin pools were analyzed, it was found that membrane-associated KHC contained predominantly the most highly phosphorylated isoform, while soluble kinesin consisted of less phosphorylated KHC isoforms. Nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells was found to increase significantly kinesin's 32P specific activity while doubling the relative abundance of the most highly phosphorylated KHC isoform. These results demonstrate that the phosphorylation state of kinesin is closely coupled to its organelle binding and to the magnitude of organelle transport in the cell. We propose that the phosphorylation state of kinesin and associated proteins may regulate motility via association with organelle membranes and, specifically, that KHC phosphorylation induces membrane association. The motor protein kinesin is implicated in organelle movement toward the plus ends of microtubules, but little is known about its interaction with organelle membranes or about the physiological role of the phosphorylation of kinesin and its associated protein kinectin seen in neurons in vivo (Hollenbeck, P.

INTRODUCTIONA substantial body of evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies has indicated that the motor protein kinesin is involved in organelle transport and membrane traffic (for review, see (1Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 724-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Skoufias D.A. Scholey J.M. Curr. Opin.

Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how kinesin's activity is regulated, particularly about the modulation of its association with organelle membranes. Toyoshima and co-workers (5Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) have identified a 160-kDa integral membrane protein, “kinectin,” and proposed that it binds to the tail region of the kinesin molecule, thus serving as a receptor molecule on the organelle surface. However, it is not yet clear whether kinectin is the sole participant in kinesin binding to the organelle membrane or whether additional factors are involved. Moreover, the most important element, the molecular mechanism serving to regulate the partitioning, or interconversion, between soluble and membrane-bound states of kinesin in vivo, remains unknown.Kinesin is generally recovered as a soluble protein from cell homogenates, and it has been shown by differential detergent solubilization of plasma and organelle membranes that approximately two-thirds of the total kinesin in fibroblasts is in a soluble state while the remaining third is organelle-bound(6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, a simple interconversion governed by a single binding affinity constant between kinesin and organelle membranes is unlikely to satisfy the complex requirements of spatiotemporal modulation of organelle transport in cells. Thus, we expect the affinity between kinesin and membranes to be regulated by a mechanism that can respond to the immediate physiological conditions of the cell and alter the state and/or activity of kinesin.One potential mechanism for this regulation is protein phosphorylation, which is known to play a role in the regulation of nonmuscle myosins (7Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and may also be involved in the case of axonemal dynein(8Tash J.S. Cell Motil.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and clearly associated with regulation of pigment granule motility in teleost pigment cells of several kinds (12Rozdzial M.M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that kinesin is a phosphoprotein (20Sato-Yoshitake R. Yorifuji H. Inagaki M. Hirokawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23930-23936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Matthies H.J.G. Miller R.J. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11176-11187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation may play a role in regulating its association with organelle membranes or its ATPase activity in vitro. However, direct correlation between the state or motility of kinesin and its phosphorylation has not yet been shown in vivo; it is notable, for instance, that despite the detailed physiological characterization of pigment granule movement and the apparent role of kinesin there(23Rodionov V.I. Gyoeva F.K. Gelfand V.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4956-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the relationship between regulatory phosphorylation and the motor protein(s) present remains unknown.Several recent studies have addressed the interaction of purified kinesin with isolated membrane vesicles(20Sato-Yoshitake R. Yorifuji H. Inagaki M. Hirokawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23930-23936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yu H. Toyoshima I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1477-1485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Varied membrane preparations have been employed, and all are reported to bind kinesin with a high affinity. However, if the phosphorylation state of kinesin plays a regulatory role in membrane association, the in vivo situation may be considerably more complex than that represented by in vitro binding experiments that employ kinesin preparations with undefined phosphorylation states. Moreover, although it has been shown that in vitro phosphorylation by protein kinase A catalytic subunits alters the affinity of kinesin for membranes(20Sato-Yoshitake R. Yorifuji H. Inagaki M. Hirokawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23930-23936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the relevance of these experiments depends upon the identity of the kinesin kinase(s), which is as yet unknown and seems unlikely to be protein kinase A in vivo(21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, in this report we have further investigated the phosphorylation of kinesin in vivo and addressed whether that phosphorylation is correlated with its association with membranes.We have previously established from metabolic labeling studies in diverse cell types that all three components presumed to be involved in the kinesin-organelle interaction, KHC, 1The abbreviations used are: KHCkinesin heavy chainKLCkinesin light chainNGFnerve growth factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagles mediumPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidKAPPskinesin-associated phosphoproteinsIEFisoelectric focussingPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. KLC, and kinectin, are phosphoproteins in vivo and that the KHC is phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues in a <5-kDa region outside of the N-terminal mechanochemical and microtubule-binding head domain(21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since the C-terminal tail domain of KHC, perhaps in association with KLC, is thought to be involved in the interaction with membrane and/or with kinectin(5Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 25Skoufias D.A. Cole D.G. Wedaman K.P. Scholey J.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1989; 56: 867-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 27Scholey J.M. Heuser J. Yang J.T. Goldstein L.S. Nature. 1989; 338: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation sites are likely to be in the general region of kinesin-membrane interaction. This is consistent with the possibility that kinesin-based motility is regulated by a phosphorylation-mediated interconversion of kinesin between soluble and membrane-bound states. This idea has been developed previously for myosin, cytoplasmic dynein, and kinesin by several authors(6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Citi S. Kendrick-Jones J. Bioessays. 1987; 7: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Lin S.X.H. Collins C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 579-588PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Here, in order to address this hypothesis, we have employed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and metabolic labeling of cultured cells in order to detect different phosphoisoforms of kinesin and investigate the phosphorylation state of kinesin in its soluble versus membrane-associated forms. Our results show that the KHC and KLC exist, with cytotypic variation, in at least three different isoelectric forms (i.e. phosphoisoforms) due to different phosphorylation states and that the phosphorylation is reversible both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate a striking difference in the phosphorylation states of the KHC between the soluble and membrane-bound kinesin pools. Finally, we show in vivo that kinesin becomes more phosphorylated when anterograde organelle transport is up-regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite extension in PC12 cells. Based upon these data, we propose that a fraction of cellular kinesin is in an inactive, soluble state, and can be recruited by protein phosphorylation into a form competent to bind organelles with higher affinity and support transport.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureAll reagents, culture media, and supplements were from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Primary cultures of chick sympathetic neurons and fibroblasts were prepared and grown as described previously(6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.6% glucose, 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator. For the induction of neurites, cells were kept continuously in medium containing 50 ng of NGF (2.5 S NGF, Boehringer Mannheim) per ml.Metabolic Labeling ExperimentsNeuronal, fibroblast, and PC12 cultures were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate essentially as described previously(21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cultures were first washed with phosphate-free DMEM and then incubated for 16-18 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing carrier-free H332PO4 (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) at 0.5-1 mCi/ml. Differentiated PC12 cells were maintained in NGF for 3-6 days prior to labeling with 32P. For [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling experiments, neuronal cultures were washed 2 × 1 h with methionine-free DMEM and incubated 16-18 h in methionine-free DMEM containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (protein labeling mix, DuPont NEN) and NGF. After incubation in radiolabel, cells were washed with L-15 medium and lysed with PHEE (65 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, 8 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.6 units/ml aprotinin, protease inhibitor mixture as described previously(31Hollenbeck P.J. Chapman K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM glycerophosphate, 10 mM Na3PO4, 2 mM ATP (PHEE+) plus 1% Triton X-100. For the sequential extraction of kinesin from fibroblasts, cells were first extracted with PHEE+ plus 0.02% saponin with gentle agitation for 4 min at room temperature. Then cells were rinsed with PHEE+ followed by a second extraction with PHEE+ plus 1% Triton X-100. For pulse-chase experiments, a 16-18 h incubation with either [32P]orthophosphate- or [35S]amino acid-containing medium was followed by three washes with L-15, and cells were then restored to normal medium without methylcellulose until the time of lysis.Isolation of Kinesin by ImmunoadsorptionKinesin was immunoadsorbed from clarified cell lysates or brain supernatants as described previously using SUK4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) against KHC coupled covalently to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads(21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Johnson C.S. Buster D. Scholey J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1990; 16: 204-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 17,000 rpm. To prepare chick brain kinesin, 19-day embryonic chick brains were homogenized in an equal volume of PHEE+ containing 1% Triton X-100, and the homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. Supernatants were incubated with SUK4-Sepharose beads with gentle continuous mixing for 2 h at 4°C. Beads were then washed 5 times with 30 volumes of Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mM ATP, 10 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM Na3PO4, and the protease inhibitors listed above; 3 times with the same buffer containing 0.5-0.7 M KCl but lacking protease inhibitors; and 7 times with Tris-buffered saline alone. Kinesin was eluted by resuspending the washed beads in gel sample buffer (125 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 mM dithiothreitol, pH 6.8), incubating them for 5 min at 95°C, and pelleting out the Sepharose beads. Using this procedure, KHC co-immunoadsorbs with equimolar KLC, kinectin in substoichiometric amounts, and a phosphoprotein doublet that varies in Mr between different tissues and cell types (21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Phosphatase Treatment of KinesinKinesin immunoadsorbed by SUK4-Sepharose beads was washed as described above and then beads were split into two aliquots. One aliquot was incubated with 100 units of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris, 100 μM EDTA, pH 8.5, for 30 min at 37°C. As a control, the other aliquot was incubated either with phosphatase plus inhibitors or without phosphatase entirely, conditions that yielded identical results. The beads were then washed an additional 5 times with Tris-buffered saline.IEF, SDS-PAGE, Immunoblotting, Fluorography, and QuantificationTwo-dimensional gels were run by a procedure similar to that of O'Farrell(33O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ampholine (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) mix for IEF was 450 μl of pH 5-8, 150 μl of pH 6-8, and 150 μl of pH 4-6 ampholine in 10 ml of 4% Nonidet P-40 and 55% urea. IEF was run for 16,000 V•h. The second dimensional SDS-PAGE and other SDS-PAGE were at a single concentration (10 or 11% acrylamide, from a 30T:2.8C stock) according to Laemmli(34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205950) Google Scholar). All the two-dimensional gels were run with carbamylyte IEF standard markers (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), visible as the train of isoelectric forms near the dye front of the gel in Fig. 1A; this ensured the consistency of IEF and expedited the exact alignment and comparison of different two-dimensional gels. Silver staining was performed by the method of Morrissey(35Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar), developed sufficiently that band densities that were linearly proportional to the amount of protein loaded (r2 > 0.98) over the range 5-50 ng of bovine serum albumin. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). KHC was detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-chicken brain KHC (6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) at a 1/3000 dilution. mAbs against the KLC (CKLC.3.9C1) and against kinectin (KR160.4), were gifts from M. P. Sheetz (Duke University). We also used an anti-KLC mAb from K. Pfister (University of Virginia). Secondary antibodies were conjugated with either alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) or horseradish peroxidase (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). All gels and blots were scanned using a Pharmacia laser densitometer. Radiolabel incorporation into polypeptides was quantified from gels or immunoblots using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager or by excision of bands and corrected Cerenkov counts, as described previously(21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Specific activities were determined from these measurements combined with mass determinations made using gel densitometry or quantitative immunoblotting with kinesin as a standard(6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Specific activities of proteins from experimentally-treated cells were compared with controls by Student's t test, with t > t0.05(1),n-1 as the criterion for rejection of Ho.RESULTSKinesin heavy chain, which was immunoadsorbed from Triton X-100-containing homogenates using SUK4 anti-KHC mAb(36Ingold A.L. Cohn S.A. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2657-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), co-adsorbed with equimolar KLC along with substoichiometric amounts of kinectin and an unidentified phosphoprotein doublet of 70-80 kDa(5Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Hollenbeck P.J. J.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the immunoadsorbed proteins showed that kinesin from embryonic chicken brain was composed of isoelectric forms with differing isoelectric points (Fig. 1A). Both the KHC and KLC were comprised of five major isoelectric forms, while kinectin showed three. The identities of each of these isoelectric forms as bona fide KHC (Fig. 1B), KLC (Fig. 1C), and kinectin (not shown) were confirmed by immunoblotting of two-dimensional gels identical to Fig. 1A. Kinesin isolated from pure cultures of chick sympathetic neurons contained four major KHC isoelectric forms (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Isoelectric forms of the KHC are the result of different degrees of phosphorylation. Kinesin from chick sympathetic neurons was immunoadsorbed, divided into two equal aliquots, treated with or without active alkaline phosphatase, and then subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The distribution of KHC isoelectric forms without (A) and with (B) phosphatase treatment is shown quantitatively in histograms. Identical treatment of kinesin immunoadsorbed from 32P metabolically labeled sympathetic neurons gave the fluorograms shown in C (untreated) and D (phosphatase treated). Arrowheads denote the positions of corresponding phosphoisoforms of both the KHC and KLC between phosphatase-treated and untreated samples; these were determined by precise alignment of two-dimensional gels using carbamylyte standards as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphoproteins above and to the right of the KHC and above and to the left of the KLC are kinectin, and the 70-80-kDa doublet, respectively. These are typical data from one of three independent experiments performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Isoelectric Forms Are Due to Phosphorylation, and Phosphorylation Is ReversibleIn order to assess the reversibility of KHC phosphorylation, we subjected immunoadsorbed neuronal kinesin to phosphatase treatment. Since the binding site of SUK4 mAb on the KHC is not near the sites of phosphorylation(21Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), phosphatase treatment of antibody-bound kinesin would not be expected to suffer from steric hindrance. Treatment with either alkaline or acid phosphatase resulted in a pronounced redistribution of KHC isoelectric forms from acidic to more basic ones; removal of a phosphate from KHC results in the shift from one isoelectric spot to a less acidic isoelectric spot. The relative intensity of each KHC isoelectric spot before and after alkaline phosphatase treatment is shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. Similar results were seen for the KLC (not shown). This suggested that these isoelectric forms (or charge isoforms) of kinesin were indeed phosphoisoforms generated by different degrees of phosphorylation. This was directly demonstrated by 32P metabolic labeling using chick sympathetic neuronal cultures (Fig. 2, C and D). All of the isoelectric forms of KHC and KLC were labeled with 32P as shown by a fluorogram of kinesin separated by two-dimensional PAGE (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D shows an equal loading of kinesin after alkaline phosphatase treatment. Cerenkov counts of excised gel bands revealed that up to 85% of the 32P associated with the KHC and KLC was removable in vitro by dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase. Alkaline phosphatase treatment rendered both the kinectin and the 70-80-kDa doublet entirely undetectable on fluorograms like the one in Fig. 2D.Phosphate Turnover in VivoKinesin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation could only play a role in regulating kinesin's behavior in vivo if the turnover of kinesin-bound phosphate were considerably faster than that of the proteins themselves. To evaluate this possibility, we compared kinesin protein turnover to kinesin-bound phosphate turnover in cultured sympathetic neurons using 35S and 32P pulse-chase experiments. While the KHC and KLC protein turnover was typical for these cultures (half-lives of 18-20 h versus 36 h for total protein (note also the extreme stability of kinectin, Fig. 3, A and B)), the kinesin-bound phosphates had considerably shorter in vivo half-lives (4-6 h, Fig. 3C). Thus, the total kinesin-bound phosphate turned over 3.5-fold (KLC) or 3.9-fold (KHC) faster than the proteins themselves.Figure 3:The phosphate associated with the KHC and KLC turns over several times faster than the proteins themselves do in neurons. Sympathetic neurons were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine overnight and then chased with medium containing cold amino acids. The 35S specific activities of (A) total protein (•) and kinectin (□), and (B) KHC (▾) and KLC (▵) were determined at intervals up to 48 h and are expressed as percentages of the specific activities at the zero chase time point. In parallel experiments, neurons were labeled with 32P overnight and chased with medium containing cold phosphate. The 32P specific activities of KHC (▾) and KLC (▵) were determined at intervals up to 10 h and are plotted as above (C). These data are the means of two independent experiments. The t1/2values shown are calculated from the slopes of the regression lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphoisoform Differences between Soluble and Membrane-associated KinesinIn order to determine whether the phosphorylation state of kinesin correlates with its association with organelle membranes, we examined chicken embryonic skin fibroblast cultures, in which a gentle sequential detergent extraction procedure separates soluble from membrane-associated proteins(6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fibroblast cultures were metabolically-labeled with 35S to increase sensitivity and facilitate quantification and then extracted in 0.02% saponin-containing buffer to remove soluble proteins followed by 1% Triton-containing buffer to release organelle-associated proteins; all cellular kinesin is released by this combination of extractions(6Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Kinesin from the resulting soluble and membrane-associated pools was separately immunoadsorbed by SUK4-Sepharose beads and analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE, fluorography, and quantification of radiolabel (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 shows fluorograms from a typical separation of soluble and membrane-associated fibroblast KHC. These cells contain three major and two minor KHC phosphoisoforms, and their distribution in each fraction (Fig. 4, C and D) shows that the membrane-associated kinesin is highly phosphorylated, while the phosphoisoform distribution of soluble kinesin is skewed toward less phosphorylated states. In particular, KHC phosphoisoform 5 (the most acidic, and thus likely the most highly phosphorylated) is the predominant one in organelle-associated kinesin, amounting to 60% of the total organelle-associated KHC. In the soluble kinesin pool, the fraction of this phosphoisoform is reduced more than 2-fold, while phosphoisoform 3 shows a corresponding increase.Figure 4:The distribution of KHC phosphoisoforms differs between soluble and membrane-bound kinesin pools. Fibroblasts were sequentially extracted to separate soluble from organelle-associated kinesin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinesin from each fraction was immunoadsorbed and analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE.

The expression of the channel activity was found to increase in parallel with that of the stimulatable generation of O∸2 in differentiated HL60 cells. HL60 cells induced to differentiate in the presence of succinyl acetone (a inhibitor of heme synthesis) were unable to generate O∸2, failed to express p22-phox but retained H+ channel activity. EBV transformed B lymphocyte cell lines from normal and CGD patients lacking expression of either p47-phox or p67-phox all expressed unaltered channel activity; however, the activity was completely absent in the lymphocyte cell line lacking gp91-phox. CHO cells and undifferentiated HL60 cells transfected with gp91-phox cDNA expressed H+ channel activity correlating with the expression of gp91-phox. We therefore conclude that the large subunit of the NADPH oxidase cytochrome b (gp91-phox) is the arachidonate activable H+ channel of human neutrophils.

We therefore conclude that the large subunit of the NADPH oxidase cytochrome b (gp91-phox) is the arachidonate activable H+ channel of human neutrophils. The activation of the NADPH oxidase is associated with a rapid depolarization of the membrane potential (Δψ: −60 mV →−15 mV), a slight fall in pHi (0.1), and the generation of superoxide (O∸2)(1Henderson L.M.

The superoxide is generated as a result of a single electron transfer from internal NADPH, through the oxidase complex, to external oxygen. We have previously shown that this is an electrogenic process and that an efflux of H+ ions through a channel provides the necessary charge compensation(1Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 2Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The opening of the channel is not synchronous with the initiation of O∸2 generation; either the H+ channel or O∸2 precedes; in either case rapid depolarization would occur, as is observed. As described for H+ conductance in the snail neuron the channel is inhibited by Cd2+ and Zn2+ ions. The tight coupling of the activities of the oxidase and the H+ channel can only be overcome by the provision of an alternative charge compensation pathway, e.g. valinomycin and K+(10Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar). In resting neutrophils the channel is closed and the opening is associated with the initiation of O∸2 generation as a result of a stimulus. We have shown that the channel is not opened by depolarization of Δψ, by an imposed change in the pH gradient or by a combination of the two. However in all cases the H+ channel was opened following the addition of arachidonate (8 μM). The direction and extent of H+ flux observed is that dictated by the proton motive force (Δp = Δψ+ RTln[H+]o/F[H+]i) (11Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase complex consists of a transmembrane, heterodimeric cytochrome b (gp91-phox, p22-phox) located in the plasma membrane and membrane of the specific granules.

Upon activation these cytosolic factors have been shown to translocate partially to the membrane where they may interact with the cytochrome b(16Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Although the H+ channel has been identified functionally and characterized, the protein(s) which bestow this property on the cell has/have not been identified. By definition a channel or carrier must be made up of a transmembrane protein(s), which may be regulated by cytosolic protein(s). We have investigated the involvement of the oxidase components (gp91-phox, p67-phox, p47-phox, p22-phox) in the H+ channel activity and have shown that the expression of the channel activity correlates with the expression of gp91-phox, but not with the expression of p67-phox, p47-phox, or p22-phox. The following were obtained from Sigma, Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom, and stock solutions were prepared as indicated: arachidonic acid, sodium salt (10 mM and 1 mM in 50% EtOH, stored under nitrogen), valinomycin (0.4 mM in EtOH), nigericin (1.5 mM in MeOH), CCCP ( 1The abbreviations used are: CCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazoneAAarachidonateBCECF-AMbiscarboxyl 5 (and 6)-carboxyfluorescence acetomethyl esterCHOChinese hamster ovaryCGDchronic grandulomatous diseaseDMFdimethylformamideEBVEpstein-Barr virusFCSfetal calf serumHL60human leukemic 60 cell lineSAsuccinyl acetone-4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid. )(8 mM and 0.8 mM in EtOH, pH adjusted with NaOH), propidium iodide (10 mg/ml in H2O), succinyl acetone (1 mg/ml tissue culture medium, filter sterilized) and F(ab′)2 fragment, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antispecies antibodies were diluted as instructed by the supplier. BCECF-AM was obtained from Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR and a stock solution of 1 mM prepared in Me2SO dried by freeze-thawing. The composition of the salt solutions was as follows: 150 mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes-Tris, 5.5 mM glucose pH = 7.3 (K+ medium) and 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes-Tris, 5.5 mM glucose, pH = 7.3 (Na+ medium). carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone arachidonate biscarboxyl 5 (and 6)-carboxyfluorescence acetomethyl ester Chinese hamster ovary chronic grandulomatous disease dimethylformamide Epstein-Barr virus fetal calf serum human leukemic 60 cell line succinyl acetone-4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid. All manipulations of the cell cultures were performed in a Flow Laboratory's flow hood, and cultures were grown in a Heraeus incubator at 37°C. The human myeloid cell line (HL60) and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B Lymphocyte cell lines were maintained in a CO2-independent medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 mML-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). The HL60 cells were induced to differentiate by the addition of 105 mM dimethyl formamide (DMF) to cultures at 2 × 105 cell/ml. The cells were harvested (day 5-7) by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, washed in 1 volume of Na+ medium, and finally resuspended in Na+ medium at 2 × 107 cells/ml. In the investigation of the role of heme, the HL60 cells were maintained and induced to differentiate (105 mM DMF), in a CO2-independent medium, in the absence of FCS, but supplemented with Nutridoma-SP (Boehringer Mannheim) and 2 mML-glutamine. Succinyl acetone (SA) (10 μg/ml) was added with the DMF and was present through out differentiation. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were maintained Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was replaced every 2-3 days, and the cells were divided once a week as described below. For harvesting or splitting of the cells the medium was discarded, cells washed twice with filter sterilized phosphate-buffered saline prior to treatment with trypsin:EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3-4 min. 37°C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min) following the addition of fresh medium (10% FCS). They were either resuspended in the assay buffer (harvesting) or 20 ml fresh medium and divided equally between two flasks. All cell types were loaded with BCECF by incubation with 5 μM BCECF-AM for 5 min at 37°C in Na+ medium, centrifuged (800 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in the appropriate assay buffer (either K+ or Na+ medium). Little leakage of dye was observed over a 2-h storage on ice. Fluxes of H+ were monitored as changes in pHi determined by ratioing the fluorescence intensity after alternative excitation at 490 and 455 nm, at 37°C as described previously(2Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). An inward Δp was imposed on the cells in a Na+ medium by the addition of valinomycin (2.7 μM) and Hepes (pHo = 6.7). Whereas an outward acting Δp was imposed on cells in a K+ medium in the presence of valinomycin (2.7 μM) and Tris (pHo = 8.2). Opening of the channel was measured following the addition of 8-12 μM arachidonate (Fig. SI). The pHi changes were calibrated in a K+ medium in the presence of 10 μM nigericin, as described previously (17Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racher E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). The gp91 construct (pMEP-4-91) was generated as follows. Nucleotides 19-1776 of the published gp91-phox cDNA sequence (18Royer-pokora B. Kunkel L.M. Monaco A.P. Goff S.C. Newburger P.E. Bachner R.L. Cole F.S. Curnutte J.T. Orkin S.H.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The construct was transfected, by electroporation (Bio-Rad gene pulser) into Escherichia coli, strain WM1100. Plasmid DNA was isolated using Qiagen columns as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The correct orientation of the gp91-phox cDNA insert was verified by diagnostic restriction enzyme digest using the BglII site within cDNA. Hygromycin b is an inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis. As susceptibility varies between cell lines a sensitivity assay was performed on both CHO and HL60 cells. The cells were cultured in the presence of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 400 μg/ml hygromycin b for 48-72 h. Cell survival was assessed as the ability of the cells to divide, to remain impermeant to trypan blue at 7 days and, in the case of CHO cells, remain adherent. The minimum concentration of hygromycin b required to lead to total cell death after 7 days was used to select for transfected cells. The ability of both CHO and HL60 cells to recover following electroporation was assessed as the ability of cells to divide and in the case of CHO cells, remain adherent. The cells were electroporated at 200 V, 210 V, 230 V, 250 V, 270 V, 290 V, 300 V, and 950 μF and allowed to stand for 20 min before culturing as described above. The highest voltage giving good recover was used in the transfection experiments. The CHO (from two T75 flasks) and HL60 cells were harvested, as described above, and washed, twice, in filter-sterilized phosphate-buffered saline. The CHO cells were resuspended in 1 ml of a medium containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 250 mM sucrose in a 0.4-cm gene pulser cuvette (Bio-Rad) containing 10 μg of pMEP-4-91kDa or 10 μg of pMEP-4. The cells were electroporated (230 V, 960 μF) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min before diluting with 20 ml Ham's-F-12 and split between two tissue culture flasks. Nonadherent/dead cells were removed 24 h later and the medium replaced. Hygromycin b (Sigma), 100 μg/ml, was added 48 h after electroporation to select for transfectants. The cells were passaged three times in the presence of hygromycin b before it was judged that stable transfectants were established. The HL60 cells in 1 ml of CO2-independent medium, in the absence of FCS, were transfected by electroporation (250 V, 960 μF) in the presence of 10 μg of pMEM-4-91kDa or 10 μg of pMEP-4. The cells were allowed to recover, diluted, and maintained in CO2-independent medium with 10% FCS for 48 h before initiating selection by supplementing the medium with 300 μg/ml hygromycin b. The cells were maintained for 4 weeks before selection of transfectants was judged to have occurred. Induction of expression from the metallothionein promoter was stimulated by the addition of 10 μM Cd2+ to the culture medium 24 h prior to harvesting. Immunocytochemical techniques in combination with confocal microscopy were used to examine the expression of gp91-phox, p67phox, p47-phox, and p22-phox. HL60 (±DMF), EBV-transformed B lymphocytes, CHO cells, and the transfected HL60 and CHO cell lines were immunostained using polyclonal anti-oxidase component antibodies by the method described previously(22Henderson L.M. Figueroa C.D. Muller-Esterl W. Bhoola K.D. Blood. 1994; 84: 474-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were fixed (4% formaldehyde, 10 min) and permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100, 2 min) prior to staining. The CHO cell lines were cultured on round glass coverslips for 24 h prior to staining. Propidium iodide shows an increase in fluorescence upon binding to DNA but is cell impermeant and therefore can be used as an indicator of cell integrity. The susceptibility of transfected cell lines (±Cd2+) to lysis by AA was followed by excitation at 500 nm with emission at 540 nm, in the presence of 7.5 μg/ml propidium iodide in Na+ medium at 37°C. A 1/100 dilution of Triton X-100 was used as a control to validate the assay. The generation of superoxide was monitored as the superoxide dismutase- or diphenylene iodonium-sensitive reduction (550 nm to 540 nm) of horse heart cytochrome c (100 μM) in Na+ medium at 37°C as described previously(1Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster blood (0.5 ml) was obtained by cardiac puncture. The buffy coat layer (rich in white blood cells) was aspirated from the top of the cell pellet following centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. The remaining red blood cells were removed by hypotonic lysis as described previously(1Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Two polyclonal anti-p22-phox protein antibodies and a anti-p47-phox were supplied by Prof A. W. Segal (University College, London). The polyclonal anti-gp91-phox was raised to the C-terminal 14-amino acid peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibodies were verified by Western blot against isolated human neutrophils. The flux of H+ through the channel was monitored as the fall of pHi of cells suspended in a Na+ medium in the presence of valinomycin. In the presence of this ionophore, the K+ gradient results in a large Δψ, negative inside. This together with a favorable pH gradient (pHo < pHi) provides the driving force for H+ entry. H+ egress was studied by suspending cells in K+ medium again in the presence of valinomycin and the imposition of a pH gradient with pHo > pHi. In both situations the counter movement of K+ provides charge compensation for H+ movements (Fig. SI). The measurements of pHi changes were carried out in the presence of excess diphenylene iodonium (an inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase) and amiloride in order to exclude the contribution of O∸2 generation and Na+/H+ exchanger, respectively(11Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The myeloid cell line, HL60, grows continuously in culture but may be induced to differentiate into neutrophil like cells (5-7 days) by the addition of DMF, Me2SO, or retinoic acid(23Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.F. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). An increase in the expression of oxidase components (gp91-phox, p67-phox, p47-phox, and p22-phox) and an increase in their ability to generate O∸2 have been previously reported to be associated with this differentiation (24Roberts P.J.

As shown in Fig. 1 the increase in O∸2 generating ability (Fig. 1, a and b) is paralleled by an increase in the expression of the H+ channel activity (Fig. 1, c and d). Therefore the differentiation of HL60 cells is associated with an increased expression of the H+ channel. The level of expression of many proteins is reported to alter during the induction of the differentiation of HL60 cells(28Davis R.C. Thomason A.R. Fuller M.L. Slovin J.P. Chou C.-C. Chada S.

However as both subunits of cytochrome b558 (gp91-phox and p22-phox) are reported to be transmembrane proteins(19Teahan C. Rowe P. Parker P. Totty N. Segal A.W. Nature. 1987; 327: 720-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Dinauer M.C. Orkin S.H. Brown R. Jesaitis A.J. Parkos C.A. Nature. 1987; 327: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 29Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Walker L.E. Allen R.A. Jesaitis A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their possible role in functioning of the H+ channel was investigated. Succinyl acetone inhibits δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for heme(30Ebert P.S. Hess R.A. Frykholm B.C. Tschudy D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 1382-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HL60 cells which have been induced to differentiate in the presence of 10 μg/ml succinyl acetone fail to show an increase in the ability to generate O∸2 (Fig. 2, a-c). It has previously been reported that succinyl acetone-treated cells lack the characteristic cytochrome b difference spectrum(31Hancock J.T. Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T.G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 21 (abstr.): 208Google Scholar). This suggested that this failure to generate O∸2 results from the absence of a heme moiety in the cytochrome b, rendering it nonfunctional. It is possible that the absence of the heme moiety may inhibit the expression of either or both cytochrome b subunits or may render their expression unstable. Therefore we investigated the expression of the cytochrome b subunits as well as the cytosolic factors (p67-phox, p47-phox) in HL60 cells differentiated in the presence and absence of succinyl acetone. This was done by using anti-oxidase component polyclonal antibodies in combination with confocal optical microscopy. In agreement with previous reports, the differentiation of HL60 cells was associated with a clear cut increase in the expression of gp91-phox, p67-phox, p47-phox, and p22-phox (Fig. 2d). However in the presence of succinyl acetone, the increase in expression of p22-phox was not observed (Fig. 2d, fourth row), whereas the increased expression of gp91-phox and p67-phox was unaffected (Fig. 2 d first and second rows), the expression of p47-phox was far greater in the cells differentiated in the presence of succinyl acetone (Fig. 2d, third row). Therefore in the absence of heme, stable expression of p22-phox, in induced HL60 cells, does not occur. Since the cells differentiated in the presence of succinyl acetone lack p22-phox, but not gp91-phox, they were utilized to investigate the role of p22-phox in the H+ channel. HL60 cells differentiated in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml succinyl acetone showed a similar increase in expression of the H+ channel compared with the undifferentiated HL60 cells (Fig. 2, e-g). Therefore we conclude that p22-phox does not act as the H+ channel, nor is it involved in the regulation of its activity. The presence of a fully functional H+ channel in HL60 cells differentiated in the presence of succinyl acetone which are unable to generate O∸2 also demonstrates that the channel is functionally independent of the activity of the oxidase. It has previously been reported the human B lymphocytes immortalized by EBV transformation generate low levels of O∸2 in response to an appropriate stimulus(32Maly F.E. Nakamura M. Gauchat J.F. Urwyler A. Walker C. Dahinden C.A. Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. De Weck A.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1260-1267PubMed Google Scholar). This ability is constitutively expressed, and it shares some characteristics with the neutrophil NADPH oxidase (33Hancock J.T. Henderson L.M. Jones O.T.G. Immunology. 1990; 71: 213-217PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic grandulomatous disease (CGD) is a genetically inherited disorder in which the expression of at least one of the oxidase components is absent. These patients are unable to generate O∸2 and show an increased susceptibility to infection(34Roos D. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 138: 121-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although the cytosolic factors cannot, by definition, act as the H+ channel, it has been suggested that p47-phox may regulate its activity(35Nanda A. Grinstein S. Curnutte J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CGD-derived EBV-transformed B lymphocyte cell lines lacking specific components of the NADPH oxidase were assayed for H+ channel activity as described above. Normal EBV-transformed B lymphocytes express an arachidonate-activable H+ channel (Fig. 3a) as do the cell lines lacking expression of p67-phox (Fig. 3b) and p47-phox (Fig. 3c). No major differences in the AA-stimulated H+ channel were observed between normal and either of the cell lines lacking the cytosolic factors. This suggests that neither is involved in the regulation of channel activity. In contrast to this, no channel activity was observed in the cell line lacking gp91-phox (Fig. 3d). The expected pHi change was only observed following the addition of an uncoupler. Thus the failure to observe an AA induced pHi fall is the consequence of an absence of a pathway for the flux of H+ ions. This strongly suggests that gp91-phox may have a role in the H+ channel or that it may be crucial to the regulation of its activity. To distinguish between these two roles for gp91-phox in the H+ channel, we investigated the ability of the protein, expressed in eukaryotic cell lines, to conduct H+ ions in response to AA. gp91-phox cDNA was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pMEP-4 (Fig. SII) and transfected, by electroporation, into CHO and HL60 cells. This vector allows the regulated expression of appropriately inserted cDNAs as expression is driven by the CdCl2-inducible human metallothionein IIa promoter; the increase in level of protein expression correlates with addition of increasing and nontoxic amounts of CdCl2 to the tissue culture medium of transfected cells (36Reaves B. Banting G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As anticipated, cells transfected with pMEP-4-91(CHO-91,HL60-91) express gp91-phox in a CdCl2-inducible manner (Fig. 4a; CHO-91,HL60-91, not shown). As the confocal microscope performs noninvasive optical sectioning the image is obtained from a discreet cross-section through the cell(37Shotton D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 175-206Crossref Google Scholar, 38Shotton D. White N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The annular staining observed (Fig. 4a, i-iii) is indicative of plasma membrane location for the expressed protein. CHO cells are impermeable to H+ ions and do not express an AA activable H+ channel (Fig. 4b). We also failed to detect the H+ channel in CHO cell lines transfected with pMEP-4 ± inducer (data not shown) and in CHO-91 grown in the absence of inducer (Fig. 4c). In all cases the addition of CCCP gave rise to the expected pHi change. However in CHO-91 cells in which the expression of gp91-phox had been induced, a clear AA-activable H+ channel was observed (Fig. 4d). A similar set of results was observed when using the HL60-91 cell line (data not shown). We have previously shown that at these concentrations AA is not a protonophore, it can only induce an H+ conductance in the presence of protein(11Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However a greater problem is that AA has detergent like properties and at sufficient concentrations can cause cell lysis. The failure of AA to induce a pHi change in nonexpressing CHO-91 cells argues against AAinduced cell lysis as the cause of the observed pHi changes. However it is possible that the expression of large amounts of a foreign protein results in the CHO-91 cells being much more susceptible to lysis by AA. That this is not the case is demonstrated by the requirement for AA in concentration > 45 μM to allow access of propidium iodide (a cell-impermeant fluorescent dye(39Beletsky I.P. Umansky S.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 134: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) in both the CHO-91 and induced CHO-91 cells. Therefore the pHi changes observed above (Fig. 4d) following the addition of 8 μM AA are not the result of cell lysis. The HL60-91 and CHO-91 cells induced to express gp91-phox did not express p22-phox, p47-phox, or p67-phox as determined by immunostaining using the anti-oxidase-component polyclonal antibodies (Table 1). As the polyclonal antibodies readily cross-react with neutrophils from Chinese hamsters (Table 1), it may be concluded that the expression of the H+ channel requires the expression of gp91-phox but that p22-phox, p47-phox, and p67-phox are not involved.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In this paper we have shown that the functional expression of the H+ channel correlates with the expression of gp91-phox (the large subunit of cytochrome b558) upon induction of HL60 cells and in EBV-transformed B lymphocyte cell lines derived from CGD patients. As CHO cells transfected with gp91-phox cDNA express an AA-activable H+ channel only associated with the expression of gp91-phox, we conclude that the large subunit cytochrome b558 functions as an essential part of the NADPH oxidase associated H+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1999837620,"The nature of the membrane attachment site(s) for protein 4.1 in the human erythrocyte membrane has yet to be fully elucidated. In this paper we show that the major attachment site is glycophorin (GP) C/D, and that purified protein 4.1 can bind to two distinct sites on glycophorin C/D. One of these interactions is direct, involving residues 82-98 on glycophorin C (61-77 on glycophorin D), while the other interaction is mediated by p55. We have localized the binding site for p55 on glycophorin C to residues 112-128 (glycophorin D 91-107). We also provide evidence that band 3 is an additional, minor, protein 4.1 binding site. The binding sites for band 3, glycophorin C/D, and p55 are all located within the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. We estimate that the relative utilization of the three sites in normal membranes comprises 40% to p55, 40% to GPC/D, and 20% to band 3. The same region of protein 4.1 binds GPC/D and band 3, while the p55 binding site is distinct. The interactions involving protein 4.1 with p55 and p55 with GPC/D are of high affinity (nM), while those involving GPC/D and band 3 are 100-fold lower (μM).

INTRODUCTIONThe structural integrity and deformability of the human erythrocyte, essential for its survival, are maintained by the skeleton, a network of proteins underlying the lipid bilayer membrane. The skeleton consists predominantly of spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1, as well as the minor components adducin, protein 4.2, protein 4.9, tropomyosin, and myosin (reviewed in (1Gilligan D.M. Bennett V. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 74-83PubMed Google Scholar) and (2Liu S.-C. Derick L.H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 231-243PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane is connected to the skeleton by at least two protein interactions. Ankyrin links band 3 to β-spectrin, an interaction which has been well studied(3Peters L.L. Lux S.E. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 85-118PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of protein 4.1, the other protein linker, with the membrane has not been so well studied, and the nature of the membrane attachment site(s) has yet to be fully elucidated. Possible membrane attachment sites include band 3(4Pasternack G.R. Anderson R.A. Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3676-3683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jons T.

This evidence suggests that GPC/D is the major membrane attachment site for protein 4.1(13Pinder J.C. Chung A. Reid M.E. Gratzer W.B.

It has also been suggested that a third component, p55, is required for such an interaction(15Alloisio N. Dalla Vanezia N. Rana A. Andrabi K. Texier P. Gilsanz F. Cartron J.-P. Delauney J.

In this paper we show that protein 4.1 can bind to GPC through two sites, one is a direct interaction between the two proteins, the other is an indirect interaction mediated by p55. We also provide evidence that band 3 is a minor, low affinity, protein 4.1 binding site.MATERIALS AND METHODSFresh normal erythrocytes were available from the National Blood Service (Bristol, UK). Fresh Leach phenotype erythrocytes (which lack GPC/D) were obtained from donor PL(18Anstee D.J. Parsons S.F. Ridgwell K. Tanner M.J.A. Merry A.H. Thomas E.E. Judson P.A. Johnson P. Bates S.

Rabbit anti-protein 4.1 antibodies against the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein were prepared using synthetic peptides Cys31-Lys53 in the 30-kDa N-terminal domain and His622-Glu641 in 22/24-kDa domain. Rabbit anti-p55 was prepared using a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 438-453 (Gly-Val-Asp-Glu-Thr-Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu-Gln-Glu-Ala-Phe-Asp-Gln-Ala-Cys-). Antisera were raised against synthetic peptides in a manner analogous to that described previously(14Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Mawby W.J. Reid M.E. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem.

Immunoblotting was as described by Mallinson et al.(22Mallinson G. Martin P.G. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J.A. Merry A.H. Tills D. Sonneborn H.H. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), except that 5% (w/v) bovine milk powder, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4, was used as the blocking agent.Protein PurificationProtein 4.1 was isolated using a modified method of Tyler et al.(23Tyler J.M. Hargreaves W. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), as described previously(14Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Mawby W.J. Reid M.E. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To prepare protein 4.1 free of p55, the KCl concentration used to elute protein 4.1 from the DEAE-Sephacryl column was reduced from 100 mM to 90 mM. Contamination of protein 4.1 with p55 was detected by ELISA of the fractions using anti-p55. p55 was purified according to the method of Husain-Chishti et al.(24Husain-Chishti A. Faquin W. Wu C.C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein determination was performed using the procedure of Lowry et al.(25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J.

Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Limited Digestion of Protein 4.1 and Isolation of 30-kDa-containing FragmentsProtein 4.1 was digested with chymotrypsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100, according to Leto and Marchesi(28Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4603-4608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments containing the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 were isolated by passing the digestion mixture through a CNBr-activated Sepharose column to which anti-30-kDa antibody had been coupled. Unbound material (fragments devoid of the 30-kDa domain) was collected, and bound fractions (containing the 30-kDa domain) eluted with 0.1 M glycine HCl, pH 2.7. Following neutralization (1 M Tris, pH 9.0, 5 M NaCl), the purity of the fractions was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent staining of the gels with Coomassie Blue. These fragments were subsequently used in the ELISA assay described below.Alkali-stripping of Human Erythrocyte MembranesLeaky membranes were prepared by the method of Dodge et al.(26Dodge J.T. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3619) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 0°C for 5 min, before stripping of peripheral proteins by washing with ice-cold 0.1 M NaOH. They were then washed three times with 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 at 4°C.Proteolytic Digestion of MembranesUnstripped and alkali-stripped membranes were diluted to 1 mg of protein/ml and incubated with 5 μg/ml trypsin or chymotrypsin in 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, for 1 h on ice. Digestion was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mM (final concentration). Alkali-stripped membranes were prepared, as above, and all membranes were washed three times with 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 at 4°C.Analysis of Protease-treated Membranes by ELISAThe wells of a round bottomed microtiter plate (Sterilin) were coated with 75 μl of lectin (from Agaricus bisporus; Sigma) (7 μg/ml in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature(27Scott, M. L., (May 27, 1992) U. K. Patent 9211176.4.Google Scholar). All other procedures were carried out on ice, and all washes were in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.055% Tween 20. The lectin-coated plate was washed, 75 μl of a 5% suspension of protease-treated membranes was added, and the plate was centrifuged at 930 × g for 2 min. The wells were incubated with antibodies to band 3 (BRIC 169), glycophorin A (BRIC 163), or GPC/D (anti-GPC1, anti-GPC2, anti-GPC3, BGRL 100) (75 μl/well) for 2 h. After washing, the secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate; DAKO) was added and incubated for 2 h. After further washing, 75 μl of substrate was added (1 mg of o-phenylenediamine and 0.4 μl of H2O2 in 1 ml of 0.05 M citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0). The color reaction was terminated by the addition of 75 μl of 1 M HCl after 3 min. The plate was read on a Titertek Multiskan ELISA reader (Flow Laboratories) at 492 nm.Binding Assays Involving Protein 4.1, Fragments of Protein 4.1, p55, Erythrocyte Membranes, and GPC PeptidesBinding studies were carried out using the ELISA system previously described(14Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Mawby W.J. Reid M.E. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments showed that equilibrium was reached after 4 h and that no peptide or protein binding was lost during washing. Within the limits of this assay, all plots appear linear. For inhibition of protein 4.1 or p55 binding to alkali-stripped membranes, serial dilutions of synthetic peptides were made in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated with an equal volume of protein 4.1 or p55 (final concentration 150 μg/ml) overnight at 4°C before addition to the microtiter plate. For p55 binding GPC-3-saturated protein 4.1: purified protein 4.1 (500 μg/ml) on microtiter wells, prepared as described above, was incubated with saturating levels of GPC-3 (75 μl/well) overnight at 4°C, before the addition of p55. For protein 4.1 binding p55-saturated alkali-stripped membranes: p55 (500 μg/ml) (75 μl/well) was incubated with microtiter plate-bound alkali-stripped membranes overnight at 4°C, prior to the addition of protein 4.1.RESULTSProtein 4.1-GPC/D InteractionIn a previous report we provided evidence for a direct interaction between protein 4.1 and the region of GPC corresponding to amino acid residues 82-98(14Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Mawby W.J. Reid M.E. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the recent report showing that Leach phenotype membranes and membranes from individuals with protein 4.1 deficiency lack an additional protein, p55(15Alloisio N. Dalla Vanezia N. Rana A. Andrabi K. Texier P. Gilsanz F. Cartron J.-P. Delauney J. Chishti A.H. Blood. 1993; 82: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raised the possibility that p55 might be a contaminant of protein 4.1 preparations from normal erythrocytes and thereby influence protein 4.1 binding assays of the type described in our earlier study. Examination of protein 4.1 preparations from normal erythrocytes with anti-p55, either by ELISA or by immunoblotting, showed a small amount of p55 (approximately 5%, data not shown) and so the experiments were repeated with protein 4.1 preparations from normal cells which were demonstrably free of p55 (see Fig. 1 and “Materials and Methods”). Peptide GPC-3 bound directly to these purified protein 4.1 preparations (Fig. 2A) and completely inhibited their binding to alkali-stripped normal membranes (Fig. 2B), confirming that, under the conditions of this assay, protein 4.1 binds directly to GPC-3.Figure 2:A, binding of synthetic peptides to protein 4.1.

Indeed, purified p55 (Fig. 1) binds to protein 4.1 in a concentration-dependent, saturable (48 μg of p55/mg of protein 4.1) manner, with high affinity (Kd = 1.27 ± 0.17 nM) (Fig. 3) and also binds saturably (63 μg of p55/mg of membrane protein) and with high affinity (Kd = 4.54 ± 0.13 nM) to alkali-stripped normal membranes (Fig. 4A).

Chung A. Reid M.E. Gratzer W.B. Blood. 1993; 82: 3482-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When unstripped normal membranes are trypsin-treated, only 88%± 4% (n = 6) GPC is cleaved while 100% (n = 6) GPC is cleaved when stripped normal membranes are digested with trypsin. The ability of p55 to block the trypsin cleavage site on GPC was demonstrated by incubating p55 with alkali-stripped normal membranes prior to trypsin digestion. Under these conditions, only 43%± 6% (n = 3) GPC was cleaved.In an attempt to localize the p55 binding site on GPC, we investigated the ability of GPC peptides to bind to purified p55. The results (Fig. 4B) clearly show a concentration-dependent binding of GPC-1 to p55. The binding was saturable at 16 μg of GPC-1/mg of p55. This compares with a theoretical value of 22 μg/mg p55, assuming one GPC-1 binding site per molecule of p55. Some binding of the other peptides was observed, but this was consistently much lower than that of GPC-1. Further, GPC-1 can totally inhibit p55 binding to alkali-stripped normal membranes, while GPC-2 and GPC-3 have no effect (data not shown).Taken together, these results indicate that p55 binds to the extreme C-terminal region of GPC.GPC/D Independent Membrane Attachment Sites for Protein 4.1In our previous paper(14Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Mawby W.J. Reid M.E. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we reported low levels of protein 4.1 binding to alkali-stripped Leach phenotype membranes (approximately 20% of normal). Since these membranes lack GPC/D and p55, additional membrane binding sites for protein 4.1 must exist. Band 3 and GPA have been postulated as protein 4.1 binding sites(4Pasternack G.R. Anderson R.A.

To determine whether these sites are utilized, Leach phenotype stripped membranes were subjected to trypsin cleavage, which destroys the N-terminal domain of band 3, while only having a mild effect on the cytoplasmic domain of GPA (15% reduction) (as determined by monoclonal antibodies to the cytoplasmic domains of band 3 (BRIC 169) and GPA (BRIC 163) data not shown). Trypsin treatment destroyed all protein 4.1 binding to alkali-stripped Leach phenotype membranes, suggesting that band 3 rather than GPA is a binding site for protein 4.1. This finding is supported by the failure of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the entire cytoplasmic domain of GPA to inhibit binding of protein 4.1 to alkali-stripped Leach phenotype membranes and absence of binding of this peptide to purified protein 4.1 (data not shown).Localization of Membrane Binding Sites on Protein 4.1To identify the protein 4.1 domain(s) involved in binding to the membrane, chymotryptic fragments of protein 4.1 were separated (as described under “Materials and Methods”), and their ability to bind GPC, p55, and band 3 was examined. Fragments containing the 30-kDa domain were able to bind to p55 (Fig. 5A) as well as to alkali-stripped normal membranes (Fig. 5B), while those lacking the 30-kDa domain were unable to bind. Thus, the membrane binding sites for GPC, p55, and band 3 appear to be located on the same domain.Figure 5:Binding of chymotrypsin-digested protein 4.1 to p55 (A) and alkali-stripped (B) normal membranes.

While there was no inhibition of binding to p55 (data not shown), binding to alkali-stripped Leach phenotype membranes was completely inhibited (Fig. 6). These results indicate that there are two distinct membrane binding sites on protein 4.1, one binds GPC-3 and band 3, while the other binds p55.Figure 6:Inhibition of protein 4.1 binding to alkali-stripped Leach membranes.

Determination of protein 4.1 binding to untreated and trypsin-treated alkali-stripped normal membranes which have been incubated previously with saturating quantities of p55 provides a means of determining the relative contribution of protein 4.1 binding sites on p55 and GPC-3, respectively. Interpretation of these experiments is possible because trypsin treatment destroys GPC independent protein 4.1 binding sites (see above) and because p55 binds, exclusively, to a trypsin-sensitive site at the extreme C terminus of GPC (see above).Protein 4.1 binding to trypsin-treated membranes (GPC-3 sites) represents 55% of the total binding; protein 4.1 binding in the absence of p55 (band 3 + GPC-3 sites), 72% (Fig. 7; Table 1). A direct measure of the protein 4.1 binding to p55 was obtained by determining the amount of GPC-3-saturated protein 4.1 bound to p55-saturated alkali-stripped membranes. The expected value of 27% was obtained (Fig. 7; Table 1).Figure 7:Binding of protein 4.1 to alkali-stripped normal membranes.

Biochemistry. 1988; 276: 614-619Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) all being implicated. Under the conditions of the experiments reported in this paper, we find no significant binding to either glycophorin A or the lipid bilayer (all GPC independent binding is trypsin-sensitive). However, we provide evidence that protein 4.1 binds to alkali-stripped normal erythrocyte membranes through at least three distinct sites. Two sites are located on GPC/D, one is a direct interaction involving residues 82-98 of GPC, and the other an indirect interaction, mediated by p55. The third binding site is most likely located on the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the anion transport protein band 3 (syn AE-1). Under the conditions of our assay, the proportion of protein 4.1 occupying each of these sites is approximately 55% directly to GPC, 28% through p55, and 17% through band 3 (Table 1). Estimation of the dissociation constants for these interactions suggest that binding through p55 is of higher affinity (Kd for GPC-p55 of 4.54 nM and for p55-protein 4.1 of 2.5 nM) than interactions involving GPC-protein 4.1 (Kd = 0.125 μM) and band 3 (Kd = 0.11 μM). The measurement of the Kd for the GPC-protein 4.1 interaction is lower in this study than that reported previously(14Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Mawby W.J. Reid M.E. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be attributable to p55 contamination in the protein 4.1 preparations used in the earlier study. It is interesting to note that Pasternack et al.(4Pasternack G.R. Anderson R.A. Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3676-3683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) obtained similar high Kd values using protein 4.1 prepared by the method of Tyler et al.(23Tyler J.M. Hargreaves W. Branton D.

INTRODUCTIONBloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei are tsetsetransmitted pathogenic protozoa that live in the blood and body fluids of the mammalian host. In these parasites, the predominant nonpolar lipids are cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, fatty acids, and triglycerides. Among phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin are the most abundant(1Carroll M. McCrorie P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 83: 647-651Google Scholar, 2Doering T.L. Pessin M.S. Hoff E.F. Hart G.W. Raben D.M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9215-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, bloodstream forms of T. brucei are incapable of de novo lipid synthesis(3Dixon H. Ginger C.D. Williamson J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1971; 398: 247-266Google Scholar, 4Dixon H. Ginger C.D.

Instead, they critically depend for their rapid growth on the presence in the culture medium of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) ( 1The abbreviations used are: LDLlow density lipoproteinBSAbovine serum albuminDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumTLCthin layer chromatographyHDLhigh density lipoprotein. )particles(6Coppens I.

Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Upon endocytosis of LDL particles at the flagellar pocket, apoprotein B-LDL is rapidly degraded by thiol protease(s) acting at acidic pH(10Coppens I. Baudhuin P. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence suggests that the receptor is recycled (10Coppens I. Baudhuin P. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and can be up-regulated upon sterol deprivation(12Coppens I. Bastin P. Levade T. Courtoy P.-J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).While the fate of apoprotein B-LDL taken up by T. brucei is now well established, that of LDL-associated lipids remains to be characterized, in order to clarify the mode of lipid acquisition and to validate the hypothesis that these parasites avidly take up LDL particles to satisfy their lipid requirements.In this paper, we have inserted [3H]sphingomyelin and [3H]cholesteryl oleate into LDL particles to study the mechanism of acquisition and the metabolic fate of these lipids. In order to confirm the role of LDL as source of exogenous phospholipids and cholesterol, we blocked receptor-mediated endocytosis of radiolabeled LDL by unlabeled LDL or by anti-LDL receptor antibodies, and we interfered with lysosomal degradation and lipid metabolism using chloroquine and the thiol protease inhibitor, leupeptin. The activity of key acidic hydrolytic enzymes was also measured. The ability to esterify sterols was also compared in the bloodstream forms and the culture-adapted procyclic form (insect stage) of T. brucei, which differ in their capacity of lipid biosynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals[1α,2α-3H]Cholesteryl oleate (36 mCi/mmol) and [9,10-3H]oleic acid (10 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp.

Lipoprotein-depleted calf or rabbit serum was obtained by centrifugation after the density was increased to 1.215 g/ml(15Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6460) Google Scholar).Culture-adapted procyclic trypomastigotes of T. brucei (hereafter often referred to for convenience as procyclic forms) were cultured at 28°C in medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS(16Brün R. Schönenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 286-292Google Scholar), collected from an exponentially growing population and seeded at 106 cells/ml in either lipoprotein-depleted FCS or lipoprotein-depleted rabbit serum. Rat-1 cells were seeded at 50,000/cm2 Petri dish and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS at 37°C, under 5% CO2.All incubations were performed at 106 parasites/ml (about 108 cells, i.e. 1 mg of cell protein/assay). For metabolic labeling, bloodstream forms (37°C), procyclic forms (28°C), and Rat-1 cells (37°C) were incubated with the radioactive precursor at the indicated temperature and then centrifuged and submitted to lipid extraction.A polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against the purified LDL receptor of bloodstream forms of T. brucei was prepared as described previously(6Coppens I. Baudhuin P. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6753-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Both preimmune and immune rabbit sera were depleted of lipoproteins as above. The concentration of 10% (v/v) antiserum in the culture medium corresponded to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer of 1:2,000 against LDL receptor preparation. Synvinolin was added from stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide, with a final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration of 0.2% (v/v). Cholesterol was added from stock solutions in ethanol, with a final ethanol concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Controls contained identical solvent concentrations.LDL ParticlesLDL particles were isolated from fresh human plasma as described(17Poumay Y. Ronveaux-Dupal M.F. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 26: 1476-1480Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Proteins were radiolabeled with 125I by means of iodine monochloride(18McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Specific radioactivity of 125I-labeled LDL was measured in a γ-counter (LKB) and was 100-800 cpm/ng of apoprotein B. LDL particles were kept at 4°C and used within 2 weeks after isolation.Preparation of LDL-associated Lipids[3H]Sphingomyelin stored in chloroform/methanol (2:1) was dried under a nitrogen stream, resolubilized in 50 μl of ethanol, and mixed with 10 ml of filtered fresh human plasma(19Levade T. Tempesta M.-C. Salvayre R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After incubation for 12 h at 37°C, LDL particles were isolated as described above. Specific radioactivity of LDL-associated [3H]sphingomyelin was 80-100 dpm/ng of apoprotein B.[3H]Cholesteryl oleate stored in toluene was similarly dried, resolubilized in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and mixed with 30 ml of plasma for 12 h at 37°C. Specific radioactivity of LDL-associated [3H]cholesteryl oleate was 0.9-1.2 dpm/ng of apoprotein B.Association of LDL Particles to CellsBloodstream forms of trypanosomes were incubated at 4°C (binding experiments) or at 37°C (uptake experiments) with various concentrations of radioactive LDL. At the indicated times, cells were washed at 4°C, twice with PBS-Ca2+ (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 3.6 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4, at pH 7.4) containing 1% (w/v) BSA and then twice with PBS-Ca2+ alone. Washed cells were lysed in 1 ml of 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, pH 11.3. Protein content and radioactivity were determined. Cell-associated LDL was expressed as the amount of apoprotein/mg of cell protein. The binding parameters were determined by nonlinear least-square fitting on specific binding values using the Systat package.LDL-[3H]Sphingomyelin and LDL-[3H]Cholesteryl Oleate MetabolismTrypanosomes were incubated with LDL-associated [3H]sphingomyelin or LDL-associated [3H]cholesteryl oleate, collected by centrifugation, and washed as described above. An aliquot was removed for protein determination(20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After lipid extraction in chloroform/methanol (2:1)(21Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the chloroform layer was separated from the aqueous layer by centrifugation, evaporated under nitrogen, and resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1). To study sphingomyelin metabolism, lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica TLC plates using chloroform/methanol/water (100:42:6) as first solvent until the two thirds of the length of the plate, and then in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (96:1:4) as second solvent until the top of the plate. Alternatively, to study the metabolism of [3H]cholesteryl oleate, lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography using hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1) as solvent. Bands were cut, and their radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters, used as internal standards, were run in parallel and visualized by iodine vapor.[14C]Oleate Incorporation into Lipids[14C]Oleic acid in hexane was dried under nitrogen and resolubilized in 150 mM NaCl containing 15 mM nonradioactive sodium oleate in complex with 7% BSA (fraction V). Ten μl of [14C]oleate-albumin solution was added per ml of culture medium. At the indicated times, trypanosomes were collected by centrifugation, while Rat-1 cells were harvested by scraping and washed thrice with PBS. An aliquot was removed for protein determination. After lipid extraction as described above, lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography using hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1) as solvent, were compared with internal standards, and were measured as above.In Vitro Enzyme AssaysCell pellets of bloodstream forms of T. brucei were homogenized in water by sonication (3 × 10 s) using a Soniprep 150 probe sonicator (50 watts). Acid sphingomyelinase activity was determined at pH 5.0 in the presence of 5 mM EDTA using [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (DuPont NEN) as substrate as described previously(22Levade T. Salvayre R. Douste-Blazy L. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 1762-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Acid lipase activity was measured at pH 4.0 with [9,10-3H]triolein (DuPont NEN) as described(23Nègre A. Salvayre R. Durand P. Lenoir G. Douste-Blazy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 794: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).RESULTSAcquisition by Bloodstream Forms of LDL-associated SphingomyelinThe phospholipid selected for incorporation into LDL particles was sphingomyelin that normally represents ∼25% of phospholipids in LDL particles(24Jackson R.L. Morrisett J.D. Gotto A.M. Physiol. Rev. 1976; 56: 259-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). When bloodstream forms were incubated at 4°C with LDL-associated [3H]sphingomyelin, binding reached an equilibrium after 6-12 h. It was strongly competed for by an excess of nonlabeled LDL particles and almost blocked by the addition of antibodies directed against the LDL receptor of T. brucei (Fig. 1). The uptake of [3H]sphingomyelin-LDL was much higher at 37°C, indicating that endocytosis took place (Fig. 2). Saturation of binding or uptake of [3H]sphingomyelin-LDL and 125I-labeled apoprotein B-LDL also paralleled each other. Indeed, in experiments with [3H]sphingomyelin-LDL, Kd is estimated at 380 ± 50 nM and Bmax at 22,100 ± 720 LDL binding sites/cell. In experiments with 125I-labeled apoprotein B-LDL, Kd is estimated at 430 ± 80 nM and Bmax at 26,300 ± 110 LDL binding sites/cell. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the uptake of LDL associated-sphingomyelin depends on LDL receptors.Figure 2Comparison of binding and uptake of [3H]sphingomyelin-LDL or 125I-labeled apoprotein B-LDL. Bloodstream forms were incubated in DMEM plus 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-depleted FCS, with the indicated concentrations of [3H]sphingomyelin-LDL (A) or 125I-labeled apoprotein B-LDL (B) for 24 h, either at 37°C (•) or 4°C (○). After washing, cell-associated radioactivity was measured and expressed as ng of apoprotein/mg of cell protein (means ± S.D., n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Metabolism of Sphingomyelin-LDL in Bloodstream FormsWe next examined whether, like in mammalian cells, sphingomyelin is rapidly metabolized in T. brucei by a lysosomal sphingomyelinase yielding ceramide that can be further hydrolyzed into sphingosine and fatty acids. Because the sphingomyelin was radiolabeled on the ceramide moiety, we were able to explore the incorporation of the liberated fatty acids into phospholipids, triacylglycerols, or cholesteryl esters.When bloodstream forms were incubated for 24 h at 37°C with LDL-associated [3H]sphingomyelin, various radiolabeled metabolites were indeed detected (Fig. 3). The exogenous sphingomyelin was first split into ceramide (already seen within 2 h, not shown), and then fatty acids were generated that were further incorporated into phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl esters. The proportion of the two latter increased with time, while the peak of ceramide remained fairly constant, as is the case for mammalian cells (19Levade T. Tempesta M.-C. Salvayre R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An acid sphingomyelinase activity could be detected in T. brucei extracts corresponding to 66 pmol of phosphocholine released/h/mg of cell protein in the bloodstream forms and to 6 pmol/h/mg of cell protein in the procyclics (means of duplicates). The breakdown of sphingomyelin was blocked when trypanosomes were incubated in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors, such as leupeptin (Fig. 3) or chloroquine (not shown). Inhibition by leupeptin strongly suggests that, despite the fact that sphingomyelin is inserted into the LDL shell, apoprotein B degradation is a prerequisite for sphingomyelinase to act on its substrate; inhibition by chloroquine indicates that both events take place in the lysosomal compartment.Figure 3Analysis of radioactive lipids after endocytosis of [3H]sphingomyelin-LDL. Bloodstream forms were incubated in DMEM plus 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-depleted FCS supplemented with 15 μg/ml of LDL containing [3H]sphingomyelin, in the absence (○) or in the presence of 50 μg/ml of leupeptin (•) for 24 h at 37°C. After lipid extraction, the cellular content of [3H]sphingomyelin, [3H]phosphatidylcholine, [3H]ceramide, and cholesteryl [3H]esters were determined by TLC and identified by co-migration of the corresponding standards. The prominent peak represented nonmetabolized sphingomyelin. Data are from a representative experiment out of two, with < 5% variation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Acquisition by Bloodstream Forms of LDL-associated Cholesteryl OleateUptake of LDL-associated [3H]cholesteryl oleate by bloodstream forms was saturable (Fig. 4A). As for [3H]sphingomyelin-LDL, uptake of [3H]cholesteryl oleate-LDL at 37°C was much higher than at 4°C, was specifically blocked by anti-LDL receptor antibodies, and could be competed for by unlabeled LDL in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating receptor-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 5).Figure 4Uptake of [3H]cholesteryl oleate-LDL and effect of LDL-associated cholesterol on [14C]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters. A, bloodstream forms were incubated at 37°C in DMEM plus 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-depleted FCS supplemented with the indicated concentrations of LDL-associated [3H]cholesteryl oleate for 24 h. After washing, cell-associated radioactivity was measured and expressed as ng of apoprotein/mg of cell protein. The experiments were repeated twice with <10% variation. B, bloodstream forms were incubated at 37°C in DMEM plus 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-depleted FCS containing the indicated concentrations of LDL. After 17 h of incubation, 0.1 mM [14C]oleate was added, and the cells were harvested 1 h later. After lipid extraction, the cellular content of cholesteryl [14C]esters was determined. Experiments were made in duplicate with less than 15% variation. The 100% values corresponded to 1,029 ng/mg of cell protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Specificity of capture of [3H]cholesteryl oleate-LDL. Bloodstream forms were incubated at 37 or 4°C for 24 h in DMEM plus 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-depleted preimmune serum with 10 μg/ml of LDL-associated [3H]cholesteryl oleate. Other trypanosomes were incubated at 37°C for 24 h in DMEM with the same concentration of ligand, together with either 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-depleted antiserum anti-LDL receptor, the indicated molar excess of unlabeled LDL, or a 100-fold molar excess of BSA. After washing, cell-associated radioactivity was measured and expressed as ng of apoprotein/mg of cell protein (means ± S.D., n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Metabolism of Cholesteryl Oleate-LDL in Bloodstream FormsWe further examined whether, like in mammalian cells, cholesteryl oleate is rapidly hydrolyzed into cholesterol by a lysosomal acid lipase. In mammalian cells, cholesterol then diffuses across the lysosomal membrane into the cytoplasm and is used for membrane biosynthesis or is reesterified with fatty acids by a cytosolic acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase. When required, esters of cholesterol are hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterases(25Goldstein J.L. Dana S.E. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4288-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).To study the metabolism of cholesteryl esters included in LDL particles (70% of the cholesterol) by T. brucei, bloodstream forms were incubated at 4°C or 37°C, in the presence of LDL-[3H]cholesteryl oleate. At 4°C, a temperature preventing endocytosis, no radioactive cholesterol was produced by T. brucei from radioactive cholesteryl esters (Table 1). At 37°C, free radioactive cholesterol was released, the proportion of which increased with time until about 6 h. Whereas the absolute uptake of [3H]cholesteryl oleate increased with external concentration, the fraction of cholesterol released was independent of influx, indicating that lipase activity was not rate-limiting. Upon longer exposures, a constant fraction (∼25%) of esters was found. This constant fraction of cholesteryl oleate may either reflect an equilibrium between LDL endocytosis and degradation, or represent reesterification of [3H]cholesterol into [3H]cholesteryl esters.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Leupeptin or chloroquine totally abrogated cholesterol release, indicating that LDL proteolysis is a prerequisite and that hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters involves a lysosomal lipase (Table 1). An acid lipase activity was measurable in T. brucei extracts corresponding to 1,055 pmol of oleic acid released/h/mg of cell protein in the bloodstream forms and to 263 pmol/h/mg of cell protein in the procyclics (means of duplicates).Synthesis of Cholesteryl Esters in Bloodstream and Procyclic FormsBloodstream forms readily incorporated exogenous [14C]oleate conjugated to albumin into cholesteryl [14C]oleate (Table 2). The rate of synthesis of esters of cholesterol was comparable with that found in Rat-1 cells cultured under the same conditions and represented ∼4% of the total radioactivity incorporated into lipids.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Like free cholesterol, LDL provided substrate for cholesterol esterification in the bloodstream forms. Esterification of [14C]oleate into cholesteryl esters leveled off at LDL concentrations that saturate the LDL receptors of T. brucei bloodstream forms (Fig. 4B) but was linear up to 100 μM of exogenously added cholesterol, the latter being able to freely diffuse across membranes (not shown).Exogenous LDL-cholesterol, rather than endogenously synthesized sterol, stimulated the esterification of sterols in procyclic forms (Fig. 6). In contrast to the bloodstream forms, culture-adapted procyclics can grow in the absence of extracellular lipoproteins, but the incorporation of [14C]oleate into steryl esters, was then nearly undetectable. On the other hand, the synthesis of steryl esters was readily detected when this form was cultured with LDL and was markedly inhibited by the addition of antibodies directed against the LDL receptors, confirming the requirement of LDL endocytosis. Leupeptin made cholesterol totally inaccessible as substrate for esterification. Synvinolin, a specific inhibitor of the 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, which inhibits the sterol production in procyclics (12Coppens I. Bastin P. Levade T. Courtoy P.-J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) only slightly reduced the formation of esters of sterol in procyclics grown in the presence of LDL-cholesterol. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that, also in procyclics, esterification depends on exogenous cholesterol delivered by receptor-mediated endocytosis.Figure 6Incorporation of [14C]oleate into steryl esters in culture-adapted procyclic forms of T. brucei. Procyclic forms were incubated at 28°C in medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS (control), 10% (v/v) lipoprotein-depleted nonimmune serum, 10% (v/v) lipoproteincontaining antiserum anti-LDL receptor, 10% (v/v) FCS plus 50 μg/ml of leupeptin, 10% (v/v) FCS plus 12.5 μM synvinolin. After 17 h of incubation, 0.1 mM [14C]oleate was added, and the cells were harvested 1 h later. After lipid extraction, the cellular content of steryl [14C]esters was determined (means ± S.D., n = 3). The 100% value corresponded to 770 ng/mg of cell protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe incapacity of bloodstream forms of T. brucei to synthesize sterol and fatty acids implies uptake from plasma, more precisely from lipid-protein complexes, since sterols and fatty acids do not circulate in a free form in the plasma. The avid uptake of LDL particles by trypanosomes (clearance of 3 orders of magnitude higher than for fluid endocytosis)(8Coppens I. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Baudhuin P. J. Protozool. 1987; 34: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), further indicates that their contribution to lipid supply must be prevailing. Indeed, the level of receptor-mediated uptake of mammalian LDL by T. brucei bloodstream forms, at the concentrations found in the host plasma, appears sufficient to fulfill the cholesterol requirement of the parasite(12Coppens I. Bastin P. Levade T. Courtoy P.-J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69:"
https://openalex.org/W2092386839,"The first intron (intron I) of the human factor IX gene, which has been previously suggested of having an expression-augmenting activity, was systematically studied for its potential enhancer activity. When tested with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression vector with a minimal factor IX promoter, subregions of intron I showed only marginal enhancing activities (1.7-1.9-fold enhancement at the highest). Smaller subregions encompassing nucleotides 5660-6350 of the intron sequence even showed some weak negative regulatory activities (∼50% suppression at the highest), while a cytomegalovirus enhancer sequence, which was used as the positive control, had a 7-fold enhancement. A set of three factor IX minigene expression vectors with the same factor IX promoter were then constructed: p-416FIXc which contained the factor IX cDNA, p-416FIXm1 which contained the factor IX cDNA with a largely truncated intron I, and p-416FIXm2 which contained the factor IX cDNA with the intron I sequence further truncated. The p-416FIXm1 and p-416FIXm2 constructs showed 7-9-fold higher expression activities than p-416FIXc. The elevated factor IX antigen levels agreed well with the grossly elevated factor IX clotting activity and mRNA levels. These results indicate that the expression enhancing activity of intron I is not due to specific enhancer elements present in the intron subsequences, but is due to functional splicing sequences present in the precursor mRNAs produced from the minigene constructs containing intron I. By being efficiently assembled into spliceosome complexes, transcripts with splicing sequences may be better protected in the nucleus from random degradations than those without such sequences.

In this study, the transgene construct containing only the factor IX cDNA expressed factor IX at a non-detectable level, while factor IX minigenes containing either all eight introns with various truncations of their middle portions or only intron I expressed factor IX at a level equivalent to or substantially higher than that of the intact factor IX gene. The liver specificity was maintained in these minigene expressions. The study suggests that such enhancer-like activity of the intron I sequence may be due 1) to enhancer elements present in intron I, particularly in the intron I sequence with its middle 4.8-kb portion deleted out of the intact 6.2-kb sequence, 2) to the presence of legitimate splicing sequences (donor, acceptor, and branch sites), or 3) to a possible combination of these two or other unknown mechanisms. The study, however, was not extended to determine the responsible mechanism underlying the observed enhancer-like activity. In this paper, we report our systematic analyses of the human factor IX intron I using a cultured cell assay system, which support the conclusion that higher levels of expression of factor IX from the minigene constructs are due to the presence of splicing sequences in intron I, and not due to the presence of various enhancer-like sequence elements within the intron.

The DNA sequencing kit was purchased from United States Biochemical Corp. The supplies for ELISA were from Bio-Rad. Mouse monoclonal anti-human factor IX (AHIX-5041) was purchased from Hematology Technologies Inc. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human factor IX used for ELISA was described previously(11Yao S.-N.

CAT expression vector pUMS-416/29CAT, which was previously constructed and successfully used to analyze the 5′-end-flanking sequence of the factor IX gene for its promoter activity(3Salier J.-P.

A. 1990; 87: 4421-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was used in this study for testing the potential enhancer-like effects present in the intron I sequence with its middle portion deleted (Fig. 1). DNA fragments containing various subregions of the intron sequence were generated by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) with the human genomic DNA template using primers containing the KpnI linker sequence (Table 1). After digestion with KpnI, these fragments were subcloned into pUMS-416/29CAT at its unique KpnI site (158 bp 5′ to the factor IX promoter) in the UMS (mouse upper sequence containing multiple polyadenylation signal sequences)(3Salier J.-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCRs were carried out as described previously (9Kurachi S. Furukawa M. Salier J.-P. Wu C.-T. Wilson E. French F. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1580-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. DNA fragments prepared by PCR were purified by using Ultrafree-MC Filters (Millipore) before they were inserted into pUMS-416/29CAT. The positive control expression vector for enhancer activity, pUMS(CMV)-416/29CAT, was constructed by inserting a 382-bp CMV enhancer sequence into pUMS-416/29CAT at the KpnI site in UMS. This enhancer corresponding to a 5′-end region spanning nt −584 to nt −217 of the CMV promoter (13Boshart M. Weber F. Jahn G. Korsch-Hasler K. Fleckenstein B. Schaffner W. Cell. 1985; 41: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) was prepared by PCR amplification with pRc/CMV.Table I Open table in a new tab Three new human factor IX minigene expression vectors, p-416FIXc, p-416FIXm1, and p-416FIXm2 were constructed with pUC19 (Fig. 2). These vectors contained the minimal transcriptional control region of the human factor IX gene identical to that used in the above CAT vectors, linked to either one of the three factor IX minigenes, −416FIXc, −416FIXm1, or −416FIXm2. p-416FIXc, which contains the human factor IX cDNA, was prepared by ligating two DNA fragments. The first, a 485-bp fragment encompassing a region of nt −416 to nt 69 (the unique StuI site at nt 69 in exon I) was the minimal factor IX promoter sequence prepared by StuI digestion of a PstI/KpnI fragment encompassing nt −416 to nt 650 (which was generated from the genomic DNA template by PCR using a 5′-primer with PstI linker and a 3′-primer with KpnI linker). The second fragment was a 1466-bp StuI/BamHI fragment (containing the same StuI site at nt 69 at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end) which was prepared by StuI and BamHI digestion of the factor IX cDNA sequence in pFIX/pD2 (14Busby S. Kumar A. Joseph M. Halpap L. Insley M. Berkner K. Kurachi K. Woodbury R. Nature. 1985; 316: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). pFIX/pD2, a factor IX expression vector, contained the human factor IX cDNA sequence as a BamHI fragment which was modified from the original factor IX cDNA clone(15Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and the adenovirus 2 major late promoter(14Busby S. Kumar A. Joseph M. Halpap L. Insley M. Berkner K. Kurachi K. Woodbury R. Nature. 1985; 316: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The fragment resulting from the ligation of the above two fragments, which contained the factor IX promoter sequence (up to nt −416 at the 5′-side) linked to a factor IX cDNA sequence (FIXc) encompassing the entire coding region and 29-bp 3′-UTR, was then ligated at its 3′-BamHI end with the 5′-BamHI end of a 380-bp BamHI/PstI fragment encompassing nt 32691-33071. This BamHI/PstI fragment was prepared by PCR amplification with the genomic DNA template using a 5′-primer containing a BamHI linker and a 3′-primer containing a PstI linker. The genomic sequence region amplified contained the polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) sequence as well as the polyadenylation site at nt 32757, in addition to its contiguous 314-bp 3′-flanking sequence. The resulting 2289-bp fragment −416FIXc was subcloned into pUC19 vector at the PstI site in an orientation with its 5′- and 3′-ends in close proximity to the SphI and KpnI sites in the pUC19 vector sequence, respectively. PCR-amplified regions and fragment ligation sites were sequenced before further use. The second expression vector p-416FIXm1, which contained a factor IX minigene with the intron I sequence with its middle 4.8-kb region deleted, was constructed by sequential ligations of five DNA fragments. All the DNA manipulations were done by utilizing pUC19. The first three fragments included (i) PstI/XmnI fragment (809 bp) encompassing nt −416 to nt 393 (the first XmnI site in intron I), which was generated by XmnI digestion of a PCR-amplified fragment (PstI linker at the 5′-end) encompassing nt −416 to nt 650; (ii) XmnI/PvuII fragment encompassing nt 394 (XmnI site in intron I) to nt 1098 (the first PvuII site in intron I) prepared by digestion of a PCR-amplified fragment (nt 98-1312) with XmnI and PvuII; (iii) PvuII/HaeIII fragment spanning from nt 5882 (the last PvuII site in intron I) to nt 6365 (HaeIII site in exon II) prepared by PvuII and HaeIII digestion of a PCR-amplified fragment (spanning from nt 5660 to 6385). Ligation of these three fragments into pUC19 in the sequential order listed above resulted in a 1997-bp factor IX sequence linked to a PstI linker at the 5′-end, and a HaeIII restriction sequence corresponding to the endogenous HaeIII site in exon II. This fragment encompassed a region of nt −416 to nt 6365 with its middle portion (nt 1099-5881, 4783 bp in length) of the intron I sequence deleted. This fragment was isolated from the pUC19 vector by digestion with SphI (which cuts pUC19 sequence just outside of the 5′-PstI site of the factor IX sequence) and HaeIII, and then ligated to a HaeIII/BamHI fragment generated by digestion of p-416FIXc with HaeIII and BamHI, containing the 3′-half of exon II beginning with the unique HaeIII site and the rest of the cDNA sequence with the BamHI site at the 3′-end. The resulting SphI/BamHI fragment was then inserted into p-416FIXc at SphI/BamHI sites, replacing the −416FIXc insert freed by SphI and BamHI digestion, finally generating a factor IX minigene expression vector p-416FIXm1 with a 3714-kb factor IX minigene (FIXm1) containing 981 and 443 bp sequences of the 5′- and 3′-end regions of intron I, respectively. The third factor IX minigene expression vector p-416FIXm2 was prepared by further deleting the middle portion of the largely truncated intron I sequence of p-416FIXm1. p-416FIXm1 was subjected to a partial digestion with ScaI. A construct digested only at two unique ScaI sites (nt 258 and 6168) within the intron I sequence maintained in FIXm1, but not digested at a ScaI site present in the pUC19 vector sequence, was screened by restriction mappings. This construct which contained only 141- and 157-bp sequences of the 5′- and 3′-end region of intron I, respectively, was then self-ligated generating the third factor IX minigene expression vector, p-416FIXm2. All expression vector DNAs including CAT vectors, factor IX minigene expression vectors, and pCH110 (internal control for transfection efficiency) used for transient assays were purified by passing through Qiagen-tip anion-exchange resin columns (16Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and carried out as described previously(9Kurachi S. Furukawa M. Salier J.-P. Wu C.-T. Wilson E. French F. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1580-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Transient assays of expression vectors with HepG2 cells were carried out as described before (3Salier J.-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hirosawa S. Fahner J. Salier J.-P. Wu C.-T. Lovrien E. Kurachi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4421-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using a high efficiency CaPO4-DNA precipitation method(17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar, 18Chen C. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SV40 promoter of pCH110 used as the internal control for transfection was previously shown to have little effect on the factor IX promoter activity, serving as an excellent internal control for the present study(3Salier J.-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for CAT expression vectors, or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% barium sulfate-treated fetal calf serum (19Yao S.-N. Kurachi K. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 525-526Google Scholar) and 1 μg of vitamin K (12Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) for factor IX expression vectors. CAT and β-galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously(3Salier J.-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hirosawa S. Fahner J. Salier J.-P. Wu C.-T. Lovrien E. Kurachi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4421-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Seventy-two h after transfection, cells were harvested for CAT and β-galactosidase activity assays. Aliquots (≤100 μl) of the cell lysates, which varied depending on the β-galactosidase activity, were taken for CAT assays, and the Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen) was used to quantitate acetylated forms of chloramphenicol. All the transfection experiments were repeated three to five times, and averages of the results are presented. Factor IX activity was determined by one-stage clotting assay (aPTT) as described before(20Austen D.E.G. Rhymes J.L. Laboratory Manual of Blood Coagulation. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1975: 59-60Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The culture medium was collected 92 h after cell transfection for factor IX assay, and cells were collected for β-galactosidase assay. All assays were performed three times for each sample with two different dilutions in duplicates. The standard curve for the activity quantitation was generated by using pooled normal human plasma (George King Bio-Medical, Inc.). Human factor IX protein was assayed by ELISA as described before(11Yao S.-N. Wilson J.M. Nabel E.G. Kurachi S. Hachiya H.L. Kurachi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8101-8105Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody to human factor IX (AHIX5041) and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-human FIX antibody were used as the first and second antibody, respectively. ELISA was duplicated for each diluted sample, and the reaction products were quantitated at room temperature by reading absorbency at 450 nm with a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, model EL312c). This ELISA system reproducibly detected human FIX antigen as low as 0.2 ng/ml. Pooled normal human plasma was used to prepare a standard curve for quantitation. Northern blot analysis of HepG2 cells transiently transfected with factor IX expression vectors was carried out as described previously(9Kurachi S. Furukawa M. Salier J.-P. Wu C.-T. Wilson E. French F. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1580-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Aliquots (5 μg) of poly(A)+ RNAs, prepared with an oligo(dT) column (FastTrack kit) from about 3 × 107 HepG2 cells transfected with factor IX expression vectors, were used. All other conditions were the same as those mentioned in the cell transfection section, except pUMS-416/29CAT vector was used in the mock control transfection. Factor IX cDNA (14Busby S. Kumar A. Joseph M. Halpap L. Insley M. Berkner K. Kurachi K. Woodbury R. Nature. 1985; 316: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) labeled with 32P was used as the hybridization probe. Quantitation of RNA bands hybridized with the probe was carried out with the Betascope 603 blot analyzer. PCR-amplified subregions of intron I which were tested in this study are summarized in Fig. 3A. In order to include the 5′-splice donor and 3′-acceptor sequences in the analysis, subregion sequences a1, a4, b1, and b2 (which were amplified by PCR) contained parts of the adjacent exon I and II sequences. These subregion fragments were analyzed for their potential enhancer activities by inserting them into a CAT expression vector pUMS-416/29CAT, at the unique KpnI site in the UMS located immediately upstream of the factor IX promoter (Fig. 1). The control CMV enhancer inserted at the KpnI site gave 7-fold enhancement in expression over that of pUMS-416/29CAT which contained no enhancer element at the site, confirming the effectiveness of this vector system for assessing enhancer activity. When the intron sequence containing the entire subregions under testing (fragments a1 + b1) was inserted at the KpnI site, only a weak enhancer activity (1.8-fold increase in CAT activity at the highest) was observed indicating that these sequences have only marginal enhancer activities. Smaller subregion sequences generated from the intron also showed independently only weak enhancer activities or even weak suppressor activities, in good agreement with the overall marginal enhancer activity observed for the a1 + b1 fragment. These results indicate that in spite of the significant numbers of known enhancer-like sequence elements present within the partial intron I sequence under investigation (such as three AP-1s, two AP-3s, one octamer, one NF-A, and possibly others), these structural elements only marginally contribute in enhancing the factor IX expression. The weak enhancer activity associated with the intron I sequence cannot fully explain the increased expression activity observed in the transgenic mice(10Jallat S. Perraud F. Dalemans W. Balland A. Dieterle A. Faure T. Muelien P. Pavirani A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3295-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting a different mechanism to be responsible. In order to further study the underlying mechanism of the enhancing activity of intron I on the factor IX promoter, we then constructed three factor IX expression vectors, p-416FIXc, p-416FIXm1, and p-416FIXm2 (Fig. 2). p-416FIXc contained factor IX cDNA under the transcriptional control of the factor IX minimal promoter. p-416FIXm1 and p-416FIXm2 contained factor IX minigenes FIXm1 or FIXm2 with the middle portion-truncated intron I sequences inserted into FIXc at the identical position as in the natural gene. FIXm1 contained intron I with a 4.8-kb deletion of its middle region spanning nt 1099-5881, while FIXm2 had a greater deletion of intron I sequence, spanning nt 259-6167. Both FIXm1 and FIXm2 contained legitimate splicing sequences (donor, acceptor and branch sites). The factor IX minimal promoter used in these expression vectors included the 5′ immediate-flanking sequence up to nt −416. This factor IX promoter was identical to that used in the CAT expression vectors in testing the intron I subregions for potential activities. p-416FIXm1 and p-416FIXm2 were designed to have exactly the same structure as p-416FIXc, except FIXc in p-416FIXc was replaced with FIXm1 or with FIXm2, respectively. Transient expression of p-416FIXm1 in HepG2 cells produced 88.8 ng of recombinant factor IX into 10 ml of culture medium after 92 h of transfection. This was equivalent to an 8.9-fold higher expression activity over that of p-416FIXc which produced 10.2 ng factor IX in simultaneous experiments (Table 2). The increase in human factor IX antigen secreted into the culture medium with the p-416FIXm1 construct correlated well with the substantial increase (7.4-fold) in the factor IX clotting activity. This increase in activity and factor IX protein levels also agreed with the 7.8-fold increase in the factor IX mRNA level within the experimental variations.Table II Open table in a new tab The mature mRNAs produced by p-416FIXm1 were of the fully spliced form with an expected size of ∼1.8 kb for the minigene (Fig. 4). The actual size may vary slightly depending on the length of poly(A) tail added. The molecular size of this major mRNA band is consistent with the 5′-upstream transcription start site at or in the vicinity of nt −176, but not with the site at nt +1(9Kurachi S. Furukawa M. Salier J.-P. Wu C.-T. Wilson E. French F. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1580-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Some minor bands with lower molecular mass, including one of ∼1 kb in size, are likely generated by minor alternative processings of precursor RNA, but due neither to possible nonspecific cross-hybridization, because they are absent in the control lane, nor to nonspecific degradations, because the bands are highly discrete. As described above, intron I lacks any substantial enhancer activity (Fig. 3, A and B), and all the factor IX minigene constructs used have the identical promoter sequence, ensuring a very similar, if not identical, promoter activity for all these constructs. Consequently, the increase in the mRNA level for p-416FIXm1 construct is highly likely due to the much increased protection of precursor mRNA molecules with an intron sequence from degradation in comparison to those without any intron sequence produced from FIXc. It is speculated that with the presence of legitimate splicing signal sequences, the minigene precursor mRNAs in the nucleus are efficiently recognized and assembled into spliceosome complexes(21Sharp P. Cell. 1994; 77: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 22Rio D.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Lamond A.I. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Sterner D.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2677-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), resulting in an increased protection of the precursor mRNAs from random degradations before being transported out of the nucleus, and consequently in an elevated level of the mature mRNAs. This conclusion was further supported by the results obtained with the third minigene construct, p-416FIXm2. The factor IX minigene in this vector had a much greater deletion of its first intron sequence than that of p-416FIXm1 and contained no known enhancer sequence elements which were still present in FIXm1. p-416FIXm2 showed an equally elevated expression as p-416FIXm1 in comparison to p-416FIXc. These results indicate that any other enhancer elements, if present in the remaining regions, may also have only insignificant activities. They also indicate that the shortening of the intron I sequence did not change the efficiency of intron splicing events. It has been known for other genes that splicing sequences augment their expression with various mechanisms(25Korb M. Ke Y. Johnson L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5901-5908Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Brinster R.L. Allen J.M. Behringer R.R. Gelinas R.E. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The present study demonstrates that intron I of the factor IX gene also has a strong overall expression enhancing activity. However, the augmented expression is not due to specific enhancer elements present in intron I, but rather to the increased precursor mRNA stability mediated by its splicing sequences. It is interesting to note that in transgenic mice experiments, the presence of multiple introns in the factor IX expression vector provided neither synergistic, nor additive enhancing activity above that observed for intron I(10Jallat S. Perraud F. Dalemans W. Balland A. Dieterle A. Faure T. Muelien P. Pavirani A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3295-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This may suggest that the presence of an intron, which happens to be intron I for the factor IX gene constructs used in the present study, is sufficient for an efficient assembly of precursor mRNAs into the spliceosome complex, resulting in increased protection from random degradations. More recently, we also observed that the factor IX minigene construct (FIXm1) in retroviral expression vectors under the control of heterologous promoters also showed a 10-12-fold increase in expression level over that of the factor IX cDNA (FIXc) construct, further supporting the present results. 2S. Kurachi, Y. Hitomi, M. Furukawa, and K. Kurachi, unpublished data. The transgenic mice study reported by Jallat et al.(10) also suggested that intron I as well as all other introns (introns II-VII) may not play any significant role in determination of the liver-specificity of the factor IX gene expression. In their study, a 5-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the factor IX gene was used as the promoter. Our recent transgenic mice study with −416FIXc as well as −416FIXm1 minigene also showed a high (although not exclusive) liver-specific expression.2 These observations together with the high expression activities observed in HepG2 cells for p-416FIXm1 and p-416FIXm2 in the present study support the conclusion that none of the intron sequences in the factor IX gene plays a significant role in the liver specificity of factor IX expression.

https://openalex.org/W1561937096,"Mechanisms and pathways of excess cholesterol removal from intracellular sites of accumulation to extracellular cholesterol acceptors remain poorly defined. To gain further insights, compounds known to affect cellular protein transport pathways were tested for their effects on high density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated cholesterol efflux from cultured cells enriched with cholesterol. Monensin, nigericin, and brefeldin A inhibited the ability of HDL to decrease cellular cholesterol esterification, stimulate sterol biosynthesis, and promote the efflux of labeled cholesterol and cholesterol mass from fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. HDL-mediated decrease in cell cholesterol esterification was inhibited up to 80% by these compounds compared with control incubations over an HDL concentration of 5-100 μg/ml and up to 18 h of incubation. Up-regulation of sterol biosynthesis after depletion of cell cholesterol by HDL increased over 10-fold; however, inclusion of monensin or brefeldin A during the incubation completely prevented the increase of sterol biosynthesis by HDL. Efflux of [3H]cholesterol to HDL from prelabeled cells was inhibited up to 40% by these compounds, and this effect persisted when cholesterol esterification was blocked. Similarly, monensin and brefeldin A inhibited up to 50% of HDL-mediated cholesterol mass efflux relative to controls. Treatment of cells with cholesterol oxidase demonstrated an increase of intracellular cholesterol after exposure to monensin or nigericin and to a lesser extent with brefeldin A. These data show that monensin, nigericin, and brefeldin A sequester cholesterol from sites normally available for efflux by HDL. Since these compounds act by disruption of Golgi complex structure and function, a role for this intracellular organelle in transport of cholesterol between intracellular sites and the plasma membrane for eventual removal by extracellular acceptors such as HDL is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2107119139,"Species-specific cell reaggregation in the marine sponge Microciona prolifera is mediated by an adhesion proteoglycan. Two interactions are involved in the process: a Ca(2+)-dependent homophilic binding between proteoglycan molecules and a Ca(2+)-independent binding between the molecule and cells. Both interactions are mediated by the glycan moieties of the proteoglycan. The interaction of the proteoglycan with itself has been characterized as a carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction of multiple low affinity sites. The monoclonal antibodies Block 1 and Block 2 raised against the purified aggregation proteoglycan and selected for inhibition of aggregation bind to these glycans. In a previous report the structure, [formula: see text] was assigned to the oligosaccharide reacting with Block 1 antibody (Spillmann, D., Hard, K., Thomas-Oates, J., Vliegenthart, J. F. G., Misevic, G., Burger, M. M., and Finne, J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13378-13387). By the technique of attaching the water-soluble acid-degraded fragments to a lipid carrier for immunochemical detection and by chemical, enzymatic and spectroscopic methods the structure, [formula: see text] was assigned to the oligosaccharide reacting with the aggregation-blocking monoclonal antibody Block 2. The structure, [formula: see text] was assigned to a major nonreactive oligosaccharide, which outlined the molecular requirements of antibody binding of the two aggregation-associated epitopes. These data demonstrate that two different functional sites with distinct structural characteristics and antibody reactivities are involved in the reaggregation of sponge cells, a model of carbohydrate-carbohydrate-mediated cell interactions."

J., Zhang, M., Fernandez, E., Trail, G., Yarnum, B., Yarden, Y., Hunter, T., and Fox, G. M.(1994) Nature 368, 558-560). We now show that B61 can also exist as a cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein that is capable of activating the Eck receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, the first such report of a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase ligand that is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked. In addition, the expression patterns of B61 and Eck during mouse ontogeny were determined by in situ hybridization. Both were found to be highly expressed in the developing lung and gut, while Eck was preferentially expressed in the thymus. Finally, the gene for B61 was localized to a specific position on mouse chromosome 3 by interspecific backcross analysis."

Changes in membrane potential (Vm) and intracellular pH (pHi) were monitored fluorimetrically with the potential sensitive dye bis-oxonol and the pH-sensitive dye tetraacethoxymethyl 2′,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein, respectively. In nominal bicarbonate-free medium (pHe7.4, 28°C), Vm and pHi of Leishmania promastigotes were maintained at −113 ± 4 mV and 6.75 ± 0.02, respectively. In Cl− free (gluconate-based) medium, cells underwent a time-dependent acidification (0.3 pH units) and a long term membrane hyperpolarization (7-10 mV), both of which were greatly enhanced in the presence of the anion blocker, 4,4′-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (H2DIDS). Cells in Cl−-free medium underwent a marked depolarization upon treatment with the H+-ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), but hyperpolarized after repletion with Cl−. In Cl−-depleted cells, replenishment of Cl− led to a H2DIDS-sensitive cytoplasmic alkalinization and a small initial hyperpolarization. Cells exposed either to DCCD or to the H+ uncoupler carbonylcyanide chlorophenylhydrazone caused a marked cytoplasmic acidification and membrane depolarization. In the presence of 25 mM HCO3−, promastigotes maintained an almost neutral cytosol, irrespective of H+ pump action or ionic composition of the medium. The present observations provide evidence for the operation of a DCCD-sensitive electrogenic H+-ATPase which contributes to the maintenance of a highly hyperpolarized plasma membrane in Leishmania promastigotes. H+ pump activity required a parallel pathway of Cl− ions in order to dissipate the pump generated electrical potential. In nominally CO2-free media, the two electrogenic systems are implicated in the maintenance of cell pH and indirectly in electrochemically driven nutrient uptake. In physiological CO2/HCO3−-containing media, the H+ pump and Cl− channel play a role only secondary to that of HCO3− in pHi homeostasis.

Both α and β subunits are synthesized with COOH-terminal domains predicted to be cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and epidermal growth factor-like; these domains are retained in β subunits but are removed from α during maturation. The present studies establish that an inserted 56-amino acid domain (the “I” domain), present in α but not in β, is necessary and sufficient for COOH-terminal proteolytic processing of the α subunit. This was demonstrated by expression of mutant meprin subunits (deletion mutants, chimeric αβ subunits, and β mutants containing the I domain) in COS-1 cells. Mutations of two common processing sites present in the I domain (a dibasic site and a furin site) did not prevent COOH-terminal proteolytic processing, indicating that the proteases responsible for cleavage are distinct from those having these specificities. Deletion of the I domain from the α subunit resulted in accumulation of unprocessed subunits in a preGolgi compartment. Furthermore, COOH-terminal proteolytic processing of wild-type α subunits occurred before acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance. Pulse-chase experiments and expression of an α subunit transcript containing a c-myc epitope tag, confirmed that proteolytic processing at the COOH terminus occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. This work identifies the region of the α subunit that is essential for COOH-terminal processing and demonstrates that the differential processing of the evolutionarily-related subunits of meprin A that results in a structurally unique tetrameric protease begins in the endoplasmic reticulum.

To determine the structural motifs important for modulating the in vivo catabolism of human apoA-I (h-apoA-I), we generated carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants at residues 201 (apoA-I201), 217 (apoA-I217), and 226 (apoA-I226) by site-directed mutagenesis. ApoA-I was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with the maltose binding protein, which was removed by factor Xa cleavage. The in vivo kinetic analysis of the radioiodinated apoA-I in normolipemic rabbits revealed a markedly increased rate of catabolism for the truncated forms of apoA-I. The fractional catabolic rates (FCR) of 9.10 ± 1.28/day (±S.D.) for apoA-I201, 6.34 ± 0.81/day for apoA-I217, and 4.42 ± 0.51/day for apoA-I226 were much faster than the FCR of recombinant intact apoA-I (r-apoA-I, 0.93 ± 0.07/day) and h-apoA-I (0.91 ± 0.34/day).

Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar). These nuclear receptors act as trans-regulators of transcription. Upon binding with their cognate ligands, these hormone-receptor complexes interact with cis-acting DNA elements, termed hormone response elements (HREs), to modulate the transcription of target genes. The functional structure and organization of these receptors comprise a variable N-terminal domain involved in the modulation of gene expression, a well conserved DNA-binding domain with two zinc fingers, and a partially conserved C-terminal ligand-binding domain(2Beato M.

Human testicular receptor 2 (TR2) is one of the first orphan receptors identified that share structural homology with members of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily(3O'Malley B.W.

The TR2 orphan receptor cDNA was isolated from human prostate and testis cDNA libraries with a probe homologous to a highly conserved DNA-binding domain common to steroid hormone receptors. The TR2 orphan receptor cDNA encodes a protein of 603 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons(4Chang C. Kokontis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The expression of the TR2 orphan receptor has been detected in various cell lines and tissues, including the human prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCaP, testis, ventral prostate, and seminal vesical(7Kokontis J. Nakamoto T. Chang C. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Prostate Cancer. Plenum Press, New York1991: 229-234Crossref Google Scholar). The HREs for steroid hormone receptors are structurally related but functionally distinct(8Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Based on the finger model, the first zinc finger in the DNA-binding domain of steroid hormone receptors may determine target HRE specificity. The three amino acids at the C-terminal region of the first zinc finger are categorized as the P (proximal) box, which is important in base interaction. Consequently, HREs can be classified into two main categories of repeat consensus sequences based on the P box, the response element for glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor (ERE)(9Martinez E. Wahli W. Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 125-153Google Scholar). The glucocorticoid response element group, which includes glucocorticoid receptor, AR, progesterone receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor, recognizes AGAACA core consensus half-site. On the other hand, the ERE group, which includes estrogen receptor, T3R, VDR, RAR, RXR, and many orphan receptors, recognizes AGGTCA half-site. In addition, five amino acids localized in the second zinc finger, referred to as D (distal) box, which is important in dimerization contact forming, are involved in half-HRE spacing functional discrimination. These two structural determinants (P and D boxes) of target gene specificity may suggest a pathway for the coevolution of receptor DNA-binding domains and regulatory gene networks(8Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 9Martinez E. Wahli W. Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 125-153Google Scholar). On the basis of P and D box sequences, the TR2 orphan receptor is assigned to the ERE subfamily and predicted to bind to an AGGTCA repeat. Recently, several transcriptional factors from HeLa cell nuclear extracts have been suggested to bind to the transcriptional initiation site of the simian virus 40 major late promoter (SV40-MLP). One of these factors turned out to be the hERR1 orphan receptor(6Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1987; 331: 91-94Crossref Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 10Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Zuo F. Murray E.E. Loritz K. Mertz J.E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2206-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). One of the core sequences within the SV40-MLP was identified as AGGTCA, which could be a potential HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor. We, therefore, developed several strategies to test this hypothesis. Herein this paper is the summary of our results showing the TR2RE within SV40-MLP as the first identified natural HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor. TNT SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system was purchased from Promega. L-[35S]methionine, [14C]chloramphenicol, and 14C-methylated protein standards were obtained from Amersham Corp. [γ-32P]ATP was from DuPont NEN. Acetyl coenzyme A and poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI-dC) were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Synthetic oligonucleotides were either a gift from Dr. J. E. Mertz or made by Bio-Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Restriction enzymes and other modifying enzymes were mainly obtained from New England BioLabs and Promega. All plasmids were constructed by standard recombinant DNA techniques(11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pSPUTK-TR2 contains the full-length coding sequence of the TR2 orphan receptor cDNA with Xenopus β-globin gene 5′-untranslated region under the control of the SP6 promoter in the pSPUTK vector (Stratagene). Plasmid pSG5-TR2 constitutes the TR2 orphan receptor cDNA under the control of the SV40 early promoter in the pSG5 vector (Stratagene) for transient transfection experiments. Plasmid pBL-SVL-CAT consists of the SV40 late promoter without the TR2RE region (SV40 nucleotides 372-385) derived from pSVL-GR (kindly provided by Dr. A. Mizokami) in the pBLCAT3 vector(12Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). On the other hand, plasmid pBL-SVLRE-CAT contains the SV40 late promoter with the TR2RE region and intron of major capsid protein VP1 derived from pSVL (Pharmacia) in the pBLCAT3. Plasmids pSV55wt1 and pSV55mut1 contain one copy of the wild-type TR2RE (SV40 nucleotides 368-389, 5′-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3′) and the mutant TR2RE (SV40 nucleotides 367-389, 5′-CGTTAAGCTTCGTAGCTCATGGA-3′) in the blunted BglII site of the pCAT-promoter plasmid (Promega), respectively. Plasmid pCMV-AR contains the full-length AR cDNA under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter(13Mowszowicz I. Lee H.-J. Chen H.-T. Mestayer C. Portois M.-C. Cabrol S. Mauvais-Jarvis P. Chang C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 861-869PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric AR/TR2/AR plasmid consists of the DNA-binding domain of the TR2 orphan receptor flanked by the N-terminal and androgen-binding domains of AR at both ends(14Lee H.-J. Kokontis J. Wang K.-C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMSG-CAT contains the full-length mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat sequence linked with the CAT gene (Pharmacia). Circular pSPUTK-TR2 plasmid containing the full-length TR2 orphan receptor cDNA was in vitro transcribed and translated simultaneously in rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Depending on the purpose of the experiment, the reactions were performed either with or without [35S]methionine in the transcription-translation mixture. After synthesis, ZnCl2 was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The in vitro translated products were then analyzed directly by either electrophoresis in SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel or electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Plasmid pSG5-TR3 was used to express the TR3 orphan receptor under control of T7 promoter as a negative control in EMSA. DNA-protein binding assay was carried out as previously described(15Talbot S.J. Altman S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Schrader M. Becker-Andre M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6444-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled oligonucleotides (0.01-0.2 ng, 2 × 104 cpm) were incubated with varying ratios (2-200 ng) of in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor protein and followed by EMSA as described above. The optimum concentration of protein was determined and fixed (60 ng). For Scatchard analysis, constant amounts of in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor were incubated with different concentrations of the TR2RE probe (0.002-1.5 ng). DNA-protein complexes were resolved by EMSA. The free probe and retarded band were quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The dissociation constant (Kd) value was determined from the minus reciprocal of the slope of the line generated from the empirical data. EMSA was performed as previously described (17Sagami I. Tsai S.Y. Wang H. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with some modification. Double-stranded TR2RE primers corresponding to SV40 nucleotides 368-389 (5′-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3′) were end-labeled as a probe. 4 μl of in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor protein were incubated with the probe (0.02-0.1 ng, 104 cpm) in the EMSA buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 6% glycerol) in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 30 min. The resulting complexes were then separated on a native 6% polyacrylamide (37:1) gel at 4°C in 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE = 50 mM Tris base, 50 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) at 10 V/cm. After electrophoresis, gel retardation was either visualized by autoradiography or quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). HeLa cells were plated at an initial density of 3 × 105/60-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture (DMEM/F-12) medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 5% charcoal-treated FBS (CTS) as previously described(13Mowszowicz I. Lee H.-J. Chen H.-T. Mestayer C. Portois M.-C. Cabrol S. Mauvais-Jarvis P. Chang C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 861-869PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection of the HeLa cells with plasmid DNA was carried out using a calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method(18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). To normalize the transfection efficiency, the Rous sarcoma virus-based β-galactosidase expression plasmid pRSV-β-galactosidase (kindly provided by Dr. A. K. Verma) was cotransfected. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for both β-galactosidase and CAT activities at 48 h after transfection(11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each value of CAT conversion represents the mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. There are at least three binding sites of nuclear proteins within the transcriptional initiation site of the SV40-MLP(10Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Zuo F. Murray E.E. Loritz K. Mertz J.E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2206-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). One of these initiator-binding sites consists of core consensus AGGTCA half-site that may represent the potential HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor. In addition, our preliminary data also suggested that the TR2 orphan receptor can be detected in the nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. These data suggested that the TR2 orphan receptor could be one of the candidates that may bind to this region and play some role in SV40 gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we prepared in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor protein for EMSA. We constructed the full-length TR2 orphan receptor cDNA into pSPUTK, which contains the SP6 promoter with a 5′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene and the consensus Kozak translational initiation site (UTK) as shown in Fig. 1A. The mock-translated control expressed in a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system produced no detectable product (Fig. 1B, lane2). In contrast, in vitro translation of pSPUTK-TR2 yielded a protein of the expected molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons for the TR2 orphan receptor (lane3). The minor product probably arose from internal initiation of translation or limited degradation. To investigate the possible interaction of authentic TR2 orphan receptor with the +55 region of the SV40-MLP, we performed an EMSA. The probe used in this study was a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the SV40 nucleotide numbers 368-389 (5′-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3′)(19Tooze J. Molecular Biology of Tumor Viruses. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981Google Scholar). A specific DNA-protein complex was visualized in the EMSA with the probe and the TR2 orphan receptor protein prepared as described above (Fig. 2, lane2). This DNA-protein complex could be eliminated upon the addition of 100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotides (lane3). In contrast, the DNA-protein complex remained intact in the presence of 100-fold molar excesses of mutated oligonucleotides (mutant TR2RE) with a point mutation on the third nucleotide in both repeat motifs (lane4). Furthermore, there was no specific interaction between these oligonucleotides (TR2RE) and the in vitro expressed TR3 orphan receptor (lane5), another orphan receptor identified in our laboratory, or a mock-translated product (data not shown). These results indicated that the TR2 orphan receptor indeed had the ability to specifically bind to the TR2RE, but not to mutant TR2RE, in the SV40-MLP (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Schematic structure of the TR2RE among the transcriptional initiation site of the SV40-MLP. The arrow indicates the position of transcriptional initiation site of the SV40-MLP. The sequence of either the wild-type or mutant TR2RE, an imperfect direct repeat of the AGGTCA half-site, is boxed. The TR2RE is located at the +55 region of the major late transcript. Numbers under the sequence show SV40 nucleotide residues(19Tooze J. Molecular Biology of Tumor Viruses. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the binding affinity between the TR2 orphan receptor and the TR2RE in more detail, we employed Scatchard binding analysis for the DNA-protein complexes in the EMSA (Fig. 4). Scatchard plot analysis revealed a single binding component for this DNA-protein complex with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 9 nM and Bmax of 0.3 nM to the TR2RE that fit the range of Kd for steroid receptors and their HREs (16Schrader M. Becker-Andre M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6444-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All in vitro binding data suggested that TR2RE could be the potential HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor. The next question asked was whether this interaction between the TR2RE and the TR2 orphan receptor was ligand dependent. Unlike classic members of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptors, which have their own ligands to test the ligand dependence, the TR2 orphan receptor is a receptor without a known ligand. To overcome this problem, we developed a “DNA swap” strategy to test this hypothesis. A chimeric receptor, AR/TR2/AR, with the DNA-binding domain of the TR2 orphan receptor flanked by the N-terminal and androgen-binding domains of the AR (Fig. 5A) was created here to study the interaction between the TR2RE and the TR2 orphan receptor. This chimeric plasmid was cotransfected into HeLa cells with reporter plasmids, which consist of the CAT gene regulated by the SV40 early promoter containing either the TR2RE or mutant TR2RE, respectively. The induction of the CAT gene by androgen was then tested. As shown in Fig. 5B, androgen clearly suppressed the transcriptional activity of the SV40 early promoter via the interaction between the TR2 orphan receptor and the TR2RE. However, SV40 early promoter construct with a mutant TR2RE was not affected by androgen in similar transient transfection CAT assay in HeLa cells. These data demonstrated that ligand can affect the interaction between the TR2RE and the TR2 orphan receptor and further confirmed the TR2RE is the HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor. Thus far, all of our data have supported the idea that SV40-MLP contains the TR2RE, a potential HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor. We then determined if the TR2 orphan receptor directly can play any role in SV40 gene expression via interaction with the TR2RE. CAT assay with the cotransfection of mammalian expression vector containing the full-length TR2 orphan receptor cDNA (pSG5-TR2) and either pBL-SVL-CAT (without the TR2RE) or pBL-SVLRE-CAT (with the TR2RE) reporter into HeLa cells indicated that the TR2 orphan receptor cannot affect the transcriptional activity of the SV40-MLP without the TR2RE (Fig. 6B, lane1). In contrast, the TR2 orphan receptor can suppress the transcriptional activity of the SV40-MLP containing the TR2RE region (lane2). These findings suggested that this TR2RE may function as a repressor for the transcriptional activity of the SV40-MLP. As our data demonstrated that the TR2 orphan receptor may function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression, we then attempted to determine if the TR2 orphan receptor always binds to the TR2RE and, therefore, constitutively blocks the SV40 gene expression or if the TR2 orphan receptor needs activator(s) for the activation of its supression function. To test this hypothesis, we applied regular FBS versus CTS in the transient transfection CAT assay. Our assumption was that the TR2 orphan receptor may have some activator(s) in the serum. As shown in Fig. 7, the repressor function of the TR2 orphan receptor was dependent on the presence of a potential activator(s) in the serum (lanes3 and 4). On the other hand, charcoal-treated serum can abolish such suppression by the removal of the potential TR2 activator(s) in the serum. These results further suggested that such activator-dependent suppression of the SV40 gene expression may rely on the interaction between the TR2RE and the TR2 orphan receptor. As expected, the mutant TR2RE had no influence on the suppression of the SV40 gene expression in the presence of either FBS or CTS (lanes5 and 6). Taken together, these data strongly suggested that the TR2RE is a HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor and functions as a repressor in the SV40 gene expression in an activator-dependent manner. It has been previously shown that some orphan receptors may affect the expression of viruses. For example, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor can bind to a negative regulatory region in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat(20Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2853-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatitis B virus enhancer I contains response elements of enhancer binding factor to polyoma C, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, and retinoid X receptor (RXRα)(21Garcia A.D. Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TR3 orphan receptor and nuclear factor I can induce transcription of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat(14Lee H.-J. Kokontis J. Wang K.-C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Bruggemeier U. Rogge L. Winnacker E.-L. Beato M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, hERR1 and other orphan receptors have also been suggested to bind to the transcriptional initiation site of the SV40-MLP that may be involved in the early-to-late shift in the SV40 gene expression(10Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Zuo F. Murray E.E. Loritz K. Mertz J.E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2206-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our finding that the TR2 orphan receptor can bind to a negative response element in the transcriptional initiation site of the SV40-MLP will further expand the knowledge of the influence of orphan receptors on the gene expression of viruses. The AGGTCA motif has been proposed to be the primary target element for the members of the ERE subfamily in the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily(8Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 9Martinez E. Wahli W. Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 125-153Google Scholar). Many family members, including the TR2 orphan receptor identified in the present study, can bind to this core sequence. However, it is not known yet how distinct sets of target genes are regulated by these nuclear receptors. In addition to the primary sequence, recent evidence has suggested that the orientation and spacing of repeat core elements determine the specificity of hormonal regulation of these receptors ((23Naar A.M. Boutin J.-M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar); also, see (24Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) for review). More recently, a novel cooperative dimer interaction within the DNA-binding domains of family members has been proposed(25Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 26Schrader M. Muller K.M. Nayeri S. Kahlen J.-P. Carlberg C. Nature. 1994; 370: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A region in the first zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of the T3R or RAR can interact with the second zinc finger in the DNA-binding domain of the RXR to promote selective DNA binding to direct repeats spaced by 4 and 5 nucleotides, respectively. The resulting polarity established by this protein-protein interaction places RXR in the 5′-position (5′-RXR-T3R-3′ or 5′-RXR-RAR-3′) of the direct repeats(25Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, the formation of either 5′-T3R-VDR-3′ or 5′VDR-T3R-3′ heterodimeric complex can be controlled by the ligand for the downstream receptor. Thus, polarity is an important regulatory property of heterodimeric nuclear receptor complexes(26Schrader M. Muller K.M. Nayeri S. Kahlen J.-P. Carlberg C. Nature. 1994; 370: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The TR3 orphan receptor, another orphan receptor identified initially in our laboratory, was used here as a negative control in the EMSA (Fig. 2). The TR3 orphan receptor, a human homologue of rat NGFI-B and mouse nur77, is also a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily(27Chang C. Kokontis J. Liao S. Chang Y. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Kokontis J. Liao S. Chang C. Receptor. 1991; 1: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chang C. Saltzman A. Lee H.-J. Uemura H. Su C. Chodak G. Nakamoto T. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Davis E. Lemons R.S. Sivak L. Shih C. Endocrine J. 1993; 1: 541-549Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that rat NGFI-B can bind to a response element (NBRE), 5′-AAAGGTCA-3′, which contains only one AGGTCA half-site(30Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Thus, NGFI-B has been grouped into a special monomer binding subfamily. Herein, we have shown that the TR3 orphan receptor cannot bind to the TR2RE, an imperfect direct repeat sequence. This finding is in good agreement with the data from NGFI-B(30Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Based on the binding affinity between some members of the ERE subfamily and the TR2RE, we found that the TR2 orphan receptor prefers TR2RE to other natural HREs, such as T3RE, RAREβ, and NBRE. 2T. Lin and C. Chang, manuscript in preparation. The binding affinity between the TR2 orphan receptor and the TR2RE is high and specific. Interestingly, sequence analysis of the TR2RE in the GenBank data base indicated that human hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus type 33 may also contain binding sites for the TR2 orphan receptor. Whether the TR2 orphan receptor has any function in these viral gene expressions could be an interesting question to ask. Lydon et al. (31Lydon J.P. Power R.F. Conneely O.M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the TR2 orphan receptor is not constitutively active. The chimera receptor (PR/PR/TR2), which replaces the ligand-binding domain of progesterone receptor with that of the TR2 orphan receptor, can be activated by dopamine, a neurotransmitter. Our previous report (28Kokontis J. Liao S. Chang C. Receptor. 1991; 1: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar) showed that chimeric receptor TR3/AR/TR3 can be constitutively activated in both COS1 and prostate PC-3 cells but not TR2/AR/TR2. These two independent data all suggested that the TR2 orphan receptor may need its cognate ligand for the activation. In summary, our data indicated that this TR2RE is indeed the first identified natural HRE for the TR2 orphan receptor. Moreover, our results showing that TR2RE can function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression may suggest that several potential HREs for the TR2 orphan receptor could exist in other viruses. This prediction may open a new chapter for the study of interaction between the viral expression and the TR2 orphan receptor. We thank Dr. Janet E. Mertz for valuable discussions and mutant TR2RE primers, Dr. Ajit K. Verma for pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid, Dr. Atsushi Mizokami for pSVL-GR plasmid, and Yi-Fen Lee for technical assistance.

Transformants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the fusion gene produced an intracellular heterogeneously N-glycosylated fusion protein of intermediate molecular weight between the core and fully extended N-glycosylated form of invertase, suggesting a post-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization. In two types of cell fractionation using sucrose density gradients the ST-invertase fusion protein cofractionated with Golgi marker proteins, whereas a minor fraction (about 30%) comigrated with a vacuolar marker; ST-invertase was not detected in other cell fractions including the ER and the plasma membrane. Consistent with Golgi localization, about 70% of the total amount of the ST-invertase fusion was immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against α-1,6-mannose linkages. The results demonstrate that the membrane anchor region of a mammalian type II glycosyltransferase is able to target a protein to the secretory pathway and to a Golgi compartment of the yeast S. cerevisiae, indicating conservation of targeting mechanisms between higher and lower eukaryotes. Since typical yeast Golgi localization signals are missing in the ST-membrane anchor region the results also suggest that yeast as mammalian cells utilize diverse mechanisms to direct proteins to the Golgi.

The Golgi comprises cellular compartments that secreted proteins traverse between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumGDPaseguanosine diphosphataseMan-Tfα-1,2-mannosyltransferasePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideSTβ-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1). and their final destinations(1Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Individual Golgi compartments are defined by specific protein processing functions, especially by reactions leading to the trimming and extension of glycosyl chains(2Mellman I. Simons K. Cell. 1992; 68: 829-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a wide variety of glycosyl chains consisting of different sugars and glycosidic linkages are successively synthesized in neighboring cisternae of typical Golgi stacks(3Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). Terminal galactosyl and sialic acid residues of complex glycosyl chains are added, respectively, in the trans-Golgi or the trans-Golgi network compartments. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the Golgi does not need to carry out as diverse functions as its mammalian counterpart, since yeast glycosyl structures are relatively simple(4Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It is known that the addition of mannosyl residues to N- and O-linked glycosyl chains, as well as the processing of the precursor of the α-factor pheromone and killer factor occur in the yeast Golgi(5Franzusoff A. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The yeast Golgi is subdivided in an early compartment containing α-1,6-mannosyltransferase, a medial compartment containing Man-Tf and GDPase and a late compartment containing processing proteases Kex2p and Ste13p(6Graham T.R.

The various Golgi processes require membrane proteins that are localized in specific Golgi compartments. The common structure of these enzymes consists of a cytoplasmic tail, a membrane anchor region, and a luminal region required for enzymatic function(9Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All glycosyltransferases of the Golgi are type II proteins, whose cytoplasmic tail and membrane anchor region are at the NH2 terminus and whose lumenal portion is divided in a stem region and the COOH-terminal catalytic domain(9Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years some structural requirements for protein localization in the Golgi have been defined. Generally, Golgi localization requires a membrane anchor region flanked by cytoplasmic and luminal protein domains. Specific sequences that determine Golgi localization may be localized in each of these three regions. In mammalian cells, some Golgi proteins contain targeting sequences in the cytoplasmic tail(10Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), whereas β-1,4-galactosyltransferase contains localization sequences in the membrane anchor(11Nilsson T. Lucocq J.M.

The membrane anchor of ST is needed for localization, but can be replaced by an artificial sequence containing 17 leucine residues (15Munro S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3577-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) or other hydrophobic sequences(17Dahdal R.Y. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26310-26319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane anchor of ST appears to function as a transmembrane spacer, which is required to present targeting sequences on the cytoplasmic and luminal side of ST(17Dahdal R.Y. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26310-26319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas in mammalian cells Golgi targeting sequences may be localized in either cytoplasmic, membrane and luminal sequences, the only defined localization sequences in three Golgi enzymes of yeast (Ste13p, Kex2p, Kex1p) are in the cytoplasmic tails (18Cooper A. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Wilcox C.A. Redding K. Wright R. Fuller R.S. Mol. Biol.

These results suggest a single Golgi localization mechanism in yeast requiring structural information in the cytoplasmic tails. Cellular components that interact with the membrane anchor regions and effect Golgi localization have not been clearly defined in either mammalian or yeast cells. It should be emphasized that besides its function in Golgi localization the membrane anchor of type II proteins is also needed as a secretion leader to translocate the respective protein across the membrane of the ER. Some signal sequences of secreted mammalian proteins have been shown to be used and processed in the yeast S. cerevisiae(21Hitzeman R.A. Leung D.W. Perry J. Kohr W.J. Levine H.L. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1983; 219: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These findings, as well as the relatively broad range of possible signal sequence structures(22Kaiser C.A. Preuss D. Grisafi P. Botstein D. Science. 1987; 235: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), suggest that the membrane insertion function of a mammalian membrane anchor region may also be used in yeast. However, it was unclear if the Golgi localization function of the anchor region would be recognized in the heterologous yeast host. In this paper we demonstrate that both the membrane insertion function, as well as the Golgi localization function of a mammalian glycosyltransferase, rat ST, are functional in yeast. This finding suggests that in yeast, specific Golgi-targeting sequences may not be limited to the cytoplasmic tail, as has been reported previously (18Cooper A. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Wilcox C.A. Redding K. Wright R. Fuller R.S. Mol. Biol.

Thus yeast, as mammalian cells, may utilize several different mechanisms for Golgi localization of proteins. S. cerevisiae SEY6210 was used as host for recombinant plasmids (MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-200 trp1-901 lys2-801 suc2-9 GAL) (23Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). As a control the mnn9 mutant strain ER112-1B/C3 (MATα ura3-52 pep4-3 leu2 mnn9) was used. Strain SEY6210 was transformed with recombinant plasmids as described(24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Transformants were grown in SD minimal medium or SGal minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% galactose, 0.2% glucose) containing leucine, tryptophane, histidine, and lysine(24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Plasmid pbs+St3 containing a 1645-base pair EcoRI fragment encoding rat ST inserted into the EcoRI site of pKS+ (Stratagene) was obtained from J. Paulson (25Weinstein J. Lee E.U. McEntee K. Lai P.-H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ST sequence differs from the published sequence (25Weinstein J. Lee E.U. McEntee K. Lai P.-H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by mutation of an A to a G at base number 123, which removes the internal EcoRI sequence without changing the amino acid sequence. Plasmid pRB58 carries the full-length SUC2 gene in YEp24 (revertant of pRB55(26Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Plasmid pYAAI, which encodes a fusion of the tail and membrane anchor regions of ST, was constructed in several steps. First, a convenient EcoRI restriction site was inserted upstream of the translational start codon of the ST gene by primer-directed mutagenesis. To this effect the 1.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment of plasmid pbs+St3 was inserted into the mutagenesis vector pSELECT, and in vitro mutagenesis was performed using the 21-mer 5′-CAT TAA GAA TTC TCC GAG GAC-3′ according to the commercial protocol (Promega). The mutagenesis generates the following sequence (the coding region is in italics). 5′‐….GAATTCEcoRIATT ATG ATT CAT…‐3′ A 120-base pair EcoRI-DraII gene fragment of the mutated gene encoding the membrane anchor region was then inserted between the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pUC-8 (the DraII site had been filled in using Klenow enzyme). The resulting plasmid, pST-Anker, was cut with BamHI, its 5′ overhangs were filled in using Klenow enzyme, and it was then ligated with a 2-kilobase SalI fragment of plasmid pInvSal, which carries a truncated SUC2 gene encoding yeast invertase(27Bielefeld M. Hollenberg C.P. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this manner a gene fusion encoding an in-frame fusion between the membrane anchor region of ST and the mature yeast invertase were constructed (plasmid pC). The fusion junction has the following sequence (ST anchor region, bold; SUC2, italics; numbers are residues of mature invertase). 5675′‐GAGGCCGGGGATCTCGACACTAGC‐3′ The fusion was excised from plasmid pC as an EcoRI-HindIII fragment and ligated with a 0.5 kilobase BamHI-EcoRI fragment carrying the ACT1 promoter (28Ernst J.F.

Spheroplasts were prepared as follows: 100 A600nm; units of cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min and preincubated in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 10 mM dithiothreitol at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in TSD buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 M sorbitol, 10 mM dithiothreitol) and treated with 3000 units of lyticase (Sigma) and 1% glucuronidase (Sigma) for 30-45 min at 30°C until at least 90% of the cells had formed spheroplasts. Spheroplasts were harvested (2000 × g, 5 min), washed in 3 ml of TSD buffer, and washed again in 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 150 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 1.5 M sorbitol; spheroplasts were resuspended in 500 μl of this buffer and frozen above liquid nitrogen(32Vida T.A. Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2871-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To prepare cell fractions the spheroplasts were slowly thawed on ice, harvested (5 min at 1500 × g), and resuspended in 3 ml of TEA buffer (0.8 M sorbitol, 10 mM triethanolamine, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6, proteinase inhibitors pepstatin, leupeptin, antipain at 2 μg/ml, 1 mM PMSF). The cell suspension was homogenized by 20 strokes in a precooled tissue homogenizer with a tight-fitting glass pestle and then centrifuged for 3 min at 1000 × g (3000 rpm) in a JA20 rotor (Beckman) to generate crude extract (S1) in the supernatant and a cell pellet (P1). P1 was resuspended in TEA buffer and centrifuged to generate S1′. The combined supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g (9000 rpm) in a JA20 rotor to generate supernatant S2 and pellet P2. S2 was then spun for 1 h at 120,000 × g (35,000 rpm) in a Ti50 rotor (Beckman) to generate supernatant S3 and pellet P3. The pellet fractions P2 and P3 containing cellular organelles were resuspended in 1.24 ml of buffer A (55% sucrose, 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF) and homogenized in the tissue homogenizer with six strokes. In the case of the pYAAI transformant P2 and P3 contained about 45% of the invertase activity of the crude extract. The homogenate was placed at the bottom of a SW41 tube (Beckman polyallomer tube 14 × 95 mm) and overlaid with 1.24 ml portions of buffer A containing 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, or 25% sucrose yielding a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged for 16 h at 170,000 × g in a Beckman SW 40 rotor. After centrifugation 550-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. In an alternative method (method B) spheroplasts were prepared from 325 A600nm; units of transformed cells. Spheroplasts were washed with 1 M sorbitol, resuspended in 0.6 ml of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM MnCl2, 15% sucrose/protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain at 1 μg/ml), and broken using glass beads (φ, 0.45 mm) at low speed on a Vortex (15-s intervals for a total of 1.5 min, at 4°C). Cell debris was removed by a low-speed centrifugation (2000 rpm/10 min) and the supernatant containing cytoplasmic proteins and organels was layered on top of a discontinous sucrose gradient (25-50% sucrose) in 13 × 51-mm polyallomer tubes. Following centrifugation in a SW 55 rotor (Beckman) at 42,000 rpm for 15 h, 300-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. 30-50 μl of each sucrose gradient fraction (cell fraction) was separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins were detected by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (33Towbin A. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1250 (anti-invertase) or 1:400 (anti-diaminopeptidyl aminopeptidase A) or 1:500 (anti-Kex2p) or 1:6000 (anti-ATPase); the secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad), diluted 1:5000. Immunoblots were developed with 5 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 70 mg of nitro blue tetrazolium in 50 ml of buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.002 M MgCl2). Immunoblots were evaluated by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer. For immunoprecipitations cells were grown in low sulfate medium (5Franzusoff A. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) containing 2% galactose, 0.2% glucose to an A600nm; of 0.3-0.6; 5 A600nm; units were labeled with 150 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) followed by the preparation of cell extracts, essentially as described(5Franzusoff A. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Invertase-related proteins were immunoprecipitated by addition of 7.5 μl of anti-invertase antibody followed by the addition of 37.5 μl of protein A-Sepharose (20%), as described(5Franzusoff A. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The washed pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer (1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 5 min at 95°C, and to 150 μl of the resulting solution, 600 μl of dilution buffer (5Franzusoff A. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was added. To 200 μl of the dilution, either 5 μl of anti-invertase antibody or 5 μl of anti-α-1,6-mannose were added followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were solubilized in sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide, 0.18% bisacrylamide); an equivalent sample of the solubilized first precipitate was added as a control. The resulting SDS-PAGE gels were analyzed by autoradiography. NADPH-dependent cytochrome c oxidoreductase(34Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and the Golgi marker enzyme Man-Tf (35Hausler A. Robbins P.W. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were determined essentially as described. α-Mannosidase was assayed in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7, 0.04% Triton X-100, 1 mMp-nitrophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside for 2 h at 30°C and stopped using 2 volumes of 2% Na2CO3(34Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Invertase activity was determined as described(23Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard protein. Digestions with peptide:N-glycosidase F were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The sucrose concentrations in the gradient fractions were determined using the refractive index. We constructed a gene fusion that encodes the 34 NH2-terminal amino acids of rat liver α-2,6-ST joined to the mature invertase protein of the yeast S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1). The ST segment contains a presumed 9-amino acid tail, 17 amino acids of the presumed membrane anchor region, which is followed by 8 additional amino acids(25Weinstein J. Lee E.U. McEntee K. Lai P.-H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion gene was placed under transcriptional control of the yeast ACT1 promoter and inserted into the yeast centromere vector YCp50 that carries the URA3 wild-type gene. The resulting plasmid, pYAAI, was transformed into a yeast ura3 mutant strain (SEY6210) lacking all invertase gene sequences (SUC20)(23Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), selecting uracil prototrophs. Thus, the only source of invertase in the transformants is the fusion gene on the expression plasmid. Because the invertase signal sequence is missing in the fusion protein, its only possibility to gain entrance to the yeast secretory pathway is the use of ST sequences. As a control, we used the multicopy yeast vector pRB58, which carries the SUC2 gene encoding the secreted glycosylated form, as well as the cytoplasmic unglycosylated form of invertase(26Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Again, pRB58 was transformed into strain SEY6210 selecting Ura+ prototrophs. -In eukaryotic cells N-glycosylation of a protein depends on its entry of the secretory pathway. Furthermore, the extent of glycosyl chain processing indicates how far the respective protein has traversed the secretory pathway. We determined the glycosylation status of the ST-invertase fusion in yeast transformants carrying pYAAI by immunoblotting experiments. In control experiments, transformants carrying plasmid pRB58 (encoding wild-type invertase) were analyzed. Spheroplasts of yeast transformants were prepared and broken by a combination of osmotic lysis and mild mechanical disruption; a crude cell extract was obtained as a supernatant in a low-speed centrifugation step. Furthermore, the periplasmic protein fraction liberated by the lyticase/β-glucuronidase treatment during spheroplast formation was assayed. The presence of plasmid pRB58 in transformants leads to the overproduction of the secreted and cytoplasmic forms of invertase(26Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). The periplasmic fraction of the pRB58 transformant contained the highly N-glycosylated form of invertase, with a molecular mass of 100-180 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 3), as expected (36Orlean P. Kuranda M.J. Albright C.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 682-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); in addition, presumably due to cell lysis during spheroplast formation, the cytoplasmic form of invertase was detected, which in our gel system had an apparent molecular mass of about 56 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 3). The periplasmic fraction of the pYAAI transformant did not contain a protein reactive with the anti-invertase antiserum (Fig. 2, lane 2), whereas in the crude extract of this transformant (obtained by method A, see below) a heterogeneous form of invertase with a molecular mass ranging from 90 to 110 kDa, containing at least two distinct invertase species, was found (Fig. 2, lane 5) (heterogeneity of ST-invertase is also shown in Fig. 4, A and B, as discussed below). As expected, a cytoplasmic unglycosylated form of invertase was not detected in crude extracts of the pYAAI transformant, because this is encoded only by the wild-type SUC2 gene(26Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Distribution of anti-invertase-reacting proteins in cell fractions separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Cells were fractionated by method A (A) or by method B (B and C), as indicated in the text. A and B, pYAAI transformant; C, pRB58 transformant. The migration of the core-glycosylated form of wild-type invertase is marked by the asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By digestions with peptide:N-glycosidase F we examined if the produced invertase forms were N-glycosylated. Treatment of the crude extract of the pRB58 transformant with peptide:N-glycosidase F resulted in the appearance of a distinct invertase species, which had a size about 3 kDa greater than the cytoplasmic form (Fig. 2, lane 6). From the intensities of staining in the immunoblot we estimate that about equal amounts of the cytoplasmic form and the peptide:N-glycosidase F-sensitive N-glycosylated form are present in the pRB58 transformant (in which invertase is overproduced compared with a wild-type Suc2+ strain). The fact that deglycosylated invertase has a greater size than cytoplasmic invertase may be due to O-glycosylation of secreted invertase (37Mormeneo S. Zueco J. Iranzo M. Sentandreu R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 57: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or the presence of a short N-glycosyl chain remaining after peptide:N-glycosidase F digestion. The ST-invertase fusion in the pYAAI transformant appeared quantitatively N-glycosylated, because peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment resulted in the disappearance of the 90-110-kDa form (Fig. 2, lane 5) and the appearance of two distinct invertase species of about 60 and 63 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 7). The presence of 34 amino acids of ST at the NH2 terminus of invertase is expected to increase its size by about 3 kDa; thus, the 60-kDa form of the ST-fusion, which comigrates with deglycosylated wild-type invertase, appears to represent the unmodified fusion protein. The 3-kDa increase in molecular mass of the 63-kDa form may be caused by O-glycosylation, as discussed for wild-type invertase. Partial O-glycosylation of proteins secreted by yeast has been reported previously(38Ernst J.F. Mermod J.-J. Richman L.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Gellerfors P. Axelsson K. Helander A. Johansson S. Kenne L. Lindqvist S. Pavlu B. Skottner A. Fryklund L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11444-11449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explore how far ST-invertase had traversed the secretory pathway, we performed immunoprecipitations to determine if ST-invertase had received α-1,6-mannose linkages, a modification which occurs in the Golgi compartment(4Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and invertase species were immunoprecipitated using anti-invertase antibody. Equal amounts of the resolubilized precipitate were immunoprecipitated with anti-invertase- or anti-α-1,6-mannose antibody, respectively, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. As in the above immunoblots (Fig. 2) ST-invertase could be detected using anti-invertase antibody as a smear of proteins containing two distinct proteins (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2).

https://openalex.org/W2041631122,"The ligand substitution reaction of EDTA with Cd7-metallothionein (Cd7-MT) has been reinvestigated. NMR titration of the 111Cd-protein with EDTA showed that the ligand interacts preferentially and cooperatively with Cd2+ ions in the β-domain cluster. NMR and ultrafiltration kinetic analysis of this reaction using 5.6 mM Cd2+ as 111Cd7-MT and 56 mM EDTA indicated that cadmium-EDTA formed less rapidly than 111Cd peak intensity declined. Spectrophotometric and gel filtration studies of the reaction with 20 μM Cd2+ as Cd7-MT with various concentrations of EDTA revealed biphasic kinetics with much larger rate constants than observed in the NMR experiments. The fraction of total ligand substitution occurring in each kinetic step varied with EDTA concentration. The EDTA concentration dependence of both kinetic steps was consistent with the initial formation of protein•EDTA adducts, followed by their breakdown into products. Kinetic measurements were also made for the reactions of the isolated Cd4-α- and Cd3-β-domains with EDTA. The Cd4 domain reacted with EDTA with biphasic kinetics, in which one Cd2+ was removed rapidly with first-order kinetics, which were zero-order in EDTA. The other three reacted with kinetics like those for the slower step of the holoprotein. Cd3-β reacted with EDTA like the faster rate process associated with the Cd7-protein. The observed rate constants for the reaction of Cd7-metallothionein with EDTA and the fraction of reaction in the faster rate process were sensitive to protein concentration. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the protein controls its kinetic reactivity with EDTA."

A combination of CD, NMR, and fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrates that Elk-93 represents an independently folded domain of mixed α/β structure in which the three conserved tryptophans appear to contribute to the hydrophobic core of the protein. Moreover, DNA binding studies demonstrate that Elk-93 binds DNA with both high affinity (Kd≈ 0.85 × 10−10M) and specificity.

This truncated form of p40phox consisting of the Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain to the 3' stop codon was also shown to interact with p67phox in the same system. A library of smaller fragments of the truncated p40 cDNA was constructed and screened against either p47phox or p67phox.

https://openalex.org/W1566888481,"We have analyzed the structure of the active site of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) synthase from spinach chloroplast envelope. Since purification of this membrane-embedded enzyme yielded such low amounts of protein that analyses of the amino acid sequence were so far impossible, we used indirect strategies. Analyses of the inhibition of MGDG synthase by UDP and of its inactivation by citraconic anhydride first indicated that the enzyme contained two functionally independent and topologically distinct binding sites for each substrate. Whereas MGDG synthase binds both the nucleotidic part of UDP-Gal and the acyl chains of 1,2-diacylglycerol, UDP is a competitive inhibitor relatively to UDP-Gal, while it does not compete with 1,2-diacylglycerol for binding on the enzyme. The UDP-Gal-binding site contains lysine residues, as demonstrated for UDP-Gal-binding sites from all galactosyltransferases studied so far. Radiolabeling of MGDG synthase by sulfur labeling reagent, a 35S-labeled lysine-blocking reagent, confirmed that MGDG synthase was a polypeptide with a low molecular mass (around 20 kDa).

https://openalex.org/W2021037285,"The XylR protein positively controls expression from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid σ54-dependent “upper” pathway operon promoter (Pu) and the xylS gene promoter (Ps), in response to the presence of aromatic effectors. Two mutant XylR regulators able to stimulate transcription from Pu and Ps in the absence of effectors were isolated. These mutants exhibited single point mutations, namely Asp135→ Asn and Pro85→ Ser. Both mutations are located in the amino termini domain of XylR, which is thought to be responsible for interactions with effectors. The effector profile of XylRP85S was similar to that of wild-type XylR protein; however, XylRD135N exhibited an altered pattern of effector recognition: with m-nitrotoluene it stimulated transcription from the Pu promoter above the high basal level, whereas this nitroarene inhibited the wild-type regulator. Previous work (Delgado, A., and Ramos, J. L.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 8059-8062) showed that residue 172 was involved in effector interactions, as mutant XylRE172K also recognized m-nitrotoluene. However, double mutant XylR135N/E172K did not stimulate transcription in the absence of effector, but retained the ability to stimulate transcription with m-nitrotoluene. Transcription mediated by XylRD135N and XylRP85S from Pu::lacZ was analyzed in detail. Like the wild-type regulator, XylRD135N and XylRP85S required σ54 for full transcription activation, but in contrast with the wild-type regulator, XylRD135N, but not XylRP85S, stimulated transcription from Pu in the absence of the integration host factor protein. XylRD135N, also in contrast with XylR and XylRP85S, mediated transcription from a mutant Pu promoter that lacked one of the upstream regulator binding sites (ΔUAS1), but not when both upstream regulator binding sites were deleted. The level of autoregulation of XylRD135N was at least 2-fold higher than that found with the wild-type XylR regulator and the mutant XylRP85S. The XylR protein positively controls expression from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid σ54-dependent “upper” pathway operon promoter (Pu) and the xylS gene promoter (Ps), in response to the presence of aromatic effectors. Two mutant XylR regulators able to stimulate transcription from Pu and Ps in the absence of effectors were isolated. These mutants exhibited single point mutations, namely Asp135→ Asn and Pro85→ Ser. Both mutations are located in the amino termini domain of XylR, which is thought to be responsible for interactions with effectors. The effector profile of XylRP85S was similar to that of wild-type XylR protein; however, XylRD135N exhibited an altered pattern of effector recognition: with m-nitrotoluene it stimulated transcription from the Pu promoter above the high basal level, whereas this nitroarene inhibited the wild-type regulator. Previous work (Delgado, A., and Ramos, J. L.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 8059-8062) showed that residue 172 was involved in effector interactions, as mutant XylRE172K also recognized m-nitrotoluene. However, double mutant XylR135N/E172K did not stimulate transcription in the absence of effector, but retained the ability to stimulate transcription with m-nitrotoluene. Transcription mediated by XylRD135N and XylRP85S from Pu::lacZ was analyzed in detail. Like the wild-type regulator, XylRD135N and XylRP85S required σ54 for full transcription activation, but in contrast with the wild-type regulator, XylRD135N, but not XylRP85S, stimulated transcription from Pu in the absence of the integration host factor protein. XylRD135N, also in contrast with XylR and XylRP85S, mediated transcription from a mutant Pu promoter that lacked one of the upstream regulator binding sites (ΔUAS1), but not when both upstream regulator binding sites were deleted.

INTRODUCTIONPseudomonas putida harboring the TOL catabolic plasmid grows on toluene and related hydrocarbons, and is able to oxidize these compounds to Krebs cycle intermediates via the “upper” and the meta-cleavage pathways(1Worsey M.J. Williams P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 7-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The XylR protein needs to be activated by effectors to stimulate transcription from the upper pathway operon promoter (Pu), and from the xylS gene promoter (Ps). Increased xylS mRNA levels lead to overproduction of the XylS regulator, which stimulate transcription from Pm, the meta-pathway operon promoter(2Inouye S. Nakazawa A. Nakazawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5182-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Marqués S. Ramos J.L. Timmis K.N. Biochim. Biophys.

Nakazawa T. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The XylR protein is 566 amino acid residues long, and belongs to the NtrC/NifA family of regulators(5Inouye S. Nakazawa A. Nakazawa T. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These regulators exhibit four domains, three of which are highly conserved among members of the family (Fig. 1). The carboxyl-terminal domain D contains an α-helix-turn-α-helix DNA-binding motif. The central domain C, the best conserved region in the family, seems to be involved in interactions with RNA-polymerase and ATP hydrolysis to allow the formation of open transcriptional complexes(6Kustu S. Santero E. Keener J. Popham D. Weiss D. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 367-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The B domain (Q linker) is a short hydrophilic region whose role is probably to serve as a linker between the C and A domains. The nonhomologous NH2-terminal domain A has been implicated in signal reception, either via a sensory protein as in the NtrB/NtrC pair, or via interaction with a chemical signal as in DmpR (7Shingler V.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), revealed that XylR recognizes a 5′ motif, which appears twice, in inverted orientation. These upstream activator sequences were identified around −160 (UAS1) and around −130 (UAS2). Deletion of one or both of these motifs abolished transcription activation by wild-type XylR regulator(10Abril M.A. Buck M. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15832-15838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Inouye S. Gomada M. Sangodkar U.M.X. Nakazawa A. Nakazawa T. J. Mol.

The −40/-70 region of both Pu and Ps is rich in As and Ts, and shows good homology to the consensus IHF-binding motif(19Holtel A. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In an IHF−-deficient Escherichia coli background, Abril et al.(10Abril M.A. Buck M. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15832-15838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and de Lorenzo et al.(20de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that stimulation of effector-activated XylR-dependent transcription from Pu was only about 10-25% of that obtained in an IHF+ background. In contrast, expression from the Ps promoter in an IHF− background was virtually unchanged with respect to the activity level in an IHF+ background (19Holtel A. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The mechanism of activation by the σ54/E complex requires that the regulator make contact with the σ54/E complex bound at the promoter site(21Buck M. Miller S. Drummond M. Dixon R. Nature. 1986; 320: 374-378Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the intervening DNA sequences loop out to allow interactions(21Buck M. Miller S. Drummond M. Dixon R. Nature. 1986; 320: 374-378Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Su W. Porter S. Kustu S. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The role of IHF in the Pu promoter is probably to assist in loop formation; it may also assist in the formation and stabilization of the complex (24Collado-Vides J. Magasanik B. Gralla J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 371-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study we show that mutant XylR regulators exhibiting single point mutations (D135→N and P85→S) stimulate transcription from the Pu and Ps promoters in the absence of effector. The XylD135N mutant also exhibited an altered pattern of effector recognition. Transcription activation from Pu and Ps by these mutant regulators is dependent on σ54, but expression from Pu with XylD135N became independent of IHF protein. Another finding of interest was that deletion of UAS1 still allowed moderate (i.e. about 50% of maximal) induction from Pu with XylRD135N, whereas induction was markedly diminished with the wild-type XylR and XylRP85S.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth ConditionsThe following bacterial strains were used: E. coli MC4100 (F−, araD139, Δ[argF-lacU169], rpsL150, relA, flb5301, ptsF25); E. coli ET8000 (lacZ::IS1, gyrA, hutCc) and E. coli ET8045 (ET8000 [ntrA::Tn10],Tetr)(25MacNeil D.

Bacteria were grown at 30°C in LB broth supplemented, when required, with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol.XylR MutantsThe xylR gene on plasmid pTS174 was mutagenized in vivo with N′-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, as described previously(11Delgado A. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8059-8062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA from bacteria surviving mutagenesis was transformed in E. coli MC4100 (pRD579), and ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were selected on McConkey plates. Red papillaceae colonies were chosen, purified, and used to test expression from the Pu::′lacZ fusion (β-galactosidase activity) in the absence of XylR effectors in LB liquid culture medium. Two XylR mutants able to mediate induction from the Pu promoter, in the absence of XylR effectors, were kept for further studies. The plasmids bearing the mutant alleles were called pAD6 and pAD49, and the corresponding xylR alleles were sequenced. Mutant proteins were named in accordance with Knowles(27Knowles J.R. Science. 1987; 236: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).The double mutant XylRE172K/D135N was constructed in vitro by replacing the 300-bp internal NheI site fragment of pAD1 with the corresponding one in pAD49, so that the resulting mutant allele bore two point mutations.β-Galactosidase Assaysβ-Galactosidase activity was measured in permeabilized cells as described before (11Delgado A. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8059-8062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was expressed in Miller's units.DNA TechniquesStandard procedures were used for the isolation of DNA and its analysis. DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using 35S-labeled nucleotide, a series of xylR-specific 20-mer oligonucleotides to prime synthesis, and 7-deaza-dGTP instead of dGTP. The 5′-mRNA start of the upper operon transcript was determined by primer extension analysis (3Marqués S. Ramos J.L. Timmis K.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide 5′-GATGTGCTGCAAGGCGATTAAGTTG-3′ was 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to 20 μg of total RNA prepared from E. coli MC4100 bearing pERD401 (Pu::lacZ fusion) and pTS174 (wild-type XylR) or pAD49 (XylRD135N), and grown in the absence or presence of m-methylbenzyl alcohol.RESULTSXylR Mutants That Stimulate Transcription in the Absence of Effectors: The Sequence Change of the xylR Mutant AllelesUsing the mutagenesis procedure (28Ramos J.L. Stolz A. Reineke W. Timmis K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8467-8471Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the screening strategy described under “Experimental Procedures,” two independent clones which carried a mutant xylR allele that encoded a regulator able to stimulate transcription in the absence of effectors were selected. The plasmids bearing the mutant alleles were called pAD6 and pAD49. In order to identify the mutation(s), the 2.5-kilobase HpaI fragment of these plasmids bearing the xylR alleles were subcloned and sequenced in pTZ19. The entire sequence of the xylR alleles from −170 to +1925 was determined. The mutant xylR allele borne by plasmid pAD49 exhibited a single base pair change at position 403 (G → A) from the A of the ATG start codon. The G → A change in codon 135 (GAT → AAT) should result in an Asp → Asn change in the polypeptide chain. The mutant protein was called XylRD135N. The mutant allele borne by pAD6 also exhibited a single base change at position 252 (C → T), this change in codon 85 should result in a Pro → Ser change in the polypeptide chain and the mutant protein was called XylRP85S.Expression from the Pu and Ps Promoters Mediated by the Mutant XylR Regulators and Their Effector ProfileThe amino-terminal domain of XylR and DmpR is involved in interactions with effectors (7Shingler V. Bartilson M. Moore T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shingler V. Moore T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Abril M.A. Michán C. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J.

Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8059-8062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).1 The two mutations located in this study were in this domain. To further confirm that these alleles encoded regulators with altered behavior with respect to that of the wild-type, plasmid pTS174 (encoding XylR wild-type), pAD6 (encoding XylRP85S), and pAD49 (encoding XylRD135N) were transformed in ET8000 (pRD579) (Pu::lacZ) and ET8000 (pAH100) (Ps::lacZ), and β-galactosidase activity was measured in the absence of effectors and in the presence of 1 mMm-methylbenzyl alcohol, o-nitrotoluene (two effectors for the wild-type XylR), and m-nitrotoluene, an aromatic that does not activate XylR (Table 1). The results showed that in the absence of effectors, XylRD135N and XylRP85S mediated 8- and 6-fold higher basal level expression than the wild-type regulator from the Pu promoter, and expression was as much as 16- and 7-fold higher, respectively, with the Ps promoter. These results confirm that both mutant regulators stimulate transcription from cognate promoters in the absence of effectors.Table I Open table in a new tab In the presence of m-methylbenzyl alcohol and o-nitrotoluene the wild-type XylR regulator stimulated transcription from Pu and Ps between 5- and 10-fold (Table 1), while with m-nitrotoluene the basal level not only did not increase, but dropped to one-half. The high basal transcription level mediated by the XylRD135N regulator from the Pu promoter increased 2-fold in response to the addition of the three aromatics noted above. These results suggest that XylRD135N is not only able to stimulate transcription in the absence of effectors, but is also able to recognize them and produce an additional transcription stimulus. However, when similar assays were done with XylRD135N and the Ps::lacZ fusion, although the basal level of expression in the absence of effectors was high, this level did not increase in response to the presence of the effectors (Table 1).Since the mutant XylRE172K had been described before (11Delgado A. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8059-8062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as able to activate transcription from Pu with m-nitrotoluene, a hybrid protein XylRD135N/E172K was constructed in vitro, and its ability to stimulate transcription in vivo from Pu and Ps fused to lacZ was tested. The double mutant protein XylRD135N/E172K was not able to mediate transcription from the Pu and Ps promoters in the absence of effectors (Table 1), however, it was able to stimulate transcription from the Pu and the Ps promoters in the presence of o- and m-nitrotoluene (Table 1). The XylRD135N/E172K mutant recognized only weakly m-methylbenzyl alcohol.The XylRP85S mutant showed an effector profile similar to the wild-type protein. The high basal transcription levels mediated by this regulator from Pu and Ps increased approximately 2-fold in response to the addition of m-methylbenzyl alcohol and o-nitrotoluene (Table 1). Interestingly, β-galactosidase activity expressed from Pu and Ps and mediated by XylRP85S in the presence of m-nitrotoluene was about one-half of the β-galactosidase activity measured in the absence of aromatic compounds (Table 1), a fact also observed with the wild-type regulator. Therefore, m-nitrotoluene seems to act as an inhibitor of transcription stimulation mediated by XylR and XylRP85S, but apparently behaves as a positive effector for XylRD135N, XylRE172K, and the double mutant XylRD135N/E172K.The stimulation of transcription from Pu by XylRD135N and XylRP85S in the absence of effectors was further confirmed when the transcription initiation point of the Pu promoter was determined by primer extension. The transcript expressed from Pu was observed both in the absence and presence of m-methylbenzyl alcohol when the cell bore the xylR allele encoding XylRD135N or XylRP85S, whereas with the wild-type regulator it was only seen in the presence of the aromatic compound. The transcription initiation point in all cases was always the same, and matched that determined by Inouye et al.(29Inouye S. Nakazawa A. Nakazawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1688-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The results obtained with the wild-type regulator and mutant XylRD135N are presented in Fig. 2.Figure 2:Induction of mRNA synthesis from Pu by the wild-type XylR and mutant XylRD135N. E. coli pERD401(Pu::lacZ) bearing pTS174 (XylR) or pAD49 (XylRD135N) were grown overnight on LB medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. Bacterial cells were diluted 1/100 in the same fresh medium, and after 1 h of cell growth, two aliquots were taken; one sample was supplemented with 5 mMm-methylbenzyl alcohol. After 30 min, samples were withdrawn for mRNA analyses. Primer extension analysis was done by hybridizing 20 μg of total RNA to a 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to the Pu-derived transcript(3Marqués S. Ramos J.L. Timmis K.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The extended products (indicated by an arrow) were 134 nucleotides and were separated in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. mRNA was prepared from the following cultures: Lanes 1 and 2, E. coli (pERD401, pTS174); in the absence (lane 1) and in the presence (lane 2) of the effector.

The first two sites are recognized by the corresponding host proteins, whereas the UASs are targets for the XylR regulator, which is encoded in cis by the TOL plasmid. To examine whether the host elements σ54 and IHF were required for transcriptional activation from the wild-type Pu promoter with XylRD135N and XylRP85S, transcription from the wild-type Pu promoter was estimated in isogenic σ54+, σ54-, IHF+, and IHF− backgrounds.Figure 3:Activation of Pu and mutant Pu in different IHF isogenic backgrounds. E. coli S90C (IHF+) and E. coli DBP101 (IHF−) were transformed with the Apr plasmid bearing the wild-type or mutant Pu::lacZ fusion indicated below, together with the Cmr plasmids pTS174 or pAD49, which encode for XylR and XylRD135N, respectively. Bacteria were grown in the presence (+) and absence(-) of 1 mMm-methylbenzyl alcohol. Other details are given under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend of Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stimulation of transcription by XylRD135N, XylRP85S, and by wild-type XylR from the Pu and Ps promoters was not observed in the σ54-deficient background provided by ET8045, either in the presence or absence of m-methylbenzyl alcohol. In fact, in all assays β-galactosidase activity was below 15 Miller units. This contrasted with the full transcriptional stimulation in the isogenic σ54+ ET8000 background with the wild-type regulator activated by m-methylbenzyl alcohol and the mutant regulators, both in the presence and absence of this aromatic (see Table 1). These results confirm the dependence on σ54 of transcription activation from Pu.Abril et al.(10Abril M.A. Buck M. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15832-15838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and de Lorenzo et al.(20de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that in an IHF− background, the level of transcription stimulation from Pu by effector-activated XylR was about 10-25% of the level in an IHF+ background. These results were confirmed in the present study: the level of effector-activated wild-type XylR-dependent expression from Pu in an IHF− background was about 10% of that determined in the IHF+ background (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained when the XylRP85S regulator was used instead of the wild-type regulator (not shown). In contrast, in the IHF− background provided by E. coli DPB101, expression from Pu::lacZ with XylRD135N in the absence of effector was as high as 65% of the maximal level in an IHF+ background (Fig. 3). Furthermore, in the presence of effector, the level of expression from Pu in an IHF− background was as high as 83% of the maximal level of expression from Pu in an IHF+ background. Therefore, it seems that XylRD135N is not only able to stimulate transcription from the Pu promoter in the absence of effectors, but is also able to overcome the IHF requirement.To further confirm this finding, we determined activation from mutant Pu promoters exhibiting an insertion of 2 or 8 bp within the IHF binding site. The mutant promoters were fused to a promoterless lacZ to yield plasmid pERD415 (Pu▾2bp::lacZ) and plasmid pERD416 (Pu▾8bp::lacZ) and these plasmids were transformed in IHF− and IHF+ backgrounds with XylR or XylRD135N. β-Galactosidase activity was then determined in the absence and presence of m-methylbenzyl alcohol (Fig. 3). As expected, in the IHF+ and IHF− backgrounds, only low levels of transcription from Pu▾8bp::lacZ and Pu▾2bp::lacZ were found with wild-type XylR, regardless of the presence of effectors. In contrast, the level of β-galactosidase expressed from these mutant promoters in IHF− and IHF+ backgrounds with XylRD135N was between 27 and 47% of the maximal level of expression determined for the wild-type regulator and the level of β-galactosidase was always higher in the presence of effectors. These results confirm that transcription from Pu mediated by XylRD135N abolishes the need for accessory DNA-binding IHF protein.Role of the UASs in the Pu Promoter in Transcription Regulation Mediated by the XylRD135N and XylRP85S RegulatorTwo independent motifs needed for transcription stimulation from Pu were defined within the UAS sequences, namely UAS1 from −160 to −180, and UAS2 from −120 to −140(10Abril M.A. Buck M.

https://openalex.org/W2049746692,"The production of cholesteryl ester (CE) by lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) is elevated significantly in hyperlipidemic subjects at high risk for coronary artery disease. To elucidate the molecular events involved, the relationship between LCAT activation and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I charge and structure in high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been studied in both native HDL and homogeneous recombinant HDL (Lp2A-I) particles containing apoA-I, palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. Increasing the cholesterol content of discoidal Lp2A-I from 4 to 26 molecules/particle raises the maximum rate of cholesterol esterification by LCAT (Vmax) from 3.1 to 9.2 nmol CE/h/unit of LCAT and increases the apparent Km from 0.5 to 3.5 μM cholesterol. Similarly, increasing the cholesterol content in triolein core-containing Lp2A-I (4-18 molecules/particle) and in native HDL3 (12-21 molecules/particle) also significantly increases the Vmax for LCAT (2.8-7.7 and 0.5-3.6 nmol CE/h, respectively) and raises the Km values (7.6-36.9 and 7.3-8.5 μM cholesterol, respectively). In contrast, changes in the cholesterol content of native and recombinant HDL have no significant effect on the apparent Km values when expressed in terms of the concentration of either apoA-I or palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine. This appears to indicate that interfacial cholesterol content has no effect on the binding affinity of LCAT to different LpA-I particles but directly affects catalysis by modulating the interaction of cholesterol molecules with the active site of LCAT. Increasing the cholesterol content of the different HDL particles progressively increases the particle net negative charge, and these changes in apoA-I charge are strongly correlated with both the Vmax and apparent Km values for LCAT. This suggests that the conformation and charge of apoA-I play a central role in LCAT activation and that these parameters are influenced by the amount of cholesterol in the surface of HDL particles."

Putative response elements in footprints I and III were not analyzed except the AP2 binding site in footprint III, which could be protected by purified AP2 protein. Footprint II contains four sites corresponding to half of the NF-I consensus sequence, but DNA mobility shift assays indicate that this footprint binds two proteins distinct from NF-I: a ubiquitous CP1-related factor and another novel factor, termed α-Adrenergic Receptor Transcription Factor (αARTF), which binds to two separate sites in this region. The αARTF is widely distributed, with the highest amounts found in brain, followed by liver, kidney, lung, and spleen, but no detectable activity in heart.

https://openalex.org/W2151933170,"Previous investigations of the role of Ca2+ in stimulus-secretion coupling have been undertaken in populations of adrenal chromaffin cells. In the present study, the simultaneous detection of intracellular Ca2+, with the fluorescent probe fura-2, and catecholamine release, using a carbon-fiber microelectrode, are examined at single chromaffin cells in culture. Results from classic depolarizing stimuli, high potassium (30-140 mM) and 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (3-50 μM), show a dependence of peak cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and catecholamine release on secretagogue concentration. Catecholamine release induced by transient high K+ stimulation increases logarithmically with K+ concentration.

The bovine adrenal chromaffin cell releases the catecholamine hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine in this way. Although the details of the exocytotic mechanism remain unclear at the molecular level, calcium influx is known to be an essential trigger for the exocytotic process in adrenal chromaffin and other cells(7Douglas W.W.

Cytosolic free Ca2+ can be increased in two ways: depolarizing stimuli can increase cytosolic Ca2+ via influx of extracellular Ca2+ through calcium channels (9Burgoyne R.D. Biochim. Biophys.

One reason for this controversy is that measurements of catecholamine release and Ca2+ entry are often made in separate cell preparations. Measurements in populations may conceal certain effects due to heterogeneity within cell populations, as shown recently with Ca2+/fura-2 measurements(15Cheek T.R. O'Sullivan A.J. Moreton R.B.

Thus, to further define the role of Ca2+ in exocytosis, it is necessary that the elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ and concomitant secretion be quantitated and simultaneously correlated at single cells. Measurements of intracellular Ca2+ in single cells are possible with fluorescent probes(16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

The results presented in this paper show that catecholamine release, resolved at the level of single cultured cells, correlates well with cytosolic free Ca2+ levels when classical depolarizing secretagogues, which cause Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels, are employed. In contrast, agents which liberate Ca2+ from caffeine-sensitive or IP3 1The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol trisphosphateDMPP1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium. -sensitive stores(3Kao L-S Schneider A.S.

These agents can induce exocytotic secretion in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in some cells. Other cells do not exhibit secretion even in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ when cytosolic free Ca2+ is elevated by release of an intracellular store.

Primary cultures of bovine adrenal medullary cells were prepared from fresh tissue(25Leszczyszyn D.A. Jankowski J.A. Viveros O.H. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Near J.A. Wightman R.M. J.

All experiments were performed at room temperature between days 3 and 8 of culture. For all experiments the culture medium was replaced with Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM glucose, and 20 mM HEPES. Either 2 mM CaCl2 or 0.2 mM EGTA (to give a free extracellular Ca2+ level < 10−8M) (31Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was added to achieve the desired Ca2+ content, and all solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. All experiments were performed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 35, Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). When veratridine was employed, a small volume of concentrated stock solution was added to the plate at the indicated time. Other secretagogues were locally applied for 3-5 s every 2 min via pressure ejection from glass micropipettes using a Picospritzer (General Valve Corp., Fairfield, NJ). When potassium was used as a secretagogue, the concentration of NaCl in the pipette was reduced to maintain osmolarity. Carbon-fiber microelectrodes were prepared by sealing individual fibers (5-μm radius, Thornell P-55, Amoco Corp., Greenville, SC) into glass pipettes with epoxy (Epon 828 Resin and m-phenylenediamine hardener, MillerStephenson, Danbury, CT). Electrodes were polished at a 45° angle on a micropipette beveller (model BV-10, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and then soaked in 2-propanol for at least 15 min before use(32Kawagoe K.T. Zimmerman J.B. Wightman R.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Calibrations were performed using a flow-injection apparatus with 50 μM epinephrine(24Schroeder T.J. Jankowski J.A. Senyshyn J. Holz R. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17215-17220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amperometric measurements (Eapplied = +650 mV versus sodium-saturated calomel electrode) employed an EI-400 potentiostat (Ensman Instrumentation, Bloomington, IN) in two-electrode mode. The carbon-fiber working electrodes were positioned 1 μm away from the cell with a piezoelectric driver (PCS-1000 Patch Clamp Manipulator, Burleigh Instruments, Fishers, NY) as described previously(22Schroeder T.J. Jankowski J.A. Kawagoe K.T. Wightman R.M. Lefrou C. Amatore C. Anal. Chem. 1992; 64: 3077-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This arrangement has been shown to measure secretion from a region extending 2 μm beyond the carbon-fiber perimeter(24Schroeder T.J. Jankowski J.A. Senyshyn J. Holz R. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17215-17220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amperometric electrode responses were low pass filtered at 16.67 kHz, digitized using a PCM-2 A/D VCR Adaptor (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY), and recorded on 1/2 inch videotape. For analysis, the data was low-pass filtered at 25 Hz (Krohn-Hite 3750, Avon, MA), digitized at 20 ms/point using a NIC-310 oscilloscope (Nicolet Instrument Corp., Madison, WI), and imported into a personal computer. Locally written software was used to determine the area under the current versus time traces for 60 s following secretagogue delivery. In this way the quantity of catecholamine released under the electrode from a single exposure to a secretagogue was evaluated. Charge can be related to the number of moles of catecholamine detected with Faraday's law: Q=nFm(Eq. 1) where Q = area under the current versus time trace for 60 s following secretagogue delivery (charge, in coulombs), F = Faraday's constant (96,485 coulombs/equivalent), n = number of electrons passed in reaction/mol (n = 2 for catecholamine), and m = total number of moles of catecholamine detected by electrode. Chromaffin cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 1 μM fura-2 AM (stock solution dissolved in 20% Pluronic F-127 in Me2SO), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mM Ca2+ for 30 min at room temperature. Culture plates were rinsed twice and refilled with buffer with the desired Ca2+ content. Single cells were selected for fluorescence measurement using a 43-μm pinhole aperture with the EMPIX Photometer System (Mississaugua, Canada). Cells were alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm, and light was collected through a 40 × oil-immersion objective (Fluar 40 X, Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) (31Jankowski J.A. Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To reduce photobleaching, a 0.5 neutral density filter was placed between the excitation source and sample, and fluorescence was sampled every 250 ms. Since the presence of the microelectrode induced considerable autofluorescence and some reflectance, it was necessary to correct the measured fluorescence intensities. Data were not corrected for cell autofluorescence because it could not be measured at the specific cells used. Autofluorescence is significant; however, it was found to vary from cell to cell, and its contribution to the measured signal leads to an underestimate of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. The corrected fluorescence values were ratioed (F340/F380) and estimates of intracellular Ca2+ concentration were calculated using a previously published method(16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Errors for fluorescent and electrochemical measurement are given as standard errors of the mean. Culture medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium, was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Collagenase (Type I) for digestion of gland tissue was obtained from Worthington Biochemical (Freehold, NJ). Renografin-60 was purchased from Squibb Diagnostics (New Brunswick, NJ). Fura-2 AM, free acid, and Pluronic-F127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma, and solutions were prepared with doubly distilled water. Fig. 1 shows the Ca2+ response (upper trace) and catecholamine release (lower trace) induced by 3-s delivery of 60 mM K+ repeated at 2-min intervals. A steady-state, low cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and no exocytotic events were exhibited at cells before the stimuli were applied. Upon application of K+, the fluorescent ratio from fura-2 rose rapidly, and current spikes from the exocytotic release of catecholamine were observed in a parallel time course. After the cytosolic free Ca2+ reached a maximal concentration, a slower decline in the fluorescent ratio commenced. At this time, the frequency of exocytotic spikes decreased until cytosolic free Ca2+ fell below the threshold required to maintain exocytosis and catecholamine spikes ceased. The shift in base line observed after stimulation in the electrochemical traces is due to the overlap of many catecholamine spikes. Fig. 2 shows both Ca2+ influx and catecholamine release at a single cell exposed to various concentrations of K+. The mean total charge due to catecholamine release detected from a single exposure to 140 mM K+ was 385 ± 36 pC (corresponding to 2.0 ± 0.19 fmol of catecholamine) and the mean apparent maximal cytosolic Ca2+ was 330 ± 23 nM. The maximal free Ca2+ and catecholamine secretion were found to be dose dependent as application of 30 mM K+ elicited 39 ± 9.6% of the mean apparent maximal cytosolic Ca2+ response and only 4.2 ± 9.4% of the release of that from 140 mM K+. Transient delivery of 20 mM or 10 mM K+, by pressure ejection, did not elicit detectable secretion or changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ from basal level. Pooled results of the maximal cytosolic Ca2+ and catecholamine release from six cells are plotted versus log K+ in Fig. 3.Figure 3:Dose response of peak cytosolic free Ca2+ and catecholamine release versus log [K+]. A, plot of peak cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration versus log [K+]. B, plot of catecholamine release versus log [K+]. A linear regression is fit to the portion of the curve where K+ is sufficient to cause catecholamine release (r = 0.982). In all cases, the results were normalized to those obtained with 140 mM K+. Each data point is from duplicate stimulations at six cells. Error bars are the standard errors of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 4 shows the concentration dependence of cytosolic free Ca2+ and catecholamine secretion for a single cell exposed to DMPP, a nicotinic agonist known to trigger Ca2+ influx. As with high K+, increasing the secretagogue concentration increased resultant cytosolic free Ca2+ and catecholamine responses. Delivery of 3 μM DMPP resulted in 48 ± 7.9% of the maximal apparent cytosolic Ca2+ response and 12 ± 9.6% of the catecholamine release found with 50 μM DMPP (232 ± 17 nM and 535 ± 50 pC (2.8 ± 0.26 fmol of catecholamine), respectively). The durations of both cytosolic free Ca2+ elevation and catecholamine release from DMPP are longer than those for K+ (45-80 s versus 25-60 s). Preliminary experiments showed that transient (3 s) exposure of cells to 100 μM veratridine did not effect cytosolic free Ca2+ or induce catecholamine release. Therefore, veratridine, an agent that activates plasma membrane Na+ channels(18Sorimachi M. Yamagami K. Yada T. Nishimura S. Jpn. J. Phys. 1989; 39: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Ohta M. Narahashi T. Keeler R.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1973; 184: 143-154PubMed Google Scholar), was added to the entire culture plate at the time indicated on the trace to give the desired concentration. Fig. 5 shows the results induced by veratridine following a 3-s application of 60 mM K+ to confirm viability of the cell. Veratridine (50 μM) was found to cause oscillations in the internal Ca2+ concentration (from apparent basal levels of 40 nM to approximately 85 nM) which were insufficient to cause significant catecholamine release (n = 7 cells). Oscillations of free Ca2+ were suppressed, and intracellular Ca2+ was returned to basal levels by transient application of 10 μM tetrodotoxin (data not shown). Upon increasing the veratridine concentration to 100 μM, Ca2+ oscillations increased in magnitude and frequency and catecholamine release began to parallel this pattern in five of the eight cells (Fig. 5, inset). Two cells required 200 μM to cause release to mimic the cytosolic free Ca2+ transients. After about 90 s of simultaneous oscillatory behavior, the cell cytosolic free Ca2+ and catecholamine release reached a sustained elevated state. The final state of high activity continued for several minutes. In one cell sequentially exposed to 50, 100, and 150 μM veratridine, an increase in the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations was noted with increased veratridine, but exocytotic release never occurred. In this cell, the maximal cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations during the oscillations remained low. Caffeine pressure ejected in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ was found to induce a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ and exocytotic catecholamine release in single cells (Fig. 6A). Regardless of the order of delivery, 40 mM caffeine always elicited larger fura-2/Ca2+ response and catecholamine release than did 10 mM. The cytosolic free Ca2+ responses induced by caffeine in Ca2+-containing medium consisted of two phases: a rapid transient, attributed to Ca2+ expulsion from internal stores, and a longer lasting plateau due to influx of extracellular Ca2+(11Cheek T.R. Moreton R.B. Berridge M.J. Stauderman K.A. Murawsky M.M. Bootman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27076-27083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second phase was not apparent in Ca2+-free medium. Results from repetitive stimulations of caffeine remained consistent, with only slightly diminished peak cytosolic free Ca2+ values in five cells. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (0.2 mM EGTA), the first application of 10 mM or 40 mM caffeine always elicited a fast increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ and exocytotic release (Fig. 6B). Subsequent stimulations of either concentration resulted in a smaller peak cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and very little or no release of catecholamine (n = 7 cells). A third stimulation with caffeine could not elicit any cytosolic free Ca2+ rise or catecholamine release. A 3-s application of 10 μM DMPP with 2 mM Ca2+ after the caffeine applications verified that the exocytotic machinery of the cell was still intact and served to refill caffeine-sensitive stores as subsequent exposure to 10 mM caffeine showed restored cytosolic free Ca2+ elevation with simultaneous catecholamine release (Fig. 6B). Individual cells were examined in media with and without Ca2+ to examine the effect of bradykinin, which activates B2-bradykinin receptors present on bovine chromaffin cells and elevates intracellular IP3 levels which induce a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+(34O'Sullivan A.J.

Several different patterns in the responses of cytosolic free Ca2+ and catecholamine release were obtained in the present study (Fig. 7). In medium with 0.2 mM EGTA, 4 out of 15 cells showed both cytosolic free Ca2+ increase and robust catecholamine release from delivery of 200 nM bradykinin (Fig. 7A). The release in these cases was often longer in duration and larger in quantity (pC) compared to release induced by 60 mM K+ with 2 mM Ca2+ at the same cell. Like caffeine, the cells which did exhibit release only did so for the first exposure indicating that the bradykinin-sensitive internal Ca2+ store is also quickly depleted. Of the cells that did not release catecholamine, one had a long lasting, substantial rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ (Fig. 7B). The remaining 10 cells showed neither Ca2+ influx nor secretion of catecholamine even though cell viability was substantiated with high K+ deliveries before and after bradykinin (Fig. 7C). When 2 mM Ca2+ was present in the extracellular media, 60% of the cells studied behaved as depicted in Fig. 7A. In this work we have combined fluorescent detection of cytosolic free Ca2+ with electrochemical measurement of catecholamine release at the single cell level to correlate responses to various chemical agents. The methods employed leave the cell membrane unperturbed thus providing a more physiological view of biochemical changes induced in the cell by various secretagogues. The microelectrode reports exocytotic events that occur in the region of the cell membrane directly beneath it(24Schroeder T.J. Jankowski J.A. Senyshyn J. Holz R. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17215-17220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The use of fura-2 AM allows measurement of whole cell cytosolic Ca2+ without the complication of washout of endogenous Ca2+ buffers(37Neher E. Augustine G.J. J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 273-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), although, like all chelating fluorescence probes, it may buffer the internal concentration changes that occur(38Sala F. Hernandez-Cruz A. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 39Nowycky M.C. Pinter M.J. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 77-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40Yamada W.M. Zucker R.S. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The general picture that emerges is that exocytotic secretion in each cell is tightly coupled to an elevation of intracellular Ca2+. However, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ is not sufficient to cause release; rather, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration must exceed a threshold before release occurs. This is the case whether Ca2+ elevation is induced by transmembrane entry or by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Transient exposure of a single cell to agents which cause membrane depolarization lead to a concentration-dependent increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ coupled with catecholamine secretion by exocytosis. Both effects are more short lived with elevated K+, which causes direct depolarization of the cell membrane, than with DMPP, which acts via the nicotinic receptor. However, in both cases the results are consistent with vesicular release triggered by entry of extracellular Ca2+ (41) via voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels(9Burgoyne R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 174-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Release and elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ remain quite similar with six repetitive exposures to K+, although the maximal free Ca2+ concentration decreases slightly with stimulation number, perhaps due to habituation of Ca2+ channels(42Martin P.T. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol."
https://openalex.org/W2019656758,"To study the biogenesis of ISP6, an outer membrane component of the mitochondrial protein translocation complex, two fusion proteins have been made by fusing ISP6 to either the carboxyl- or amino-terminal end of the mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In vitro import experiments showed that when DHFR was placed at the carboxyl-terminal end of ISP6, the resulting fusion protein 6-DHFR inserted into mitochondrial membrane less efficiently than the other form of the fusion proteins. In vivo this fusion protein lost its ability to suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of an isp42 mutant, while the other fusion protein DHFR-6, which was found targeted correctly to mitochondria, suppressed the mutant as well as the wild-type ISP6. Further analysis showed that the binding and insertion of DHFR-6 to mitochondrial outer membrane was not affected by deletion of either of the two mitochondrial protein receptors or by the predigestion of mitochondrial surface proteins prior to import. Additional data indicated that ISP42, which closely associates with ISP6 in the translocation complex, does not likely play the role of a targeting partner for ISP6. In summary, these data suggest that ISP6 may target to mitochondria by sequences at its carboxyl terminus and that the import process of ISP6 is most likely distinct from that of most other mitochondrial precursors, which are recognized by protein receptors on mitochondrial surface.

In summary, these data suggest that ISP6 may target to mitochondria by sequences at its carboxyl terminus and that the import process of ISP6 is most likely distinct from that of most other mitochondrial precursors, which are recognized by protein receptors on mitochondrial surface. INTRODUCTIONThe biogenesis of mitochondria depends on the synthesis and correct localization of a large number of proteins from the cytoplasm. This requires both the action of specific signals on the mitochondrial precursor proteins to direct them to their correct suborganellar location as well as the function of receptor complexes on the surface of the organelle (Schatz, 1993; Stuart et al., 1993). Studies from different groups have now documented the presence of a dynamic receptor complex, which is required for the import of different classes of mitochondrial precursors (Pfanner et al., 1992; Segui et al., 1993). Both antibody-subfragment blocking studies and gene disruption experiments have shown that the receptor elements termed MAS70/MOM72 and MAS20/MOM19 define the key components of the receptor complex, which are responsible for the efficient import of essentially all mitochondrial precursors (Hines et al., 1990; Sollner et al., 1989, 1990; Moczko et al., 1994). Although yeast strains that harbor simultaneous deletions of MAS70 and MAS20 fail to grow (Ramage et al., 1993), recent studies show they can adapt and grow normally. This suggests that yeast may contain additional genes encoding potential receptor elements on the mitochondrial surface that may not be normally expressed (Lithgow et al., 1994).The parallel action of the MAS70 and MAS20 receptors in the receptor complex direct bound precursor proteins to a common translocation pore. This pore consists of the outer membrane protein ISP42, which has been shown by independent criteria to directly participate in the translocation of proteins across the membrane bilayer. Earlier studies from this laboratory have identified a small protein, ISP6, which is associated with ISP42 (Kassenbrock et al., 1993). Early characterization of this protein has revealed that it is necessary for the function of temperature-sensitive alleles of ISP42. These studies are consistent with a function for ISP6 as one which is necessary to stabilize ISP42 so that either ISP42 is properly assembled into the translocation site or that the gating of ISP42 is assisted by this small protein (Hartmann et al., 1994).In the present study, we have examined the biogenesis of the ISP6 protein. This particular protein is very small. It is only 61 amino acids in length and anchors specifically to the mitochondrial outer membrane by a carboxyl-terminal anchor (Kassenbrock et al., 1993). The delivery and interaction of small proteins into different intracellular membranes is of interest since several recently identified small carboxyl-terminal anchored membrane proteins are essential in biogenesis or function of membrane translocation complexes in endoplasmic reticulum and synaptic membranes (Kutay et al., 1993; Dobberstein, 1994). In the case of the mitochondrial outer membrane, the identification of ISP6 in association with ISP42 provides an example of such a protein in association with an intracellular translocation complex. One noteworthy aspect of small carboxyl-terminal anchored proteins is that their intracellular targeting appears to be determined by the sequences either adjacent to or a part of the carboxyl-terminal anchor domain (Kutay et al., 1993; Mitoma and Ito, 1992). If this is the case then, the mechanisms that operate for the targeting and localization of most other proteins do not appear to operate for the carboxyl-terminal anchored proteins. For example, the synthesis of these proteins must be essentially completed in order to make the signals available for localization. Thus, the delivery mechanism for these proteins likely utilizes other proteins after synthesis to assist their correct insertion and assembly. The ISP6 provides an interesting model for analysis of the components and mechanisms that operate for proper biogenesis of such a protein. In the present study, we have exploited the biochemical and genetic properties of ISP6 to define the basic features of its biogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrainsThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study were w303/a (ade2-1 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 12 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100), isp42-3 (Kassenbrock et al., 1993), YTJB5 (a leu2-3, 112 ΔURA3 His4-519 mas20::URA3), and LEYL6 (a ade2-1 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 12 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100 mas70::URA3). The Escherichia coli strain RR1 (supE44 hsdS20(rB—mB—) ara-14 proA2 lacY1 galK2 rpsL20 xyl-5 mtl-1) was used to amplify plasmids.Construction of PlasmidsFusion constructs containing mouse dihydrofolate reductase and ISP6 sequence were prepared from plasmid pBS-3S1-Stu-BamHI (Kassenbrock et al., 1993) and pT7-2:DHFR 1The abbreviation used is: DHFRdihydrofolate reductase. (Smagula and Douglas, 1988).To construct DHFR-6, primers DHFR-N-H (CGC AAG ATC GAT TCT AGA A) and DHFR-C-B (CAC GGA TCC GTC TTT CTT CTC GTA GAC) were used to amplify a fragment from pT7-2:DHFR containing the DHFR gene by polymerase chain reaction while deleting the termination codon and introducing a BamHI site at its 3′ end. This fragment was inserted between HindIII site and BamHI site of plasmid pBlueScript KS(-) to generate pBS-DHFR(ns). Another polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers 61-N-BAM (GCC GGA TCC AAA ATG GAC GGT ATG TTT) and M13(−20) forward to introduce a BamHI site just before first ATG of ISP6 gene from plasmid pBS-3S1-Stu-BamHI. This second fragment was then inserted into the BamHI site immediately after DHFR coding sequence in pBS-DHFR(ns). To transfer this fusion gene into pRS315gal, a derivative of pRS315 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989), which contains a 685-base pair EcoRI-BamHI fragment of GAL1 and GAL10 promoters (Johnston and Davis, 1984), the 1.2-kilobase pair fragment generated after digestion of pBS-DHFR-6 with XbaI was then inserted into XbaI site of pRS315gal with the orientation of 5′ end of DHFR adjacent to the GAL 1 promoter.The strategy of constructing 6-DHFR was similar to above except primers 61-N-BAM/61-ORF (GCC GGG ATC CAA TTG TGG GGC CAA CAT) and DHFR-N-B (CAC GGA TCC CAT GGT TCG ACC ATT GAA C)/T7-LINK (GGC CAG TGT GAA TTC) were used to amplify fragments containing ISP6 and DHFR coding sequence, respectively.In Vitro Transcription and TranslationLinearized plasmid DNA was transcribed and further translated in vitro as described (Cyr and Douglas, 1991).Induction of Fusion Proteins and Subcellular FractionationYeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method (Schiestl and Gietz, 1989). The yeast strains to be induced first grew overnight in yeast nitrogen base dextrose medium that contained 0.5% dextrose, and then they were diluted into yeast nitrogen base galactose medium that contained 2% galactose and harvested with an A600nm between 3 and 5. Subcellular fractionation was done as described (Hase et al., 1984).Binding and Import of Labeled ProteinsLabeled proteins were incubated with 50 μg of isolated yeast mitochondria (Daun et al., 1982) or an equal amount of canine pancreatic microsomal membrane (Promega) in import buffer (Kassenbrock et al., 1993) in a 100-μl reaction at 25°C for 20 min. Then membranes were washed through 20% sucrose cushion and reisolated. Protein integrated in membrane was analyzed by alkaline extraction of the membranes (Kassenbrock et al., 1993). Protease pretreatment was done by incubating mitochondria with indicating concentration of protease K on ice for 30 min before sufficient inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. Then, mitochondria was reisolated and resuspended in import buffer to start import reaction as described above.RESULTSIn Vitro and in Vivo Expression of ISP6The ISP6 gene encodes a small membrane protein of 61 amino acids that contains a membrane-spanning domain near its carboxyl terminus (Kassenbrock et al., 1993). This yields an amphipathic protein that may be an important property for its function but makes it difficult for in vitro studies. In early attempts to generate in vitro forms of the protein for analysis of assembly and import, we observed that the small protein could only be translated in wheat germ extract but somehow not in reticulocyte lysate and that the resulting peptide was not soluble. It could be pelleted under the same conditions required for pelleting mitochondrial membranes and therefore was not suitable for biogenesis studies.In order to circumvent these problems and to yield a protein that could be monitored in import studies, gene fusions between a soluble protein, mouse DHFR, and ISP6 were constructed. Two different sets of constructions were prepared. First, DNA encoding the full-length ISP6 was fused in frame at the amino-terminal of the gene encoding mouse dihydrofolate reductase (6-DHFR). Second, the full-length ISP6 was fused at the carboxyl-terminal end of DHFR (DHFR-6). In each case (Fig. 1), these genes were placed in T3 promoter-based in vitro transcription-translation systems for the preparation of fusion proteins for in vitro studies. These same constructs were also placed in a yeast expression vector behind the Gal1 promoter for conditional expression of the gene product in yeast cells. In vitro translations of either the 6-DHFR or DHFR-6 gene products yielded proteins of the same size on SDS gels (data not shown).In the first set of experiments, the gene fusion products were utilized to examine the association of ISP6 present at either the amino-terminal end or the carboxyl-terminal end of DHFR to different membrane fractions. Earlier studies had demonstrated that the mouse DHFR, which is a cytoplasmic protein in the cell, was unable to associate with or target to mitochondria (Hurt et al., 1984). In vitro translated 6-DHFR or DHFR-6 were incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria and microsomes under standard conditions as shown in Fig. 2. Only the gene fusion product with ISP6 sequences located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the fusion protein associated strongly with mitochondria. When the level of gene fusion protein associated with mitochondria was quantitated, only 8% of the gene fusion product with ISP6 at the amino-terminal end (6-DHFR) remained with mitochondria, whereas 33% of the input DHFR-6 gene fusion product cofractionated with mitochondria under these same conditions. Both fusion proteins had the ability to associate with the isolated microsomal membranes, but at a reduced level compared with their association with mitochondria. These data support the earlier observation (Kassenbrock et al., 1993) that the ISP6 protein is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane by its carboxyl-terminal membrane anchor. In addition, the data also suggest that the insertion of the small protein into the membrane apparently is via its carboxyl-terminal end first.Figure 2:In vitro insertion of ISP6-DHFR fusion proteins into membranes. In vitro translated DHFR-6, 6-DHFR, as well as DHFR proteins were incubated without membrane (b), with 50 μg isolated mitochondria (c), or with equivalent amount of isolated microsomal membrane (d) in import buffer for 20 min at 25°C. The portion of input proteins resistant to Na2CO3 extraction after import was loaded on SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed as shown here. 20% of total input proteins is shown in a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the localization of the ISP6 protein in vivo, yeast shuttle vectors containing the gene fusions under the control of the Gal 1 promoter were introduced into wild-type strains, and the fate of the DHFR fusion protein was monitored. Following growth of yeast cells in the appropriate selective media, cell fractions were prepared for the quantitation of DHFR in different subcellular fractions. For a control in this study, the DHFR protein by itself was also expressed and monitored for its distribution. As shown in Fig. 3, all of the DHFR fusion expressed in yeast, which harbor the ISP6 sequences at the carboxyl-terminal end, was efficiently targeted and localized in the mitochondrial fraction. In contrast, like the DHFR protein itself, the DHFR fusion harboring ISP6 sequences at the amino-terminal end was localized exclusively to soluble fractions. We also observed that the incorrectly targeted 6-DHFR fusion product in these studies was more labile to degradation than the DHFR or DHFR-6 expressed under identical conditions. As a control for these in vivo studies, we also pulse labeled these proteins to confirm that the same level of DHFR-6 and 6-DHFR proteins were synthesized under these conditions (data not shown).Figure 3:In vivo subcellular localization of ISP6-DHFR fusion proteins. Yeast cells expressing indicating fusion proteins as well as DHFR were fractionated into mitochondria (M), crude microsomes (E), and cytosolic fraction (C). The level of the proteins associated with each fraction was examined by Western blot with anti-DHFR antibody and then quantitated. ∗, 6-DHFR was found degraded into a smaller fragment, which remains exclusively in cytosol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DHFR-6 But Not 6-DHFR Is Correctly Targeted in VivoThe in vivo distribution described above strongly implies, like the in vitro data, that the carboxyl-terminal localized ISP6 sequences are effective in targeting DHFR reporter to the mitochondrial fraction. In order to gain additional support for the correct targeting of this protein, we exploited the earlier observation that the isp42-3 allele, which is conditionally defective in protein import at 35°C, can be rescued by overexpression of the wild-type ISP6 protein (Kassenbrock et al., 1993). In each case, the two ISP6-DHFR gene fusions and DHFR itself were transformed into a yeast strain harboring the isp42-3 allele. When the resulting transformants were left to grow at nonpermissive temperature, only the strain expressing the DHFR fusion with ISP6 sequences at the carboxyl-terminal end was effective in supporting growth at high temperature (Fig. 4). These data provide additional support that the correct targeting of the DHFR gene fusion occurred even though it contained a DHFR domain at its amino terminus.Figure 4:Suppressor function of ISP6-DHFR fusion proteins. Temperature-sensitive mutant isp42-3 cells transformed with indicating fusion proteins were streaked on plates with inducing (YNBG) or noninducing (YNBD) carbon source and incubated at permissive (25°C) or nonpermissive (35°C) temperature for 10 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If oriented in the same manner as the ISP6 wild-type protein, DHFR-6 fusion should localize in such a way to the mitochondrial surface that it places the soluble DHFR domain on the cytoplasmic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane. To confirm the orientation of the fusion protein, the correctly targeted DHFR-6 fusion products associated with the mitochondria were further examined using proteolysis. As shown in Fig. 5, this analysis revealed that the DHFR domain present on the mitochondrial surface was readily accessible to added protease under the conditions in which cytochrome b2, a marker protein localized in the intermembrane space, was not accessible. This construct, therefore, renders the DHFR-6 gene fusion product a member of the carboxyl-terminal anchored protein family.Figure 5:Orientation of in vivo targeted DHFR-6 on mitochondria membrane. Mitochondria (100 μg) isolated from yeast cells expressing DHFR-6 protein were subjected to digestion by externally added protease K for 30 min on ice. After digestion, the levels of DHFR-6 and marker protein cytochrome b2 were examined by Western blot. As a control, in one reaction the mitochondria membrane was first solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 before protease K was added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mitochondrial Delivery in the Absence of Outer Membrane ReceptorsThe carboxyl-terminal targeted protein, ISP6, is a member of a new class of proteins in the cell, which clearly must be completed as a nascent protein before being properly localized (Kutay et al., 1993). In order to understand the extent to which different mitochondrial receptors operate in the delivery of ISP6, two experiments were performed. In the first, we exploited the genetic deletions of two mitochondrial outer membrane receptors, i.e. MAS20 and MAS70, that had been previously characterized (Ramage et al., 1993). In each case, we prepared mitochondria from yeast strain lacking one of the two receptors and incubated the labeled fusion proteins with these mitochondria (Fig. 6A). This experiment demonstrates that there was no difference between wild-type mitochondria and mitochondria depleted of either protein receptor. However, as expected, the import of F1α subunit precursor was greatly impaired in mitochondria isolated from ΔMAS20 strain. We transformed the mutant strains containing deletions in either MAS20 or MAS70 with the fusion construct and determined the extent to which the DHFR-6 was localized. We observed that the localization of the DHFR-6 under these conditions was identical in both strains (data not shown) and the same as wild type. Thus, the data above suggest that neither MAS20 or MAS70 plays a role in the sorting of ISP6.Figure 6:Role of proteinaceous receptors in the import of DHFR-6. A, DHFR-6 and F1α precursor were imported in vitro into 50 μg of mitochondria isolated from wild-type W303 strain and mutant strains deficient of receptor protein MAS70 or MAS20, respectively. B, isolated wild-type mitochondria (50 μg) were preincubated with indicating concentrations of protease K before the treated mitochondria were reisolated and mixed with translated DHFR-6 or pre-F1α in import buffer and incubated at 25°C for 20 min. The level of ISP42 associated with the predigested mitochondria was examined by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to further characterize this targeting, we determined if proteins exposed on the mitochondrial surface might be necessary for binding and insertion of ISP6 into isolated mitochondria. In this study, mitochondria were pretreated with protease prior to the import reaction to determine the consequences on import. As shown in Fig. 6B, we observed that mild digestion of isolated mitochondria with proteinase K yielded mitochondria that were unable to import presequence containing precursors such as the F1α subunit. Under these conditions and even at concentrations of the protease well above that required to inhibit import of F1 ATPase precursor (e.g. 200 μg/ml protease K), the binding and apparent insertion of DHFR-6 remained unchanged. To access the integrity of ISP42 under these conditions, we examined ISP42 by immunoblotting (Fig. 6B). This protein was effectively proteolyzed even at 10 μg/ml, and a smaller fragment was generated that was also gradually digested at higher protease levels. These data indicate that the targeting mechanism that operates for the carboxyl-terminal insertion of the ISP6 protein is by a mechanism not previously characterized.ISP42 Is Not Required for Delivery of ISP6In earlier studies, it was proposed that ISP6 might operate in vivo to stabilize the ISP42 protein in its assembly and or dynamics for correct precursor translocation activity. One possibility for the targeting of ISP6 might be that its assembly with ISP42 in the outer membrane was acting to promote the specific delivery in some manner. To test this model, antibodies against either carboxyl-terminal end, amino-terminal end, and full length of ISP42 were prebound to mitochondria to block association of the DHFR-6 fusion protein. Under these conditions, the insertion was not affected (data not shown) in any detectable manner.In earlier studies, we have determined that the in vitro import of proteins into an ISP42-ts mutant can be efficiently blocked at higher temperature under conditions in which similar import into the wild-type mitochondria remains unchanged (Kassenbrock et al., 1993). To determine if the absence of functional ISP42 might influence the association of ISP6 with mitochondrial membrane, we exploited the lability of the isp42-3 mutant. In this experiment, mitochondria preparations from ISP42 wild type and the isp42-3 temperature-sensitive mutant were held at the nonpermissive temperature for 10 min prior to the initiation of the in vitro import reaction. Under these conditions, we observe that the import of the DHFR-6 protein was not affected in the isp42-ts mutant when compared with the wild type (Fig. 7).Figure 7:Role of ISP42 in the import of DHFR-6. Mitochondria isolated from wild-type strain (WT) or ts mutant isp42-3 (50 μg each) were preincubated at different temperatures for 10 min before labeled DHFR-6 or F1α precursor was added and incubated for another 20 min at the same temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On the other hand, when the integrity of ISP42 in the protease pretreated mitochondria was examined (Fig. 6B), we found that DHFR-6 fusion protein inserted efficiently into mitochondrial outer membrane even after more than 90% of ISP42 was proteolyzed (protease K concentration at 200 μg/ml). Thus, all of the data suggest that ISP42 unlikely functions as a targeting partner to DHFR-6 fusion protein.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have examined the biogenesis of ISP6 and have observed some unusual features of its targeting. Introduction of DHFR domain at the carboxyl-terminal end of ISP6 completely abolished the ability of the resulting 6-DHFR to target and function appropriately in vivo. On the other hand, efficient insertion of DHFR-6 to mitochondrial outer membrane does not require the involvement of proteinaceous receptors, such as MAS20 and MAS70. ISP42, which forms a multiprotein complex with ISP6 on mitochondria outer membrane, does not likely play a role in targeting of ISP6.Based on the observations described here, ISP6 appears to belong to a new membrane protein class that possesses a hydrophobic segment near the carboxyl terminus that orients it with its amino terminus in the cytosol (Kutay et al., 1994). Among the two forms of ISP6-DHFR fusion proteins, only DHFR-6 with its native carboxyl-terminal end can target itself to its correct destination and maintain its suppresser function for the isp42-3 mutant. However, the targeting information seems to be disrupted in the construct 6-DHFR, in which the DHFR domain was placed at the carboxyl terminus of ISP6. Therefore, ISP6 appears to rely on sequences that must be correctly presented near the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. This is very similar to the carboxyl-terminal anchored proteins, which are found directed to their subcellular destinations by the sequences either adjacent to or inside the carboxyl-terminal anchor (Kutay et al., 1993; Mitoma and Ito, 1992; Nguyen et al., 1993).Control of the targeting specificity for carboxyl-terminal anchored proteins is of special importance since their hydrophobic tails have the potential to interact with different membranes. It has been shown that some of the carboxyl-terminal anchored proteins can insert into any membrane and even liposomes spontaneously in vitro (Mitoma and Ito, 1992; Janiak et al., 1994). The DHFR-6 fusion was also able to associate in vitro with membranes other than mitochondrial membrane, e.g. microsomal membranes, while at a reduced level when compared with its association with mitochondria. The fact that in vivo this protein targeted exclusively to mitochondria indicates that certain mechanisms are operating to ensure the specific delivery.However, import receptors previously described for entry of most mitochondrial precursors are apparently not required for entry of ISP6. The localization of ISP6 to mitochondrial outer membrane has been found unaffected in vivo and in vitro in yeast cells depleted of either MAS20 or MAS70 receptors. Furthermore, ISP6 can be effectively imported in vitro into mitochondrial outer membrane in which functional surface receptors have been eliminated. This form of receptor-independent targeting is very unusual and has been described for only a few mitochondrial precursor proteins (Hartl and Neupert, 1990). Among them, MOM19, the counterpart of MAS20 in Neurospora crassa, is the only example of such a protein on the outer membrane (Schneider et al., 1991). The biogenesis of Bcl-2, another carboxyl-terminal anchored protein, has been shown to associate with mitochondrial outer membrane via a mechanism yet to be confirmed (Nguyen et al., 1993; Janiak et al., 1994).The selective targeting and assembly of the components of any translocation machinery to its correct organelle membrane is an essential prerequisite to maintain the specific organization of a eukaryotic cell. For the ISP6 protein, it is not clear what is responsible for the specificity of this process since the common receptors operating for other components are not involved. Closely associated with ISP6 in the translocation complex, the ISP42 gene product was then speculated as a potential receptor to assist insertion of ISP6 through their assembly. In N. crassa mitochondria, MOM38, the homologue of ISP42 has been proposed to play such a role in the targeting of the master receptor MOM19 (Schneider et al., 1991). However, three observations described here show that ISP42 is probably not the receptor for the specific insertion of ISP6. 1) Prebound antibodies against ISP42 to mitochondria surface did not block the insertion of DHFR-6. 2) Import of DHFR-6 remains efficient in the mitochondria, which lost the translocation activity of ISP42. 3) Proteolysis of ISP42 did not inhibit the import of DHFR-6. Although ISP42 may not be the receptor that helps docking and inserting ISP6, the mitochondrial outer membrane may have other proteins that can be recognized by ISP6 and play such a role. The identification of the specific components residing on the outer membrane as well as the sequence requirements for the targeting of ISP6 are currently under investigation. INTRODUCTIONThe biogenesis of mitochondria depends on the synthesis and correct localization of a large number of proteins from the cytoplasm. This requires both the action of specific signals on the mitochondrial precursor proteins to direct them to their correct suborganellar location as well as the function of receptor complexes on the surface of the organelle (Schatz, 1993; Stuart et al., 1993). Studies from different groups have now documented the presence of a dynamic receptor complex, which is required for the import of different classes of mitochondrial precursors (Pfanner et al., 1992; Segui et al., 1993). Both antibody-subfragment blocking studies and gene disruption experiments have shown that the receptor elements termed MAS70/MOM72 and MAS20/MOM19 define the key components of the receptor complex, which are responsible for the efficient import of essentially all mitochondrial precursors (Hines et al., 1990; Sollner et al., 1989, 1990; Moczko et al., 1994). Although yeast strains that harbor simultaneous deletions of MAS70 and MAS20 fail to grow (Ramage et al., 1993), recent studies show they can adapt and grow normally. This suggests that yeast may contain additional genes encoding potential receptor elements on the mitochondrial surface that may not be normally expressed (Lithgow et al., 1994).The parallel action of the MAS70 and MAS20 receptors in the receptor complex direct bound precursor proteins to a common translocation pore. This pore consists of the outer membrane protein ISP42, which has been shown by independent criteria to directly participate in the translocation of proteins across the membrane bilayer. Earlier studies from this laboratory have identified a small protein, ISP6, which is associated with ISP42 (Kassenbrock et al., 1993). Early characterization of this protein has revealed that it is necessary for the function of temperature-sensitive alleles of ISP42. These studies are consistent with a function for ISP6 as one which is necessary to stabilize ISP42 so that either ISP42 is properly assembled into the translocation site or that the gating of ISP42 is assisted by this small protein (Hartmann et al., 1994).In the present study, we have examined the biogenesis of the ISP6 protein. This particular protein is very small. It is only 61 amino acids in length and anchors specifically to the mitochondrial outer membrane by a carboxyl-terminal anchor (Kassenbrock et al., 1993). The delivery and interaction of small proteins into different intracellular membranes is of interest since several recently identified small carboxyl-terminal anchored membrane proteins are essential in biogenesis or function of membrane translocation complexes in endoplasmic reticulum and synaptic membranes (Kutay et al., 1993; Dobberstein, 1994). In the case of the mitochondrial outer membrane, the identification of ISP6 in association with ISP42 provides an example of such a protein in association with an intracellular translocation complex. One noteworthy aspect of small carboxyl-terminal anchored proteins is that their intracellular targeting appears to be determined by the sequences either adjacent to or a part of the carboxyl-terminal anchor domain (Kutay et al., 1993; Mitoma and Ito, 1992). If this is the case then, the mechanisms that operate for the targeting and localization of most other proteins do not appear to operate for the carboxyl-terminal anchored proteins. For example, the synthesis of these proteins must be essentially completed in order to make the signals available for localization. Thus, the delivery mechanism for these proteins likely utilizes other proteins after synthesis to assist their correct insertion and assembly. The ISP6 provides an interesting model for analysis of the components and mechanisms that operate for proper biogenesis of such a protein. In the present study, we have exploited the biochemical and genetic properties of ISP6 to define the basic features of its biogenesis."

It consists of a hydrophilic subunit (IIABMan) and two transmembrane subunits (IICMan, IIDMan). The purified complex was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles by octyl glucoside dilution.

Uptake of hexoses and hexitols in bacteria is mediated by membrane protein complexes, the so-called enzymes II of the bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS). 1The abbreviations used are: PTSP-enolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase systemIICMan and IIDMantransmembrane subunits of the mannose transporterIIABManhydrophilic subunit of the mannose transporterIICBAMtlmannitol transporterHPrhistidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the PTSIICBGlctransmembrane subunit of the glucose transporterIIAGlccytoplasmic subunit of the glucose transporterptsH ptsI crrgenes coding for HPr, enzyme I and IIAGlcptsGgene encoding IICBGlcIPTGisopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosideDTTdithiothreitol. They couple vectorial translocation with phosphorylation of the transported solute. Coupling is tight unlike in eukaryotic cells where transport and phosphorylation of glucose are mediated by a sequential pair of enzymes (transporter and kinase). However, phosphorylation of cytoplasmic substrates without transport, e.g. of glucose derived from maltose within the cell, has also been observed (Thompson and Chassy, 1985; Thompson et al., 1985; Nuoffer et al., 1988). There exist 16 enzymes II of different substrate specificity in Escherichia coli. They are composed of three functional units (IIA, IIB, IIC, or IICD; for nomenclature see Saier and Reizer(1992)) which occur either as protein subunits or domains of a multidomain protein. The IIC unit spans the membrane several times. It contains the substrate binding site. The IIA and IIB units are hydrophilic. They sequentially transfer phosphoryl groups from the “high-energy” phosphoryl carrier protein phospho-HPr to the substrate on the IIC subunit. Phospho-HPr in turn is regenerated by P-enolpyruvate in a reaction catalyzed by enzyme I. The collective of phosphoproteins which have additional functions in metabolite transport, chemotaxis, and metabolic regulation constitute the bacterial phosphotransferase system (for reviews, see Meadow et al.(1990), Erni(1992), and Postma et al.(1993)). P-enolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system transmembrane subunits of the mannose transporter hydrophilic subunit of the mannose transporter mannitol transporter histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the PTS transmembrane subunit of the glucose transporter cytoplasmic subunit of the glucose transporter genes coding for HPr, enzyme I and IIAGlc gene encoding IICBGlc isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside dithiothreitol. The mannose transporter of the PTS has a broad substrate specificity for mannose, glucose, and related hexoses. In addition, it acts as a host factor required for infection of E. coli by bacteriophage λ (Elliott and Arber, 1978). It consists of three subunits (Fig. 1). The IICMan and IIDMan subunits form a tight transmembrane complex which is sufficient for penetration of phage λ DNA (Erni et al., 1987). For transport and phosphorylation of sugars, the third subunit, IIABMan, is also required. IIABMan is reversibly associated with the IICMan-IIDMan complex (Kd 5-10 nM). 2B. Erni, unpublished data. It consists of two hydrophilic domains IIAMan and IIBMan which are linked through a hinge peptide-rich in Ala and Pro (Erni, 1989). IIAMan and IIBMan each contain one phosphorylation site (His10 and His175) which relay the phosphoryl groups from HPr to the substrate on the IICMan-IIDMan complex. The isolated IIB domain together with the IICMan-IIDMan complex is sufficient for equilibrium phosphoryl exchange between Glc-6-P and Glc (Erni et al., 1989). Due to the complexity of the system comprising two cytoplasmic phosphoryl carrier proteins (enzyme I and HPr) in addition to the transporter, sugar phosphorylation rather than vectorial transport activity is measured in routine assays (Kundig and Roseman, 1971). Of all the purified PTS transporters only the mannitol transporter could be reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, so far (Elferink et al., 1990). The mannose transporter differs from the mannitol transporter in subunit composition and stoichiometry, chemistry of the active site, and protein structure. The molecular mechanism of vectorial solute transport and its coupling to phosphorylation are not understood. As a first step toward the elucidation of this process the mannose transporter was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and the vectorial transport and phosphorylation activity was measured. Also addressed was the question of substrate channeling (Srivastava and Bernhard, 1986; Srere, 1987; Welch and Easterby, 1994) between the transport and phosphorylation moieties, the hypotheses of transport regulation by the membrane potential (Reider et al., 1979; Robillard and Konings, 1981, 1982), and the proposition of a coupling of solute uptake with proton extrusion (Scarborough, 1985). To provide the soluble phosphoryl carrier proteins enzyme I and HPr, which are required in large amounts for the loading of proteoliposomes, a recombinant plasmid for their overexpression was constructed and methods for their purification are described. E. coli K-12 WA2127 is ptsG+manX−Y−Z−. WA2127ΔHIC is ptsG+manX−Y−Z−ptsH−ptsI−crr−. It was constructed by conjugative transfer into WA2127 of the ptsH ptsI crr deletion from strain UE7 (Hfr KL16 thi (ptsH ptsI crr) galR galP::Tn10; gift of W. Boos, University of Konstanz). Plasmid pTSPM8 encodes manY and manZ under the control of Ptac (Erni et al., 1987). The recombinant plasmid pTSHIC9 carries behind the Ptac promoter ptsH, ptsI, and crr encoding in this order HPr, enzyme I, and the IIAGlc subunit of the glucose transporter. pTSHIC9 was constructed from the expression vector pJF119HE (Fürste et al., 1986) and plasmid pDIA3206 (contains 11 kilobase E. coli chromosomal DNA carrying ptsH ptsI crr; de Reuse and Danchin(1988)) as follows. (i) A 9.1-kilobase SalI-BamHI fragment containing ptsH ptsI crr from pDIA3206 was inserted into the polylinker of pJF119HE. (ii) Extra DNA at the 3′ end of the ptsH ptsI crr coding region was deleted by BamHI and partial HpaI digestion of the plasmid followed by self-ligation of the desired 9.4-kilobase fragment. (iii) 5′ noncoding chromosomal DNA was deleted unidirectionally starting from the polylinker toward the 5′ end of ptsH (SalI and SphI digestion in the polylinker, unidirectional deletion with ExoIII nuclease for different time intervals, trimming with S1 nuclease, and self-ligation of the truncated fragments). (iv) Strain WA2127ΔHIC was transformed with the self-ligated plasmids, plated on McConkey indicator plates (0.4% Glc, 100 μg/ml ampicillin), and colonies which weakly fermented Glc (complementation of IICBGlc dependent Glc transport) were selected. (v) The selected colonies were replica plated on IPTG containing plates, and non-fermenting colonies were selected (strong overexpression of ptsH ptsI crr was found to inhibit Glc fermentation for unknown reasons). (vi) Cell lysates from IPTG-sensitive colonies were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels for overexpression of enzyme I, HPr, and IIAGlc by Coomassie staining and autoradiography following incubation of the extracts with [32P]P-enolpyruvate. The plasmid from a transformant displaying maximal overexpression was isolated and the noncoding region upstream of ptsH was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Sequenase™ kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The IICMan-IIDMan complex was overexpressed in E. coli WA2127 transformed with plasmid pTSPM8 (Erni et al., 1987). Cells were grown at 37°C to A550 = 1.5. Protein expression was induced with 50 μM IPTG and incubation continued for 5 h. The IICMan-IIDMan complex was solubilized with 2% octyl-β-glucopyranoside (Sigma) and purified by isoelectric focusing in a U-tube in the presence of the same detergent (Erni et al., 1987). The IICMan-IIDMan complex from the peak fraction was concentrated in a Centricon 10 (Amicon) to 1 mg of protein/ml. The concentrated protein solution was used for reconstitution experiments. Protein concentrations were determined using the assay kit of Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as standard. The wild-type IIABMan subunit was purified as described (Stolz et al., 1993). Enzyme I and HPr were overexpressed in E. coli WA2127 transformed with plasmid pTSHIC9. Cells were grown at 37°C to A550 = 1.5, protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG, and incubation continued overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and ruptured by two passages through a French pressure cell (15,000 psi). Cell debris were sedimented by low speed centrifugation (10 min, 12,000 × g) and the membrane fraction by ultracentrifugation (90 min, 150,000 × g). Protamine sulfate was added to the high-speed supernatant to a final concentration of 0.33%. After removal of the precipitate by low speed centrifugation, enzyme I, IIAGlc, and HPr account for 50% of protein in the clarified supernatant. The supernatant was applied to a DE-52 column (Whatman, 70-ml bed volume, equilibrated with buffer A), and eluted with a 0-700 mM NaCl gradient (buffer A, 2 ml/min flow rate). HPr eluted between 50 and 80 mM NaCl, IIAGlc between 0.20 and 0.25 M NaCl, and enzyme I between 0.4 and 0.45 M NaCl. The HPr, IIAGlc, and enzyme I containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by precipitation with 80% ammonium sulfate. The precipitates were dissolved in a small volume of buffer A and dialyzed against buffer A. IIAGlc and HPr were further purified by gel filtration on Superdex 75 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and enzyme I on Superdex 200. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Lowry assay (Markwell et al., 1978) and bovine serum albumin as standard. E. coliL-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (Type IX, Sigma) was dissolved in chloroform, dried in a round-bottom flask, and resuspended at a concentration of 20 mg/ml in reconstitution buffer (20 mM imidazole/HCl, pH 6.0, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). The suspension was homogenized by brief sonication in a bath-type sonicator and stored at −70°C until use. 1 ml of phospholipid suspension (20 mg/ml) and 0.11 ml of 10% octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma) were added to a screw capped test tube, flushed with N2, and vortexed for 30 s at room temperature. 0.05 ml of the isoelectrofocused IICMan-IIDMan complex (approximately 50 μg of protein) was added to the phospholipid/detergent solution. The solution was mixed gently, incubated for 1 h at 4°C, pipetted into 30 ml of reconstitution buffer, mixed, and proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation (1 h, 150,000 × g, 4°C). The proteoliposomes were resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate buffer (50 mM KPi, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 40 mg/ml phospholipids, 100 μg/ml IICMan-IIDMan; molar lipid/protein ratio 30,000) and then stored at −70°C until use. The frozen proteoliposomes were thawed at room temperature. P-enolpyruvate and purified enzyme I, HPr, and IIABMan were added to 250 μl of concentrated proteoliposomes to final concentrations of 4.5 mM, 0.3 μM, 2.5 μM, and 0.7 μM, respectively. The mixture was sonicated for 2 min at room temperature in a bath-type sonicator (TEC-40, TECSONIC, Switzerland). The sonicated proteoliposomes were frozen in liquid N2 and thawed in a 22°C water bath. Freezing and thawing was repeated 8 times. After sonication for 3 s in a bath-type sonicator, the proteoliposomes were purified by spin column gel filtration (Chonn et al.(1991). 1-ml tuberculin syringes plugged with glass wool were filled with Sephacryl S-300 (High Resolution, Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer (50 mM KPi, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) and hanging in 13 × 100-mm test tubes centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 rpm. Fills and centrifugations were repeated until the bed volume was 1 ml. A final spin of 5 min at 2000 rpm assured that the gel was uniformly packed and that excess buffer was removed. 80-μl aliquots of proteoliposomes were then applied and spun (1 min, at 1000 rpm). To drive the elution of proteoliposomes to completion, the column was washed with 80 μl of phosphate buffer. The proteoliposomes were diluted 4-fold into phosphate buffer to a final volume of 2 ml. The import reaction was started by adding [14C]Glc (DuPont NEN, diluted to 10 mM, 4.5 mCi/mmol) to the desired concentration. Aliquots of 100 μl were withdrawn at the indicated time points and diluted into 2 ml of buffer (50 mM KPi, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). To measure active import the diluted aliquots were immediately filtered through glass microfiber filters (GF/F, Whatman) under suction, the filters washed with 2 × 1 ml of phosphate buffer, and the radioactivity retained on the filters determined by liquid scintillation counting. To measure Glc phosphorylation, aliquots were diluted into 2 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100 and Glc-6-P was separated from Glc by anion-exchange chromatography as described (Erni et al., 1982). The kinetic constants were obtained by nonlinear fitting of the Michaelis-Menten equation to data points. 100 μl of D-[U-14C]Glc (DuPont NEN, diluted to 10 mM, 4.5 mCi/mmol) was added to 250 μl of concentrated proteoliposomes. The mixture was sonicated and freeze-thawed as described above. To remove extravesicular [14C]Glc the suspension was incubated for 15 min at 22°C with hexokinase (4.5 mg/ml) and ATP (4.0 mM) and then spin column purified and 4-fold diluted as described above (5 mg/ml phospholipid, 0.18 μM IICMan-IIDMan). Enzyme I, HPr, and IIABMan (final concentrations of 0.3, 2.5, and 0.7 μM) were added to the proteoliposomes and at 22°C the transport reaction was started by adding P-enolpyruvate to a final concentration of 4.5 mM. Aliquots of 100 μl were withdrawn and [14C]Glc retained in the proteoliposomes as well as [14C]Glc-6-P formed were determined as described above. Proteoliposomes mock-loaded with Glc-free buffer were used to measure nonvectorial phosphorylation of external Glc. The reaction was started by adding enzyme I, HPr, IIABMan, and P-enolpyruvate together with [U-14C]Glc to the outside. Glc phosphorylation was measured by the ion-exchange method (Kundig and Roseman, 1971; Erni et al., 1982). To measure competition between vectorial export of internal [14C]Glc and nonvectorial phosphorylation of external Glc, [12C]Glc was added together with P-enolpyruvate. The kinetic constants were obtained by nonlinear fitting of the Michaelis-Menten equation to data points. The proteoliposomes collected by ultracentrifugation were suspended in buffer A (150 mM KPi, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT) and loaded with [14C]Glc as described. External K+ was removed together with external [14C]Glc by spin column gel filtration through Sephacryl 300 equilibrated in buffer B (149 mM NaPi, pH 7.5, 1 mM KPi, 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT). In this experiment, SO42− was used to replace Cl− in order to minimize the passive anion permeation. SO42− has no effect on the phosphorylation activity of the mannose transporter (data not shown). The K+ diffusion potential was started by adding valinomycin (Sigma) to a final concentration of 40 nM. 5 min after the addition of valinomycin, the PTS-dependent extrusion of [14C]Glc was started by adding P-enolpyruvate. In parallel experiments the membrane potential formed by K+-efflux from K+-loaded proteoliposomes was measured with the fluorescence indicator 1,3,3,1′,3′,3′-hexamethylindoldicarbocyanine (NK529, Nippon Kankoh Shikiso Kenkyusho, Okayama, Japan) as described by Apell et al.(1985). 170 μl of K+ containing purified proteoliposomes (without [14C]Glc) and 530 μl of buffer (149 mM NaPi, pH 7.5, 1 mM KPi) containing 37 μM NK529 (added from 2.5 mM stock solution in 1:9 (v/v) ethanol/water) were mixed in a 1-ml cuvette. After the fluorescence signal reached a constant value (F0), valinomycin was added to a final concentration of 40 nM whereupon the fluorescence signal rapidly decreased to a new constant value (F). The K+ concentration was increased by small increments and the fluorescence change (ΔF = F-F0) was monitored. There is a linear relationship between the membrane potential, which was calculated from the Nernst equation, and the fluorescence change: 0.64 F/mV. The fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B luminescence spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was set to 620 nm (slit width 5 mm) and the emission wavelength to 680 nm (slit width 5 mm). 40 μl of spin column-purified proteoliposomes were incubated with the indicated amounts of trypsin (Sigma) or subtilisin (Serva) in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM KPi, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) with and without 2.7% Triton X-100 at room temperature in a final volume of 60 μl. Proteolysis was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (3.5 mM, final concentration) at the indicated time intervals. Proteins were precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone to remove detergent and phospholipid, and treated with formic acid/ethanol (1:2, v/v) to completely unfold the IICMan subunit. The lyophilized protein samples were solubilized in 25 μl of sample buffer and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were stained with alkaline silver (Wray et al., 1981). To maximize protein expression and minimize plasmid loss during fermentation, the pts operon encoding enzyme I, HPr, and IIAGlc was put under the control of the Ptac promoter. The optimal distance between Ptac and the coding region was determined by progressively truncating the noncoding region upstream of ptsH and the screening of transformants for protein overexpression. Plasmid pTSHIC9 (Fig. 2A) supporting the strongest overexpression was isolated and the 5′ region between ptsH and Ptac was sequenced. It comprises 148 noncoding nucleotides. It ends 16 nucleotides downstream of the −10 region of the pts P1 promoter (de Reuse et al., 1992). Enzyme I is the most prominent of all E. coli proteins in whole cell lysates, and IIAGlc and HPr also appear as prominent bands on a Coomassie-stained electropherogram (Fig. 2B, lane 1). The proteins were purified by procedures adapted from the Roseman laboratory (Kukuruzinska et al., 1982; Nakazawa and Weigel, 1982; Meadow, 1982). After only two steps of purification the three proteins appear homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel elecrophoresis (Fig. 2B), and 90% of the PTS activity present in the cytoplasmic fraction is recovered (Schunk, 1992). However, the IIAGlc preparation was cross-contaminated with HPr activity as indicated by the strong background of PTS activity of an assay mixture from which exogenous HPr was omitted. This residual HPr activity could be completely removed by two extra steps of IIAGlc purification: anion exchange chromatography on Mono-Q (Pharmacia) and gel filtration on Superdex 75. No mutual cross-contamination of enzyme I and HPr and no contamination of these proteins by IIAGlc could be detected using elevated background activity in the sugar phosphotransferase assay as the criterium. Proteoliposomes were formed by dilution of the purified, β-octyl glucoside solubilized IICMan-IIDMan complex into a detergent-free buffer containing a 30,000-fold molar excess of E. coli phospholipids. 80-90% of the PTS activity present in the IICMan-IIDMan preparation could be recovered in the sedimented proteoliposome preparation. Detergent dialysis also afforded proteoliposomes but their IICMan-IIDMan activity was below 20%. The uranyl acetate-stained vesicles had diameters of between 200 and 500 nm (results not shown). The orientation of IICMan-IIDMan in the membrane is random as concluded from proteolysis experiments. Treatment of proteoliposomes with subtilisin resulted in a 50% conversion of the 29-kDa IIDMan subunit into a new 28-kDa fragment (Fig. 3A). Trypsin removed 50% of the IIDMan (Fig. 3B) from the intact vesicles. No tryptic fragments of IIDMan could be detected by alkaline silver stain (Fig. 3B) and immune blots (results not shown). When the proteoliposomes were solubilized with detergent prior to proteolysis, conversion of the IIDMan subunit was complete (Fig. 3). The IICMan subunit behaved differently. It was cleaved into smaller fragments by subtilisin and trypsin, but cleavage did not go to completion after detergent solubilization of the proteoliposomes (Fig. 3). The reason for this behavior is not clear. After detergent solubilization, 50% of (nonvectorial) phosphotransferase activity could be recovered from the trypsin-treated proteoliposomes. Only 20% activity could be recovered from the subtilisin-treated proteoliposomes, suggesting that the IICMan-IIDMan complex is accessible to subtilisin in both orientations. This results in more than 50% inactivation but cleavage from only one side afforded a product of different electrophoretic mobility. The IICMan-IIDMan complex is oriented randomly in the proteoliposomes. However, by adding the soluble phosphoryl carrier proteins and P-enolpyruvate to only one of the two compartments a unique direction of transport can be imposed upon the reconstituted system. Uptake can be measured if the proteoliposomes are loaded with the phosphoryl carrier proteins and [14C]Glc is added to the outside (“right-side out”), efflux if they are loaded with [14C]Glc and the soluble phosphotransferase proteins are added to the outside (“inside-out”). The inside-out orientation allows for manipulation of protein-protein interactions occurring at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane but is of limited use for kinetic studies because intravesicular glucose is quickly depleted. The right-side out orientation allows assay for time-dependent solute accumulation but intravesicular conditions are not easily manipulated. Import of [14C]Glc was measured with proteoliposomes which were loaded with purified soluble PTS proteins and P-enolpyruvate. [14C]Glc was added to start the uptake reaction (Fig. 4). 80% of the glucose originally present at a concentration of 5 μM was concentrated in the proteoliposomes and accumulation was accompanied by phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). The kcat and Km of vectorial transport by proteoliposomes were 401 ± 32 pmol of Glc/μg of IICMan-IIDManD/min and 30 ± 6 μM, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). Assuming that the molecular mass of the functional unit of the mannose transporter is 90 kDa and that only 50% are correctly oriented and therefore active, a turnover number of 1.2 s−1 can be calculated. No uptake of [14C]Glc could be detected, when P-enolpyruvate, enzyme I, HPr, IIABMan, and [14C]Glc were added to the outside of the proteoliposomes (results not shown), indicating that transport occurs only if the solute ([14C]Glc) and the phosphoryl transfer components are on opposite sides of the membrane. Observations with intact bacteria indicated that PTS transporters not only catalyze vectorial transport with phosphorylation but also phosphorylation of substrates in the cytoplasm (nonvectorial phosphorylation, e.g. of glucose generated in the cell from maltose). When [14C]Glc is added together with the soluble phosphoryl carrier proteins to the outside of IICMan-IIDMan containing proteoliposomes, Glc-6-P is formed rapidly without concommitant transport (Fig. 5A). The kcat and Km of nonvectorial phosphorylation by proteoliposomes are 975 ± 88 pmol of Glc-6-P/μg of IICMan-IIDMan/min and 201 ± 43 μM, respectively (Fig. 5B). Phosphorylation without transport is therefore 2-3 times faster than vectorial phosphorylation. This nonvectorial phosphorylation raises two questions. First, passive diffusion of solute followed by nonvectorial phosphorylation could in principle be misinterpreted as true vectorial phosphorylation in the reconstituted system. Second, transport coupled to phosphorylation and nonvectorial phosphorylation could be competing reactions. The two problems were addressed by measuring the efflux of [14C]Glc in the presence and absence of nonlabeled external glucose. To test for passive and IICMan-IIDMan-mediated facilitated diffusion, (proteo)liposomes were loaded with [14C]Glc and purified by spin column chromatography (without the hexokinase treatment described under “Materials and Methods”). By adding hexokinase and ATP, a constant amount of Glc could be converted to Glc-6-P in the external compartment of pure liposomes as well as of proteoliposomes containing the IICMan-IIDMan complex. This amount did not change when the soluble phosphoryl carrier proteins were added as long as either P-enolpyruvate or the IIABMan subunit were omitted (Fig. 6). The amount of Glc-6-P did, however, increase immediately above this background when P-enolpyruvate (Fig. 7B) was added, and this increase was accompanied by a stoichiometric decrease of trapped glucose (Fig. 7A). This result indicates that (i) export of [14C]Glc concomitant with phosphorylation is catalyzed only by the complete phosphotransferase system, (ii) passive and IICMan-IIDMan-dependent facilitated diffusion of [14C]Glc do not occur on the time scale of up to 1 h, and (iii) a small amount of [14C]Glc which was not removed by spin column purification alone remains accessible from the outside. Henceforth, residual nontrapped glucose was removed with hexokinase prior to spin column purification as described under “Materials and Methods.” When IIABMan, enzyme I, HPr, and P-enolpyruvate were added to the hexokinase-treated and spin column-purified proteoliposomes, rapid export of trapped [14C]Glc concomitant with phosphorylation could be measured (Fig. 7). Export of glucose and phosphorylation are strictly coupled in a 1:1 molar ratio.Figure 7:Export and phosphorylation of glucose. IICMan-IIDMan containing proteoliposomes (0.1 μM IICMan-IIDMan, IICMan-IIDMan:phospholipid ratio 1:30,000) are loaded with [14C]Glc (2.85 mM). The export reaction is started (arrow) by addition to the outside of IIABMan, HPr, enzyme I, and P-enolpyruvate without (○, •) and with (▿, ▾) 17.5 mM unlabeled Glc. A, export of trapped [14C]Glc. B, vectorial phosphorylation, formation of Glc-6-P. External glucose does not compete with export and phosphorylation of [14C]Glc (compare triangles and circles). □, diffusion of [14C]Glc observed when P-enolpyruvate is omitted from the incubation mixture. Shown are means and S.D. of three independent experiments done with a single batch of reconstituted proteoliposomes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Are nonvectorial phosphorylation, as described above (Fig. 5) and vectorial transport and/or phosphorylation of transported substrate (Fig. 7) competing reactions? To address this question export and phosphorylation of trapped [14C]Glc was measured in the presences of increasing amounts of external [12C]Glc. As shown in Fig. 7, a 6-fold molar excess of external [12C]Glc neither slows down the rate of [14C]Glc export (Fig. 7A) nor its phosphorylation (Fig. 7B). This indicates that (i) nonvectorial phosphorylation and vectorial transport are not competing reactions and (ii) that [14C]Glc does not equilibrate with [12C]Glc between the translocation and phosphorylation reaction and coupling between these two steps therefore must be tight (Fig. 1). No difference was observed whether [12C]Glc was added simultaneously with the cytoplasmic phosphoryl carrier proteins (Fig. 7) or whether it was added before (results not shown). Reconstituted IICMan-IIDMan does catalyze exchange equilibration between internal and external glucose. It has been proposed that the activity of PTS transporters is regulated by the transmembrane electrochemical potential (Robillard and Konings, 1981, 1982). The rate and extent of solute accumulation by intact cells increased when the proton electrochemical gradient was abolished by uncouplers or respiratory chain inhibitors (Reider et al., 1979; Singh et al., 1985; Nuoffer et al., 1988). To rationalize this inverse correlation between membrane potential and transport activity, a mechanism involving the release of a proton on the periplasmic side concomitant with sugar phosphorylation was suggested (Scarborough, 1985). Reconstitution of the purified mannose transporter allowed testing for a possibly direct effect of the membrane potential on the transport activity. The extrusion from and the import of [14C]Glc into K+-loaded proteoliposomes was measured in the absence and in the presence of valinomycin. The calculated K+ diffusion potential was 120 mV, positive outside. According to the predictions the transport activity should have increased in the extrusion experiment (negative polarization with respect to the direction of transport, inside-out orientation) and decreased in the uptake experiment (positive polarization, right-side out orientation). However, in neither case could a difference be detected (results not shown). Similarly the addition of the uncoupler dinitrophenol had no effect on extrusion or uptake of [14C]Glc. The purified mannose transporter of the bacterial phosphotransferase system was reconstituted by detergent dilution into proteoliposomes and two activities, vectorial transport concomitant with phosphorylation and nonvectorial phosphorylation were measured. Transport is coupled to phosphorylation in a 1:1 ratio. The Km of the transport reaction is 30 ± 6 μM. A turnover number of 1.2 ± 0.1 s−1 can be calculated, assuming that the minimal functional unit consists of one IICMan and two IIDMan subunits (Rhiel et al., 1994), and that at most 50% of the complexes are correctly oriented and active (probably an overestimate). The turnover number of the PTS transporter for mannitol is 4 s−1 (Elferink et al., 1990) and similar numbers can be calculated from reported experiments with the purified H+/lactose transporter (3.5 s−1, Newman et al.(1981); 0.6 s−1, Consler et al.(1993)), the intestinal Na+/glucose transporter (4 s−1, Peerce and Clarke(1990)), and the histidine transporter (1.1 min−1, Bishop et al.(1989)). Nonvectorial phosphorylation has an approximately 7-fold higher Km and a 3-fold faster kcat than the transport reaction. It is likely that solute translocation requires more extensive protein motion than the binding and release reaction during nonvectorial phosphorylation, and that the former reaction therefore is slower than the latter. A similar difference of catalytic constants was also observed with the mannitol transporter (Elferink et al., 1990). Although nonvectorial phosphorylation on the one hand and phosphorylation coupled with solute translocation on the other hand are mediated by the same protein complex, no cross-inhibition between the two reactions could be observed. Neither the export of [14C]Glc out of proteoliposomes nor phosphorylation of the exported solute could be inhibited by Glc added to the outside of the proteoliposomes. Noncompetition between nonvectorial and vectorial phosphorylation indicates that the transported glucose is not in diffusion equilibrium with glucose in the bulk phase. Transport and phosphorylation are either mechanistically coupled or the rate of phosphorylation of bound glucose is much faster than the rate by which unphosphorylated glucose could dissociate (dissociation being a precondition for exchange; Fig. 1). This is a clear example of tight channeling by a multifunctional enzyme which catalyzes two sequential reactions (Srivastava and Bernhard, 1986; Srere, 1987). No competition between translocation and nonvectorial phosphorylation could be detected within the experimental error of the export assay. However, the initial rate of export could not be measured accurately because export is fast and due to the small intravesicular volume of very short duration. Small differences might therefore have gone unnoticed. The results summarized above differ in three respects from recent observations with the mannitol transporter which indicated facilitated diffusion, exchange, and uncoupling of transport and phosphorylation. (i) Purified IICBAMtl reconstituted into proteoliposomes mediated facilitated diffusion in a way which was saturable and specific for mannitol (Elferink et al., 1990). (ii) Addition of unlabeled Mtl to the exterior of inside-out membrane vesicles resulted in the complete exchange of [3H]Mtl bound to the interior (Lolkema et al., 1991). (iii) Over 50% of the radiolabeled mannitol bound to the periplasmic side of IICBAMtl containing inside-out oriented membrane vesicles exchanged with unlabeled mannitol before it became phosphorylated, indicating that mannitol dissociates after translocation at a rate comparable to that of phosphorylation. The differences could have several reasons. (i) The two transporters are very different with respect to amino acid sequence, active site residues (histidine versus cysteine in the second phosphorylation site; Pas and Robillard(1988), Erni et al.(1989), and Pas et al.(1991)), and subunit composition (4 domains in 3 subunits versus 3 domains in 1 subunit) and the molecular mechanism of their action might be correspondingly different. (ii) Facilitated diffusion catalyzed by the IICMan-IIDMan complex went unnoticed because it was indistinguishable from passive diffusion of L-glucose and diffusion of D-glucose out of protein-free liposomes (results not shown). The proteolysis data are not easily reconciled with the proposition of Beneski et al.(1982) that the IIMan complex is symmetrically oriented in the membrane. They observed that IIMan interacts with 2-deoxyglucose and phosphorylate this sugar when the phosphoryl carrier proteins are located either inside of right-side out membrane vesicles (resulting in uptake and phosphorylation) or outside the vesicles (nonvectorial phosphorylation). If the two surfaces exposed toward the aqueous phases were identical, proteolysis should proceed to 100% and not only 50% as observed (Fig. 3). However, functional symmetry found by Beneski et al.(1982) does not necessitate a structural symmetry of the complex. Both faces of an asymmetrical complex could in principle have independent sugar phosphorylation activity, and noncompetition between vectorial transport and nonvectorial phosphorylation could then be explained. However, it appears more likely to us that some randomization of sidedness might have occurred during preparation of membrane vesicles by Beneski et al.(1982). The present reconstitution method is useful whenever nonvectorial phosphorylation and vectorial transport must be investigated in parallel and when interference with PTS activity by other membrane components has to be excluded. It will be used as an assay complementary to in vivo uptake studies and in vitro measurement of nonvectorial phosphorylation. We thank R. Lanz for expert technical assistance, Dr. C.

The eukaryotic initiation factors have been purified mainly from mammalian cells, and their functions have been studied in vitro in reconstituted assays for initiation of protein synthesis. To better characterize the structure/function of these proteins, the cDNAs of many of the factors have been cloned and sequenced. Recently, we reported the primary structure of eIF-1A (formerly called eIF-4C) from rabbit, human, and wheat germ obtained both by amino acid sequencing of peptides and by deduction from cloned cDNAs(3Dever T.E.

Human eIF-1A is a small protein with a mass of 16.4 kDa and appears not to be post-translationally modified(4Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20823-20826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The factor is essential for maximal protein synthesis in either mammalian or plant in vitro systems. The most pronounced effects of this protein have been observed in 80 S ribosome dissociation, stabilization of initiator Met-tRNAi binding to 40 S ribosomal subunits, and promotion of mRNA binding to 40 S and 80 S ribosomes(5Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Thomas A.A.M. Benne R. Voorma H.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, eIF-1A has pleiotropic effects at different steps of the initiation process. Since the factors purified from wheat germ and rabbit reticulocytes are functionally interchangeable in vitro(7Timmer R.T. Lax S.R. Hughes D.L. Merrick W.C. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24863-24867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their active domains must be strongly conserved. The cloning of the human eIF-1A cDNA creates an opportunity to study the factor in greater detail. We report here the overexpression of recombinant eIF-1A in Escherichia coli and the purification of large amounts of active protein. Antibodies prepared in rabbits were used to quantitate cellular levels. We also describe studies of the structure and translational efficiency of eIF-1A mRNA in vivo and the effects of overexpression in transiently transfected cells. Two oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to amplify the coding region of eIF-1A cDNA by PCR. Primer 1 (P1) is 5′-CCCCTGCAGCCGCCATGGCTCCCAAGAATAAAGG-3′. The underlined regions are PstI and NcoI restriction sites, respectively. P1 corresponds to the region surrounding the initiation codon (positions −5 to +3 and positions +7 to +20, where position +1 signifies the A of the AUG initiator codon). Primer 2 (P2) is 5′-CCCAAGCTT GAATTCAGAAAAGATGG-3′. The underlined regions are HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. P2 corresponds to the region 3′ of the termination codon (positions +458 to +471). PCR with pBluescript-1A (clone I in Fig. 5) template was carried out under standard conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Perkin-Elmer). The fragment was cleaved with NcoI and EcoRI, blunt-ended with Klenow DNA polymerase, and subcloned into the blunt-end NdeI site of pT7-7 (8Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar) to produce pT7-7-1A. pT7-7-1A was then transformed into E. coli strain DH5α carrying pGP1-2, which contains the phage T7 RNA polymerase gene under the inducible λPL promoter as well as the gene encoding the temperature-sensitive λ-repressor (cI857). Induction of eIF-1A synthesis was performed as described previously(8Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in rich medium (75 μg/ml each ampicillin and kanamycin, 2% Tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.2% glucose, pH 7.4) at 30°C until OD595 = 0.3-0.4 and then shifted to 42°C for 30 min, followed by 2 h of growth at 30°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4°C and washed once with buffer (10% sucrose, 20 mM Tris-HCl, and 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). In some cases, rifampicin was added at a concentration of 200 μg/ml to inhibit the activity of host RNA polymerase. eIF-1A-overexpressing cells were resuspended in 3 volumes of MgTris buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, pH 7.4) and lysed with lysozyme (80 μg/g of cell) and deoxycholic acid (4 mg/g of cell) in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After clarification, ribosomes were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant (S100) was saved. S100 proteins (156 mg/loading) were fractionated on a 10-ml MonoS column of the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) by salt gradient (0.15-0.5 M KCl) elution. Fractions (4 ml) containing rc-eIF-1A were identified according to the known elution profile of HeLa eIF-1A and by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Further purification of rc-eIF-1A was accomplished by adsorption on a 1-ml MonoQ column followed by salt gradient (0.15-0.5 M KCl) elution. Column fractions were examined by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The reaction was carried out in a 30-μl mixture containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM Mg(OAc)2, 63 mM KCl, 27 mM KOAc, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 16 pmol of [3H]Met-tRNA, 0.8 mM GTP, 1 mM puromycin, 33 mM ApUpG, 0.06 and 0.15 A260 units of 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits from rat liver, respectively, 1.08 μg of eIF-2, 1.44 μg of eIF-3, 0.68 μg of eIF-5, and 0.47 μg of eIF-5A purified from HeLa cells, and fractions containing rc-eIF-1A as indicated. The reaction mixtures were incubated and analyzed as described previously(9Smit-McBride Z. Schnier J. Kaufman R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18527-18530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum against rc-eIF-1A protein was raised in a New Zealand White rabbit. Approximately 400 μg of rc-eIF-1A protein purified from E. coli was emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously as the primary immunization. Six weeks later, 50 μg of protein was used in a booster immunization. Blood (10 ml) was taken at 3-day intervals and allowed to clot, and serum was clarified by centrifugation and stored at −70°C. Serum diluted up to 1:10,000 gives a strong band for eIF-1A by Western blot analysis of total protein prepared from HeLa cells. The minimum amount of eIF-1A protein detectable is 30 ng with the colorimetric method (nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) and 1 ng with the chemiluminescence method. To prepare the substrate for affinity binding, 30 μg of purified rc-eIF-1A was electrophoretically transferred from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then blocked for 50 min in blocking solution (PBS (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl)/0.5% nonfat dry milk). Antiserum was diluted 1:10 with PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 3 h with membrane strips containing adsorbed rc-eIF-1A. The nitrocellulose strips were washed three times with PBS, and the bound antibodies were eluted with 200 μl of low pH buffer (0.2 M glycine, 1 mM EGTA, pH 2.3-2.7) and immediately neutralized with 3 N NaOH. The affinity-purified antibodies were stored at 4°C and used at a 1:500 dilution. To construct an eIF-1A expression vector for transient transfections, the 470-bp PstI-EcoRI PCR fragment of eIF-1A used to construct pT7-7-1A was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pMT2 to generate pMT2-1A. The vector contains the SV40 origin of replication and utilizes the adenovirus major late promoter and SV40 enhancer to produce a transcript that begins with the adenovirus tripartite leader and a small intron upstream from the eIF-1A coding region(10Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with pMT2-1A DNA (10 μg/100-cm2 plate) by using the DEAE-dextran method(10Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, ∼15-20% of the cell population is expected to express the transfected DNA. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's labeling medium (1.5 ml/plate) containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN). Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.05% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Protein in the lysates was precipitated with 10% hot trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Protein aliquots containing equal amounts of radioactivity were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The relative synthesis rate of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was determined by densitometric scanning (Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIcx) of the autoradiographs by using the NIH Image program. To obtain large amounts of eIF-1A protein, human cDNA was expressed in E. coli, and the overproduced protein was purified. The eIF-1A open reading frame from plasmid pBluescript-1A (clone I of Fig. 5) (3Dever T.E. Wei C.L. Benkowski L.A. Browning K. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3212-3218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the NcoI-EcoRI sites of pT7-7 to create the recombinant plasmid pT7-7-1A as described under “Materials and Methods.” pT7-7-1A was then transformed into E. coli and heat-induced to overexpress eIF-1A. A major polypeptide that migrates with the same mobility as purified HeLa eIF-1A when analyzed by SDS-PAGE is seen in cells transformed with pT7-7-1A (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). Synthesis of this polypeptide is specific for the eIF-1A cDNA sequence since the E. coli strain containing the pT7-7 plasmid vector lacking the cDNA insert fails to overproduce a 20-kDa protein (lanes 2 and 3). The overexpressed rc-eIF-1A protein was purified from transformed E. coli cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” About 10 mg of protein was obtained from 10 g of cells (wet weight). Analysis by 15% SDS-PAGE of rc-eIF-1A purified through the MonoQ step shows that the protein is >95% pure (Fig. 1B). An in vitro methionylpuromycin synthesis assay was used to determine whether or not rc-eIF-1A possesses initiation factor activity. The assay measures the formation of methionylpuromycin on 80 S ribosomes in the presence of AUG and five purified initiation factors (5Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) : eIF-1A, eIF-2, eIF-3, eIF-5, and eIF-5A. The activities of rc-eIF-1A and eIF-1A purified from HeLa cells were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” rc-eIF-1A and native eIF-1A have essentially identical specific activities in this assay (Fig. 1C). Since eIF-1A is found primarily in the ribosomal high salt wash, the factor presumably associates with ribosomes. Such association may occur by binding to rRNA, mRNA, and/or ribosomal proteins. Many of the initiation factors are RNA-binding proteins, e.g. eIF-2, eIF-3, eIF-4B, and eIF-4F. To determine whether or not eIF-1A binds RNA, a Northwestern blot analysis was carried out. Purified rc-eIF-1A was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was treated with 32P-labeled Xenopus β-globin mRNA and subjected to autoradiography as described in the legend to Fig. 2. A strong radiolabeled band at 20 kDa indicates that eIF-1A binds to RNA. As a positive control, eIF-3 also was analyzed; the p66 subunit of eIF-3 binds tightly to RNA, as shown in Fig. 2(third lane). Insight into the function of an initiation factor may be obtained from knowledge of its abundance relative to other translational components. The level of eIF-1A was determined in HeLa cells by quantitative Western immunoblotting. Toward this goal, antiserum against human rc-eIF-1A was prepared in rabbits as described under “Materials and Methods.” The titer and specificity of the polyclonal antibodies were evaluated by Western blot analysis of HeLa cell lysates; at a 1:10,000 dilution, a single major band corresponding to eIF-1A was detected, although a very minor band also was detectable at ∼55 kDa (data not shown). Moreover, only 1 ng of eIF-1A is needed to generate a good signal with the chemiluminescence detection method (Fig. 3A). To obtain monospecific antibodies, the anti-human eIF-1A antibodies were affinity-purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” The affinity-purified antibodies were used in Western blot analyses to quantitate the level of eIF-1A in HeLa cells (Fig. 3). The cellular level of eIF-1A was estimated by comparing the intensities of the bands from crude lysates with the intensities obtained from known amounts of purified protein. Based on the slope of the line in Fig. 3C, eIF-1A represents 0.010% of total protein, which corresponds to 6 × 105 molecules/cell (see legend to Fig. 3 for calculations). Since the concentration of ribosomes in HeLa cells is ∼3 × 106 ribosomes/cell(11Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7228-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the factor/ribosome ratio is 0.2. This ratio is somewhat lower than those reported previously for eIF-2, eIF-3, and eIF-4B (0.5-0.7)(11Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7228-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, eIF-1A may be a limiting initiation factor since its molar level is comparable to that of eIF-4α(12Duncan R. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection of mammalian cells has been widely used to assess the effect of increasing the level of an initiation factor on the in vivo rate of protein synthesis(13Kaufman R.J. Murtha P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1568-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. Davies M.V. Kelleher K. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N.

In most cases, no effect on protein synthesis has been detected; however, overexpression of eIF-4Fα stimulates translation(15Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 16De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of eIF-4B inhibits translation(14Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. Davies M.V. Kelleher K. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Like eIF-1A, both of these proteins are mRNA-binding initiation factors. To evaluate the effect of overexpression of eIF-1A, eIF-1A cDNA was transiently transfected into COS-1 cells, and the translation of a reporter mRNA encoding DHFR was monitored. The same PCR fragment used to express eIF-1A in E. coli was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pMT2 (10Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) to generate pMT2-1A. The cDNA is transcribed from the adenovirus major late promoter, and the mRNA contains the tripartite leader of adenovirus late mRNAs (Fig. 4A). The expression level of eIF-1A was examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4B); a 20-kDa protein comigrating with HeLa eIF-1A was overexpressed only in cells transfected with pMT2-1A. The 4-fold increase in eIF-1A level over that in mock-transfected cells indicates that eIF-1A is overexpressed ∼20-fold in the transfected cell population. To determine the effect of overexpression on protein synthesis, the rate of DHFR synthesis was measured by pulse-labeling cells with [35S]methionine at 48 h post-transfection. Equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4C). In cells transfected with pMT2 alone, a strong band (∼26 kDa) corresponding to DHFR is seen (identified by an arrowhead). A weak band at ∼20 kDa is seen with pMT2-1A, due to eIF-1A synthesis (identified by an arrow). In cells cotransfected with pMT2-1A and pMT2, the level of DHFR expression is decreased to ∼60% that of transfectants with pMT2 alone (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 2 and 4). However, quantitation of DHFR mRNA by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 4D) shows that the level of DHFR mRNA in the cotransfected cells is decreased to ∼45% that in cells transfected with pMT2 alone (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 2 and 4). Correcting for this difference in mRNA, we conclude that overexpression of eIF-1A causes only a slight, likely insignificant stimulation of the translational efficiency of DHFR mRNA. The finding suggests that accumulation of high levels of eIF-1A in cells results in little or no change in translational efficiency. When eIF-1A cDNA was cloned, four independent recombinant phages carrying eIF-1A coding sequences were isolated but not described in detail(3Dever T.E. Wei C.L. Benkowski L.A. Browning K. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3212-3218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two or more of these clones (shown in Fig. 5) share 187 bp of the 5′-UTR and ∼600 bp of the 3′-UTR, but no polyadenylation signal is apparent in the sequences. The DNA sequences of the regions flanking the coding region have not been published, but are available from the GenBankTM Data Bank (accession number L18960). Since the lengths of neither the 5′-UTR nor the 3′-UTR are defined, we wished to establish the overall length of eIF-1A mRNA by Northern blot hybridization. A single band measuring ∼1900 nucleotides was observed in total and poly(A)+ preparations from HeLa cells (Fig. 6). Since the coding region contains 432 nucleotides and the poly(A) tract is usually ∼250 nucleotides in humans(17Brawerman G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 10: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the 1900-nucleotide mRNA appears to contain ∼1200 nucleotides of nontranslated sequence distributed between the 3′- and 5′-regions. Therefore, ∼400 bp of cDNA remain to be defined. The 5′-leader sequence of cDNA clone II (Fig. 5) uniquely contains 214 residues at the 5′-end in addition to the 187 nucleotides shared with the 5′-UTR of clone I. To determine whether or not this extended cDNA corresponds to true eIF-1A mRNA sequences, the cDNA from clone II was used for S1 nuclease mapping of HeLa mRNA. eIF-1A mRNA protects only a partial fragment (133 nucleotides) of a 347-bp radiolabeled probe (Fig. 7A), indicating that only the 187 nucleotides of the 5′-UTR shared by clones I and II are present in eIF-1A mRNA. Primer extension was then used to identify the transcription start site(s) of eIF-1A mRNA. A single major extended cDNA product is seen (Fig. 7B); its length (139 nucleotides) indicates that the mRNA ends 187 bp upstream from the AUG start codon. These results suggest that two of the cloned cDNAs (I and III) are nearly full-length at their 5′-termini and that there is only one major transcription start site for the eIF-1A gene. However, a more precise definition and characterization of the 5′-terminus of eIF-1A mRNA requires the cloning of the corresponding gene(s). The 5′-UTR of eIF-1A mRNA is unusual in two respects: it is longer than most leaders; and it is very prone to possess secondary structure, containing 72% G + C nucleotides. Although the 5′-UTR contains no upstream AUG codon, the G/C-rich aspect leads one to predict that the mRNA will be inefficiently translated(18Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar). We examined eIF-1A mRNA efficiency by determining the number of ribosomes present in eIF-1A polysomes by measuring the polysome size by Northern blot hybridization. As shown in Fig. 8, eIF-1A mRNA in exponentially growing HeLa cells is found mainly in polysomes containing about five ribosomes (fractions 7 and 8), and little mRNA is detected in the ribonucleoprotein region (fractions 2 and 3). The polysome size corresponds to ∼85 nucleotides of coding sequence/ribosome, which is a ribosome density somewhat greater than that found on globin mRNA in rabbit reticulocytes. Reprobing the blot with an eIF-2α cDNA probe detects eIF-2α mRNA on polysomes containing at least 11-12 ribosomes, as previously reported(19Ernst H. Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1206-1212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF-2α mRNA is a very efficiently translated mRNA. Since the number of ribosomes on eIF-1A mRNA is about half that for eIF-2α and its coding length also is about half, the results indicate that eIF-1A mRNA translation also is very efficient, assuming that elongation/termination rates are comparable. eIF-1A functions in the early steps of protein synthesis by promoting the dissociation of 80 S ribosomes into subunits and by stabilizing the binding of the ternary complex comprising eIF-2, Met-tRNAi, and GTP to 40 S ribosomal subunits. Its function in these partial initiation reactions parallels that of eIF-3 and suggests that eIF-1A also acts stoichiometrically on the ribosome. To better characterize the role of eIF-1A in protein synthesis, its cDNA was expressed in E. coli, and highly purified recombinant protein was isolated. Recombinant eIF-1A is active in vitro in the methionylpuromycin synthesis assay and displays the same molecular mass as the protein isolated from HeLa cells. Antibodies to rc-eIF-1A were prepared in rabbits and used to quantitate eIF-1A levels by Western immunoblotting. The level of eIF-1A in HeLa cell crude lysates is 0.2 molecules/ribosomes, i.e. in the micromolar range. This is about three times lower than the levels found for eIF-2, eIF-3, and a number of other initiation factors in HeLa cells(11Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7228-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since initiation occurs on native 40 S ribosomal subunits and these usually represent <10-20% of total ribosomes in exponentially growing cells, eIF-1A is equal to or in slight excess of initiating 40 S ribosomal subunits. It follows that eIF-1A may not be limiting for protein synthesis under most conditions. Consistent with this suggestion is the finding that overexpression of the factor in transiently transfected COS cells raises the factor level ∼20-fold, but does not significantly affect the rate of protein synthesis. eIF-1A is found primarily in the high salt ribosomal wash subcellular fraction(20Thomas A. Goumans H. Amesz H. Benne R. Voorma H.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting an association with ribosomes. However, it is not known how the factor binds to initiation complexes and whether or not it is released following completion of the initiation phase. We demonstrate here that eIF-1A is a strong RNA-binding protein. The arginine- and lysine-rich regions in the N-terminal half of the molecule likely are responsible for this activity, although this has not yet been demonstrated directly. Since eIF-1A promotes the dissociation of 80 S ribosomes, it likely binds to one of the ribosomal subunits. Voorma and co-workers (21Thomas A. Goumans H. Amesz H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown eIF-1A binding to 40 S preinitiation complexes containing Met-tRNAi, eIF-2, and eIF-3. Its binding is promoted by eIF-1 and somewhat by the presence of mRNA. eIF-1A binding to such ribosomal complexes appears to be quite labile(21Thomas A. Goumans H. Amesz H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and there is no direct evidence that the factor binds to 40 S subunits in the absence of other translational components. We analyzed HeLa cell lysates fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation for the presence of eIF-1A and found that the protein is present primarily toward the top of the gradient, but is detectable in the 40 S region and at even less abundance up to 80 S (data not shown). Whereas these results suggest a weak binding interaction with 40 S and 80 S ribosomes and perhaps with polysomes, the analyses have not been successful in demonstrating discrete binding complexes. eIF-1A appears to be expressed from a single size class ofmRNA. The mRNA is unusual in possessing a long 5′-untrans-lated leader. Both S1 nuclease protection and primer extension analyses identify a 200-nucleotide leader upstream from the AUG initiator codon. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that still additional residues are present in the leader. There is no upstream AUG sequence, but the leader is unusually rich in G and C residues (72%). Long G/C-rich leaders are found in mRNAs that tend to be translated inefficiently(18Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar), due presumably to stable secondary structures. Indeed, the 5′-leader of eIF-1A mRNA may form a structure that possesses a stability of −71 kcal/mol (Fig. 9). Paradoxically, eIF-1A mRNA in HeLa cells is present in quite large polysomes, suggesting a high rate of initiation (assuming that the elongation/termination rates reflect the bulk of translation). In contrast, in vitro synthesized RNAs possessing the entire 5′-leader are translated poorly in a reticulocyte lysate, whereas the coding region lacking the 5′-leader is translated well in vitro (data not shown). Further studies of the mechanism of initiation on eIF-1A mRNA are needed to explain how in vivo translation is so efficient with this mRNA.

Possible targets of these agents include the fMLP receptor, Gi, and PLCβ. Differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by Me2SO or dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) is associated with increases in the number of fMLP-binding sites (26Skubitz K.M. Zhen Y.S. August J.T.

Bourne, unpublished observation. )although it clearly increases responses to fMLP. Thus, the mode of action of RA differs from that of Me2SO. Here we report studies of the potentiation by RA of the Me2SO-induced fMLP-dependent activation of PLCβ in HL-60 cells. This potentiation occurs, at least in part, via an effect on Gi2. RA enhances both the interaction of Gi2 with fMLP receptors and its ability to activate βγ-sensitive PLCβ. RA treatment increases expression of a specific γ polypeptide, γ2, which may be responsible for both changes in the function of Gi2. HL-60 cells (approximately 5 × 105/ml) were differentiated into neutrophil-like cells by treatment with 1.3% Me2SO for 5-6 days either with or without 1 μM RA for the final 24 h. The differentiated cells were resuspended at a final concentration of 1 × 108 cells/ml in cavitation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM benzamidine, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM (p-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and disrupted by N2 cavitation followed by addition of 1.25 mM EGTA as described(33Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used as cytosol, and the pelleted membranes were obtained and resuspended at 5-8 mg of protein/ml in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 25 kallikrein inhibitory units/ml aprotinin) and stored at −85°C(33Borregaard N.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1020-1026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes (15-25 μg of protein) were incubated at 30°C for 20 min with various concentrations of [3H]fMLP (1.25-160 nM) in 50 μl of buffer N (20 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 kallikrein inhibitory units/ml aprotinin). The reaction mixture further contained 10 μM GTPγS where indicated. The reactions were terminated and fMLP binding was quantitated by rapid filtration on GF/C glass filters as described (35Iiri T. Ohoka Y. Ui M. Katada T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). GTPγS-sensitive fMLP binding was determined as a difference between values for specific binding assayed in the presence and absence of 10 μM GTPγS. For the reconstitution of GTPγS-sensitive fMLP binding in HL-60 cell membranes by addition of purified Gi2, the membranes were prepared from differentiated HL-60 cells which had been cultured in the presence of 50 ng/ml PTX for 24 h. The membranes from PTX-treated cells were incubated on ice for 15 min with indicated amounts of purified Gi2 and then assayed for fMLP binding with 80 nM [3H]fMLP, as described(34Iiri T. Ohoka Y. Ui M. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1020-1026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes (10-12.5 μg of protein) were incubated at 30°C for 5 min in 25 μl of buffer N containing 0.5 mM App[NH]p, 1 μM [γ-32P]GTP (3-7 × 103 counts/min/pmol), an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 0.1 mM ATP, 3 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and various concentrations of fMLP. The reactions were terminated, and phosphate release was quantitated by charcoal absorption, as described (36Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. van D.C. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Membranes were solubilized with CHAPS and Gi2 was purified essentially as described(34Iiri T. Ohoka Y. Ui M. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1020-1026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were solubilized with 5 ml of buffer A containing 1% CHAPS and 100 mM NaCl. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, the clear supernatant fractions, in buffer B-1 (buffer A containing 0.7% CHAPS and 50 mM NaCl), was applied to a column of DEAE-Toyopearl 650(S) (1 × 10 cm) which had been equilibrated with 50 ml of buffer B-1. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer B-1 and then eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a 40-ml linear gradient of NaCl (50-250 mM) in buffer B-1. Gi3 and Gi2 were recovered at 100 and 130 mM NaCl, respectively. The second major peak fractions containing Gi2 were concentrated to approximately 1 ml (using Centricon-10 filters, Amicon) and then fractionated on a column (1.6 × 50 cm) of Sephacryl S-300(HR) which had been equilibrated with buffer B-2 (buffer A containing 0.5% sodium cholate, 1 μM GDP, and 100 mM NaCl). Gi2 fractions were further applied to a column of Mono Q HR5/5 which had been equilibrated with 20 ml of buffer B-1. The column was washed with 2 ml of buffer B-1 and then eluted at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min with a 20-ml linear gradient of NaCl (100-300 mM) in buffer B-1. Fractions containing Gi2, in buffer B-3 (buffer A containing 10% glycerol, 0.5% sodium cholate, and 1 μM GDP), were applied to a column of Hi-Trap Heparin (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol; 1-ml bed volume) which had been equilibrated with 5 ml of buffer B-3. Gi2 was recovered in flow-through fractions. The fractions containing Gi2 were concentrated and stored at −85°C. Cytosol of HL-60 cells (1-2 × 109 cells) was diluted with equal volume of buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% sodium cholate) and applied to a column of Hi-Trap Heparin (1-ml bed volume) which had been equilibrated with 5 ml of buffer C. The column was washed with 3 ml of buffer C and then eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a 25-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-500 mM) in buffer C. Phospholipase C activity was measured using sonicated micelles of 50 μM [inositol-2-3H]phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (20,000 counts/min/tube) and 450 μM phosphatidylethanolamine in a solution containing 50 mM MES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM EGTA, and 1.2 mM CaCl2 (to give 0.3 μM free Ca2+)(37Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The final concentration of sodium cholate was 0.08%. Reactions were terminated and released IP3 was quantitated as described(38Homma Y. Imaki J. Nakanishi O. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6592-6598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before the assay, Gi2 was activated by incubation with 10 μM GTPγS in a reaction mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5% cholate, and 10 mM MgCl2 at 30°C for 30 min. For immunoblotting of γ subunits, purified Gi2 or the cholate-solubilized particulate fractions of HL-60 cells, prepared as described(14Cali J.J. Balcueva E.A. Rybalkin I. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24023-24027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose blots, using a high temperature transfer procedure(39Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with either the γ2/3-specific antibody (B-17), the γ5-specific antibody (D-9), or the γ7-specific antibody (A-67) at a serum dilution of 1:200. The specificities of these antibodies against various recombinant γ subunits have been described previously(15Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); γ2 is distinguished from γ3 by their differing mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(15Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected by incubation of the blots with 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment (Du Pont NEN). Immunoblot analysis of α and β subunits was performed as described(40Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody AS/7 and EC/2 were purchased from DuPont NEN. The specificities of rabbit polyclonal antibodies, β-636, β-637, and β-638 to β1, β2, and β3, respectively, were described previously(11Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Yamane H.K. Bok D. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24776-24781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific antibody for β4 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Bovine brain Gi2, αi2, and βγ subunit were purified as described(41Katada T. Oinuma M. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8182-8191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation of Giα subunits by PTX, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing was performed as described(28Tohkin M. Morishima N. Iiri T. Takahashi K. Ui M. Katada T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Iiri T. Ohoka Y. Ui M. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1020-1026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). fMLP-stimulated O2− generation was measured by assaying the reduction of cytochrome c, as described (42Simchowitz L. Spilberg I. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1979; 93: 583-593PubMed Google Scholar). fMLP-dependent IP3 production in intact cells was measured using an IP3 assay kit (Amersham Corp.), as described(43Seishima M. Yada Y. Nagao S. Mori S. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In agreement with the idea that the mode of action of RA differs from that of Me2SO, exposure of HL-60 cells to RA for 24 h barely increased fMLP-dependent O2− generation, but O2− generation was dramatically increased by addition of RA during the last 24 h of differentiation induced by Me2SO (Fig. 1A). Similarly, RA treatment enhanced activation of PLCβ by fMLP over and above the effect of Me2SO alone (Fig. 1B) although RA alone (24 h) did not induce detectable activation of PLCβ by fMLP (not shown). Differentiation induced by Me2SO or RA was followed by termination of cell proliferation (after 1 day for RA or 4-5 days for Me2SO). With either agent, HL-60 cells began to die 24-48 h after proliferation ceased (not shown). fMLP binding and fMLP-dependent GTPase assays in membranes suggested that RA enhances the interaction between Gi and fMLP receptor. We first investigated fMLP binding in membranes from HL-60 cells treated with Me2SO alone (5 days) or with Me2SO (5 days) plus RA (during the last day of treatment) (D versus DR). As assessed by PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of αi, the membrane Gi content of D and DR membranes were almost equal (25 versus 28 pmol/mg protein, respectively), indicating that co-exposure to RA did not affect the expression of Gi. Like the binding of many agonists to Gi-coupled receptors, fMLP binding is diminished in the presence of GTPγS(35Iiri T. Ohoka Y. Ui M. Katada T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 44Gierschik P. Steisslinger M. Sidiropoulos D. Herrmann E. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); presumably, this is because receptor-Gi complexes have a higher binding affinity for agonists, and binding of GTPγS to αi promotes dissociation of Gi from receptors. D and DR membranes contained apparently equal numbers of fMLP-binding sites, as measured in the presence of GTPγS, while the number of sites sensitive to GTPγS was greater in DR than in D membranes (Fig. 2, A and B). The fMLP-binding sites that disappear in the presence of GTPγS are assumed to represent fMLP receptors that would be coupled to Gi in the absence of the guanine nucleotide, while the GTPγS-insensitive-binding sites are thought to represent receptors uncoupled from Gi. Following this interpretation, the data in Fig. 2, A and B, show that treatment with Me2SO plus RA enhanced coupling of fMLP receptors to Gi more than did treatment with Me2SO alone. Although GTP hydrolysis stimulated by maximally effective concentrations of fMLP was almost equal in D and DR membranes, fMLP stimulated GTPase activity with an EC50 that was almost 10-fold lower in DR, as opposed to D membranes (Fig. 2C). By this criterion also, RA enhanced the interaction between fMLP receptors and Gi. Membranes from HL-60 cells treated with RA alone (for 1 or 2 days) showed no detectable fMLP-binding or fMLP-stimulated GTPase activity. In the presence of Me2SO, exposure of the cells to RA for more than 24 h inhibited the induction of fMLP binding and the Gi increase induced by Me2SO (data not shown). The principal PTX substrate in HL-60 cells is the α subunit, αi2, of Gi2; these cells contain a small amount of αi3, but do not express other potential PTX substrates, such as αi1 or αo(23Oinuma M.

FEBS Lett. 1987; 221: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To assess differentiation-induced changes in Gi2, we purified the Gi2 heterotrimer from D or DR membranes, without detectable contamination of Gi3(34Iiri T. Ohoka Y. Ui M. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1020-1026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess interactions of pure Gi2 with fMLP receptors, we prepared acceptor membranes from PTX-treated cells; in these membranes, fMLP binding was completely unaffected by the presence of GTPγS, indicating that PTX treatment had completely uncoupled endogenous Gi from the receptors. In order to test specifically the additional differentiating effect of RA, the acceptor membranes were prepared from cells differentiated in the presence of Me2SO alone. Addition of pure Gi2 to these membranes increased the binding of fMLP to its receptors, and this increased binding was blocked by GTPγS. Gi2 purified from DR cells (DR-Gi2) was much more effective in enhancing GTPγS-sensitive fMLP binding than was pure Gi2 from D cells (D-Gi2) (Fig. 3A), in agreement with parallel observations (Fig. 2, A and B) of the effects of GTPγS on fMLP binding to sites in DR versus D membranes, in experiments in which the receptors were coupled to endogenous Gi2. We compared the abilities of three purified Gi2 preparations to enhance fMLP binding in PTX-treated acceptor membranes; at a concentration of 5 nM, these pure Gi2 proteins enhanced fMLP binding with a rank order of DR-Gi2 > Gi2 purified from bovine brain ≫ D-Gi2 (Fig. 3B). In addition to increasing the ability of Gi2 to interact with fMLP receptors, RA treatment greatly enhanced the ability of GTPγS-activated Gi2 to stimulate PLC activity partially purified from HL-60 cytosol. Cytosol, obtained from DR HL-60 cells, was fractionated on a Hi-Trap Heparin column in an NaCl gradient (see “Experimental Procedures”), and PLC activities of individual fractions were assayed without an activator (control) or in the presence of either 30 nM βγ purified from bovine brain or 10 nM GTPγS-activated DR-Gi2 (Fig. 4A). PLC activity was eluted from the column in two peaks; the second peak of PLC activity was similarly activated by both GTPγS-activated DR-Gi2 and bovine brain βγ, in keeping with previous evidence (18Camps M.

Column fraction 26, which showed maximal fold stimulation by both activated DR-Gi2 and βγ, was used to test the molar potency of pure βγ, DR-Gi2, and D-Gi2 as stimulators of βγ-sensitive PLC activity. On a molar basis, GTPγS-activated DR-Gi2 appeared slightly more potent as a stimulator of PLC than did pure βγ from bovine brain. Both were much more effective stimulators than was GTPγS-activated D-Gi2 (Fig. 4B). In accord with work by others (18Camps M. Hou C. Sidiropoulos D. Stock J.B. Jakobs K.H. Gierschik P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 25Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), GTPgS-activated αi2 from bovine brain did not stimulate this PLC activity. Because DR-Gi2 interacted with the fMLP receptor and stimulated a βγ-sensitive PLC activity more effectively than did D-Gi2, we asked whether the difference might be accounted for by a qualitative difference between the βγ subunits of the two proteins. The immunoblots of Fig. 5A show that both the D- and DR-Gi2 preparations contained similar relative amounts of β1, β2, and β4 (β3 was not detectable in either type of preparation; result not shown). Although both Gi2 preparations contained γ5 and γ7, only the DR-Gi2 contained detectable γ2 (Fig. 5B). Indeed, immunoblots of membrane proteins from undifferentiated or Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells revealed no immunoreactive γ2, although γ2 could be detected in immunoblots of membranes of cells treated with RA alone (for 2 days) and was much more prominent in membranes from DR cells (Fig. 5C). Although the γ2 band was detected with an antibody that binds both γ2 and γ3, the presence of γ3 was ruled out by virtue of its different mobility from γ2, and also because a γ3-specific antibody failed to detect γ3 in extracts of DR cells (results not shown). Thus, Me2SO and RA synergistically increased fMLP-dependent activation of PLC (Fig. 1C) in parallel with their synergistic effect on expression of γ2. After ADP-ribosylation by PTX and radioactive NAD+, D- and DR-Gi preparations were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Apparent molecular weights and isoelectric points of αi2 in the two preparations were identical (results not shown), suggesting that differentiation in the presence of RA did not produce a change in size or charge of αi2. In this report we show that RA potentiates Me2SO as an inducer of fMLP-dependent PLC activation in HL-60 cells and that this potentiation results, at least in part, from a qualitative change in the βγ subunit of Gi2. RA enhances the abilities of Gi2 both to interact with fMLP receptor and also to activate a βγ-sensitive PLC in the cytosol of differentiated HL-60 cells. RA induces expression of a specific γ subunit, γ2, which is otherwise not found in either Gi2 or membrane fractions of HL-60 cells. This is the first demonstration that a differentia-tion factor regulates both the function and the polypeptide composition of a G protein βγ subunit. Moreover, if expression of γ2 is responsible for the enhanced signaling ability of Gi2, this is the first demonstration that the specific co"

The specificity of the response appears to reside in the spacing between the hexamers, with response elements for vitamin D restricted to direct repeats separated by a 3-base pair (bp) spacer, thyroid hormone a 4-bp spacer, and retinoic acid a 5-bp spacer (3-4-5 rule). Recently we have shown that the optimum thyroid hormone receptor binding site consists of an 8-bp sequence (TAAGGTCA), not a hexamer. Therefore we tested whether the 3-4-5 rule is valid for octamer sequence direct repeats. In transfection experiments octamer direct repeats with 3-, 4-, or 5-bp spacers conferred equivalently strong thyroid hormone responses, although a repeat with a 9-bp spacer was substantially weaker. For the 4- and 5-bp spacer constructs, the 5′ half-site octamer had as strong an influence on thyroid hormone induction as did the 3′ half-site octamer, although for the 3-bp spacer construct the 5′ octamer was marginally less potent than the 3′ octamer. Transfection and gel shift experiments did not suggest a simple correlation between the binding of thyroid hormone receptor-retinoid X receptor heterodimers and thyroid hormone induction from these response elements. We conclude that half-site sequence can override the effect of spacing in determining the hormone responsiveness of a direct repeat response element. In addition, the thyroid hormone response may not be due simply to the binding of thyroid hormone receptor-retinoid X receptor heterodimers to the DNA.

In the case of thyroid hormone-responsive genes, T3 regulation is dependent on the binding of TRs to specific cis-acting sequences, or T3 response elements (TREs)(1Koenig R.J. Brent G.A. Warne R.L.

The well characterized positive TRE in the promoter of the rat growth hormone (GH) gene has been shown to consist of three copies of a loosely conserved hexamer motif, AGGTCA(6Brent G.A. Harney J.W.

Differential spacing between hexamer half-sites has been proposed to account for the specificity of the T3-, RA-, and vitD-dependent responses of otherwise equivalent DR response elements. Thus, a DR of the hexamer AGGTCA has been shown to function specifically as a vitD response element (VDRE) if the hexamers are separated by 3 base pairs (bp), as a TRE if the spacer is 4 bp, and as an RA response element (RARE) if the spacer is 5 bp (3-4-5 rule)(8Umesono K.

Recently, we and others have shown that nucleotides surrounding the hexamer sequence can influence TR binding and function(12Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol.

A protocol of sequential electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications allowed us to identify the optimal TRα1 monomer binding sequence from an original pool of random DNA sequences(12Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This optimal binding sequence, 5′-TAAGGTCA, is 2 bp longer than the consensus hexamer sequence. We have demonstrated that the 2 additional 5′ bp are important for the binding and function of TRs (12Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that a single octamer sequence can function as a TRE but not as an RARE, VDRE, or RXR response element (RXRE)(15Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18915-18920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3-4-5 rule was based on functional studies of the effect of variable spacing between hexamer sequences. In retrospect, the hexamer AGGTCA represents an incomplete TR binding sequence. Therefore we wanted to evaluate the effect of spacing on the ligand responses of reporter genes containing optimal octamer TRα1 binding sequences arranged as DR response elements. In the transfection studies described below, we demonstrate that octamer DRs with 3-, 4-, and 5-bp spacers 2In order to maintain continuity with the original description of spacing effects on ligand-dependent response elements, all spacings of DR response elements denote the nucleotide distances between the traditional core hexamer motifs. all function as equally strong TREs. Thus, the two upstream nucleotides of the receptor binding site play a prominent role in determining the strength and specificity of T3 DR response elements. Various response element sequences were ligated as single copies into the unique BamHI site of pUTKAT3 located upstream of the basal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter directing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression(16Moore D.D.

The reporter plasmid ptkMA contains a single copy of the octamer sequence inserted into pUTKAT3 (12Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol.

In naming the complex reporter plasmids, the number preceding “DR” signifies whether the half-sites are octamers or hexamers, and the number following DR signifies the bp spacing between the core AGGTCA sequences. The plasmid ptk6DR4 was described previously as ptk6DR(17Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol.

For example, ptk86DR3 had the octamer in the upstream position, whereas ptk68DR3 had the octamer in the downstream position.

Transfections included 3 μg of receptor (or control pCDM) plus an additional 3 μg of pCDM vector as “filler” plasmid. Reporter plasmids (described under “DNA Construction”) were transfected at a dose of 4 μg/Petri dish. To control for transfection efficiency, each transfection also included 0.25 μg of pRSVGH, in which the Rous sarcoma virus promoter directs expression of human GH. This reporter plasmid was not affected by the cotransfection of the different receptors or their respective ligands (data not shown). Cells in 60-mm Petri dishes were transfected in the presence of 90% modified Eagle's medium plus 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 nM dexamethasone and cultured for 2 days with or without the appropriate ligand. The ligand concentrations used were 10 nM T3, 1 μM all-trans-RA, and 100 nM vitD. Cell lysates were assayed for CAT activity and media were assayed for human GH as described previously(18Koenig R.J.

Ligand responsiveness is defined as CAT activity/human GH for cells cultured in media with ligand divided by CAT activity/human GH for cells cultured in media without ligand. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. for at least four transient transfections per condition. Ligand-induced CAT activity required the presence of the appropriate cotransfected receptor, except for a modest 2-3-fold RA induction of ptk8DR4 and ptk8DR5 in the absence of cotransfected RAR (data not shown). The DNA probes were obtained by PCR with primers specific to regions flanking the BamHI site in pUTKAT3 (PCR primers span bp 2211-2225 and 2279-2299 (reverse complement); the BamHI site is located at bp 2251). The templates were pUTKAT3 derivatives described under “DNA construction.” The amplification products were digested with EcoRI (restriction cleavage site located at bp 2233), and the PCR fragments were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9500-9505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein-DNA binding reactions were performed in 35 μl of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol. The incubations included varying amounts of receptor(s), 1.4 μg of poly(dI•dC), and 80,000 cpm of labeled DNA. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 40 min and then subjected to electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.25 × TBE buffer (22 mM Tris base, 22 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA) at room temperature. The gels were fixed in 30% methanol/10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to film with an intensifying screen for 1-6 h at −70°C as indicated. A series of transfections was performed examining the T3 responsiveness of variably spaced octamer DR reporter plasmids. Fig. 1 illustrates the T3-dependent increases in gene activation from a single octamer sequence (ptkMA) and DR octamer response elements with 3-, 4-, 5-, and 9-bp spacings (ptk8DR3, ptk8DR4, ptk8DR5, and ptk8DR9) in the presence of cotransfected TRα1. The 3-, 4-, and 5-bp spacer DR elements all showed equivalently robust T3 responsiveness, indicating that T3 induction from octamer DR response elements does not obey the 3-4-5 rule. In contrast, the T3 induction of CAT activity conferred by the 9-bp spacer DR was relatively weak. The more potent T3 responses on the 3-, 4-, and 5-bp DRs suggests that some type of dimeric T3 complex regulated transcription from these elements, and that increasing the spacing to 9 bp presumably limited this receptor interaction by introducing an additional half-turn of the DNA helix between the half-sites. These experiments also were performed with TRβ1 with similar findings (data not shown). A series of experiments was performed on the reporter plasmids containing variably spaced arrangements of the hexamer motif (5′-GCAGGTCA) to determine whether our laboratory could replicate the original observations that DR hexamers require a 4-bp spacer to function as TREs. As can be observed in Fig. 2, the reporter plasmid with a 4-bp spacer between the hexamer repeats (ptk6DR4) was the most responsive to T3 in the presence of TRα1, although a very modest T3 response was noted with the 3- and 5-bp spacer reporter plasmids. Thus, in contrast to the DR octamer data in Fig. 1, the T3 response of suboptimal hexamer sites obeys the 3-4-5 rule. In addition, increasing the spacing to 9 bp caused the hexamer DR element to become resistant to T3 induction. A similar lack of T3 response was previously noted with a response element composed of a single copy of the 5′-GCAGGTCA sequence(12Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The modest T3 response of 6DR4 relative to that of 8DR4 (~6-fold versus ~12-fold) indicates that suboptimal sites arranged as DRs do not act as potently as DRs of optimal sites. The requirement for appropriate spacing and the lack of T3 response by the 9-bp spacer element (ptk6DR9) also suggest that suboptimal TR binding sites require dimeric receptor interactions for positive T3 regulation. Experiments performed with TRβ1 had similar results (data not shown). Current evidence suggests that under most circumstances T3 induction of gene expression is mediated by TR•RXR heterodimers(23Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T.

When these heterodimers bind to traditional DR4 response elements, RXR occupies the 5′ half-site and TR occupies the 3′ half-site(29Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 30Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Näär A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, if TR•RXR heterodimers account for gene activation on the 8DR3-5 response elements, it might be expected that only the 3′ half-site would require the octamer sequence. This idea was tested in a series of transfections using TREs in which one half-site was an octamer and the other a hexamer (for example, 86DR4 has an octamer as the 5′ half-site and a hexamer as the 3′ half-site, whereas the opposite holds for 68DR4). In contrast to the above expectations, 86DR4 and 68DR4 were equally potent TREs, and in fact were as potent as 8DR4 (104 ± 5% and 115 ± 8% [mean ± SE] the T3 induction of 8DR4, respectively; n = 6). The results with the DR5 series again showed that the 5′ octamer was as potent as the 3′ octamer, although the DR5's with one octamer and one hexamer were slightly weaker TREs than the two octamer DR5. Thus, 86DR5 and 68DR5 showed 71 ± 8% and 70 ± 7% the T3 induction of 8DR5, respectively (n = 8). Results with the DR3 series were similar to those with the DR5's, except that there was a trend for the 5′ octamer to be marginally less potent than the 3′ octamer. Thus, 86DR3 showed 57 ± 12%, and 68DR3 70 ± 13%, the T3 induction of 8DR3 (n = 4). Overall, the results demonstrate that there is little if any difference in the effect of having the octamer in the 5′ versus 3′ half-site, suggesting that perhaps the T3 induction from these response elements cannot be accounted for solely by the binding of TR•RXR heterodimers. Since the 3-4-5 rule is not essential for T3 induction from octamer DR elements, we wished to determine whether it was important for RA or vitD induction from these same elements. The cotransfection of RARα with 8DR3, 8DR4 and 8DR5 showed that the 5-bp spacer response element had the greatest RA response, as predicted by the 3-4-5 rule (Fig. 3). Experiments in which VDR was cotransfected with the same reporter constructs revealed that 8DR3 had the greatest vitD response (Fig. 3), again consistent with the 3-4-5 rule. Thus, octamer half-sites relax the spacing requirement for T3 induction, but not for RA or vitD induction. The surprising result that 8DR3, 8DR4 and 8DR5 all are stronger TREs than 6DR4 led us to examine the nature of the TR-DNA complexes that form with these elements. Previous studies with hexamer DRs have shown that TR homodimers and TR•RXR heterodimers have a strong preference for DR elements with a 4-bp spacer and that the heterodimer forms a higher affinity complex than does the homodimer (10Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), especially in the presence of T3(17Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9500-9505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yen P.M. Darling D.S. Carter R.L. Forgione M. Umeda P.K. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

Therefore we examined the binding of TR•RXR heterodimers to the octamer DRs and 6DR4 by EMSA (Fig. 4). These experiments utilized a relatively low dose of TRα1 such that detectable monomer complexes formed with 8DR3, −4, and −5, but not with 6DR4, and homodimers did not form on any element (middle panel). The addition of RXR caused the formation of a more slowly migrating TR•RXR heterodimer complex with each element (right panel). The heterodimer-DNA complex was of comparable intensity on all DRs, even though 6DR4 is weaker as a TRE. Furthermore, both a single octamer and 8DR9 bound TR•RXR heterodimers nearly as well as did 8DR3-5 (data not shown), yet these also are weaker response elements (Fig. 1). Thus, the strength of 8DR3-5 as TREs cannot be explained simply by enhanced TR•RXR binding, at least as measured by EMSA. Although it may seem surprising that TR•RXR heterodimers can bind to a single octamer site, this probably reflects the fact that these receptors form stable heterodimers in solution off DNA(32Lazar M.A. Berrodin T.J. Harding H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5005-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and that heterodimerization does not substantially inhibit TR binding to the octamer. A similar observation has been published previously(15Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18915-18920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since TR homodimers might contribute to the T3 responsiveness of DR TREs, we also evaluated TR homodimer formation on the 8DRs by performing EMSAs with a 10-fold increased dose of TRα1. TR homodimers did not form on the single octamer element, but did form on 8DR3-8DR5 and 8DR9 with approximately equal intensity (data not shown). Since 8DR9 is a weak TRE, the strength of 8DR3-8DR5 as TREs cannot be directly correlated with the strength of TR homodimer binding as measured by EMSA. Although the EMSA data do not allow one to conclude whether TR monomers, TR homodimers, or TR•RXR heterodimers actually are involved in gene activation from the 8DR elements, they do indicate that all of these complexes could potentially contribute to the T3 response. Despite much progress over the last several years, the molecular basis of hormone-specific regulation of gene expression is still unclear. An essential component of a hormone response is the binding of the appropriate receptors to the regulatory regions of responsive genes. In order to understand this process relative to the ErbA superfamily of hormone receptors, it is necessary to determine the optimum binding sequence of each particular receptor, as well as the degree of cross-binding possible with other closely related members of this gene family. Previous investigators did not know a priori the exact size or sequence of the optimal TR binding site, so a consensus binding sequence was derived from limited mutagenesis of a complex TRE in the rat growth hormone promoter and sequence comparisons of the positive and negative TREs of a limited number of T3-responsive genes. The result was an initial characterization of the TR binding site as containing 6 nucleotides (5′-AGGTCA) and the observation that positive TREs consisted of complex arrangements of loosely conserved sites. In the case of DR elements, the effect of spacing was believed to be essential in conferring ligand-specific responses, with vitD responses being restricted to elements with a 3-bp spacer, T3 responses to elements with a 4-bp spacer, and RA responses to elements with a 5-bp spacer (3-4-5 rule). However, these studies were based on suboptimal TR binding sites. In the present report we demonstrate that DRs of the optimal (octamer) TR binding sequence are less affected by alterations in spacing than had been previously proposed according to the 3-4-5 rule. Thus, 8DR3, 8DR4, and 8DR5 all are capable of eliciting an equally strong T3 response. However, interposing an additional half-turn of DNA helix between the receptor binding sites (8DR9) weakens the magnitude of T3 induction. This suggests that the induction from 8DR3, 8DR4, and 8DR5 involves a protein-protein interaction in addition to DNA binding. This interaction can occur with half-site spacings of 3, 4, and 5 bp, but not 9 bp. It is perhaps surprising that 8DR9 is no more active than a single octamer sequence as a TRE. The explanation for this observation is not known. Although it could reflect an adverse effect of phasing on T3 induction, this TRE is more than 100 bp from the transcriptional start site and we are unaware of published data to demonstrate such effects for comparably positioned TREs. Alternatively, perhaps the number of TR monomers bound to DNA is not the rate-limiting factor for determining the level of T3 induction. In any case, it is clear that the 3-4-5 rule cannot be used to predict the specificity of hormone induction from these octamer DR response elements. Although the 3-4-5 rule represents a major advance in our understanding of a variable (spacing) that restricts the specificity of hormone induction from hexamer DR elements, this rule is less influential when optimal TR binding sequences are present. We conclude that the affinity of the DNA half-site sequence for TR has at least as great an influence on conferring ligand response as does the spacing of DRs (at least for spacings of 3-5 bp). TRs can bind to direct repeat TREs as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers with a variety of other ErbA superfamily members such as RXRs(23Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M.

However, indirect evidence has led to the notion that TR•RXR heterodimers may be the most important functional complex within the cell, at least for traditional hexameric DR4 TREs(23Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.Y. Staub A. Garnier J.M. Mader S. Chambon P.

TR•RXR heterodimers have been shown to bind DNA with the 5′ half-site occupied by RXR and the 3′ half-site by TR(29Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 30Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Näär A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, if the transcriptional response from 8DR3-5 were due entirely to the binding of TR•RXR heterodimers, one would expect that the octamer would be required only for the 3′ half-site. This is especially the case since the optimal half-site sequence for RXRα binding is GGGGTCA, not TAAGGTCA(36Subauste J.S. Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30232-30237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a direct test using reporters comprising one octamer and one hexamer half-site failed to substantiate this prediction. Indeed, 86DR4 was as potent as 68DR4, and also as potent as 8DR4. Although neither 86DR5 nor 68DR5 was quite as potent as 8DR5, the 5′ octamer was again as potent as the 3′ octamer. These data argue against TR•RXR heterodimers as being the sole activators of transcription from the 8DR elements. This conclusion is further supported by EMSA data (Fig. 4), which demonstrate that 6DR4 binds TR•RXR heterodimers as well as the 8DRs, even though it is weaker as a TRE. It is likely that part of the T3 induction from the 8DR elements is accounted for by TR monomers(12Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18915-18920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is possible that TR homodimers or TR heterodimers with other co-regulators also may account for some of the induction. When the octamer elements were tested for RA and vitD induction, the 5-bp spacer (8DR5) was found to be the most potent RARE, and the 3-bp spacer (8DR3) had the greatest vitD response. Thus, in contrast to the above data for TRs, the specificity of induction by RAR and VDR on these sequences does conform to the 3-4-5 rule. However, it appears that TAAGGTCA does not represent the optimal binding site for RAR (37Mader S. Leroy P. Chen J. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or VDR(38Nishikawa J. Matsumoto M. Sakoda K. Kitaura M. Imagawa M. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19739-19743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Freedman L.P. Arce V. Fernandez R.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is possible that variably spaced DR response elements composed of the optimal binding sequences for RAR or VDR will show RA and vitD responses that do not conform to the 3-4-5 rule, analogous to what is shown here for T3 and 8DR3-5. As noted above, it appears that T3-responsive cells may contain a diverse population of TR-containing complexes ranging from TR monomers to several different TR dimers and potentially larger complexes. The ability of a particular DNA sequence to confer a T3 response in a particular cell or tissue may depend on the affinity of different specific TR-containing complexes for that sequence. Since a T3 response requires the binding of a TR-containing complex, TREs appear to require at least one TR binding site. Genes whose regulatory regions contain one or more optimal TR binding sites may have their T3 response transduced by TR monomers, homodimers, heterodimers, and/or larger order complexes. In those cases where the individual half-sites are suboptimal for TR binding, a TR homo- or heterodimer may still possess sufficient cooperative affinity such that it may confer T3 responsiveness. In order to understand the relative contribution of each TR-containing complex to conferring T3 responsiveness in various tissues, it will be necessary to understand how TRs bind to different arrangements of optimal and suboptimal sites. In addition it will be necessary to understand how each of the potential dimerization partners of TRs bind to their own optimal and suboptimal sites. Since many members of this receptor family are closely related, a particular DNA sequence may function as a high affinity site for one receptor complex and a modest affinity site for several other receptor complexes. With the close proximity of two sites, some sequences can function as response elements for multiple receptors (e.g. a palindromic sequence can function as a TRE and an RARE; (40Umesono K. Giguere V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 336: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and other arrangements will be more restricted in their potential receptor interactions (e.g. TAAGGTCA can function as a TRE but not an RXRE, RARE, or VDRE; (15Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18915-18920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We believe it is reasonable to propose that a T3-responsive cell contains a limited variety of TR complexes (monomers, specific heterodimers, etc.) and that each TR complex will confer the greatest ligand response to a set of regulatory elements that bind a particular complex with the highest affinity and in a conformation supportive of trans-activation. For example, TR monomers will confer the greatest T3 response from a single octamer sequence 5′-TAAGGTCA placed in a forward orientation relative to the transcriptional start site(12Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this view, TR homodimers will confer maximal T3 responses to sites composed of two copies of 5′-TAAGGTCA. Based on studies showing that RXR binds 5′ to TR in TR•RXR heterodimers(29Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 30Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Näär A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that TR•RXR heterodimers will confer the greatest T3 response from an element composed of an optimal TR binding site in close proximity and downstream of an optimal RXR binding site. Thus, changes in the composition of the pool of TR complexes could alter the genetic response of a cell to T3. It is possible that the presence or absence of a particular TR complex may account for the tissue-specific effects of T3. Before one can understand physiologic and pathologic hormone or vitamin regulation at the transcriptional level, it will be necessary to characterize the optimal binding sites for a large group of related zinc finger receptors (such as RARs, RXRs, and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor), determine how different combinations of sequences confer ligand-restricted changes in gene expression through specific receptor combinations, and identify these sequences as the actual regulatory elements of specific sets of genes modulated by the relevant hormone receptors.

Miller R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). From the DNase I footprinting analysis, we deduced the location for binding of the mesangial cell nuclear protein which binds to −82 to −102 in the 5′-flanking region of the PDGF-A chain promoter. Complementary pairs of single-stranded deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to form double-stranded 21-bp oligomers (specific oligomer): 5′-GGCCCGGAATCCGGGGGAGGC-3′; 3′-CCGGGCCTTAGGCCCCCTCCG-5′. In addition, complementary pairs of nonspecific single-stranded deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to form double-stranded 15-bp oligomer (nonspecific oligomer): 5′-TAACCTCACCTGGCA-3′; 3′-ATTGGAGTGGACCGT-5′. In addition, we used a 22-bp oligomer which corresponds to one of the binding sites for SP-1 (Promega) with the following nucleotide sequence: 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; 3′-TAAGCTAGCCCCGCCCCGCTCG-5′. Double-stranded oligomers in which specific bases were mutated were also synthesized (Fig. 9A) and used in gel retardation assays. Double-stranded deoxyoligonucleotides (specific oligo −82 to −102) or SP-1 were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The binding reactions were performed in 10 μl containing labeled probe (10,000 cpm) in a final concentration of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and nuclear extracts. Binding reactions were initiated by adding labeled probe and incubation was performed for 30 min on ice. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 40 mM Tris glycine buffer (pH 8.6). Gel was dried at 80°C before autoradiography. For competition assays, unlabeled competitor DNA oligomers were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice before addition of labeled probe. PDGF-A chain/CAT constructs containing PDGF-A chain promoter sequences from −120 to +8 (pACCATe36) and −82 to +8 (pACCATf11) in promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid pSPCAT3 (kindly provided by Dr. T. Collins, Birgham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) were constructed as described(20Gashler A.L. Bonthron D.T. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Collins T. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10984-10988Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This procedure was performed by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene pulsar electroporator. Nearly confluent cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin and sedimented. Cells (10 × 106) were resuspended in 1 ml of minimal essential medium/fetal bovine serum. Electroporation was performed with 20 μg of pACCATe36 and pACCATf11 plasmids at 340 volts and a capacitance of 960 microfarad. Cells were then incubated on ice for 5 min and plated at approximately 80% confluence. Cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of SV40-β-galactosidase fusion gene (pSV2-β-gal) as an internal control for transfection efficiency(21Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 22Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection, cells were made quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium for 24 h before treatment with PMA (10−7M) for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. CAT activity was measured at 37°C from the rate of conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to acetylated products as described previously(16Bhandari B. Roesler W.J. Delisio K.D. Klemm D.J. Ross N.S.

We have performed DNase I footprinting analysis to identify protein binding sequences in the promoter region of the PDGF-A chain gene. A diagram for PDGF-A chain promoter is shown in Fig. 1. A 1.16-kilobase MluI/MstII fragment of the 5′-flanking region of PDGF-A chain promoter was inserted into SP-65. This includes TATA box and sites for binding early growth response elements (Egr-1) and SP-1 in the GC-rich region of the PDGF-A chain promoter(23Bonthron D.T. Morton C.C. Orkin S.H. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1492-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have used a 380-bp DNA fragment (XhoI/HindIII, labeled at XhoI) of the PDGF-A chain promoter for the DNase I footprint analysis (Fig. 1). Nuclear extracts from human mesangial cells maintained in complete cultured medium protected from DNase I digestion a region in the 5′-flanking sequence of PDGF-A chain promoter (Fig. 2). These data suggest that human mesangial cells contain a nuclear protein that binds to a DNA sequence at the location −82 to −102 in the PDGF-A chain promoter region (Fig. 1). The protein will be referred to as PDGF-A-BP-1. The sequence that binds this protein is shown in Fig. 1. We performed gel mobility shift analysis to obtain further evidence for the presence of the putative PDGF-A-BP-1. Quiescent human mesangial cells were incubated with PMA for 3 h. Cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were prepared. Oligomer containing the nucleotide sequence for the binding site for PDGF-A-BP-1 was synthesized (Fig. 1), 5′-end labeled, and used for gel mobility shift analysis. Data in Fig. 3 clearly demonstrate formation of DNA-protein complexes. Three DNA-protein complexes A1, A2, and A3 are observed. Gel mobility shift analysis (Fig. 3, lane 2) demonstrates that incubation with phorbol ester induces PDGF-A-BP-1 by >20-fold (complex A1) compared to control untreated cells (Fig. 3, lane 3). The DNA-protein complex A1 is more abundant than A2 or A3. The induction of the PDGF-A chain mRNA expression by phorbol ester has been demonstrated in other cell lines. We used nuclear extracts from human liver fat-storing cells that were kept quiescent in serum-free medium (Fig. 4, lane 2) or treated with 10−7M PMA for 4 h (Fig. 4, lane 3). Similar to human mesangial cells, gel mobility shift analysis demonstrates the formation of a PMA-inducible protein-DNA complex using nuclear extracts from human fat-storing liver cells.Figure 4:Induction of PDGF-A-BP-1 by phorbol ester in gel mobility shift analysis in liver fat-storing cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared from liver fat-storing cells made quiescent in serum-free medium for 2 days and same cells treated with 10−7M PMA for 4 h. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 5′-end labeled specific oligomer probe for 30 min on ice and then analyzed on 6.7% polyacrylamide gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein-DNA complexes are labeled as A1, A2, and A3. 5 μg of nuclear proteins were used in the gel mobility shift assays as follows: lane 1, labeled probe alone without nuclear extract; lane 2, nuclear extract from quiescent cells; lane 3, nuclear extract from cells maintained in serum-free medium and treated with PMA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to ascertain the specificity of the observed DNA-protein complex A1, we performed competition assays using gel mobility shift analysis. We used a nonspecific oligomer which has no sequence homology with the binding site for PDGF-A-BP-1. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells made quiescent in serum-free media for 2 days and the same cells incubated with phorbol ester for 3 h. Data indicate that DNA-protein complex A1 was specifically competed for when 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe was used (Fig. 5, lane 4). In addition, preincubation with a 100-fold molar excess of nonspecific oligomer did not compete for the binding site of PDGF-A-BP-1 (Fig. 5, lane 5). We compared the consensus sequence for the binding site of PDGF-A-BP-1 with known transcription factors which contain abundant G and C nucleotides. There are several known transcription factors which have some sequence homology for the binding site for PDGF-A-BP-1 (Table 1) but none of them have perfect homology. SP-1 has a consensus binding sequence that has abundant GC nucleotides (Table 1) and has sequence homology with the 3′-end of the binding sequence for PDGF-A-BP-1. We used SP-1 oligomer to test whether the observed protein-DNA complex (A1) is due to SP-1. Our data for human mesangial cells (Fig. 6, lane 5), as well as for liver fat-storing cells (Fig. 4, lane 6) demonstrate that SP-1 did not compete specifically with PDGF-A-BP-1. To further confirm these findings, we labeled SP-1 oligomer and performed competition assays using unlabeled oligomer (−82 to −102) corresponding to the binding site for PDGF-A-BP-1 in gel mobility shift analysis. Our results show that unlabeled oligomer did not compete with SP-1 (Fig. 7, lane 5). In addition, DNA-protein complexes formed have different gel mobility when labeled SP-1 oligomer was used (Fig. 7). The consensus nucleotide sequence for the binding site of Egr-1 shares homology to the 5′-end of the sequence for the binding site for PDGF-A-BP-1 (Table 1). When Egr-1 peptide was incubated with labeled oligomer (−82 to −102), no DNA-protein complex formation was observed in the absence of nuclear extracts from PMA-stimulated cells (Fig. 8, lanes 3 and 4). In addition, preincubation of nuclear extracts with Egr-1 polyclonal antibody did not compete with PDGF-A-BP-1 (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 6). These data demonstrate specificity of protein-DNA complex A1 and shows that PDGF-A-BP-1 is neither a SP-1- nor Egr-1-like transcription factor.Table I Open table in a new tab Figure 7:Competition studies using labeled SP-1 oligomer in gel mobility shift assays. Experimental details are as for Fig. 3 except that labeled oligomer used in binding assays was SP-1 instead of oligomer corresponding to binding site for PDGF-A-BP-1. Lane 1, labeled SP-1 oligomer without nuclear extract; lanes 2-5 contained nuclear extracts and labeled SP-1 as follows: lane 2, no competitor; lane 3, 100-fold excess unlabeled SP-1 oligomer; lane 4, 100-fold excess nonspecific oligomer; lane 5; 100-fold excess unlabeled specific oligomer corresponding to binding site for PDGF-A-BP-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8:Effect of Egr-1 peptide and Egr-1 IgG on binding of labeled specific oligomer corresponding to the binding site for PDGF-A-BP-1 and nuclear extracts from human mesangial cells in gel mobility shift analysis.

Blocks of 6 bases were deleted from wild type 21-base pair oligomer at three different regions. Gel mobility shift analysis data (Fig. 9B) demonstrate the formation of DNA-protein complex when either labeled wild type −82/-102 (lanes 1 and 2) or mut −82/-96 oligomer was used for binding assays. When labeled mut −88/-102 (lanes 5 and 6) or mut −82/-88, −95/-102 oligomers were used in gel mobility shift assay, the formation of DNA-protein complexes were abolished (compared to lanes 1-4). Using competition analysis, the results (Fig. 9C) demonstrate that DNA-protein complex A1 was specifically competed for when 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe (mut −82/-96) was used. On the other hand, preincubation with 100-fold molar excess of nonspecific oligomer did not compete for the binding site of PDGF-A-BP-1 (Fig. 9C). These data clearly indicate that the sequences −82 to −96 of the PDGF-A chain promoter are required for the binding of PDGF-A-BP-1. In order to assess the potential function of PDGF-A-BP-1 sequences, we used pACCATe36 and pACCATf11 fusion genes. These constructs include nucleotides −120 to +8 and −82 to +8 of the PDGF-A chain promoter inserted upstream of the promoterless CAT gene(20Gashler A.L. Bonthron D.T. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Collins T. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10984-10988Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The PDGF-A-BP-1 binding site present in pACCATe36 is deleted in the pACCATf11 construct. The promoter activity in response to PMA was measured in rat vascular smooth muscle cells, which were co-transfected with pSV2-β-galactosidase to normalize for any variation in the transfection efficiency(21Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 22Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Since human mesangial cells were difficult to transfect, we choose rat vascular smooth muscle cells to demonstrate the functional importance of PDGF-A-BP-1 sequences. The data from two separate experiments are shown in Fig. 10. The data clearly demonstrate a 2.4-fold increase in CAT activity in response to PMA when pACCATe36 containing PDGF-A-BP-1 sequences were used in the experiments. There was no difference in PMA-inducible CAT activity when the pACCATf11 construct was used in transfection studies. The structure of the PDGF-A chain gene has been described in detail by several investigators(23Bonthron D.T. Morton C.C. Orkin S.H. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expression of PDGF-A in mesangial and other cells has recently been demonstrated to be regulated by a number of agents including phorbol ester, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α and β, and thrombin(5Knauss T.C.

We have recently shown that PDGF-A chain gene transcription in human mesangial cells is induced by phorbol ester(14Bhandari B. Abboud H.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 91: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism(s) which regulate PDGF-A chain gene transcription, we analyzed the 5′-flanking sequence of the human PDGF-A chain promoter. We have used DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift analyses to identify protein(s) that bind to the 5′-flanking region of the PDGF-A chain promoter. Identification of potential regulatory elements will help understand PDGF-A chain gene regulation in mesangial and other cells that express abundant levels of PDGF-A chain mRNA. By DNase I footprint analysis, we deduced the boundaries of the nucleotide sequences protected from DNase I digestion which revealed a location at approximately −82 to −102 from transcription initiation site of the PDGF-A chain promoter. This suggests that nuclear extracts from human mesangial cells contain a nuclear protein (PDGF-A-BP-1) that binds to a DNA sequence (GGCCCGGAATCCGGGGGAGGC) in the 5′-flanking region of the PDGF-A chain promoter. It is noteworthy that by S1 nuclease analysis, S1 hypersensitive sites SHSI and SHSII have recently been identified in the 5′-flanking region of the PDGF-A chain promoter(25Wang Z.Y. Lin X.H. Nobyuoshi M. Qui Q.Q. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang Z.Y. Lin X.H. Qui Q.Q. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17022-17031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SHSI site is within the PDGF-A-BP-1 binding site, whereas the SHSII site is in the GC-rich region of the PDGF-A chain promoter(25Wang Z.Y. Lin X.H. Nobyuoshi M. Qui Q.Q. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang Z.Y. Lin X.H. Qui Q.Q. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17022-17031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DNase I protection assays showed a protected region between −98 and −49 from the transcription start site and this region is implicated in the regulation of Wilms' tumor suppresser gene WTI(20Gashler A.L. Bonthron D.T. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Collins T. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10984-10988Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We have used gel mobility shift analyses to further confirm the results obtained by DNase I protection analysis (Fig. 2). Data reported in this article demonstrate that the binding site for PDGF-A-BP-1 in the 5′-flanking region of PDGF-A chain promoter is specific. A comparison of identified sequences for binding of PDGF-A-BP-1 to several known transcription factors shows no perfect homology (Table 1). The binding site (−82 to −102) for PDGF-A-BP-1 contains abundant G and C nucleotides similar to transcription factors that are rich in GC nucleotides. The transcription factors: Egr-1 (also called NGF-I-A, Krox24, Tis 8, Zif 268) and Egr-2 and Egr-3 (27Christy B. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Auwerx J. Ny T. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15086-15091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that while several transcription factors (Table 1) appear to show remarkable sequence homology, they differ in their properties. There are several binding sites for Egr-1 that are located in the GC-rich region of the 5′-flanking region of the PDGF-A chain promoter. However, Egr peptide does not form protein-DNA complexes when incubated with the labeled oligomer and preincubation of nuclear extracts with Egr-1 antibody does not interfere with binding of PDGF-A-BP-1 (Fig. 8). These data indicate that the putative factor is not Egr-1. In addition, there are a number of SP-1 binding sites located in the GC-rich region of PDGF-A chain promoter. Comparison of sequence homology for SP-1 binding site and that for PDGF-A-BP-1 reveal some homology at the 3′-end of the binding sequence for PDGF-A-BP-1. We therefore used SP-1 for competition analysis in gel mobility shift assays. By using labeled oligomer (−82 to −102) or SP-1 oligomer, we have shown that PDGF-A-BP-1 is not SP-1 (Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8:). This is due to the fact that the consensus sequence for SP-1 did not compete with the PDGF-A-BP-1 binding sequence (Figure 6:, Figure 7:) and the PDGF-A-BP-1 binding sequence did not compete with SP-1 for binding (Fig. 7). Deletion of specific bases within the PDGF-A-BP-1 binding sequence demonstrates that sequences −82 to −96 of PDGF-A chain promoter are required for binding of the PDGF-A-BP-1 (Fig. 9). These data, together with functional analysis of PDGF-A-BP-1 sequences (Fig. 10), strongly suggest that PDGF-A-BP-1 is a novel nuclear protein. In conclusion, we have identified by DNase I footprint analysis, a sequence (−82 to −102) in the 5′-flanking region of the PDGF-A chain promoter which is a site for binding of nuclear protein (PDGF-A-BP-1) in human mesangial cells. PMA caused severalfold induction of PDGF-A-BP-1 as demonstrated by gel mobility shift analysis. Based on gel mobility shift analysis with specific and nonspecific competitors, it appears that PDGF-A-BP-1 is a new nuclear protein and thus has the potential to play an important role in the regulation of PDGF-A chain gene transcription in mesangial cells and other vascular pericytes.

https://openalex.org/W2076589464,"These studies in HL-60 cells examined the regulation of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity at the level of gene expression during terminal maturation. Following addition of 210 mM Me2SO to cultures of HL-60 cells at a concentration that induces maturation of 85-90% of the cells, FPGS activity, but not folylpolyglutamate hydrolase (FPGH) activity, was reduced 2-7-fold within 1-5 days. The initial decline in FPGS activity preceded any effect of Me2SO on rate of growth and the increase in appearance of nitro blue tetrazoliumpositive cells, a marker of cellular maturation, and the decrease after 5 days of exposure to Me2SO was solely accounted for by a 7-fold decrease in value for Vmax. The same time and concentration dependence for Me2SO was shown for the decline in FPGS activity, increase in nitro blue tetrazolium-positive cells, and decline in the level of a 2.1-kilobase FPGS mRNA during exposure to this inducer. This decline in FPGS mRNA was reversible when Me2SO was removed from the culture medium but only until that time when an appreciable number of cells were committed to terminal maturation. Following growth of HL-60 cells with [3H]MTX, used as a model folate compound, a large reduction in its intracellular polyglutamate pools was shown during maturation which quantitatively reflected the decline in FPGS activity as well as folate transport inward (Sirotnak, F. M., Jacobson, D. M., and Yang, C-H.(1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11150-11156). Other data showed that folate status or obviation of the folate requirement during growth of these cells strongly influenced the rapidity of the onset of maturation following exposure to inducer. Overall, these results show that FPGS activity in HL-60 cells is a marker for proliferative capacity and that the underlying basis for the decline in FPGS activity during maturation is altered cognate gene expression which is manifested as early reversible and late irreversible phases. They also suggest that the coordinate reduction observed in folate transport, FPGS activity, dihydrofolate reductase, and probably other folate related enzymes by limiting macromolecular biosynthesis may be early programmed events in the maturation process that influence the switch from proliferation to senescence in these cells. These studies in HL-60 cells examined the regulation of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity at the level of gene expression during terminal maturation. Following addition of 210 mM Me2SO to cultures of HL-60 cells at a concentration that induces maturation of 85-90% of the cells, FPGS activity, but not folylpolyglutamate hydrolase (FPGH) activity, was reduced 2-7-fold within 1-5 days. The initial decline in FPGS activity preceded any effect of Me2SO on rate of growth and the increase in appearance of nitro blue tetrazoliumpositive cells, a marker of cellular maturation, and the decrease after 5 days of exposure to Me2SO was solely accounted for by a 7-fold decrease in value for Vmax. The same time and concentration dependence for Me2SO was shown for the decline in FPGS activity, increase in nitro blue tetrazolium-positive cells, and decline in the level of a 2.1-kilobase FPGS mRNA during exposure to this inducer.

INTRODUCTIONThe process of folylpolyglutamylation in mammalian cells is important to the conservation and efficient utility of folate coenzymes required for macromolecular biosynthesis(1McBurney M.W.

Intracellular levels and preferences among folate analogues as substrate for FPGS and, probably, levels of FPGH appear to partially determine (12Samuels L.L. Goutas L.J. Priest D.G. Piper J.R.

In addition to the metabolic conversion of folate compounds, this could occur at the level of mediated entry of exogenous folates (reviewed in (17Kisliuk R.L. Sirotnak F.M. Burchall J.J.

As one approach to understanding the manner by which the expression of these processes are regulated in tumor cells, we and others have examined (19Sirotnak F.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3992-4000PubMed Google Scholar, 21Corin R.E. Haspel H.C. Sonenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 206-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sirotnak F.M.

These studies showed (19Sirotnak F.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3992-4000PubMed Google Scholar, 21Corin R.E. Haspel H.C. Sonenberg M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6628-6634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the level of inward transport of folates mediated by this system and synthesis of the transporter rapidly declined during maturation of these cells. The present work utilized a similar approach to studies of FPGS in the context of this same system. Our data expand upon findings presented in an earlier report (24Barredo J. Moran R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 687-692PubMed Google Scholar) which showed a delayed onset in reduction of FPGS activity during growth of HL-60 cells in the presence of inducers of maturation. In contrast, our results appear to show that FPGS activity in HL-60 cells is rapidly down-regulated during Me2SO-induced maturation. In these studies, we examined this effect and its time and concentration dependence during maturation at the level of FPGS activity, the intracellular accumulation and retention of model 4-amino-folylpolyglutamates and cognate gene expression. We also show that the effects on FPGS mRNA levels after removal of inducer are reversible until commitment of HL-60 cells to a program of terminal maturation verifying that they are bona fide maturational events. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that folate homeostasis in general and programmed down-regulation of dihydrofolate reductase, folate transport inward, and polyglutamylation, in particular, may be involved in initiating the switch from proliferative capacity to maturation in these cells. A preliminary report of these studies has been presented in abstract form (25Egan M.G. Sirlin S. Rumberger B.G. Shane B. Sirotnak F.M. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1993; 34: 275Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture ConditionsThe origin and properties of HL-60 cells have been described in detail elsewhere(26Gallagher R. Collins S.

The particular subline utilized here was obtained as a gift from Dr. Janice Gabrilove of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY. For experiments in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum with and without dialysis (plus folate compound), cells in early log phase of growth were employed as inoculum (initial concentration was 50-60 × 103 cells/ml). A dye exclusion assay (27Chello P.L. Sirotnak F.M. Wong E. Kisliuk R.L. Gaumont Y. Combepine G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was employed for estimating viability during these studies. Terminal maturation of HL-60 cells was quantitated morphologically and by determining the fraction of cells which acquired the ability to reduce NBT, a measure of phagocytic activity (21Corin R.E.

The integrity of the RNA was assessed by electrophoresis in 1.1% agarose containing 1 M glyoxal and staining with ethidium bromide. An aliquot of the same RNA was analyzed (31Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5847) Google Scholar) by Northern blotting and radioautography using a human FPGS cDNA, PZT 18U936-10(32Garrow T.A. Adman A. Shane B.

Ponte P. Okayama H. Engle J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Labeling of each probe was by random priming (Random Primers DNA Labeling Kit, Boehringer Manneheim) using [γ-32P]dCTP (300 Ci/mmol and 10 μg of insert). Direct measurement of total radioactivity in each blot minus background was obtained with a Betagen 603 Blot Analyzer.Materials and Other Analytical MethodsAminopterin was provided by Dr. J. R.

[3H]Methotrexate (specific activity = 22 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (City of Industry, CA). lL5-CHO-folateH4 was purchased from Schirks Laboratory, Jonas, Switzerland. These compounds were purified to >97% by high pressure liquid chromatography(8Samuels L.L. Moccio D.M. Sirotnak F.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1488-1495PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of [3H]MTX polyglutamates was also by high performance liquid chromatography (8Samuels L.L. Moccio D.M. Sirotnak F.M.

Cancer Res. 1987; 46: 2230-2235Google Scholar).RESULTSFPGS and FPGH Activities in HL-60 Cells in the Presence and Absence of Me2SOAppreciable FPGS activity was found in cell-free extract from HL-60 cells. The level of this activity was only slightly (25-30%) lower (Fig. 1) than that found in similar extracts derived from L1210 and S180 murine tumor cells with 100 μM AMT as substrate. In all cases, the major polyglutamate formed was AMT + G1 (data not shown). Additionally, product formation showed (data not given) the same requirements for the concentration of substrate, ATP, MET, MgCl2, and KCl in each case.Initially, HL-60 cells were exposed to 210 mM Me2SO during very early logarithmic phase of growth in RPMI medium for a period of 2 or 4 days. This concentration was shown earlier (22Sirotnak F.M. Jacobson D.M. Yang C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11150-11155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be effective in inducing maturation of these cells in culture with no growth inhibitory effect. Also a decrease in viability of only 3-6% was observed only after 5 days of exposure to this agent compared to 2-4% for control cells. From data shown in Fig. 1, it can be seen that these different exposures (2 and 4 days) to Me2SO reduced FPGS activity compared to control approximately 3- and 6-fold, respectively. The addition of 210 mM Me2SO to HL-60 cells in culture just prior to harvesting of the cells had no effect (data not shown) on the level of FPGS activity measured in the cell free extract. Additionally, growth of L1210 or S180 cells in the presence of 210 mM Me2SO for as long as 1 week had no effect on FPGS activity. In contrast to the results for FPGS activity, FPGH activity was unaltered following the addition of 210 mM Me2SO to cultures of HL-60 cells (data not shown).In other experiments, we measured the level of FPGS activity in cell-free extract and the relative number of NBT+ cells among HL-60 cells exposed to 210 mM Me2SO for various periods of time over 1-5 days. A substantial effect (approximately 2-fold reduction compared to control level) on FPGS activity was observed (Fig. 2A) within 1 day of exposure to inducer, continued to decrease upon further exposure and after 5 days of exposure was reduced 7-fold. The data also show (Fig. 2A) that the percent of NBT+ cells did not begin to increase until after 1 day of exposure to inducer. A rapid increase in NBT+ cells began only after 2-3 days of exposure to Me2SO at a time when FPGS activity was already reduced 3-4-fold compared to control and after 5 days of exposure the fraction of NBT+ cells reached 87%. In Fig. 2B, it can be seen that the increase in NBT+ cells and decrease in FPGS activity during exposure to Me2SO was unrelated to effects on growth of HL-60 cells in culture. No appreciable effect on growth was observed until after 2 days of exposure to Me2SO at a time when the number of NBT+ cells began to markedly increase and FPGS activity was already reduced 3-fold compared to control.Figure 2:Time course for decrease of FPGS activity and increase in NBT+ cells during exposure of HL-60 cells to Me2SO in culture. Cells were incubated with 210 mM Me2SO in RPMI medium plus 10% fetal calf serum.

The data show that a single saturable component and the same value for apparent Km was obtained in cell-free extract derived from HL-60 cells before and after exposure to Me2SO. However, the value for Vmax for FPGS activity was 7-fold lower than that derived with extract from control cells. The same time course for the appearance of NBT+ cells was obtained ((22Sirotnak F.M. Jacobson D.M. Yang C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11150-11155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when HL-60 cells were cultured for 5 days with 1 μM retinoic acid. In other experiments, we showed (Table 2) a similar concentration-response for the induction of NBT+ cells and the reduction in FPGS activity following exposure of HL-60 cells to Me2SO. Effects on either property were seen at a Me2SO concentration as low as 50 mM. Further elevation in concentration increased the content of NBT+ cells in the culture and decreased the level of FPGS activity measured in cell-free extract in approximately the same manner.Table I Open table in a new tab Table II Open table in a new tab Induced Maturation and Intracellular Polyglutamates of [3H]MTX as a Model Folate CompoundMTX shares a transport route and is polyglutamylated in tumor cells in a manner similar(2McGuire J.A. Bertino J.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 38: 19-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) - (5Moran R.G. Colman P.D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4580-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Sirotnak F.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3992-4000PubMed Google Scholar) to natural folate compounds. For this reason, we utilized this folate analogue as a model permeant and substrate for FPGS to estimate the probable impact of down-regulated transport and FPGS on intracellular pools of natural folate compounds during maturation of HL-60 cells. First, we pulse-exposed HL-60 cells for 3 h at 37°C with [3H]MTX before and after 3 days of growth in RPMI medium with 210 mM Me2SO. From the data, it can be seen (Table 3) that compared to control cells net intracellular accumulation of [3H]MTX in cells grown with 210 mM Me2SO was reduced 7-fold and total [3H]MTX polyglutamates approximately 25-fold. In addition, the proportion of higher polyglutamates (>+GI) among the total was substantially lower than in control cells. Second, HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI medium in the presence of trace amounts of [3H]MTX along with hypoxanthine and thymidine to avoid any effects of the drug on growth. Me2SO (210 mM) was added 24 h after initiation of growth and cells harvested 3 days later. In this case, higher levels of total [3H]MTX polyglutamates were accumulated compared to Experiment 1. However, the results again show (Table 3) that net accumulation in Me2SO-treated cells of total [3H]MTX polyglutamates, and the higher polyglutamylated forms were very substantially reduced compared to control cells. Both results appear to be entirely consistent with the extent of down-regulation of transport and polyglutamylation of these folate compounds also seen.Table III Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis of FPGS mRNA in HL-60 Cells during Induced MaturationRelative FPGS mRNA levels in HL-60 cells before and after exposure to 210 mM Me2SO in culture for 1-5 days were analyzed (Fig. 3) in a Northern blot of poly(A)+ RNA using as a probe a 2.1-kb cDNA insert (32Garrow T.A. Adman A. Shane B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in PTZ18U (PTZ18U936-10). It can be seen that the intensity of the FPGS mRNA blot (2.1 kb) relative to the control γ-actin mRNA blot decreased similarly to the decrease in FPGS activity (Fig. 2) with time of exposure of HL-60 cells to Me2SO. Levels were significantly reduced within 2 days, further reduced after 3 days, and by 5 days of exposure were markedly reduced compared to control. We showed (Fig. 4) that the effect on FPGS mRNA level like FPGS activity was also dependent on the concentration of Me2SO. The reduction in FPGS mRNA blotted from HL-60 cells exposed to 100 mM Me2SO for 5 days compared to control was substantially less than that seen with 2 or 5 days exposure to 210 mM. Total radioactivity associated with four separate FPGS mRNA blots was also quantitated (Fig. 5) with a Betagen blot analyzer. Radioactivity associated with each FPGS mRNA blot (average of four separate blots) that were normalized against separate γ-actin blots run in parallel, decreased appreciably after 1 day of exposure to 210 mM Me2SO, and showed the same relationship with time of exposure to Me2SO and fraction of NBT+ cells as that shown for FPGS activity.Figure 3:Northern blot analysis of FPGS mRNA in HL-60 cells before and after growth in the presence of Me2SO for various intervals.

https://openalex.org/W2059226123,"Previous studies have shown that formation of intermolecular DNA triplexes at sequences that overlap protein binding sites inhibits DNA binding by these proteins. We show that DNA cleavage by eukaryotic topoisomerase II is blocked by triplex formation at sites overlapping and adjacent to the triple binding site. To map precisely the boundaries of triplex interference, we constructed a vector containing enzyme binding sites of different lengths and flanked both 5′ and 3′ by DNA triplexes. We call this method Triplex Interference Mapping by Binding Element Replacement (TIMBER). Triplex regions within 3 bases 5′ or 7 bases 3′ of cleavage sites blocked DNA cleavage; triplex formation outside of this region had no effect upon cleavage activity. We conclude that topoisomerase II binding requires unhindered access to the major groove of a duplex DNA binding site in this 10-base region. In addition, the inclusion of topoisomerase II inhibitors yielded the same results for the triplex interference assays despite alterations in DNA cleavage site selection. The statistical analyses of over 500 topoisomerase II cleavage sites (in the presence or absence of inhibitors) suggest a model consistent with the region spanning −3 to +7 (relative to the cleavage site) containing most of the base-specific contacts for topoisomerase II. This triplex interference assay may prove valuable in the characterization of DNA binding sites for other proteins as well, particularly in conjunction with deletion analysis.

INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic topoisomerase II is a nuclear enzyme that modulates the topological states of DNA via transient double strand breaks in DNA coupled with strand passage(1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The enzyme is essential for the segregation of daughter chromosomes in mitosis(2DiNardo S. Voelkel K. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 3Uemura T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1737-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 4Holm C.

Cell. 1985; 41: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar); it is also the intracellular target for a number of classes of clinically valuable anticancer agents(5Chen G.L.

Most of these agents, including doxorubicin, amsacrine, ellipticine, epipodophyllotoxins, and quinolones, act through the trapping of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex, subsequently inducing chromosome breaks(7D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gootz T.D. Osheroff N. Hooper D.C. Wolfson J.S. Quinolone Antimicrobial Agents.

Recently, another class of antitumor compounds was shown to stabilize a topoisomerase II•ATP•DNA complex in a conformation incompatible with DNA cleavage (11Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).Topoisomerase II is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, but it makes double strand breaks in DNA sites that are not palindromic and are diverse in sequence content; characterizations of cleavage sites in the absence of inhibitors have revealed quite degenerate consensus sequences(12Sander M. Hsieh T.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1057-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. J. Mol. Recognit. 1989; 2: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Capranico G. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6611-6619Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The presence of inhibitors alters the base preferences around the cleavage site, leading to the derivations of different druginduced consensus sequences (for example, see (14Capranico G. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6611-6619Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These consensus studies have yielded results that are inconsistent in terms of defining the size of the sequence-specific DNA recognition element for topoisomerase II. To approach this problem in a different way, we devised a mapping strategy based on our observation that the formation of a DNA triple helix, in which a homopyrimidine oligonucleotide bound to a homopurine/homopyrimidine target duplex, prevented topoisomerase II cleavage at sites present on the DNA duplex alone(17Chung I.K. Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 105-114Google Scholar). We call this method Triplex Interference Mapping by Binding Element Replacement (TIMBER). ( 1The abbreviations used are: TIMBERtriplex interference mapping by binding element replacementbpbase pair(s)m-AMSA4′-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide. )Intermolecular DNA triplexes are formed under defined conditions when an appropriate single strand oligonucleotide anneals to duplex DNA; these unusual DNA structures offer new prospects for evaluating and modulating the interaction between proteins and DNA(18Maher L.J. Wold B. Dervan P.B. Science. 1989; 245: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 19Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 157-161Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this DNA structure, pyrimidine oligonucleotides bind through the major groove parallel to the Watson-Crick purine strand by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. Thymine (T) in the third strand recognizes adenine-thymine (AT) base pairs (T•AT triplet) and protonated cytosine (CH+) recognizes guanine-cytosine (GC) base pairs (CH+GC triplet)(20Le Doan T. Perrouault L. Praseuth D. Habhoub J. Decout J. Thuong N.T. Lhomme J. Helene C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7749-7760Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 21Moser H.E. Dervan P.B.

Due to the requirement for protonation of cytosine, triplexes involving C-rich sequences are more stable under acidic conditions (pH 5-6)(26Povsic T.J. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9428-9430Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Lyamichev V.I. Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Cantor C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The pH stability of intermolecular triplex formation thus depends on the sequence composition of oligonucleotides employed; however, intermolecular triplexes have been shown to exist at neutral pH(21Moser H.E. Dervan P.B. Science. 1987; 238: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 24Strobel S.A. Moser H.E. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem.

Dervan P.B. Science. 1990; 249: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Previous findings have additionally revealed that pyrimidine oligonucleotides can inhibit restriction endonuclease and methylase activities at sites located in or near pur•pyr tracts(18Maher L.J. Wold B. Dervan P.B. Science. 1989; 245: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 19Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 157-161Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, triplex-forming oligonucleotides blocked binding of the eukaryotic transcription factor Sp1 to its consensus sequence(18Maher L.J. Wold B. Dervan P.B. Science. 1989; 245: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These results clearly show that DNA-binding proteins can be inhibited by oligonucleotide-directed triplex formation. An interesting and useful extension of this idea relates to recent reports using triplexes to limit the systemic specificity of restriction enzyme in high complexity genomes(30Strobel S.A. Dervan P.B. Nature. 1991; 350: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).In this report, we show that intramolecular DNA triplexes inhibit topoisomerase II induced breakage of DNA at positions flanking the triplex regions. We evaluated the ability of the DNA triplexes to interfere with topoisomerase II cleavage of DNA sites located over a range of distances away from the two triplex blocks. We found that triplex regions within 3 bases 5′ or 7 bases 3′ of a cleavage site on either DNA strand define a minimum 10-bp core-binding element required for topoisomerase II activity. This novel application of DNA triplexes should prove useful for defining duplex DNA binding minima for other proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzyme and MaterialsTopoisomerase II was purified from whole chicken blood according to procedures previously described(15Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5533-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 31Muller M.T. Spitzner J.R. DiDonato J.A. Mehta V.B. Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8369-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and T4 nucleotide kinase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and U. S. Biochemical Corp., respectively. α- and γ-[32P]ATP were from ICN. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystem DNA synthesizer (at the Ohio State University Biochemical Instrumentation Center). The topoisomerase II inhibitors 4′-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA)and VM-26 (teniposide) were provided by the National Cancer Institute divisions of synthetic and natural products, respectively. DNA manipulation, fragment end labeling, and DNA sequencing were performed as described elsewhere(32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Plasmid ConstructionsThe triplex plasmid pTX-0 was constructed as follows: pUC19 DNA was digested with HincII, and 14-bp homopurine-homopyrimidine fragments were inserted (see Fig. 1) such that a new SmaI site was generated in the middle of the 14-base elements (the original SmaI site of pUC19 was removed by previous manipulation). Constructs pTX-GT17, pTX-AC12, and pTX-N10 were prepared by inserting appropriate fragments into SmaI site of pTX-0.Band Shift AnalysisFormation of triplex structures was assayed using a modification of the band shift technique described previously(28Lyamichev V.I. Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Cantor C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). End-labeled oligonucleotides (10 nM, 10,000 cpm) were mixed with 10 nM supercoiled or linearized DNA (20 μl, total volume) in triplex buffer (25 mM Tris acetate, pH 5.5, 70 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mM spermidine, 3 mM ATP, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25°C, and, after addition of 2 μl of tracking dye (0.25% bromphenol blue, 40% sucrose), they were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel (running buffer, 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 5.5, 100 mM sodium acetate with circulation). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide, destained, photographed, dried, and exposed to film at −70°C.DNase I Footprintng and Topoisomerase II Cleavage ReactionsReactions (20 μl) were carried out in triplex buffer (see above) and contained 5′ end-labeled fragment (2 nM, 20,000 cpm) and the specified oligonucleotide at 3 μM. Reactions were preincubated 30 min at 25°C before the addition of enzymes. For DNase I footprinting experiments, digestions were initiated by the addition of 1 μl of 40 mM CaCl2 and 1 μl of 50 μg of DNaseI/ml. Reactions were incubated 1 min at 25°C and terminated by the addition of 2 μl of 0.5 M EDTA. Topoisomerase II cleavage reactions were initiated by the addition of 8 units (5.6 nM) of purified chicken topoisomerase II in the presence or absence of drugs (m-AMSA at 50 μg/ml and VM26 at 500 μg/ml) as indicated, incubated 30 min at 30°C, and then terminated by the addition of SDS to 1% followed by proteinase K digestion (50 μg/ml, 56°C for 30 min). Samples were ethanol-precipitated and analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel.Statistical Analysis of Topoisomerase II Cleavage Site Data SetsPrevious analyses of topoisomerase II cleavage sites suggested that despite the double-stranded nature of these events, the sequence information common to all cleavage sites is conserved primarily on only one of the two strands(15Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5533-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The determination of cleavage site locations from sequencing gels does not reveal which of the two strands contains the information to specify the cleavage. To select the conserved strand from each cleavage pair, we used a computer algorithm that maximizes the information content of the data set (i.e. to yield the most nonrandom base proportions). Sites were taken in random order and tested to see which strand contributed to a greater information content from the set (33Stormo G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 34DiDonato J.D. Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 451-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using Equation 1. % Information content =(1−Hpow/Hmax)×100%(Eq. 1) where H is the entropy (in bits), calculated as follows: H=∑i=14[−p(xi)log2⁡p(xi)]in which p is the probability of base occurrence at position x taken from the base proportions of the already aligned sites, plus one strand of the current site. For example, as the 10th selected site is analyzed, the base proportions of the previously aligned nine sites are used, with one orientation of the 10th site added in; this information content is compared with that with the opposite strand sequence added in. After a strand has been selected for the last site of a data set, the process is repeated selecting the sites in a different random order. After 10-20 such repetitions, the alignment that yielded the greatest total information content is used, and the base proportions of this set are determined. This method was used for the analyses in Fig. 8, A-C, termed the consensus single strand method; the information content, in bits, at each position was then determined as in Stormo(33Stormo G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 35Stormo G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In Fig. 8, D and E, both the sequenced strand cleavage site and the complementary strand site (located 4 bases 5′) were pooled for all sites, with no strand selection; the information content at each position was calculated directly from the frequencies of all pooled sites. All computations were performed using the EDEN Genesys computer software system (TEAM Associates, Westerville, OH).Figure 8Information content analyses of topoisomerase II cleavage site data sets. The information content (in bits), is plotted against the sequence position relative to the cleavage site for sets of topoisomerase II sites analyzed by consensus single strands (A-C) or pooled double strands (D and E), as described in the text. The origins of the data are indicated. The bracket marks the 10-base region from −3 to +7, which was found by triplex interference to be the essential duplex binding region; the identities of the bases at the most highly conserved positions are indicated in the boxed region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSThe Vector pTX-0 Forms DNA Triplexes at Two Adjacent SequencesWe previously observed that DNA triplex formation over a duplex DNA sequence containing topoisomerase II cleavage sites inhibited enzymatic cleavage at those sites; furthermore, this triplex interference was propagated over proximal cleavage sites flanking the triplex region(17Chung I.K. Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 105-114Google Scholar). Having shown that DNA triplex formation blocks topoisomerase II activity at sites both within and external to a triplex region(17Chung I.K. Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 105-114Google Scholar), the next experiments were designed to map, at base pair resolution, the exact 5′ and 3′ boundaries at which triplex formation interfered with topoisomerase II cleavage of DNA. Our previous experiments (17Chung I.K. Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 105-114Google Scholar) were conducted in a neutral pH buffer (6.8). The following experiments were conducted at pH 5.5 (as described under “Materials and Methods”) since triplexes with cytosine containing oligos are stabilized at lower pH(28Lyamichev V.I. Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Cantor C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); moreover, topoisomerase II displays very good DNA cleavage activity at this pH (36Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). ( 2J. R. Spitzner, I. K. Chung, and M. T. Muller, unpublished observations. )In terms of DNA relaxation activity, topoisomerase II has high catalytic activity pH 5.5 (90% of the activity seen at pH 6.8, data not shown). The plasmid pTX-0, shown in Fig. 1, contains two 14-base pair polypurine-polypyrimidine sequences (identical and in opposite orientation) with a central SmaI to allow insertion of additional DNA sequences between these two triplex-forming sites.Incubation of an end-labeled pyrimidine oligo probe (14-mer) with plasmid pTX-0 (see Fig. 1), resulted in a clear band-shift of the probe to a position coincident with the plasmid (Fig. 2A). As reported previously, these results can be explained by formation of intermolecular DNA triplexes(28Lyamichev V.I. Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Cantor C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Triplexes formed with closed circular supercoiled (sc) and linear (lin) pTX-0 DNA (Fig. 2A, lanes5 and 6; compare with the same gel stained with ethidium bromide and shown in Fig. 2B). Negative controls show that pUC19 DNA did not band shift the pyrimidine oligo (Fig. 2A, lanes1-4) and purine oligos did not bind pTX-0 (Fig. 2A, lanes7 and 8); thus, the pyrimidine oligo forms complexes specifically with pTX-0. The reactions and gel electrophoresis in Fig. 2 were carried out with approximately the same molar concentrations of oligo and plasmid (10 nM) in the pH 5.5 buffer.Figure 2Band shift experiment of pUC19 and pTX-0 with pyrimidine oligonucleotide. End-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with either pUC19 and pTX-0 under conditions optimal for triplex formation as described under “Materials and Methods.” Samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel and following electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed (B), dried, and exposed to X-ray film (A). The odd numbered lanes contained supercoiled (sc) DNA, and even lanes contained EcoRI-digested linear (lin) DNA; open circular DNA (oc) is marked in panelB. Pyrimidine oligonucleotides were added in lanes1, 2, 5, and 6. Purine oligonucleotides were added in lanes3, 4, 7, and 8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As triplexes block DNase I access at the homopurine-homopyrimidine sequences(17Chung I.K.

Science. 1988; 241: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), DNase I footprinting was performed to localize sites of pyrimidine oligo binding in pTX-0 (Fig. 3). The 14-mer pyrimidine oligo specifically protected the homopurine-homopyrimidine sequences (Fig. 3, lane6); however, footprints were not observed when a 14-mer purine oligo was used (Fig. 3, lane7), and the pUC 19 DNA fragments were not protected by any of the oligonucleotides tested (Fig. 3, lanes1-3). These results, combined with the gel shift data in Fig. 2A, show that pyrimidine oligonucleotides formed stable intermolecular triplexes with pTX-0 at the sequences of both target sites under our conditions. In Fig. 3, a DNase I hypersensitive site can be seen at the 3′ boundary of the triplex region; a similar effect was observed at the 5′ triplex boundary in Chung et al.(17Chung I.K. Spitzner J.R.

DNase I digestions were performed as described under “Materials and Methods” on an RsaI-PvuII fragment (labeled at the RsaI site). Lanes1-4 contained the pUC19 fragment as a control, and lanes5-8 contained the corresponding pTX-0 fragment, which differs in that it has two 14-base pair homopurine-homopyrimidine regions (bracketed). Purine and pyrimidine oligonucleotides were included as indicated above the gel lanes. Lanes4 and 8 show chemical sequencing markers. The filledbar marks the DNaseI protected region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Topoisomerase II Cleavage of pTX-0 Sequences by DNA TriplexesFor several reasons, topoisomerase II is particularly amenable to site mapping by triplex interference. The enzyme cleaves DNA at specific sites, making it possible to determine directly the binding site locations without resorting to band shifts or footprinting. In addition, while sequence-specific in its binding, topoisomerase II sites are found rather frequently (on average, one site every 25.9 bases in random DNA sequences, (15Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5533-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, a large number of binding sites have been characterized, and high affinity sites have been defined(13Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. J. Mol. Recognit. 1989; 2: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5533-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 37Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Muller M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).The sequencing gel in Fig. 4 shows the results of topoisomerase II cleavage reactions (in the presence or absence of the inhibitors m-AMSA and VM-26) on either a pUC19 sequence (lanes1 and 2) or on the equivalent region of pTX-0 containing the two triplex target sites (lanes4-9). Incubation of the pUC19 fragment with the pyrimidine 14-mer used in Fig. 3 did not alter the specificity of topoisomerase II cleavage. In contrast, in the reactions on pTX-0, all topoisomerase II sites (for no drug, m-AMSA or VM-26) within and immediately flanking the triplex forming sequences were blocked by binding of the 14-mer (compare lanes5, 7, and 9 with 4, 6, and 8, respectively, in Fig. 4); external to this region, triplex formation did not alter the cleavage patterns. This experiment revealed that the inhibition of topoisomerase II cleavage by DNA triplexes is independent of the presence of drugs, and suggested that, in all cases, the enzyme requires contact with a contiguous region of nontriplex (presumably B-form) DNA spanning a minimum of 2 bases 5′ and 6 bases 3′ of a cleavage site. The experiments described below were conducted in order to further define this core duplex sequence required for topoisomerase II activity.Figure 4Inhibition of topoisomerase II cleavages intermolecular triplexes. Topoisomerase II cleavage reactions were performed on the pUC-19 or pTX-0 fragments described in the legend to Fig. 3 and in the presence (lanes2, 5, 7, and 9) or absence (lanes1, 4, 6, and 8) of pyrimidine oligonucleotides. Lanes containing the pUC19 or pTX-0 fragments are indicated as are the constituents of each reaction (inhibitor and oligo concentrations are specified under “Materials and Methods”).

We took advantage of our previous results showing that topoisomerase II cleaves DNA at every second base in sequences of alternating purine-pyrimidine (RY), and that these sites are conserved when topoisomerase inhibitors are included(37Spitzner J.R. Chung I.K. Muller M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The construct pTX-GT17 has a 17 bp (dGdT)-(dAdC) repeat cloned between the two triplex blocks in the SmaI site (see Fig. 1). DNase I footprinting revealed that both triplex regions were protected from digestion in the presence of the pyrimidine oligonucleotide (Fig. 5A, lane2); in addition, a novel hypersensitive site appeared at the 3′ triplex boundary. Topoisomerase II cleavage reactions were also carried out on pTX-GT17 with or without oligonucleotides (lanes7-12). Topoisomerase II cleavages at triplex and flanking regions were inhibited by the pyrimidine oligonucleotides (compare lane7 with 8, 9 with 10, and 11 with 12"
https://openalex.org/W1990562027,"The LEU4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the enzyme encoded by LEU4, α-isopropylmalate synthase, occupy a special position in amino acid metabolism. α-Isopropylmalate synthase catalyzes the first committed step in leucine biosynthesis. However, the reaction product α-isopropylmalate is not only an intermediate in the leucine biosynthetic pathway, but also functions as co-activator of at least six genes, both within and outside of the leucine pathway. The metabolic importance of α-isopropylmalate appears to be reflected in the surprisingly multifaceted regulation of LEU4 expression. This report describes an analysis of functional cis elements in the LEU4 promoter. Five such elements were identified. Three distal elements, designated UASLEU, GCE-A, and GCE-B, are responsible for regulation by the regulatory proteins Leu3p and Gcn4p, respectively. The incremental activation of LEU4 by these elements is additive and independent. In addition, two proximal elements were localized. One of these conforms to the TATA consensus sequence and exhibits high affinity for TATA binding protein. The other element shows strong sequence identity with the Bas2p binding site and appears to be involved in basal and phosphate-mediated regulation of LEU4."
