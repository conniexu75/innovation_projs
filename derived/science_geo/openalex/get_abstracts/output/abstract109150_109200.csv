https://openalex.org/W1594135844,"The molecular action of leptomycin B (LMB), an agent inducing arrest of the eukaryotic cell cycle at G1 and G2 phases, was investigated by analyzing an LMB resistance gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A genomic library of an LMB-resistant mutant was screened for LMB resistance, and a DNA fragment containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1078 amino acids was cloned on a multicopy vector. The plasmid was found to confer drug resistance specifically to LMB. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the ORF was a mutant gene for the essential nuclear protein crm1, which had been reported to complement a cold-sensitive mutation causing deformed nuclear morphology. The gene product named crm1-N1 had two amino acid replacements (Gly-503 to Asp and Met-546 to Ile). Two allelic mutants of crm1 (crm1-809 and crm1-119) were found to be hypersensitive and resistant, respectively, to LMB. Nuclear morphology of the cold-sensitive crm1-809 mutant at the restrictive temperature was almost the same as that of the wild-type cells treated with LMB. Furthermore, a low concentration of LMB induced the intracellular accumulation of a 25-kDa protein in the wild-type cells, which was immunologically identical to the protein accumulating in the crm1-809 mutant cells. These results strongly suggest that LMB primarily inhibits the function of the crm1 gene which is required for maintaining higher order chromosome structures, correct gene expression, and cell growth in the fission yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1486631729,"Raf is a mitogen-stimulated protein kinase that functions as a component of the signaling cascade that leads to the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Here we show that the native structure of Raf is a large multi-subunit protein complex with an apparent mass of 300-500 kDa that interacts with Ras and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase Mek. Analysis of the structure of the Raf complex demonstrates that it contains a single Raf protein kinase together with the molecular chaperones hsp90 and p50. The Raf-hsp90-p50 complex was observed in starved cells and in cells activated with serum or phorbol ester. Thus, changes in complex formation with hsp90 and p50 are not required for activation of the Raf protein kinase. However, Raf activation caused by Ras was associated with the translocation of the cytoplasmic Raf-hsp90-p50 complex to the cell membrane. Significantly, it is only the membrane-bound complex that exhibits increased protein kinase activity. Thus, the Ras-activated Raf protein kinase functions as a membrane-bound multi-subunit complex."
https://openalex.org/W1548713443,"The Escherichia coli hns gene encodes the abundant nucleoid-associated DNA-binding protein H-NS. Mutations in hns alter the expression of many genes with unrelated functions and result in a derepression of the proU operon (proVWX) without abolishing the osmotic control of its transcription. We have investigated the interactions of H-NS with the proU regulatory region by deletion analysis of cis-acting sequences, competitive gel retardation assays, and DNase I footprinting. The negative effect of H-NS on proU transcription was mediated by cis-acting sequences within proV but did not depend on the presence of a curved DNA segment upstream of the proU-35 region previously characterized as a target for H-NS binding in vitro. We detected a 46-base pair high affinity H-NS binding region downstream of the proU promoter at the 5' end of the proV gene and a complex array of additional H-NS binding sites which suggest the presence of an extended H-NS nucleoprotein complex. Most of the H-NS binding sites were highly A+T-rich and carried stretches of 5 or more consecutive A-T base pairs. The implications of our results for the osmotic regulation of proU transcription are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1560533935,"The properties of a deletion mutant delta V191-Q364 of gelatinase A, which represents the removal of the fibronectin-like type II repeats defined by exons 5-7, were compared with those of full-length gelatinase A. Both enzymes underwent self-activation over a similar time course in the presence of 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. The fully active enzymes had similar kcat/Km values for the cleavage of an octapeptide substrate, but the deletion mutant had 50% of the activity of wild type gelatinase A against beta-casein and 10% of the activity against gelatin. The cleavage pattern for gelatin was similar for both enzymes but differed for type IV collagen. Comparison of the rates of association of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 and their N-terminal domains to both forms of gelatinase indicated that the fibronectin-like domain plays little role in TIMP binding. The deletion mutant failed to bind to collagen, while the wild type gelatinase bound tightly, indicating that the fibronectin-like domain is the sole site of collagen binding. Both gelatinases could be activated by concanavalin A-activated fibroblasts, suggesting that the fibronectin-like domain is not required for the membrane-mediated activation process."
https://openalex.org/W119628112,"A novel member of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), named GRK5, has been cloned from bovine taste epithelium. The cDNA sequence predicts a 590-amino acid protein with high overall similarity to rhodopsin kinase. GRK5 mRNA is found most abundantly in lung, heart, retina, and lingual epithelium, but is expressed very little in brain, liver, kidney, or testis. GRK5 expressed in Sf9 cells was purified to apparent homogeneity. GRK5 major autophosphorylation sites were mapped to Ser484 and Thr485. Purified GRK5 phosphorylates rhodopsin in a light-dependent manner and beta 2-adrenergic receptor in an agonist-dependent manner and phosphorylates the C-terminal tail regions of both receptor proteins. GRK5 possesses neither a CAAX motif specifying protein prenylation like rhodopsin kinase nor similarity to the G protein beta gamma-subunit binding domain of beta-adrenergic receptor kinases. GRK5 phosphorylation of rhodopsin or beta 2-adrenergic receptor is not stimulated by G protein beta gamma-subunits. The GRK5 protein does not undergo agonist-dependent translocation from cytosol to membranes as do beta-adrenergic receptor kinase and rhodopsin kinase, but rather appears to associate with membranes constitutively. GRK5 thus appears functionally similar to other characterized GRKs, but has distinct regulatory properties which may be important for its cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W1581887538,"The respiratory burst oxidase is responsible for O2- production in stimulated neutrophils and B lymphocytes. Components of this oxidase include cytochrome b558, a membrane-bound flavohemoprotein; the cytosolic polypeptides p47phox and p67phox; and one or more small G proteins including Rac1, Rac2, and/or Rap1A. We found that when normal neutrophils were activated, small percentages of each of the cytosolic proteins p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 were transferred to the membrane cytoskeleton. However, Rac2 was not transferred to the membrane during activation of p47phox-deficient neutrophils. In normal cells, some p47phox also became associated with the non-cytoskeletal portion of the plasma membrane, but p67phox, Rac2, and O(2-)-forming activity were restricted to the cytoskeleton. Neutrophil activation also causes the phosphorylation of multiple serines in p47phox. The most heavily phosphorylated forms of p47phox were found solely in the membrane cytoskeleton. These results suggest that 1) the membrane cytoskeleton participates in respiratory burst oxidase activation, 2) the fully phosphorylated p47phox is located in the active oxidase, which resides in the membrane cytoskeleton, and 3) Rac2 acts like a dedicated component of the respiratory burst oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1522781444,"We have previously shown that bone organ cultures produce large amounts of latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), which lacks latent TGF beta-binding protein (LTBP). In this study we used the known osteoblast-like cell lines UMR-106, ROS 17/2.8, and MG63 as models to further examine latent TGF beta expression in bone. We found that the osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106 secreted latent TGF beta almost exclusively as a 100-kDa complex lacking LTBP. ROS 17/2.8 cells produced both the 100-kDa complex and also a 290-kDa complex containing the fibroblastic (190 kDa) form of LTBP. MG63 cells (like human foreskin fibroblasts) expressed almost exclusively the 290-kDa complex. To investigate the regulation of latent TGF beta complexes in bone cells we assessed the effects of TGF beta 1 treatment on expression of active and latent TGF beta. TGF beta 1 induced secretion of latent but not active TGF beta in all cell types examined. In human foreskin fibroblast cells, TGF beta 1 and LTBP mRNA were expressed concomitantly. In contrast, in osteosarcoma cell lines autoinduction of TGF beta 1 mRNA was associated with either a delayed increase or no change in LTBP mRNA. In UMR-106 cells LTBP message was virtually undetectable. We postulate that the expression of different latent TGF beta forms by osteoblast-like cells may reflect their maturation states and that different latent TGF beta complexes may have different functions, for example as secretory forms or as matrix storage forms."
https://openalex.org/W1497263990,"We established a novel method to isolate a single type of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) among the heterogeneous population of receptors to study the regulatory mechanism of Ca2+ release. We raised in the rabbit a polyclonal antibody against synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 2736-2747 (pep 6) of type I IP3R (IP3-R-I) that is most abundant in cerebellum. We purified IP3R-I from a 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid solubilized mouse cerebellar microsomal fraction by immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-pep 6 antibody-Sepharose 4B column with specific elution by the pep 6 peptide (GHPPHMNVNPQQ) of the IP3R-I C terminus. Immunoaffinity-purified IP3R reconstituted into lipid vesicles formed a homotetramer structure. Monoclonal antibody 18A10, which partially blocks the Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsome, almost completely inhibited IP3-induced 45Ca2+ influx into proteoliposomes, whereas monoclonal antibody that recognizes other regions did not inhibit Ca2+ influx. Both the rate and extent of 45Ca2+ influx into proteoliposomes increased 20% after incubation with the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, accompanied by stoichiometric phosphorylation of IP3R protein."
https://openalex.org/W1562801779,"The Rh blood group antigens are associated with nonglycosylated human erythrocyte membrane proteins of molecular mass 30 kDa (the Rh30 polypeptides) and a glycoprotein of 40-100 kDa (the Rh glycoprotein). We have studied the topology of this family of proteins in the erythrocyte membrane. We confirmed the predicted cytosolic localization of the C and N termini of the Rh protein family. We located Lys-196 and Arg-323 of the Rh glycoprotein to the cytosol, and Glu-34 to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane in erythrocytes, by N-terminal sequencing of Rh glycoprotein peptides produced by proteolysis at the cytoplasmic or extracellular side of the membrane. We also show that a glycan chain is present on only one (Asn-37) of the three potential N-glycan addition sites in the Rh glycoprotein. Studies of the Rh glycoprotein fragments that co-immunoprecipitated with the Rh30 polypeptides suggest there is an interaction between the Rh30 polypeptides and amino acids 35-196 of the Rh glycoprotein. A model for the organization of the components of the Rh complex in the red cell membrane is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1541553752,"Heterologous expression of the beta subunit of H+/K(+)-ATPase (HK beta) with alpha subunits of Na+/K(+)-ATPase (NK alpha) in yeast leads to the formation of ouabain binding complexes, indicating assembly of the two subunits into active ion pumps (Eakle, K. A., Kim, K. S., Kabalin, M. A., and Farley, R. A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 2834-2838). Complexes of NK alpha and HK beta are less sensitive to inhibition of ouabain binding by K+, suggesting that HK beta lowers the affinity of K+ binding sites. This effect is particularly pronounced when HK beta is combined with the alpha 3 isoform of NK alpha. In this case, titration with K+ yields a biphasic curve, suggesting that there are two nonequivalent sites for K+ binding. Attempts at purifying complexes formed with either alpha 1 + HK beta or alpha 3 + HK beta using SDS extraction of microsomal membranes resulted in the loss of ouabain binding. Controls show that alpha 1 + beta 1 and alpha 3 + beta 1 complexes still retain ouabain binding after SDS extraction under the same conditions. This suggests that the HK beta subunit forms a less stable complex with NK alpha subunits. We have created chimeric beta subunits comprised of the amino-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of HK beta combined with the carboxyl-terminal extracellular region of Na+/K(+)-ATPase beta 1 (HN beta 1) and the complementary chimera with amino-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of beta 1 combined with the carboxyl-terminal extracellular region of HK beta (NH beta 1). When NH beta 1 is combined with either alpha 1 or alpha 3, the complexes show profiles of K+ inhibition of ouabain binding that are very similar to HK beta combined with either alpha 1 or alpha 3. The data suggest that the extracellular region of HK beta is primarily responsible for the effect on apparent K+ affinity. When the HN beta 1 subunit is expressed with the alpha 3 subunit, less than 5% of the amount of ouabain binding complexes are formed compared with HN beta 1 + alpha 1. This observation suggests that the HN beta 1 subunit either assembles poorly or forms an unstable complex with alpha 3. After SDS extraction, complexes of alpha 1 + NH beta 1 and alpha 3 + NH beta 1 retain ouabain binding, while alpha 1 + HN beta 1 complexes are sensitive to SDS extraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1557403584,"Previous studies have shown that the transcription factor YY1 can both activate and repress transcription of many mammalian genes (reviewed by Hahn (Hahn, S. (1992) Curr. Biol. 2, 152-154)). Given the diverse effects of the YY1 protein, it seems likely that its function depends on interaction with other cellular factors. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate mouse cDNAs encoding proteins capable of directly binding to YY1. Sequence analysis of one clone revealed it had an open reading frame with the potential to code for a protein nearly identical to the previously published mouse nucleolar phosphoprotein B23. The YY1.B23 complex is specific, and occurs in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of the B23 protein can reverse the transcriptional repression exerted by YY1. These results suggest a role for a nucleolar protein as a component in transcription and provide a possible mechanism for transcriptional regulation by YY1."
https://openalex.org/W1512969508,"A previous study has demonstrated that deletion of a region within the last exon of bovine growth hormone (bGH) pre-mRNA results in almost complete retention of the upstream intron (Hampson, R. K., LaFollette, L., and Rottman, F. M. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 1604-1610). We now demonstrate that insertion of a simple purine-rich element (GGAAG), which is present within the deleted region, activates intron splicing upon expression in transfected cells. Moreover, several repeats of the GGAA(G) sequence restore splicing to near wild-type levels and direct the binding of a factor present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Mutation of the 5'-splice site toward U1 small nuclear RNA complementarity eliminates dependence on the downstream exon sequence for splicing. These results support a model for alternative intron retention in which purine-rich sequences function as part of an exonic splicing enhancer to complement a weak 5'-splice site and thereby facilitate intron removal. As a result, the majority of bGH mRNA is processed to remove intron D while still allowing a fraction of bGH mRNA containing the intact intron to reach the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1535875327,"Abstract Remodeling of the pulmonary vascular tree in pulmonary hypertension is associated with hypertrophy and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Since the stimuli and signaling pathways for these processes are not well understood, we used a rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell line (PAC1) to examine the effects of thrombin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on cellular growth and immediate-early gene expression. Over 72 h, thrombin (1 unit/ml) caused hypertrophy as reflected by a 102 +/- 12% increase in protein synthesis and a 49 +/- 11% increase in protein content per cell, but no change in cell number. PDGF (2.5 ng/ml) stimulated proliferation as evidenced by an increase in cell number (doubling in 5 days), but no significant change in protein content per cell. Immediate-early gene expression was examined by Northern blotting: both thrombin and PDGF induced egr-1, c-fos, c-jun, junB, and fra-1 mRNAs within 15 min; the response was maximal at 30-60 min (increases ranging from 2.9- to 9.3-fold over control serum-deprived cells) and returned to base-line levels within 2-4 h. Neither agent affected junD mRNA levels. However, thrombin but not PDGF, caused an increase in fosB mRNA levels (7.7 +/- 4.0-fold higher than control, n = 12, p < 0.0005). The immediate-early gene response to both agonists was generally dependent on extracellular Ca2+, Na2+/H+ exchange, and protein kinase C activation, but not on cAMP. The exception was c-jun mRNA, the levels of which were not affected by inhibition of protein kinase C, but decreased significantly by prevention of cAMP formation. Thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores were necessary for the response to thrombin, but not to PDGF. These results demonstrate that thrombin is a hypertrophic agent and that PDGF is a proliferative agent in PAC1 cells. These two agonists stimulate increases in a variety of immediate-early gene mRNAs, but only thrombin induces fosB mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1556380106,"Farnesyl acetate and ethyl farnesyl ether, two analogues of farnesyl pyrophosphate, stimulate post-transcriptional down-regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids. Farnesyl acetate and ethyl farnesyl ether reduce translation of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA and enhance degradation of the enzyme, the same regulatory effects attributed to the putative non-sterol regulatory metabolite (Goldstein, J.L., and Brown, M.S. (1990) Nature 343, 425-430). HMGal, a fusion protein consisting of the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase linked to Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, is subject to the same regulated degradation as HMG-CoA reductase (Skalnik, D. G., Narita, H., Kent, C., and Simoni, R. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6836-6841). At 10 micrograms/ml (37.8 microM), farnesyl acetate and ethyl farnesyl ether trigger a 50-80% reduction in HMGal activity. Farnesyl acetate reduces the synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase and HM-Gal by 60-80%, but neither farnesyl compound affects HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels. Farnesyl acetate and ethyl farnesyl ether stimulated the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal, reducing the half-lives of the enzymes by 40-70%. In addition to their regulatory effects on HMG-CoA reductase, these farnesyl compounds also directly disrupt sterol synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1481714339,"Regulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chains not associated with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) on freshly isolated and in vitro cultured human B and T leukemia cells was analyzed. These beta 2m-free class I heavy chains originate from surface beta 2m-associated MHC class I molecules and are expressed as integral membrane glycoproteins on activated, but not resting, cells. We found that the levels of beta 2m-free class I heavy chains can be regulated by proteolytic cleavage and release into the medium of soluble molecules containing the extracellular domains. The release is mediated by a Zn(2+)-dependent, membrane-bound metalloprotease that does not cleave HLA-DR, CD4, and CD71 surface receptors and can be activated by phorbol myristate acetate. Specific cleavage by the metalloprotease occurs at a site close to the papain cleavage site in the alpha 3 domain of class I heavy chains. This site is not accessible to the metalloprotease in beta 2m-associated MHC class I molecules. The dissociation of beta 2m-associated MHC class I molecules and subsequent cleavage of beta 2m-free class I heavy chains may be partially responsible for controlling the levels of MHC class I molecules on the surface of activated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1508854949,"The thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) receptor (T3R) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. T3Rs are known to bind as homodimers and heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to two hexameric half-sites in directly repeated, palindromic, and inverted palindromic orientations. The binding of T3R monomers to individual half-sites was often reported, but no clear ligand-induced transactivational activity has been shown. Here, we analyzed interactions of T3R monomers with individual half-sites of the sequence NNAGGTCA. We found that the two nucleotides 5' of the AGGTCA core half-site strongly influence T3R binding and transcriptional activity: octameric half-sites of the consensus sequence (T/C)(A/G)AGGTCA were bound by T3Rs with the highest affinity. This suggests T3R functioning also as a monomeric transcription factor like the orphan nuclear receptors NGFI-B and FTZ-F1. Moreover, we observed that the function of T3R-RXR heterodimers on response elements composed of two half-sites in a directly repeated orientation spaced by 4 nucleotides is determined in major parts by the 5'-flanking sequence of the upstream half-site. Consequently, we noted that the affinity of T3R homodimers is influenced by both 5'-flanking sequences. Our findings suggest that the binding of dimerizing receptors like T3R and other nuclear receptors to their cognate response elements is determined not only by the half-site core sequence, orientation, and number of spacing nucleotides, but also by the nucleotide sequence preceding the half-sites."
https://openalex.org/W1543935121,"Four disulfide bonds were engineered into the pore-forming domain of colicin A to probe the conformational changes associated with its membrane insertion and channel formation. The soluble pore-forming domain consists of 10 alpha-helices with two outer layers (helices 1, 2, and 3-7, respectively) sandwiching a middle layer of three helices (8-10). Helices 8 and 9 form a hairpin which is completely buried and consists of hydrophobic and neutral residues only. This helical hairpin has been hypothesized to be the membrane anchor. Each double-cysteine mutant possessing an individual disulfide bond, cross-linking either helices 1 to 9 (H1/H9), 5 to 6 (H5/H6), 7 to 8 (H7/H8), or 9 to 10 (H9/H10), respectively, is unable to promote K+ efflux from sensitive Escherichia coli cells. Activity can be restored by addition of a reducing agent. In vitro studies with brominated lipid vesicles and planar lipid bilayers show that the disulfide bond which connects the helices 1 to 9 prevents colicin A membrane insertion, whereas the other disulfide bond mutants insert readily into lipid vesicles. All of the engineered bridges prevented the formation of a conducting channel in the presence of a membrane potential. This novel approach indicates that membrane insertion and channel formation are two separate steps. Moreover, the effects of the distance constraints introduced by the different disulfide bonds on colicin A activity indicate that the helical pair 1 and 2 moves away from the other helices upon membrane insertion. Helices 3-10 remain associated together. As a consequence, the results imply that the helical hairpin lies parallel to the membrane surface. In contrast, induction of the colicin channel by the membrane potential requires a profound reorganization of the helices association. These results are discussed in light of several proposed models of the membrane-bound colicin and channel structures."
https://openalex.org/W1546970082,"Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme which can be acylated by myristoyl-CoA analogs (Deichaite, I., Berthiaume, L., Peseckis, S. M., Patton, W. F., and Resh, M. D. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13788-13747). Here we describe the mechanisms which mediate regulation of the enzymatic activity of bovine MMSDH by long chain fatty acylation. The substrate specificity of the acylation reaction was measured in vitro using purified MMSDH and the coenzyme A derivative of an 125I-labeled long chain fatty acid (13-iodotridecanoate), an analog of myristoyl-CoA. Long chain fatty acyl CoAs (> 8 carbons) were able to inhibit radiolabeling of MMSDH. In order to study the physiological role of the acylation process in vivo, a system using highly purified mitochondria from COS-1 cells overexpressing MMSDH was exploited. MMSDH was shown to be processed properly, targeted to the mitochondrial fraction, and enzymatically active. The extent of fatty acylation of MMSDH as well as of other mitochondrial proteins was correlated with the mitochondrial energy level. Biochemical evidence as well as site-specific mutagenesis of cysteine 319 revealed that this highly conserved active site cysteine of MMSDH was the target of the fatty acylation. Another member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family, yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase was also covalently modified by [125I]13-iodotridecanoyl-CoA and thereby inactivated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that has been previously shown to be strongly inhibited by palmitoyl-CoA, is fatty acylated by the 125I-labeled myristoyl-CoA analog. Our data suggest that attachment of long chain fatty acids to proteins is a new and potentially widespread type of enzyme regulation mechanism that we denote active site fatty acylation."
https://openalex.org/W1949031059,"Attenuation of Syrian hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase, EC 1.1.1.34) activity by in vitro phosphorylation was studied using AMP-activated protein kinase and wild-type and mutant forms of HMG-CoA reductase. The only residue of the wild-type enzyme phosphorylated was Ser871. Substrates protected against kinase-mediated attenuation of activity, consistent with substrate-induced conformational changes at the C-terminal region. Although close to the catalytic histidine His865, Ser871 appears to play no direct role in catalysis or substrate recognition. Mutant enzymes S871A, S871H, S871N, and S871Q exhibited from 62-106% of wild-type activity and had wild-type Km values for HMG-CoA and NADPH. Replacement of Ser871 by aspartate or glutamate, but not by glutamine, asparagine, histidine, or tyrosine, severely attenuated activity. Attenuation of catalytic activity that accompanies phosphorylation thus appears to result primarily from the introduction of negative charge, not merely steric hindrance. Other than the wild-type enzyme, only mutant enzyme S871T was phosphorylated, and phosphorylation was accompanied by attenuation of activity. The AMP-activated kinase thus can also phosphorylate threonyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W1562931176,"In order to investigate how calcium on the cytosolic side of human erythrocytes induces the transmembrane redistribution of phospholipids, we studied the effect of this cation on the transmembrane movements of spin-labeled phospholipids (phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC)) incorporated into inside-out vesicles derived from human erythrocytes. We found that the extent of the Ca(2+)-induced lipid scrambling was dependent upon the level of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) contained in the external leaflet of inside-out vesicles. The level of PIP2 in this leaflet, which normally accounts for 80% of the total membrane PIP2, was manipulated either by ATP depletion of the original erythrocytes or by incorporation of exogenous PIP2. Similarly, loading the outer monolayer of the membrane of intact erythrocytes with exogenous PIP2 caused, in a dose-dependent way, the scrambling of spin-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, PC, and PS and in parallel the stomatocytic conversion of the cells. Both scrambling and stomatocytosis were strictly dependent on the presence of divalent cations in the medium. Mg2+ could replace Ca2+ but required a 10 times higher concentration. The effect was specific for PIP2, the other phosphoinositides being unable to induce the lipid redistribution. The shape change, but not the scrambling, required a normal ATP level. These results show that Ca2+ or Mg2+ trigger the lipid redistribution either from the internal or the external side of the membrane, provided that enough PIP2 is present on that side. Thus, no specific protein is required for this process. We infer that the ATP-dependent shape change of erythrocytes after incubation with PIP2 and Ca2+ results from the bilayer imbalance due to the activity of the aminophospholipid translocase which relocates PS and phosphatidylethanolamine to the inner monolayer without simultaneous outward diffusion of PC and sphingomyelin."
https://openalex.org/W1483885617,"Transferrin receptor (TfR) expression is regulated by iron at the level of mRNA stability through a factor (IRF/IRE-BP) which binds to specific iron-responsive elements (IRE). On the other hand, growth-dependent regulation of TfR expression is generally believed to be transcriptionally controlled. We analyzed the molecular mechanisms that control TfR gene expression at the onset of cell proliferation in vivo during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. The amount of TfR mRNA increased considerably after partial hepatectomy while run-on assays did not show significant changes in TfR gene transcription. RNA band-shift assays documented a significant activation of IRF/IRE-BP specific for the faster migrating IRE-protein complex (IRFB). These changes occurred in the absence of modifications of total liver iron concentration but together with a significant decrease of ferritin content. Moreover, when extreme variations of liver iron content were achieved by either chronic iron overload or severe iron deficiency, liver regeneration was unable to influence IRE-binding activity. We conclude that IRF/IRE-BP-mediated post-transcriptional control can fully account for TfR mRNA induction during liver cell proliferation in vivo. IRF/IRE-BP activation in the absence of changes in total tissue iron content might depend either on a drop of iron levels into the regulatory pool or on a relatively iron-independent mechanism specific for the faster migrating complex."
https://openalex.org/W1543349901,"Renal proximal Na/Pi-cotransport is increased in response to low dietary Pi intake. Recently, a cDNA (NaPi-2) related to the rat renal brush membrane Na/Pi-cotransporter has been cloned. In the present study, we used rats fed for 6 days with either a low Pi diet (LPD) or a high Pi diet (HPD), respectively. In parallel to an increased renal brush-border membrane Na/Pi-cotransport in LPD rats, there was also an increased content of NaPi-2 mRNA in renal cortex. After injection into Xenopus laevis oocytes, mRNA isolated from LPD rats induced a greater increase in Na/Pi-cotransport compared to mRNA from HPD rats. Hybrid depletion experiments suggested that mRNA-induced Na/Pi-cotransport is related to NaPi-2. We conclude that chronic Pi deprivation leads to an increased brush-border membrane Na/Pi-cotransport via an increase in the level of (NaPi-2) mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1606041540,"Succinate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.1) is an intrinsic bacterial or inner mitochondrial membrane protein that catalyses the oxidation of succinate and donates electrons to the respiratory chain via quinone acceptors. It is a heterotetramer composed of a flavoprotein, an iron-sulfur, and two hydrophobic subunits. We purified succinate dehydrogenase by blue native gel electrophoresis, determined the amino-terminal sequence of the Sdh4p subunit and used this information to clone the SDH4 gene. It encodes a precursor protein of 181 amino acids that is converted to the 150-amino acid mature Sdh4p protein with a mass of 16,638 Da. Hydrophobicity analysis predicts that Sdh4p forms three transmembrane alpha-helices. We have constructed an SDH4 mutant by targeted gene disruption; it retains the ability to grow on rich glycerol medium. Western blot analysis of SDH4 disruption mutant membrane fractions indicates that membrane attachment of the flavoprotein and iron-sulfur subunits is impaired but not abolished. This membrane-bound enzyme is able to reduce ubiquinone, although less efficiently than the wild-type enzyme. These findings indicate that Sdh4p contributes both to the membrane attachment of the catalytic flavoprotein and iron-sulfur subunits and to electron transfer to ubiquinone."
https://openalex.org/W1494526055,"The hemostatic functions of human von Willebrand Factor (vWF) depend on the normal assembly of disulfide-linked multimers from approximately 250-kDa subunits. Subunits initially form dimers through disulfide bonds near the COOH terminus. Dimers then form multimers through disulfide bonds near the NH2 terminus of each subunit. Previous studies of plasma vWF and recombinant vWF fragments indicate that 1 or more of the Cys residues at position 459, 462, and 464 form intersubunit disulfide bonds. No evidence has been reported that vWF multimer formation involves additional intersubunit bonds. To probe the disulfide bond requirements for multimer formation, mutant vWF proteins were expressed in which all 3 Cys residues at positions 459, 462, and 464 were changed to either Gly or Ala. Surprisingly, none of these cysteines appears to be necessary for efficient multimer assembly. Furthermore, recombinant vWF with Gly or Ala at all three positions induces platelet aggregation in the presence of ristocetin and binds to platelet glycoprotein Ib, factor VIII, and collagen in a manner similar to wild-type recombinant vWF. These results suggest that other intersubunit disulfide bonds must exist. Direct evidence for such a bond was obtained by characterization of tryptic fragments of vWF. By Edman degradation, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, a disulfide bond was demonstrated between Cys379 residues of adjacent vWF subunits. Thus, intersubunit disulfide bonds involving Cys379 and 1 or more of the Cys residues at positions 459, 462, and 464 connect the NH2-terminal ends of the vWF subunits in a parallel orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1595565542,"We have characterized three cis-acting elements of the human CYP11A1 gene. A proximal cAMP-responsive sequence (P-CRS) functioned in both adrenal Y1 and placental JEG-3 cells. An upstream cAMP-responsive sequence (U-CRS) and an enhancer, localized by transfections of deleted gene segments linked to a reporter gene to bases -1621 to -1503 and -1931 to -1822, respectively, functioned in Y1 but not JEG-3 cells. Both regions bind proteins only from Y1 cells as identified by footprinting analysis. U-CRS contains the TCAAGGTCA sequence that binds the nuclear receptor family of proteins. The cAMP-dependent transcription mediated by U-CRS, but not by P-CRS, was abolished in a cell line deficient in cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Therefore, P-CRS and U-CRS use different effectors to mediate cAMP response. Gel mobility shift, competition, and antibody supershift experiments showed that nucleotides -117 to -94, which contributed to P-CRS activity in transfection experiments, bound weakly to Sp1-like proteins. This feature is shared by many proximal regulatory elements of steroidogenic genes. Therefore, steroidogenic genes could be coordinately regulated through common regulatory elements such as P-CRS, U-CRS, and cell type-selective enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W313233414,"The myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (WT), caused dose-dependent inhibition of the sustained increases but not the initial spikes of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in angiotensin II (AII)-stimulated adrenal glomerulosa cells. In contrast, WT did not affect the [Ca2+]i increases evoked by K(+)-induced depolarization or by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with ionomycin or thapsigargin, suggesting that its inhibitory effects on Ins-1,4,5-P3 and [Ca2+]i responses are closely related. The inhibitory effect of WT on the Ins-1,4,5-P3 response was not secondary to its reduction of Ca2+ entry, since ionomycin-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i did not restore Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation. Also, WT inhibited agonist- and GTP gamma S-stimulated Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation in permeabilized cells maintained at fixed Ca2+ concentrations. Thus, inhibition of Ca2+ influx by WT is a consequence of reduced Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation and could reflect the resultant refilling of the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pool. Indeed, AII-depleted Ca2+ pools were found to refill by a thapsigargin-sensitive mechanism in WT-treated cells. Other structurally unrelated inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase (MS-347a, KT5926, and ML-9) also inhibited AII-induced inositol phosphate formation, albeit with lower potencies than WT. MS-347a, like WT, inhibited only the second phase of the inositol phosphate and [Ca2+]i responses to AII. These findings demonstrate that WT is a potent inhibitor of the Ins-1,4,5-P3-Ca2+ signaling pathway and acts primarily on a mechanism that promotes Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation and is sensitive to inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1501369263,"Dihydrosphingosine, an intermediate in the de novo synthesis of ceramide, induced proliferation of Swiss 3T3 cells. The proliferative effects of this lipid were much more potent than those of sphingosine, a break-down product of ceramide. The maximal proliferative response to dihydrosphingosine occurred at relatively low concentrations (1 microM), while sphingosine produced its maximal effect at much higher concentrations (15 microM). The cell-permeable ceramide, N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6-ceramide), which was also a mitogen in these cells (at 1 microM), caused a striking morphological change when added to the cells at concentrations of 5-10 microM. This shape change was reversible with the removal of ceramide. Exogenous dihydrosphingosines and sphingosines have at least two metabolic fates in Swiss 3T3 cells, conversion to ceramide or to sphingosine 1-phosphate. Surprisingly, both the synthetic threo- isomer and the naturally occurring erythro- isomer of dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine (D-erythro-sphingosine, L-threo-sphingosine, DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine, and DL-erythro-dihydrosphingosine) were readily phosphorylated in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. This substrate specificity may be an indication of a sphingosine kinase activity which is distinct from that of platelets or rat brain. Although sphingosine 1-phosphate and ceramide were both produced upon the addition of sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine, no sphingosine 1-phosphate was produced when Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with mitogenic concentrations of C6-ceramide. These data are consistent with the formation of ceramide and not sphingosine 1-phosphate being required for the mitogenesis produced by exogenous sphingoid bases."
https://openalex.org/W1566582900,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef is a myristylated 27-kDa, cytoplasmic protein. It is attributed to have suppressive effects on LTR-based expression and T cell activation. Additionally, SIV nef has been shown to possess an essential in vivo function in the development of immunodeficiency. To define the biochemical activity of HIV-1 Nef in a signal transduction pathway, we have transduced murine NIH-3T3 cells with a retroviral nef expression system. In nef-expressing cells, but not in controls, the proliferative response to bombesin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was eliminated. Analysis of an early signal pathway metabolite, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, following bombesin and PDGF treatment to quiscent cells, revealed that both control and nef-transformed cells displayed similar kinetics of signal formation. Normally, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mediates increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Upon stimulation with bombesin or PDGF, control cells displayed a 2-4-fold increase of [Ca2+]i over the basal level, while the [Ca2+]i response in nef-expressing NIH-3T3 cells was lacking or highly diminished. However, the release of [Ca2+]i from the intracellular store of the nef-expressing cells by an endomembrane Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, revealed that these cells contained normal Ca2+ stores. These results suggest a specific, definable biochemical activity for the HIV-1 Nef protein in the context of a well characterized cellular activation pathway. Our results thus define, for the first time, a unique function of Nef that is not limited to an alteration of T cell function or of expression of a T cell surface antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1581754635,"The purpose of this study was to investigate P450scc expression during trophoblast differentiation. Biochemical characteristics of P450scc protein and mRNA identified in rat trophoblast tissues were similar to those identified in the rat adrenal gland. Furthermore, P450scc was localized to trophoblast giant cells. This observation prompted an examination of progesterone biosynthesis and P450scc expression in Rcho-1 cells. Rcho-1 cells were derived from a transplantable rat choriocarcinoma, their differentiation can be regulated, and they have the capacity to express the trophoblast giant cell phenotype. Progesterone was produced by Rcho-1 cells and increased approximately 100-fold as the cells progressed from proliferation to differentiation. P450scc protein and mRNA accumulation also increased during trophoblast differentiation. P450scc expression within the Rcho-1 cell line was restricted to trophoblast giant cells. To further investigate the regulation of P450scc expression during trophoblast differentiation, we examined a plasmid construct, containing 894 base pairs of DNA 5' upstream from the P450scc transcriptional start site linked to a human growth hormone reporter gene, following stable transfection into Rcho-1 cells. The transfected P450scc regulatory DNA permitted the expression of human growth hormone which paralleled expression of the endogenous P450scc gene. In conclusion, transcriptional activation of the P450scc gene accompanies trophoblast giant cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1604208828,"Alanine mutagenesis scanning of the intracellular portion of the human muscarinic cholinergic Hm1 receptor was performed to identify domains mediating agonist induced receptor sequestration. Using these multiple alanine point mutants of Hm1, we had previously identified several receptor domains in the intracellular loops i1-3 that play a role in coupling to phosphatidyl inositol turnover, most notably, a lipophilic residue, Leu-131, in the conserved i2 loop domain DRYXXVXXPL (Moro, O., Lameh, J., Hogger, P., and Sadee, W. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 6862-6865). We now demonstrate that alanine substitutions in three of these domains, i.e. middle of the i2 loop and both junctions of the i3 loop, also result in defective sequestration (loss of surface receptor sites accessible to a polar tracer) in transfected human kidney U293 cells. The i2 loop was studied further by single point mutations. The strongest impairment of sequestration occurred with mutant L131A which was also highly defective in phosphatidyl inositol (PI) coupling. Substitution of Leu-131 with several distinct amino acids indicated that a bulky lipophilic residue is required for sequestration in this position, as shown for coupling to PI turnover. Further, the double point mutation, V127A/L131A, almost completely suppressed both sequestration and coupling of Hm1. In the beta 2 adrenoceptor, alanine substitution of the i2 residue Phe-139, equivalent to Leu-131 in Hm1, also resulted in impaired coupling to adenylyl cyclase and sequestration, indicating a general role for this conserved i2 loop residue in both processes. The combined results show that the multi-site domain involved in signal transduction of Hm1 is similar to and overlaps with that involved in sequestration. However, three Hm1 mutants that were moderately deficient in stimulating PI turnover displayed normal sequestration, suggesting distinct mechanisms. We propose that cellular mediators of receptor sequestration are structurally similar or identical to the heterotrimeric G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1565339590,"p53 is a tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in a wide variety of tumors. The encoded p53 protein has properties of a classical transcription factor, but the promoter targets for its regulation are largely unknown. We have investigated the ability of p53 to regulate activity of the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) promoter using a cotransfection assay in CCL-64 and Saos-2 cells. p53 was able to stimulate transcription from the Rb promoter at low input doses of p53 expression plasmid, whereas transcription was repressed at high input doses. The stimulatory effect of p53 on Rb promoter activity mapped to a region between 4 and 92 base pairs upstream from the start site of translation, whereas the region controlling repression by p53 mapped to the basal transcriptional control region of the promoter between -207 and -185. Moreover, an oligonucleotide containing Rb promoter sequences between -63 and -88 was sufficient to confer stimulation by p53 when inserted upstream from a minimal heterologous promoter. Gel mobility shift analysis was used to demonstrate that p53 can bind to a sequence within the -63 to -88 oligonucleotide with homology to a p53 binding site. The presence of a functional p53 binding site in the human retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene promoter suggests that p53 can regulate Rb promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1542993968,"The R2 gene of ribonucleotide reductase is elevated in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts treated with the tumor promotor, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). TPA treatment increased the half-life of the R2 message by 3-fold, showing that TPA regulates R2 gene expression by a post-transcriptional mechanism(s). A 20-nucleotide (nt) TPA-responsive region was found within the R2 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). Ultraviolet cross-linking detected a novel 45-kDa protein-R2 mRNA complex migration band that bound selectively to the 20-nt fragment and did not bind to the 5'UTR or the coding region of the R2 message, or to the 3'UTRs of mRNA from several other genes, or to the homopolymer poly(A) sequence. The-45 kDa protein-R2 mRNA binding activity observed in unstimulated cells was markedly down-regulated after TPA treatment. Deletion of a 201-nt region, containing the 20-nt sequence, from the 3'UTR caused stabilization of hybrid chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA in the absence of TPA treatment. Furthermore, in vitro decay reaction mixtures supplemented with the 20-nt sense RNA transcript resulted in stabilization of R2 message. A model is presented of R2 message regulation in which a cis-element within the 20-nt sequence of the 3'UTR interacts with a cytosolic protein to form a 45-kDa protein-mRNA binding complex. The TPA-induced alteration of R2 message stability is at least in part due to the down-regulation of the 45-kDa protein-mRNA binding activity which is linked to a reduction in the rate of R2 mRNA degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1556315547,"Dependence of hormone binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) on cellular ATP levels suggested that GRs traverse an ATP-dependent cycle, and without ATP accumulate in forms that cannot bind hormone. Such null receptors (NRs) were identified in ATP-depleted WEHI-7 cells, where they are tightly associated with the nuclear fraction and partly dephosphorylated. With WCL2 cells (Chinese hamster ovary cells with overexpressed GRs) depleted of ATP with azide, we have now identified dephosphorylated sites on NRs, studied possible roles of phosphorylation using GR mutants, and measured association with the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90). Most NRs in WCL2 cells are dephosphorylated at serines 220 and 234, but GRs with those serines mutated to alanines do not resemble NRs since they bind hormone. They do not associate strongly with nuclei. On azide treatment, however, mutated GRs lose hormone binding capacity faster than normal GRs. Association of hsp90 (and presumably other heat shock proteins) with cytosolic GRs is drastically reduced by azide treatment, sufficient to account for decreased hormone binding. We conclude that: (a) dephosphorylation of GRs does not yield NRs, but may weaken association with hsp90. (b) The postulated ATP-dependent GR cycle can be accounted for by dissociation, and ATP-dependent reconstitution, of GR-hsp90 complexes. (c) ATP depletion blocks reconstitution of complexes. Uncomplexed GRs may accumulate as one form of NR; they are probably also the precursors for other forms of NR."
https://openalex.org/W1487184433,"Glutamine 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase from Escherichia coli is subject to synergistic feedback regulation by adenine and guanine nucleotides. Inhibition assays and equilibrium binding measurements have established that synergistic inhibition by AMP and GMP results from synergistic binding to two sites/enzyme subunit in the homotetramer. Although each nucleotide can bind to both sites, analyses of the wild type and mutant enzymes indicate that binding of GMP to an A (allosteric) site and AMP to a proximal C (catalytic) site are necessary for synergistic inhibition. K326Q and P410W amino acid replacements result in decreased binding affinity for GMP and AMP and lead to corresponding reductions in feedback inhibition. The K326Q A site mutation results not only in decreased affinity of GMP for the mutant A site but also has an adverse effect on AMP affinity for the C site. Similarly, the P410W C site mutation has a detrimental effect on binding of AMP to the mutant C site and also on affinity of GMP to the A site. The fact that a mutation in one site affects binding of nucleotides to both sites provides further evidence for synergistic binding of nucleotides."

Quantitative analysis provided estimations of about 50% @-sheet, 12% a-helix, 24% @-turn, and 14% unordered structure for CRP and about 54% @-sheet, 12% a-helix, 25% @-turn, and 9% unordered structure for SAP. With both proteins significant calcium-dependent changes were observed in conformation-sensitive amide I regions assigned to each type of structure. The CRP spectrum was also af€ected by magnesium, but the changes differed from those induced by calcium. The SAP spectrum was not affected by magnesium. Phosphorylcholine in the presence of calcium also affected the spectrum of CRP but not the spectrum of SAP. Our present study provides the first direct comparison of the secondary structures of the pentraxins human CRP and SAP and hamster female protein (Dong, A., Caughey, B., Caughey, W. S., Bhat, K.

https://openalex.org/W1484171168,"Following sequestration into the endoplasmic reticulum, wheat gliadin storage proteins may either be retained and packaged into protein bodies inside the organelle or be transported via the Golgi apparatus to vacuoles and condense into protein bodies at a post-endoplasmic reticulum location. To unravel the mechanism of this complex process of deposition, we expressed wild-type and mutant forms of two closely related gamma and aggregated gliadins in Xenopus oocytes. Although a considerable amount of the gamma-gliadin was secreted to the medium, its closely related aggregated gliadin was entirely retained within the oocytes. This differential secretion was largely due to structural variations in the C-terminal regions of the proteins. Retention of the wild-type aggregated and gamma-gliadins within the endoplasmic reticulum could not be explained by rapid assembly into insoluble deposits inasmuch as both proteins could diffuse rather efficiently within the organelle for several hours. To address more closely the role of the C-terminal region in the transport and assembly of the gamma-gliadin within the endoplasmic reticulum, 3 cysteine codons in this region were mutated, one at a time, to serine codons. The cysteine-replacement mutants improperly aggregated within the endoplasmic reticulum forming denser deposits compared with the wild-type protein."
https://openalex.org/W1557804355,"2-Azido-ATP (2-N3-ATP) was investigated as a reagent for the identification of amino acids located within the catalytic ATP binding site of Na,K-ATPase. The enzymatic activity of Na,K-ATPase was inhibited up to 50% by 2-N3-ATP (K0.5 = 5-10 microM) after irradiation with ultra-violet light, and inhibition was prevented by 0.2 mM ATP. The binding of ATP to Na,K-ATPase (KD = 0.1 microM) was inhibited competitively by 2-N3-ATP. [alpha-32P]2-N3-ATP labels the alpha subunit of Na,K-ATPase, and the stoichiometry of covalent ATP-protectable incorporation of the probe into the protein is approximately equal to the stoichiometry of high-affinity binding of ATP to the Na,K-ATPase. 2-N3-ATP is also hydrolyzed by Na,K-ATPase as a substrate. From these data, it is concluded that 2-N3-ATP photochemically labels the Na,K-ATPase from within the catalytic ATP site on the protein. Trypsin digestion of Na,K-ATPase after photochemical labeling with [alpha-32P]2-N3-ATP generated a large 30-kDa fragment containing the radiolabeled nucleotide. This fragment was resistant to further cleavage by trypsin, but it could be digested further after denaturation in urea. High pressure liquid chromatography separation of tryptic peptides from the 30-kDa fragment and subsequent amino acid sequence analysis of the radiolabeled peptides identified the region between His496 and Arg510 of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit as the region labeled by [alpha-32P]2-N3-ATP. Gly502 was absent from all sequences of the radiolabeled peptides from this region, consistent with the derivatization of this amino acid by 2-N3-ATP and localization of Gly502 within the ATP binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1620040145,"The properties of the purinergic receptors in the PC12 cells were studied. The rank order of potency to increase [Ca2+]i was: adenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) > ATP > adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) >>> 3'-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl)ATP. ADP, AMP, GTP, UTP, alpha, beta- and beta,gamma-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphates, 5'-adenylylimido-diphosphate, and adenosine analogues were ineffective. Although tetrabasic ATP4- was the form responsible for activation of the P2 receptors, ATP4- did not cause cell membrane permeabilization. The binding of alpha-35S-ATP to the intact cells showed a divalent cation dependency and a binding profile similar to the rank order of potency to increase [Ca2+]i. Scatchard plots of the equilibrium saturation binding data were nonlinear, and dissociation kinetics of the radioligand were best described using two kinetic rates. Different kinetic rates were, however, obtained when dissociation was initiated by the addition of excess ATP or by an 80-fold dilution.

In vitro, these mutations result in constitutive activation of the protein. In an effort to develop a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of the disease, we have examined various amine derivatives of 11-cis- and 9-cis-retinal for ability to irreversibly inactivate a related constitutively active mutant, K296G. Three amines were prepared by reductive amination of retinal: 11-cis-retinylpropylamine, 11-cis-retinylamine, and 9-cis-retinylamine. All three compounds inactivated K296G, and the inactivation could not be reversed upon exposure to light. None of the compounds inactivated the wild-type protein. Although the amines were not effective on the naturally occurring retinitis pigmentosa mutants, presumably because of unfavorable steric interactions with the bulky Glu and Met side chains at position 296, the success with K296G makes it highly encouraging that this approach will evolve related compounds that are capable of inactivating the naturally occurring mutants as well."
https://openalex.org/W1516693210,"Mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) has previously been shown to function in vitro as a retinol dehydrogenase as well as an ethanol dehydrogenase. Thus ADH participates in the conversion of retinol (vitamin A alcohol) to retinoic acid, a regulatory ligand for the retinoic acid receptor class of transcription factors. Human ADH exists as a family of isozymes encoded by seven genes, which are differentially expressed in adult liver and extrahepatic tissues, being found preferentially in the epithelial cells which are retinoid target tissues. However, human ADH expression patterns have not been analyzed in early embryonic tissues, which are known to synthesize and respond to retinoic acid such as the neural tube and limb buds. To estimate the embryonic expression pattern for one member of the human ADH family, we have constructed transgenic mouse lines carrying the human ADH3 promoter fused to the lacZ gene. ADH3-lacZ transgene expression was first noted at embryonic day 9.5 and was active in the neural tube extending from the midbrain to the spinal cord, as well as the heart and proximal regions of the forelimb buds. In day 12.5 and 13.5 embryos, ADH3 transgene expression remained in the neural tube and heart and was also observed in more distal regions of the forelimb and hindlimb buds as well as the kidney. Expression in the neural tube was highest in the ventral midline including the floor plate and showed a ventral to dorsal gradient of decreasing expression. These findings indicate that at least one human ADH isozyme may exist in the correct tissues to act as an embryonic retinol dehydrogenase catalyzing the synthesis of retinoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1544513962,"Two modalities of urate transport have been reported in rat kidney, a urate/anion exchanger and a potential sensitive, uricase-like uniporter. As an initial attempt to isolate and characterize the responsible transport protein(s), rat renal cortical membranes were harvested, solubilized, and subjected to affinity chromatography with urate or xanthine as the affinity ligand. Pig liver peroxisomal uricase was purified with the same system, and the enzymatically active protein was used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbit. Silver stain of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels of the eluted fraction containing the affinity-purified renal membrane protein(s) demonstrated bands at 25, 32, 36, and 41 kDa. On Western blot, two of these bands (32 and 36 kDa) were immunoreactive to the polyclonal antibody to pig liver uricase. In 6 of 10 studies, the affinity-purified renal membrane protein(s) also oxidized urate. Anti-pig liver uricase produced a selective and dose-dependent inhibition of the uricase-like urate uniporter in renal membrane vesicles, but did not affect the urate/anion exchanger or the sodium-dependent glucose transporter. Immunocytochemical studies of rat renal cortex with the same antibody indicated that the immunoreactivity was localized to proximal tubules. These studies demonstrate that the renal cortical plasma membranes contain urate-binding proteins, which have some functional and immunological homology to the hepatic peroxisomal core protein, uricase. Within the renal cortex, these proteins are localized to proximal tubules, the site of urate transport. Since the antibody that reacts with the affinity-purified urate-binding proteins on Western blot selectively inhibits urate transport in intact membrane vesicles, it is concluded that at least one of the affinity-purified urate-binding proteins is a uricase-like urate transporter."

The purified omega-conotoxin receptor from rabbit brain is a multisubunit complex composed of alpha 1B, alpha 2 delta, beta 3, and 95-kDa subunits. Immunoadsorption experiments confirm that the purified preparation does not contain alpha 1 subunits other than the omega-conotoxin-sensitive class B isoform. The functional properties of the purified channel have been analyzed further in lipid bilayers, and similarities to or differences from the native N-type Ca2+ channel have been outlined. Conserved properties include ion selectivity, open-time duration, and pharmacology (insensitivity to drugs affecting skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channels). Observed properties of the reconstituted channel which differ from the native channel include (a) sustained channel activity without Ca(2+)- or voltage-induced inactivation; (b) examples of extremely high open-state probability; (c) the absence of run-down; and (d) voltage independence of the Ca2+ channel gating. In addition, the conductance of the purified receptor is comprised between 7 and 27 picosiemens. Our results suggest that cellular components may play critical roles in the regulation of several biophysical properties and neuronal function of the native N-type Ca2+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1559756731,"The R2 protein family of class I ribonucleotide reductases contains a highly conserved serine residue close to the essential tyrosyl radical and the dinuclear iron center. In order to test its physiological importance, we have engineered the Ser-211 of Escherichia coli R2 to an alanine and a cysteine residue. The three-dimensional structure of R2 S211A solved to 2.4-A resolution is virtually identical to the wild-type structure apart from the substituted residue. Both mutant proteins contain oxidized dinuclear iron and tyrosyl radical, and their specific enzyme activity per radical are comparable to that of the wild-type protein. In R2 S211A the stability of the tyrosyl radical is substantially decreased, probably caused by movement of Gln-80 into hydrogen bonding distance of Tyr-122. The major defect in R2 S211A, however, is the inability of its iron center to be reduced by enzymic or chemical means, a characteristic not found in R2 S211C. We propose that Ser-211 is needed as a proton donor/transporter during reduction of the iron center of R2, a reaction which in vivo precedes reconstitution of the tyrosyl radical. This offers a physiological explanation for the high conservation of a serine residue at this position in the R2 family."

Successful entry of the antibodies was determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Permeabilized cells showed typical large granular lymphocyte morphology and remained functional, significantly lysing both NK-sensitive K562 cells and NK-resistant/IANK-sensitive RAJI target cells. This method was utilized to study the effect of anti-G protein antibodies on the functional activities of IANK cells. Anti-Gs antibody inhibited IANK cell killing of RAJI but not of K562 target cells. Further analysis showed that K562 and RAJI cells enhance the binding of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) to IANK cell membranes, and increase the hydrolysis of [32P]GTP in these membranes. Immunoblot analysis showed that K562 and RAJI cells induce the release of alpha o, but not alpha i, alpha s, or alpha q.11 from IANK cell membranes. Cumulatively, these data indicate that putative receptors recognizing K562 or RAJI target cells are coupled to Go in IANK cells, however, only Gs seems to be coupled to receptors recognizing RAJI target cells.

The present studies have now revealed that the decomposition of the ternary complex of luciferase with FMN and myristic acid occurs at a rate 10-15 times slower than the decay of luminescence and that functional luciferase is only regenerated after the release of flavin. In contrast, the rate of FMN dissociation and recovery of activity observed with a binary luciferase-FMN complex was more rapid indicating that release of fatty acid played the critical role in determining the rate of FMN dissociation from the ternary complex. Decomposition of the ternary complex was shown to occur by an ordered process involving the slow release of fatty acid followed by the more rapid release of flavin. The present results suggest that the rate-limiting step for the turnover of luciferase occurs subsequent to emission of light and would be the controlling step under conditions (e.g. in cells) with continuous light emission."
https://openalex.org/W1541443213,"Oligodeoxynucleotide models of mRNA were used to determine the ribosomal site of specific nucleotides 3' to the initiation codon. Each mRNA analog had a 5'-terminal 9-base Shine-Dalgarno sequence, a 7-nucleotide spacer, and an ATG initiation signal, followed by up to 31 nucleotides, one of which carried an antibody-recognizable marker. All probes bound efficiently to activated Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits. Complexes were formed using ribosomal subunits, initiator tRNA, an oligodeoxynucleotide probe, and antibodies. Electron microscopy was then used to place specific positions in the mRNA analog on the subunit and thus to trace the pathway of the messenger. As viewed from the cytoplasmic side of the subunit, the 5' segment of the mRNA lies on the left, along the inner surface of the platform. The initiation codon and the next 9 nucleotides are located in the cleft between the subunit platform and body; within this segment the mRNA makes a U turn and emerges from the cleft at the left of the neck that separates the subunit head and body. The mRNA then loops around the neck to the right, along the cytoplasmic surface of the subunit and toward the site of the 7-methylguanosine residue of the 16 S ribosomal RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1582135469,"Previous work has shown that when yeast mitochondria are incubated in the presence of the presequence peptide pL4(1-22), the peptide is imported and accumulates within the mitochondrial membranes, presumably at the import sites. If the extramitochondrial concentration of peptide is sufficiently high, enough peptide accumulates within the import sites to prevent the uptake of authentic precursor proteins. We have used chemical cross-linking to probe the interaction of this peptide with yeast mitochondrial proteins. We found that radiolabeled pL4(1-22) could be reproducibly cross-linked to a number of polypeptides. Interestingly, nearly all were membrane proteins. Several of the cross-linked proteins were located in the outer membrane, while others were located in the inner membrane. The interaction between the peptide and many of the cross-linked products was shown to be specific by two independent criteria. First, an excess of unlabeled peptide acted as a competitor in the cross-linking reaction, and, second, treatment of the peptide with the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide dramatically reduced its ability to form cross-links. Two of the cross-linked species corresponded to the outer membrane proteins, Mas70p and ISP42. Significantly, both of these proteins have previously been shown to play critical roles in mitochondrial protein import. While the role of the other cross-linked proteins in the import process remains to be determined, the results of this study demonstrate that our experimental approach may be useful in identifying components of the import machinery as well as proteins that interact with mitochondrial presequences."
https://openalex.org/W1603905705,"The mechanism for reversible iron binding in the N-terminal lobe of ovotransferrin was investigated by a protein fragmentation approach. The iron-saturated N-terminal half-molecule of ovotransferrin was proteolyzed into large 30-kDa (1-279) and small 6-kDa (280-332) fragments by a single cleavage with Achromobacter protease I, producing a stable nicked form. For the separation of the two fragments, denaturing conditions were required. The isolated large fragment contained all four iron-coordinating ligands and the anion-binding ligand, and according to spectroscopic titration analysis, it showed iron binding capacity. The iron-bound large fragment, however, showed a blue-shifted visible absorption spectrum and a much decreased iron stability compared with those of the intact half-molecule. Analyses by ion-exchange chromatography revealed that the large fragment reassociates with the small fragment. In order for reassociation to occur, iron must be bound to the large fragment; upon reassociation, the large fragment regained its stable iron binding capacity as well as a visible absorption spectrum almost indistinguishable from those of the intact half-molecule. These data are consistent with a two-step sequential pathway for reversible iron binding in the N-terminal lobe of ovotransferrin that includes an initial iron binding intermediate having a perturbed metal environment and its transformation into the stable iron-bound holoform by peptide-peptide interactions between the large coordinating and small noncoordinating segments."
https://openalex.org/W1510296248,"Residues 12-87 (TR1C fragment) of turkey skeletal muscle troponin-C comprises two helix-loop-helix calcium-binding motifs which are the regulatory calcium-binding sites in the N-terminal domain of the protein. We have used the combined distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol DGII (Havel, T. F. (1991) Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 56, 43-78) to determine the structure of this 76-residue polypeptide in solution from 475 1H NMR-derived distance restraints. The nuclear Overhauser enhancement-derived distance constraints used in the DGII protocol were supplemented by introducing generic hydrogen bond distance restraints for slowly exchanging amide hydrogens in regular secondary structure elements, by restricting the available phi angle space to -180 degrees to 0 degrees for all residues except glycines, and by tailoring the distance boundaries used for quantitating the nuclear Overhauser enhancement intensities to correspond to characteristic distances found in helices. This improved the geometry of the four helices in the resulting structures. The relative positions of helices A and B which flank calcium-binding loop 1, helix D which follows calcium-binding loop 2, and the beta-sheet between the two calcium-binding loops were well defined and had an overall root-mean-square deviation for 20 converged structures of 1.4 +/- 0.2 A for backbone atoms. The structure and relative orientations of these regions are very similar to these of the corresponding regions of the protein in the crystal structure of intact turkey skeletal troponin C (Herzberg, O., and James, M. N. G. (1988) Nature 313, 653-659). The structure of helix C was well defined, but its relative position to the other helices was not defined. It occupied a range of positions in the set of 20 DGII structures, the average of which was quite similar to the orientation of helix C in the x-ray structure. The overall structure of the apo regulatory domain of troponin-C is therefore not affected by the loss of the N-helix, or the low pH conditions used for the x-ray structure, but may be more flexible in regions known to be involved in contacts with other skeletal muscle regulatory proteins."
