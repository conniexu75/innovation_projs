https://openalex.org/W2074475022,"Precursor reactions based on metathetical (exchange) pathways have been found to be an effective synthetic route for the preparation of a large number of materials. These solid-solid reactions are extremely rapid (typically less than 1 second) and often can be initiated at or near room temperature. They are potentially useful for controlling product particle size and for preparing highquality cationic or anionic solid solutions. The frequently self-propagating and sometimes explosive behavior exhibited by these reactions can be attributed to the large amount of heat they release. As a consequence, thermodynamic considerations can be used to help select the best set of precursors as judged from reaction enthalpies. The factors that influence these reactions are illustrated by a discussion of MoS(2), ZrN, MoSi(2), and GaAs, examples of the many compounds accessible by this synthetic route."

https://openalex.org/W2047422249,"The results of kinetic simulations of the aggregates formed during the deposition of atoms on a semiconductor surface are reviewed. Because the kinetic parameters are poorly known and the accuracy of the existing interatomic potentials has not been sufficiently tested, the goal has been to reach a qualitative understanding of the formation of unusual patterns during growth, such as the segregation of aluminum during the growth of aluminum-gallium-arsenide (AlGaAs) coherent tilted superlattices and the formation of thin, long, and parallel islands during the deposition of Si on an Si(100) surface. Kinetic mechanisms for these phenomena are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2029643996,"The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can be used to measure current-voltage characteristics on an atomic scale. The attachment of copper phthalocyanine molecules, in contrast to a variety of other molecules, to graphite changes the electrical characteristics of the STM from relatively symmetric to highly asymmetric or rectifying. Evidence is presented to show that the asymmetry arises because of the electronic energy levels of the copper phthalocyanine. The organic molecules were bonded to the graphite by an acid-base reaction that may have wide applicability."

Modern research in polymers focuses on the ways in which tailored macromolecules organize themselves in the solid state and on materials design and synthesis at the interface between polymer science and the fields of ceramics, metals, and electroactive or electrooptical materials."
https://openalex.org/W1977181312,"Readily identifiable groups of microorganisms present on nonliving particulate organic matter (detritus) in the upper waters of Lake Tahoe are attached in specific ways and appear responsible for detrital aggregation. This microflora is associated with active heterotrophic metabolism, but deeper waters possess little detrital microflora and little heterotrophic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2029614355,"A review of advances for aircraft engine structural materials and processes is presented. Improved materials, such as superalloys, and the processes for making turbine disks and blades have had a major impact on the capability of modern gas turbine engines. New structural materials, notably composites and intermetallic materials, are emerging that will eventually further enhance engine performance, reduce engine weight, and thereby enable new aircraft systems. In the future, successful aerospace manufacturers will combine product design and materials excellence with improved manufacturing methods to increase production efficiency, enhance product quality, and decrease the engine development cycle time."
https://openalex.org/W1977693807,"Rhenium and osmium concentrations and the osmium isotopic compositions of iron meteorites were determined by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Data for the IIA iron meteorites define an isochron with an uncertainty of approximately +/-31 million years for meteorites approximately 4500 million years old. Although an absolute rheniumosmium closure age for this iron group cannot be as precisely constrained because of uncertainty in the decay constant of (187)Re, an age of 4460 million years ago is the minimum permitted by combined uncertainties. These age constraints imply that the parent body of the IIAB magmatic irons melted and subsequently cooled within 100 million years after the formation of the oldest portions of chondrites. Other iron meteorites plot above the IIA isocbron, indicating that the planetary bodies represented by these iron groups may have cooled significantly later than the parent body of the IIA irons."
https://openalex.org/W2043918832,"Analysis of data on coral abundance and growth, and the population size (26 individuals per hectare) and feeding rate of Acanthaster indicates that Pocillopora reefs on the Pacific coast of Panama are undergoing vigorous growth in the presence of this predator. Prediction of the effects of a population increase in Acanthaster to plague proportions (2.5 times that presently observed) suggests that reefs could still maintain a positive growth. However, Acanthaster at ten times the present population density would lead to rapid destruction of reefs. It is argued that coral destruction due to Acanthaster represents only one of several factors affecting coral reef progression."
https://openalex.org/W2022111799,"Significantly higher concentrations of nitrate and silicate were found in glaciated South Cape Fiord than in unglaciated Grise Fiord, in the Canadian Arctic, or in adjacent Jones Sound. No significant differences in phosphate concentrations were found. Glacial activity apparently enriches the concentrations of those nutrients most critically limiting for arctic phytoplankton requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1997414445,"New potassium-argon age data from the Columbia Plateau suggest a basalt production rate of 108 cubic meters per year during a middle Miocene volcanic episode. This is two to three times the production rate in some oceanic islands, and about four to six times the production rate in spreading mid-oceanic ridge systems."
https://openalex.org/W1998947077,"Magnetite from the Orgueil C1 chondrite is only 2.0 +/- 2.4 million years older by the iodine-xenon method than the next oldest meteorite, the Karoonda C4 chondrite. This age ties the primitive C1 chondrites to the extensive iodine-xenon chronology of normal chrondrites. If Karoonda and Orgueil magnetite formed from similar material, then the age difference is an upper limit to the formation time of these meteorites-and by customary extension, the solar system. Condensation, chondrule formation, accretion, and metamorphism of the Karoonda parent body all seem to have been completed within a few million years."

These problems appear in the relatively discrete sectors of consumer protection and occupational safety and in the diffuse sectors of community quality of life and the national and international environments."
https://openalex.org/W2015316532,Pulsating hemolymph pressures of remarkable magnitude for invertebrates are prevalent in the Pacific gooseneck barnacle. Mean pressures of 250 centimeters of water are common with pulse pressures up to 70 centimeters of water. The pulsations are distinctly rhythmical and the pulsation rate is highly temperature-dependent. The results strongly suggest that in cirripeds hemolymph is circulated by muscular contractions of a functional heart.

https://openalex.org/W1978925822,"During a November 1989 conference on radiation exposure measurement, scientists from what was then the Soviet Union toasted the birth of an arrangement they hoped would grow into a lasting business partnership. A Cleveland company that makes radiation dosimetry equipment such as the exposure badges worn by workers in nuclear power plants, expects to import as many as 100,000 radiation-sensitive disks of synthetic sapphire (aluminum oxide) from the Soviet Union. When doped with carbon atoms, the crystals can monitor radiation levels 40 times fainter than the levels picked up by the lithium fluoride-based materials usually used in the West, a sensitivity that it is hoped will make them the standard in the nuclear industry. Earlier this month the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, proposed setting up a $200 million foundation to fund Russian research in areas including materials science."
