Here we describe a higher frequency of T helper type 1 (T(H)1)-like, interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-secreting Foxp3(+) T cells in untreated subjects with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) as compared to healthy control individuals. In subjects treated with IFN-β, the frequency of IFN-γ(+)Foxp3(+) T cells is similar to that in healthy control subjects. In vitro, human T(reg) cells from healthy subjects acquire a T(H)1-like phenotype when cultured in the presence of interleukin-12 (IL-12). T(H)1-like T(reg) cells show reduced suppressive activity in vitro, which can partially be reversed by IFN-γ-specific antibodies or by removal of IL-12."
https://openalex.org/W2009867049,"Despite the power of massively parallel sequencing platforms, a drawback is the short length of the sequence reads produced. We demonstrate that short reads can be locally assembled into longer contigs using paired-end sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-PE) fragments. We use this RAD-PE contig approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and determine haplotype structure in threespine stickleback and to sequence E. coli and stickleback genomic DNA with overlapping contigs of several hundred nucleotides. We also demonstrate that adding a circularization step allows the local assembly of contigs up to 5 kilobases (kb) in length. The ease of assembly and accuracy of the individual contigs produced from each RAD site sequence suggests RAD-PE sequencing is a useful way to convert genome-wide short reads into individually-assembled sequences hundreds or thousands of nucleotides long."
https://openalex.org/W2001428385,"SIRT1 is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes, and aging. However, it is not clear how SIRT1 activity is regulated by intracellular kinases in cells. In this study, we investigated SIRT1 phosphorylation and protein degradation in response to JNK1 activation in obese mice. Mouse SIRT1 is phosphorylated by JNK1 at Ser-46 (Ser-47 in human SIRT1), which is one of the four potential residues targeted by JNK1. The phosphorylation induces a brief activation of SIRT1 function and degradation of SIRT1 thereafter by the proteasome. Ubiquitination occurs in SIRT1 protein after the phosphorylation. Mutation of Ser-46 to alanine prevents the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation. In vivo, SIRT1 undergoes an extensive degradation in hepatocytes in obesity as a consequence of persistent activation of JNK1. The degradation leads to inhibition of SIRT1 function, which contributes to development of hepatic steatosis. The degradation disappears in obesity when JNK1 is inactivated in mice. JNK2 exhibits an opposite activity in the regulation of SIRT1 degradation. The JNK1-SIRT1 pathway provides a new molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in obesity.

The alteration is related to loss of SIRT1 protein or a reduction in intracellular NAD+ levels. The protein reduction is associated with hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in mammalian systems (20Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T.

Our recent study of liver-specific JNK1 knock-out mice suggests that JNK1 activity is required for protection of liver from hepatic steatosis (31Sabio G. Cavanagh-Kyros J. Ko H.J. Jung D.Y. Gray S.

The study has raised a concern about the exact role of JNK1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism in liver. It is unknown why JNK1 has opposite activities in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis. In the present study we investigated regulation of SIRT1 protein by JNK1 in cellular and animal models. We present evidence that JNK1 phosphorylates SIRT1 and induces SIRT1 activation, which is followed by ubiquitination and degradation of SIRT1. Persistent JNK1 activation leads to inhibition of SIRT1 activity through extensive protein degradation, which contributes to hepatic steatosis in obesity. The JNK1-SIRT1 pathway provides a new molecular mechanism for fatty liver in obesity. Male C57BL/6 (B6) mice were purchased at 4 weeks of age from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The global knock-out mice for JNK1-, JNK2-, and liver-specific knock-out mice for JNK1/2 were from Dr. Roger Davis' laboratory. Age- and gender-matched littermates were used as controls.

SIRT1+/− transgenic mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for 10 generations to obtain the C57BL/6 gene background. The heterozygous knock-out (KO) (SIRT1+/−) and wild type (WT) littermates were used in the study. All of the mice were housed in the animal facility in group of 4 mice per box with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and constant temperature (22–24 °C). The mice had free access to water and diet.

The cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin overnight before treatment with 200 nm insulin and 50 mm glucose. The JNK activator (anisomycin, ST-102), inhibitor (SP600125, EI305), and proteasome inhibitor (MG-132, PI102) were purchased from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The ERK inhibitor (PD98059, 513000) was purchased from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide (C-7698) was from Sigma. Body composition was measured using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as described elsewhere (33Gao Z. Wang Z. Zhang X. Butler A.A. Zuberi A. Gawronska-Kozak B. Lefevre M. York D.

The mouse was placed into a small tube individually and then examined with a Brucker model mq10 NMR analyzer (Brucker, Milton, ON, Canada). The fat and lean mass were measured within 1 min. Each measurement was made in triplicate for each mouse to get a mean value. Whole cell lysates were prepared by sonication in lysis buffer and used in Western blots as described elsewhere (34Gao Z.

Antibodies to β-actin (ab6276) and ubiquitin (ab122) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). To detect multiple signals from one membrane, the membrane was stripped with a stripping buffer. IP was carried out using whole cell lysates (400 μg of total protein), 2–4 μg of antibody, and 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described elsewhere. The kinase assay was conducted at room temperature for 30 min in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 5 μCi of [32P]ATP (34Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M.J. Ye J. J. Biol.

The product was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for autoradiography or immunoblotting. The recombinant JNK1 (#14-327) was purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA), and c-Jun fusion protein beads (#9811) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Expression vectors for JNK1, ERK1, and Akt were expressed in HEK293 cells through transient transfection. The plasmids for ERK1 and JNK1 were a gift from Dr. Daniel Hwang (Nutrition Department, University of California at Davis). The expression plasmid for mouse SIRT1 (pCruzHA SIRT1, 10962) was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) (35Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. J. Biol.

The SIRT1 Ala-46 mutant was made by substituting Ser-46 with alanine in the pCruzHA SIRT1 vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The Akt expression plasmid was from Dr. Bin-Hua Jiang (BMC Cancer Center, West Virginia University). Transient transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine as reported previously (36Gao Z. He Q. Peng B. Chiao P.J. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4540-4547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or electroporation with the Amaxa Nucleofector TM II (Lonza Inc. Allendale, NJ). Fresh tissues (liver) were collected and fixed in 4% buffered formalin solution (HT50-1-2; Sigma). Tissue slides were obtained through serial cross-section cutting at 8 μm in thickness and stained with a standard procedure. Triglycerides were extracted from 50 mg of liver tissues as described elsewhere (37Lin J. Yang R. Tarr P.T. Wu P.H. Handschin C. Li S. Yang W. Pei L. Uldry M. Tontonoz P. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2005; 120: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The extract (2 μl) was used to measure glycerol and TAG with a serum TAG determination kit (Sigma). SIRT1 deacetylase activity was measured with a SIRT1 fluorimetric activity assay/drug discovery kit (catalog #AK555, Biomol International LP). Nuclear extract protein (5 μg) was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 25 μm concentrations of the indicated fluorogenic acetylated peptide substrate. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 mm nicotinamide, and the deacetylation-dependent fluorescent signal was determined using a 360-nm excitation laser and measuring 460-nm emission on a fluorescence plate reader. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. All in vitro experiments were conducted at least three times. Student's t test was used in the statistical analysis with significance set at p ≤ 0.05. SIRT1 protein is regulated by insulin and glucose in the body. To understand the molecular mechanism, we examined SIRT1 protein in cells after insulin or glucose treatment. Insulin reduced SIRT1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Glucose exhibited a similar activity in the cells (Fig. 1B). We searched for a kinase that is activated in both conditions and then directed our focus on JNK1. JNK1 activity was increased by insulin or glucose as indicated by an increase in its phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B). Suppression of JNK1 activity by a chemical inhibitor (SP600125, SP) prevented SIRT1 reduction (Fig. 1C). ERK was also activated by insulin or glucose (data not shown), but ERK inhibition did not influence SIRT1 response to insulin (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that SIRT1 reduction is related to JNK1 activation. To test this possibility, SIRT1 was examined when JNK1 was specifically activated with a chemical activator (anisomycin) or by JNK1 overexpression. In both conditions, SIRT1 protein was reduced (Fig. 1, D and E). In the overexpression study, ERK or Akt1 was used in the control, and SIRT1 protein was not altered by these serine kinases (Fig. 1E). JNK has three major isoforms: JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3. In this study, JNK1 and JNK2 were compared in the regulation of SIRT1 protein. JNK3 was not included as it is mainly expressed in the brain. MEF cells of JNK1-KO and JNK2-KO were used to determine SIRT1 response to insulin. In WT cells, SIRT1 was reduced by insulin. The reduction was observed in JNK2-KO cells but not in JNK1-KO cells (Fig. 1F), suggesting that JNK1 is required for SIRT1 reduction. These data suggest that JNK1 activation by insulin or glucose leads to the reduction in SIRT1 protein. JNK1 is a serine kinase that phosphorylates several downstream proteins in the signaling pathway. It was not known if JNK phosphorylates SIRT1 when this project was started in 2007. We tested the kinase/substrate relationship for JNK and SIRT1. Protein-protein interaction was examined in cells using IP. SIRT1 protein was detected in IP product of JNK1, and JNK1 protein was found in IP product of SIRT1 (Fig. 2A). The protein interaction results provide a basis for the kinase/substrate relationship. In a kinase assay in vitro, recombinant JNK1 was used to phosphorylate SIRT1 protein in the presence of radiolabeled ATP. The phosphorylation was monitored by radioactivity in the SIRT1 protein. JNK1 induced a strong phosphorylation in the SIRT1 protein (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation was not observed in the controls, in which JNK1 was not included in the reaction. The JNK1 target motif is characterized by Ser-Pro (SP) residues in the amino acid sequence (38Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar). According to this feature, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of SIRT1 and identified several SP sites (Fig. 2C). There are four SP sites in the mouse and five in the human SIRT1 proteins. The amino acid sequences at some sites are similar to those predicated from mass spectrometry (39Sasaki T. Maier B. Koclega K.D. Chruszcz M. Gluba W. Stukenberg P.T. Minor W. Scrable H. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this study we focused on Ser-46 in the mouse SIRT1 (Ser-47 in human), as the phospho-antibody to this serine residue is available in our laboratory. Mouse SIRT1 was used mostly in this study for JNK1-SIRT1 interaction. Human SIRT1 was tested with a peptide containing the Ser-47 site. In the kinase assay, the human WT peptide (Ser-47) was phosphorylated by JNK1 (Fig. 2D). When the Ser-47 was replaced with alanine (Ala-47), the SIRT1 peptide was no long phosphorylated by JNK1 (Fig. 2D). The data suggest that JNK1 phosphorylates SIRT1 at serine residues in both mouse and human. The SIRT1 phosphorylation was tested in cells using a phospho-specific antibody, which was raised against phospho-serine 47 of human SIRT1. With this antibody, we observed SIRT1 phosphorylation in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2E). The phosphorylation was detected at Ser-46 in mouse SIRT1 and was inhibited in cells treated with JNK inhibitor (Fig. 2E). When the experiment was repeated in human 293 cells, the phosphorylation was detected in human SIRT1 (data not shown). The association of phosphorylation and protein reduction suggests that SIRT1 protein may undergo degradation in cells in response to JNK1 activation. To this possibility, we compared WT (Ser-46) and mutant (Ala-46) SIRT1 recombinant protein in response to glucose. The proteins were hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged and expressed in cells through a transient transfection. The wild type (Ser-46) was reduced at 120 min, but the mutant protein (Ala-46) was not reduced in cells treated with glucose (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that SIRT1 serine phosphorylation is required for SIRT1 protein reduction. Phosphorylation-induced protein reduction is often a result of ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation. It is not known if SIRT1 protein is subjected to modification by ubiquitination. To address this issue, we examined SIRT1 ubiquitination using a FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (Ub) in this study. The recombinant proteins for ubiquitin and SIRT1 were expressed together in a transient transfection. SIRT1 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody. Ubiquitination was detected with a FLAG antibody in the IP product. The result shows that SIRT1 was ubiquitinated in the basal condition, and the modification was further increased upon JNK1 activation (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that ubiquitination is induced by phosphorylation of SIRT1. An increase in ubiquitination usually induces protein degradation by the proteasome. To test this possibility, we used the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Pretreatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor prevented SIRT1 protein reduction upon insulin-treatment (Fig. 3B). The inhibition was not a result of blockade of the insulin signaling pathway. The pathway was normal, as insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation was not altered by MG132 (Fig. 3B). The data suggest that SIRT1 ubiquitination is followed by proteasome-mediated protein degradation. To exclude protein synthesis in the SIRT1 reduction, we pretreated cells with cycloheximide, which inhibits protein biosynthesis and activates JNK1 at the same time. In this model SIRT1 exhibited a half-life of 3 h in WT cells (Fig. 3C). In JNK1-KO cells, SIRT1 protein remained unchanged up to 8 h (Fig. 3C), suggesting that SIRT1 degradation, not protein synthesis, contributes to SIRT1 reduction in response to JNK1-mediated phosphorylation. These data provide another line of evidence that JNK1 reduces SIRT1 through protein degradation. JNK1 uses this mechanism to regulate SIRT1 protein abundance. To understand the biological significance of JNK1-SIRT1 interaction, we examined SIRT1 protein in the liver of diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. In this model, blood insulin is increased result in hyperinsulinemia. The liver was examined as it is exposed to the highest level of insulin in the body under obese conditions. Insulin is secreted from β-cells in the pancreas and delivered to the liver by the portal vein. In the obese mice SIRT1 protein was reduced, and JNK1 activity was elevated in the liver (Fig. 4A). SIRT1 reduction was associated with an increase in Ser-46 phosphorylation. In the liver, hepatic steatosis is enhanced as indicated by the elevated triglyceride content (Fig. 4B). Obesity is indicated by the gain in body weight and body fat content in the DIO mice (Fig. 4, C and D). These data suggest that the SIRT1 reduction is associated with JNK1 activation and hepatic steatosis in obese mice. SIRT1 activity is required for protection of liver from steatosis as reported for the pharmacological activator of SIRT1 (10Baur J.A. Pearson K.J. Price N.L. Jamieson H.A. Lerin C. Kalra A.

To understand the JNK1-SIRT1 pathway in the pathogenesis of fatty liver, we compared SIRT1+/− and WT mice in hepatic steatosis. On a HFD, WT mice developed the steatosis as indicated by liver morphology and histology (Fig. 4E). In SIRT1+/− mice, the steatosis was enhanced with a dramatic gain in liver size and lipid droplets in hepatocytes (Fig. 4E). The triglyceride content was increased in liver by 25% over WT (Fig. 4F). The SIRT1-deficient mice had a 10% increase in body weight and a 14% increase in body fat content (Fig. 4, G and H). The genetic model provides in vivo evidence for the JNK1-SIRT1 pathway in the pathogenesis of fatty liver. JNK1-KO and WT mice were compared for SIRT1 protein in the liver to test the JNK1 activity in vivo. The study was conducted in the mice on HFD. In the JNK1-KO mice, JNK1 was gone, and SIRT1 was significantly higher in liver (Fig. 5A). Liver did not gain as much weight as in the WT mice (Fig. 5B). The hepatocytes did not exhibit as many lipid droplets as observed in the WT mice (Fig. 5B)"

This has been formalized by the Lockhart equation, which can be derived from the physical laws of the deformation of viscoelastic materials. However, the experimental evidence for such a direct correlation between growth rate and turgor is inconclusive. This has led to challenges of the Lockhart model. We model the oscillatory growth of pollen tubes to investigate this relationship. We couple the Lockhart equation to the dynamical equations for the change in material properties. We find that the correct implementation of the Lockhart equation within a feedback loop leading to low amplitude oscillatory growth predicts that in this system changes in the global turgor do not influence the average growth rate in a linear manner, consistent with experimental observations. An analytic analysis of our model demonstrates in which regime the average growth rate becomes uncorrelated from the turgor pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2158561340,"The interaction between Ca2+ sensors STIM1 and STIM2 and Ca2+ channel-forming protein ORAI1 is a crucial element of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in non-excitable cells. However, the molecular mechanism of SOCE in neurons remains unclear. We addressed this issue by establishing the presence and function of STIM proteins. Real-time polymerase chain reaction from cortical neurons showed that these cells contain significant amounts of Stim1 and Stim2 mRNA. Thapsigargin (TG) treatment increased the amount of both endogenous STIM proteins in neuronal membrane fractions. The number of YFP-STIM1/ORAI1 and YFP-STIM2/ORAI1 complexes was also enhanced by such treatment. The differences observed in the number of STIM1 and STIM2 complexes under SOCE conditions and the differential sensitivity to SOCE inhibitors suggest their distinct roles. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) store depletion by TG enhanced intracellular Ca2+ levels in loaded with Fura-2 neurons transfected with YFP-STIM1 and ORAI1, but not with YFP-STIM2 and ORAI1, which correlated well with the number of complexes formed. Moreover, the SOCE inhibitors ML-9 and 2-APB reduced Ca2+ influx in neurons expressing YFP-STIM1/ORAI1 but produced no effect in cells transfected with YFP-STIM2/ORAI1. Moreover, in neurons transfected with YFP-STIM2/ORAI1, the increase in constitutive calcium entry was greater than with YFP-STIM1/ORAI1. Our data indicate that both STIM proteins are involved in calcium homeostasis in neurons. STIM1 mainly activates SOCE, whereas STIM2 regulates resting Ca2+ levels in the ER and Ca2+ leakage with the additional involvement of STIM1."
https://openalex.org/W2099007586,"Nitrogen is a key regulator of primary productivity in many terrestrial ecosystems. Historically, only inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) and L-amino acids have been considered to be important to the N nutrition of terrestrial plants. However, amino acids are also present in soil as small peptides and in D-enantiomeric form. We compared the uptake and assimilation of N as free amino acid and short homopeptide in both L- and D-enantiomeric forms. Sterile roots of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants were exposed to solutions containing either 14C-labelled L-alanine, D-alanine, L-trialanine or D-trialanine at a concentration likely to be found in soil solution (10 µM). Over 5 h, plants took up L-alanine, D-alanine and L-trialanine at rates of 0.9±0.3, 0.3±0.06 and 0.3±0.04 µmol g−1 root DW h−1, respectively. The rate of N uptake as L-trialanine was the same as that as L-alanine. Plants lost ca.60% of amino acid C taken up in respiration, regardless of the enantiomeric form, but more (ca.80%) of the L-trialanine C than amino acid C was respired. When supplied in solutions of mixed N form, N uptake as D-alanine was ca.5-fold faster than as NO3-, but slower than as L-alanine, L-trialanine and NH4+. Plants showed a limited capacity to take up D-trialanine (0.04±0.03 µmol g−1 root DW h−1), but did not appear to be able to metabolise it. We conclude that wheat is able to utilise L-peptide and D-amino acid N at rates comparable to those of N forms of acknowledged importance, namely L-amino acids and inorganic N. This is true even when solutes are supplied at realistic soil concentrations and when other forms of N are available. We suggest that it may be necessary to reconsider which forms of soil N are important in the terrestrial N cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2064067002,"GPER is a Gs-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor that has been linked to specific estrogen binding and signaling activities that are manifested by plasma membrane-associated enzymes. However, in many cell types, GPER is predominately localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and only minor amounts of receptor are detectable at the cell surface, an observation that has caused controversy regarding its role as a plasma membrane estrogen receptor. Here, we show that GPER constitutively buds intracellularly into EEA-1+ endosomes from clathrin-coated pits. Nonvisual arrestins-2/-3 do not co-localize with GPER, and expression of arrestin-2 dominant-negative mutants lacking clathrin- or β-adaptin interaction sites fails to block GPER internalization suggesting that arrestins are not involved in GPER endocytosis.

Lagerström M.C. Lundin L.G. Schiöth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Upon binding their cognate ligands, activated G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) undergo a series of adaptive changes that effectively prevent excessive receptor signaling. This process, termed receptor desensitization is typically associated with receptor phosphorylation by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases and the recruitment of β-arrestins, which not only facilitate receptor uncoupling from G-proteins, but promote recruitment of activated receptors into clathrin-coated pits via interaction of arrestin with clathrin and the clathrin adaptor, AP2. Subsequent recruitment of dynamin, or other small GTPases, to the receptor-enriched, clathrin-coated pits results in the scission of newly formed intracellular vesicles or endosomes (2Marchese A.

Thus, internalization, recycling, and degradation of GPCRs collectively serve as a mechanism to mediate receptor desensitization, resensitization, and down-regulation, thereby, contributing to the spatiotemporal regulation of GPCR-promoted cell signaling. A number of studies suggest that GPER functions as a unique estrogen receptor that promotes rapid estrogen action and is associated with female reproductive cancers (16Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A.

Moreover, subcellular fractionation studies also support the plasma membrane as a site of GPER action, and stimulation of GPER-expressing HEK-293 cells with E2 induced sequestration of GPR30 into clathrin-coated vesicles (22Filardo E.J.

A major concern with the proposed function of GPER as a plasma membrane receptor is the fact that the protein largely concentrates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Likewise, binding sites for synthetic estrogen fluorophores are not observed at the cell surface but are concentrated in the ER (26Revankar C.M. Cimino D.F. Sklar L.A. Arterburn J.B. Prossnitz E.R.

Steroids. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting that GPER is not restricted from the plasma membrane. Here, we have further explored the endocytic fate of GPER in HEK-293 cells and compared its endocytic trafficking pattern to other GPCRs, which either recycle (β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR)) or are sorted to lysosomes for proteolytic degradation (CXCR4). Our results show that, although GPER, CXCR4, and β1AR each enter cells via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, they ultimately have distinct endocytic fates. GPER endocytosis does not involve recruitment of arrestins. Contrary to the rapid recycling route employed by β1AR and rapid lysosomal degradation route of CXCR4, GPER accumulates in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and suffers degradation through an ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Human embryonal kidney 293 cells (HEK-293) were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HEK-293 cells that stably express hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged GPER (HA-GPER) or HA-β1-adrenergic receptor (HA-β1AR) were previously described (22Filardo E.J. Quinn J. Pang Y. Graeber C. Shaw S. Dong J. Thomas P. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 3236-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). HEK-293 (HA-CXCR4) cells were generated in a similar manner by transfection and drug selection as described previously (22Filardo E.J. Quinn J. Pang Y. Graeber C. Shaw S. Dong J. Thomas P. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 3236-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) using HA-CXCR4 plasmid DNA kindly provided by Jeffrey Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University). All cells were grown at 37 °C in phenol red-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Monoclonal GPER antibody, 2F2, was generated as described previously (22Filardo E.J. Quinn J. Pang Y. Graeber C. Shaw S. Dong J. Thomas P. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 3236-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Fab fragments of mouse HA antibody (Covance) were produced by limited papain digestion and isolated as the non-bound fraction on protein A-immunoabsorbent beads using a commercial kit (Thermo Scientific). Other commercial antibodies included: rabbit anti-HA epitope monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, MA, at 1:1000), mouse anti-HA (Covance, at 1:200), mouse anti-EEA1 (IgG1, at 1:500), mouse anti-LAMP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, IgG1, at 1:40), sheep anti-TGN46 (AbD Serotec, 1:1000), mouse anti-Rab11 (1:200), mouse anti-rab-7 (Cell Signaling, 1:200), rabbit anti-calnexin (Stressgen Bioreagents, 1:200), rabbit anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, at 1:200), goat anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 594 and anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488 (1:1000, Molecular Probes), donkey anti-sheep Alexa-Fluor 647 and 555 (1:1000, Molecular Probes), and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 555 and anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488 (1:1000) and 647 (1:500) (Molecular Probes). Molecular clones for HA-CXCR4, arrestin-2-GFP, and arrestin-3-GFP were kindly provided by Jeffrey Benovic. Plasmids encoding amino acids 319–418 of bovine arrestin 2, or mutants of the same protein lacking the clathrin (ΔLIELD) or β-adaptin (F391A) interaction sites of bovine arrestin-2, were also provided by Dr. Benovic (31Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30760-30768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips (0.3 × 106/35-mm dish) and washed with serum-free medium several times before use. When needed, cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding arrestin-2/-3-GFP or arrestin-2 mutants using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were chilled in cold medium and then incubated with rabbit or mouse anti-HA antibody/normal rabbit IgG alone or with both anti-HA antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated transferrin (50 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) in ice-cold, serum-free medium for 25 min. Cells were washed with cold serum-free medium to remove excess antibody or transferrin and then treated in medium prewarmed to 37 °C with vehicle or respective agonists and/or reagents (cycloheximide, 36 μm; MG132, 10 μm; brefeldin A (BFA), 2.5 μg/ml; chloroquine, 100 μm) and incubated at 37 °C for various times. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then processed for immunofluorescence or ELISA analysis. Fixed cells were permeabilized in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% BSA, and 3% normal goat or donkey serum in PBS (pH 7.4) or incubated in the blocking buffer without Triton X-100 for 20–30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated for 1 h in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Unbound primary antibody was removed by washing in PBS. Cells were incubated at room temperature in secondary antibodies for 1 h, washed in PBS, and mounted in anti-quench mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence images were visualized with an Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with a Nikon Plan Fluor 100 × 0.5–1.3 oil iris with differential interference contrast and epifluorescence capabilities using a Qimaging Retiga 2000R digital camera and Nikon imaging software (NIS-Elements-BR 3.0), or with the Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope with ZEN 2009 software (Zeiss). The figures were processed with brightness/contrast adjustment using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe). Cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plates (1 × 106/well) and prelabeled with rabbit anti-HA antibody as described above. After removal of excess antibody, cells were incubated with vehicle or E2 (1 nm) or Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, 25 ng/ml) for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min at 37 °C and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in blocking buffer containing 3% BSA and 3% normal donkey serum in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells fixed at the 0 time point (representing total surface receptors) were not permeabilized and were incubated only with the blocking buffer. After several rinses with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:8000) diluted in 3% BSA in PBS, and then incubated with the HRP substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of hydrochloric acid. The absorbance of the reaction product was then measured at 450 nm. The nonspecific background binding of antibody to cells was determined by omission of primary antibody. HA-GPER or HA-β1AR cells were prelabeled with HA antibody as described above. Cells were then directly harvested (0 min) or incubated at 37 °C with cycloheximide (36 μm) alone or together with chloroquine (100 μm) or MG132 (10 μm) or BFA (2.5 μg/ml) for various time periods. Cells were harvested and solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay-buffered detergent supplemented with protease inhibitors as described previously (16Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Bland K.I. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insoluble proteins were clarified from detergent lysates by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 25 min. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by mixing 20–30 μg of detergent-soluble protein in 2× reducing Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) for 10 min at room temperature prior to gel loading. The remainder of lysate was incubated with protein A-coupled agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Immunoabsorbed proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 2 min. Protein A beads containing surface-labeled receptor were washed six times with lysis buffer, and then captured proteins were eluted from the beads using 1× reducing Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE according to standard procedures. The same amount of proteins, determined using a BCA protein assay, was loaded into the gel. Equal protein loading was also verified by staining of the transferred nitrocellulose membrane using red reversible dye Ponceau S. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T buffer for 30 min, the transferred membrane was incubated overnight in primary antibody, diluted in 3% or 5% BSA in TBS-T buffer, at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce), and then treated with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal, Pierce) and exposed on film (Kodak). To investigate the molecular events that regulate GPER internalization, and to determine its endocytic fate, the widely adopted scheme of tracking cell surface receptors using antibodies specific for amino-terminally located epitope tags was employed (32Benovic J.L. Regulation of G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Function and Expression. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2000: 4-13Google Scholar). To this end, live HEK-293 cells stably expressing HA-GPER were surface-labeled at 4 °C with HA-specific rabbit antibodies. For controls, normal HEK-293 cells or HEK-293 cells expressing HA-GPER were surface-labeled with HA antibody or normal rabbit IgG, respectively. Cells were then warmed to 37 °C for various lengths of time in the presence of E2. After treatment, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2F2 specific for the C terminus of GPER. Surface and intracellular receptors were distinguished using species-specific fluorescent antibodies using epifluorescence analysis. In control experiments, no immunoreactivity was observed in normal HEK-293 cells either at the surface or in the cytoplasm. Similarly, no immunoreactivity was observed at the surface of HA-GPER cells (Fig. 1, A and B). mAb 2F2 showed no immunoreactivity in permeabilized control HA-β1AR cells (data not shown). These results suggest no nonspecific binding in HA-GPER HEK-293 cells for both HA and 2F2 antibodies. Intracellular GPER was abundantly expressed and concentrated in a perinuclear pattern in permeabilized cells that were immunostained with mAb 2F2 (Fig. 1, B–E). Coincident staining of HA antibodies applied to live cells and mAb 2F2 applied post fixation and permeabilization was observed at the surface prior to warming (Fig. 1C) and intracellularly after warming (Fig. 1, D and E) suggesting that the recombinant HA-GPER protein was intact during trafficking. HA antibody-bound immunoreactivity was not intracellularly detected in the cells fixed at 0 min (Fig. 1C). This suggests that dissociation of HA antibodies from surface receptors and subsequent binding to intracellular GPER during staining procedures employed in this study did not occur. At early time points (<15 min) as represented in Fig. 1D, the bulk of HA-GPER was observed in vesicles near the inner face of the plasma membrane, whereas at later times (≥30 min) GPER concentrated in a large compartment in close proximity to the nucleus (Fig. 1E). These observations support the idea that intact HA-GPER protein is measured during GPER internalization. Many 7TMRs, including CXCR4 (33Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Michejda C.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, the capacity of GPER and CXCR4 to internalize in the absence of their cognate ligands was tested (Fig. 2). For these experiments, HA-GPER cells or HA-CXCR4 cells were prelabeled in the cold with HA antibodies and then cells were exposed to vehicle or their respective ligands, E2 or SDF-1. Cells were fixed at various time intervals and evaluated by immunofluorescence. The majority of surface-labeled GPER redistributed to the intracellular compartment with a similar endocytic fate concentrated in a perinuclear patch whether or not agonist was added (Fig. 2A). Quantitative ELISA assay further revealed that GPER disappeared from the cell surface in the absence of E2 at 15, 30, and 60 min (53.8 ± 6.0%, 65.2 ± 6.3%, and 72.6 ± 7.9%, respectively). Similar results were obtained at these time points in the presence of E2 (56.4 ± 4.9%, 66.7 ± 3.1%, and 70.4 ± 13.6%, respectively) (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that GPER undergoes constitutive endocytosis. CXCR4 undergoes either constitutive or agonist-dependent endocytosis in different cell types (34Zhang Y. Foudi A. Geay J.F.

https://openalex.org/W2022452013,"Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide accumulation in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely associated with increased nerve cell death. However, many cells survive and it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in this survival response. Recent studies have shown that an anti-apoptotic mechanism in cancer cells is mediated by aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. One of the major regulators of aerobic glycolysis is pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), an enzyme which represses mitochondrial respiration and forces the cell to rely heavily on glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that the spatial distribution of aerobic glycolysis in the brains of AD patients strongly correlates with Aβ deposition. Interestingly, clonal nerve cell lines selected for resistance to Aβ exhibit increased glycolysis as a result of activation of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1. Here we show that Aβ resistant nerve cell lines upregulate Warburg effect enzymes in a manner reminiscent of cancer cells. In particular, Aβ resistant nerve cell lines showed elevated PDK1 expression in addition to an increase in lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) activity and lactate production when compared to control cells. In addition, mitochondrial derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) were markedly diminished in resistant but not sensitive cells. Chemically or genetically inhibiting LDHA or PDK1 re-sensitized resistant cells to Aβ toxicity. These findings suggest that the Warburg effect may contribute to apoptotic-resistance mechanisms in the surviving neurons of the AD brain. Loss of the adaptive advantage afforded by aerobic glycolysis may exacerbate the pathophysiological processes associated with AD."
https://openalex.org/W2079798818,"We propose that human cognition consists of cascading cycles of recurring brain events. Each cognitive cycle senses the current situation, interprets it with reference to ongoing goals, and then selects an internal or external action in response. While most aspects of the cognitive cycle are unconscious, each cycle also yields a momentary “ignition” of conscious broadcasting. Neuroscientists have independently proposed ideas similar to the cognitive cycle, the fundamental hypothesis of the LIDA model of cognition. High-level cognition, such as deliberation, planning, etc., is typically enabled by multiple cognitive cycles. In this paper we describe a timing model LIDA's cognitive cycle. Based on empirical and simulation data we propose that an initial phase of perception (stimulus recognition) occurs 80–100 ms from stimulus onset under optimal conditions. It is followed by a conscious episode (broadcast) 200–280 ms after stimulus onset, and an action selection phase 60–110 ms from the start of the conscious phase. One cognitive cycle would therefore take 260–390 ms. The LIDA timing model is consistent with brain evidence indicating a fundamental role for a theta-gamma wave, spreading forward from sensory cortices to rostral corticothalamic regions. This posteriofrontal theta-gamma wave may be experienced as a conscious perceptual event starting at 200–280 ms post stimulus. The action selection component of the cycle is proposed to involve frontal, striatal and cerebellar regions. Thus the cycle is inherently recurrent, as the anatomy of the thalamocortical system suggests. The LIDA model fits a large body of cognitive and neuroscientific evidence. Finally, we describe two LIDA-based software agents: the LIDA Reaction Time agent that simulates human performance in a simple reaction time task, and the LIDA Allport agent which models phenomenal simultaneity within timeframes comparable to human subjects. While there are many models of reaction time performance, these results fall naturally out of a biologically and computationally plausible cognitive architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2011909379,"Drosophila melanogaster is emerging as a powerful model system for the study of cardiac disease. Establishing peptide and protein maps of the Drosophila heart is central to implementation of protein network studies that will allow us to assess the hallmarks of Drosophila heart pathogenesis and gauge the degree of conservation with human disease mechanisms on a systems level. Using a gel-LC-MS/MS approach, we identified 1228 protein clusters from 145 dissected adult fly hearts. Contractile, cytostructural and mitochondrial proteins were most abundant consistent with electron micrographs of the Drosophila cardiac tube. Functional/Ontological enrichment analysis further showed that proteins involved in glycolysis, Ca2+-binding, redox, and G-protein signaling, among other processes, are also over-represented. Comparison with a mouse heart proteome revealed conservation at the level of molecular function, biological processes and cellular components. The subsisting peptidome encompassed 5169 distinct heart-associated peptides, of which 1293 (25%) had not been identified in a recent Drosophila peptide compendium. PeptideClassifier analysis was further used to map peptides to specific gene-models. 1872 peptides provide valuable information about protein isoform groups whereas a further 3112 uniquely identify specific protein isoforms and may be used as a heart-associated peptide resource for quantitative proteomic approaches based on multiple-reaction monitoring. In summary, identification of excitation-contraction protein landmarks, orthologues of proteins associated with cardiovascular defects, and conservation of protein ontologies, provides testimony to the heart-like character of the Drosophila cardiac tube and to the utility of proteomics as a complement to the power of genetics in this growing model of human heart disease."

The challenge has been to find the stem cells or progenitors that are responsible for tissue renewal and repair.

https://openalex.org/W2079888880,"Major efforts have been invested in the identification of cancer biomarkers in plasma, but the extraordinary dynamic range in protein composition, and the dilution of disease specific proteins make discovery in plasma challenging. Focus is shifting towards using proximal fluids for biomarker discovery, but methods to verify the isolated sample's origin are missing. We therefore aimed to develop a technique to search for potential candidate proteins in the proximal proteome, i.e. in the tumor interstitial fluid, since the biomarkers are likely to be excreted or derive from the tumor microenvironment. Since tumor interstitial fluid is not readily accessible, we applied a centrifugation method developed in experimental animals and asked whether interstitial fluid from human tissue could be isolated, using ovarian carcinoma as a model. Exposure of extirpated tissue to 106 g enabled tumor fluid isolation. The fluid was verified as interstitial by an isolated fluid:plasma ratio not significantly different from 1.0 for both creatinine and Na+, two substances predominantly present in interstitial fluid. The isolated fluid had a colloid osmotic pressure 79% of that in plasma, suggesting that there was some sieving of proteins at the capillary wall. Using a proteomic approach we detected 769 proteins in the isolated interstitial fluid, sixfold higher than in patient plasma. We conclude that the isolated fluid represents undiluted interstitial fluid and thus a subproteome with high concentration of locally secreted proteins that may be detected in plasma for diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic monitoring by targeted methods."
https://openalex.org/W2151118402,"This study examines the genes coding for enzymes involved in bovine milk oligosaccharide metabolism by comparing the oligosaccharide profiles with the expressions of glycosylation-related genes. Fresh milk samples (n = 32) were collected from four Holstein and Jersey cows at days 1, 15, 90 and 250 of lactation and free milk oligosaccharide profiles were analyzed. RNA was extracted from milk somatic cells at days 15 and 250 of lactation (n = 12) and gene expression analysis was conducted by RNA-Sequencing. A list was created of 121 glycosylation-related genes involved in oligosaccharide metabolism pathways in bovine by analyzing the oligosaccharide profiles and performing an extensive literature search. No significant differences were observed in either oligosaccharide profiles or expressions of glycosylation-related genes between Holstein and Jersey cows. The highest concentrations of free oligosaccharides were observed in the colostrum samples and a sharp decrease was observed in the concentration of free oligosaccharides on day 15, followed by progressive decrease on days 90 and 250. Ninety-two glycosylation-related genes were expressed in milk somatic cells. Most of these genes exhibited higher expression in day 250 samples indicating increases in net glycosylation-related metabolism in spite of decreases in free milk oligosaccharides in late lactation milk. Even though fucosylated free oligosaccharides were not identified, gene expression indicated the likely presence of fucosylated oligosaccharides in bovine milk. Fucosidase genes were expressed in milk and a possible explanation for not detecting fucosylated free oligosaccharides is the degradation of large fucosylated free oligosaccharides by the fucosidases. Detailed characterization of enzymes encoded by the 92 glycosylation-related genes identified in this study will provide the basic knowledge for metabolic network analysis of oligosaccharides in mammalian milk. These candidate genes will guide the design of a targeted breeding strategy to optimize the content of beneficial oligosaccharides in bovine milk."
https://openalex.org/W2039750212,"Spreading depression (SD) is thought to cause migraine aura, and perhaps migraine, and includes a transient loss of synaptic activity preceded and followed by increased neuronal excitability. Activated microglia influence neuronal activity and play an important role in homeostatic synaptic scaling via release of cytokines. Furthermore, enhanced neuronal function activates microglia to not only secrete cytokines but also to increase the motility of their branches, with somata remaining stationary. While SD also increases the release of cytokines from microglia, the effects on microglial movement from its synaptic activity fluctuations are unknown. Accordingly, we used time-lapse imaging of rat hippocampal slice cultures to probe for microglial movement associated with SD. We observed that in uninjured brain whole microglial cells moved. The movements were well described by the type of Lévy flight known to be associated with an optimal search pattern. Hours after SD, when synaptic activity rose, microglial cell movement was significantly increased. To test how synaptic activity influenced microglial movement, we enhanced neuronal activity with chemical long-term potentiation or LPS and abolished it with TTX. We found that microglial movement was significantly decreased by enhanced neuronal activity and significantly increased by activity blockade. Finally, application of glutamate and ATP to mimic restoration of synaptic activity in the presence of TTX stopped microglial movement that was otherwise seen with TTX. Thus, synaptic activity retains microglial cells in place and an absence of synaptic activity sends them off to influence wider expanses of brain. Perhaps increased microglial movements after SD are a long-lasting, and thus maladaptive, response in which these cells increase neuronal activity via contact or paracrine signaling, which results in increased susceptibility of larger brain areas to SD. If true, then targeting mechanisms that retard activity-dependent microglial Lévy flights may be a novel means to reduce susceptibility to migraine."
https://openalex.org/W2065743337,"Metallothioneins (MT) are small proteins involved in heavy metal detoxification and protection against oxidative stress and cancer. The mammalian MT family originated through a series of duplication events which generated four major genes (MT1 to MT4). MT1 and MT2 encode for ubiquitous proteins, while MT3 and MT4 evolved to accomplish specific roles in brain and epithelium, respectively. Herein, phylogenetic, transcriptional and polymorphic analyses are carried out to expose gains, losses and diversification of functions that characterize the evolutionary history of the MT family. The phylogenetic analyses show that all four major genes originated through a single duplication event prior to the radiation of mammals. Further expansion of the MT1 gene has occurred in the primate lineage reaching in humans a total of 13 paralogs, five of which are pseudogenes. In humans, the reading frame of all five MT1 pseudogenes is reconstructed by sequence homology with a functional duplicate revealing that loss of invariant cysteines is the most frequent event accounting for pseudogeneisation. Expression analyses based on EST counts and RT-PCR experiments show that, as for MT1 and MT2, human MT3 is also ubiquitously expressed while MT4 transcripts are present in brain, testes, esophagus and mainly in thymus. Polymorphic variation reveals two deleterious mutations (Cys30Tyr and Arg31Trp) in MT4 with frequencies reaching about 30% in African and Asian populations suggesting the gene is inactive in some individuals and physiological compensation for its loss must arise from a functional equivalent. Altogether our findings provide novel data on the evolution and diversification of MT gene duplicates, a valuable resource for understanding the vast set of biological processes in which these proteins are involved."
https://openalex.org/W2043820865,"Background While the role of canonical (β-catenin-mediated) Wnt signaling in hematolymphopoiesis has been studied extensively, little is known of the potential importance of non-canonical Wnt signals in hematopoietic cells. Wnt4 is one of the Wnt proteins that can elicit non-canonical pathways. We have previously shown that retroviral overexpression of Wnt4 by hematopoietic cells increased thymic cellularity as well as the frequency of early thymic progenitors and bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). However, the molecular pathways responsible for its effect in HPCs are not known. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report that Wnt4 stimulation resulted in the activation of the small GTPase Rac1 as well as Jnk kinases in an HPC cell line. Jnk activity was necessary, while β-catenin was dispensable, for the Wnt4-mediated expansion of primary fetal liver HPCs in culture. Furthermore, Jnk2-deficient and Wnt4 hemizygous mice presented lower numbers of HPCs in their bone marrow, and Jnk2-deficient HPCs showed increased rates of apoptosis. Wnt4 also improved HPC activity in a competitive reconstitution model in a cell-autonomous, Jnk2-dependent manner. Lastly, we identified Fz6 as a receptor for Wnt4 in immature HPCs and showed that the absence of Wnt4 led to a decreased expression of four polarity complex genes. Conclusions/Significance Our results establish a functional role for non-canonical Wnt signaling in hematopoiesis through a pathway involving Wnt4, Fz6, Rac1 and Jnk kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1972043513,"There are few diagnostic tools for chronic musculoskeletal pain as structural imaging methods seldom reveal pathological alterations. This is especially true for Whiplash Associated Disorder, for which physical signs of persistent injuries to the neck have yet to be established. Here, we sought to visualize inflammatory processes in the neck region by means Positron Emission Tomography using the tracer (11)C-D-deprenyl, a potential marker for inflammation. Twenty-two patients with enduring pain after a rear impact car accident (Whiplash Associated Disorder grade II) and 14 healthy controls were investigated. Patients displayed significantly elevated tracer uptake in the neck, particularly in regions around the spineous process of the second cervical vertebra. This suggests that whiplash patients have signs of local persistent peripheral tissue inflammation, which may potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker. The present investigation demonstrates that painful processes in the periphery can be objectively visualized and quantified with PET and that (11)C-D-deprenyl is a promising tracer for these purposes."

Linear and logistic regression were used to determine associations between blood Ca, Mg, and the Ca/Mg ratio across controls and case groups while adjusting for potential confounding factors.Serum Mg levels were significantly lower, while the Ca/Mg ratio was significantly higher, among high-grade cases vs. controls (p = 0.04, p = 0.01, respectively). Elevated Mg was significantly associated with a lower risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR = 0.26 (0.09, 0.85)). An elevated Ca/Mg ratio was also associated with an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR = 2.81 (1.24, 6.36) adjusted for serum Ca and Mg). In contrast, blood Ca levels were not significantly associated with prostate cancer or PIN.Mg, Ca, or Ca/Mg levels were not associated with low-grade cancer, PIN, PSA levels, prostate volume, or BPH treatment.Low blood Mg levels and a high Ca/Mg ratio were significantly associated with high-grade prostate cancer. These findings suggest Mg affects prostate cancer risk perhaps through interacting with Ca."
https://openalex.org/W1991622705,"Background Statins are drugs that are used to lower plasma cholesterol levels. Recently, contradictory claims have been made about possible additional effects of statins on progression of a variety of inflammatory disorders, including infections. We therefore examined the clinical course of patients admitted to hospital with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), who were or weren't taking statins at time of admission. Methods A retrospective case-control study was performed using the United Kingdom Influenza Clinical Information Network (FLU-CIN) database, containing detailed information on 1,520 patients admitted to participating hospitals with confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection between April 2009 and January 2010. We confined our analysis to those aged over 34 years. Univariate analysis was used to calculate unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (95%CI) for factors affecting progression to severe outcome (high dependency or intensive care unit level support) or death (cases); two multivariable logistic regression models were then established for age and sex, and for age, sex, obesity and “indication for statin” (e.g., heart disease or hypercholesterolaemia). Results We found no statistically significant association between pre-admission statin use and severity of outcome after adjustment for age and sex [adjusted OR: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.46–1.38); n = 571]. After adjustment for age, sex, obesity and indication for statin, the association between pre-admission statin use and severe outcome was not statistically significant; point estimates are compatible with a small but clinically significant protective effect of statin use [adjusted OR: 0.72 (95% CI: 0.38–1.33)]. Conclusions In this group of patients hospitalized with pandemic influenza, a significant beneficial effect of pre-admission statin use on the in-hospital course of illness was not identified. Although the database from which these observations are derived represents the largest available suitable UK hospital cohort, a larger study would be needed to confirm whether there is any benefit in this setting."

Four collybistin isoforms are expressed in brain neurons; CB2 and CB3 differ in the C terminus and occur with and without the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. We have found that in transfected hippocampal neurons, all collybistin isoforms (CB2SH3+, CB2SH3−, CB3SH3+, and CB3SH3−) target to and concentrate at GABAergic postsynapses. Moreover, in non-transfected neurons, collybistin concentrates at GABAergic synapses. Hippocampal neurons co-transfected with CB2SH3− and gephyrin developed very large postsynaptic gephyrin and GABAA receptor clusters (superclusters). This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Co-transfection with CB2SH3+ and gephyrin induced the formation of many (supernumerary) non-synaptic clusters. Transfection with gephyrin alone did not affect cluster number or size, but gephyrin potentiated the clustering effect of CB2SH3− or CB2SH3+. Co-transfection with CB2SH3− or CB2SH3+ and gephyrin did not affect the density of presynaptic GABAergic terminals contacting the transfected cells, indicating that collybistin is not synaptogenic. Nevertheless, the synaptic superclusters induced by CB2SH3− and gephyrin were accompanied by enlarged presynaptic GABAergic terminals. The enhanced clustering of gephyrin and GABAA receptors induced by collybistin isoforms was not accompanied by enhanced clustering of neuroligin 2. Moreover, during the development of GABAergic synapses, the clustering of gephyrin and GABAA receptors preceded the clustering of neuroligin 2.

In immunofluorescence of hippocampal (HP) cultures and in brain sections, the immunoreactivity specifically co-localized with that of gephyrin and γ2 GABAARs and was apposed to GABAergic presynaptic terminals. In transfected HEK293 cells, the Ab specifically reacted with NL2 but not with NL1 or NL3.

Briefly, neurons grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. The free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min. Permeabilization was done with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min followed by incubation with 5% normal donkey serum in 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. The coverslips were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a mixture of primary antibodies raised in different species, in the presence of 0.25% Triton X-100, followed by incubation with a mixture of species-specific secondary anti-IgG antibodies raised in donkey and conjugated to Texas Red (or AlexaFluor 594), FITC, or aminomethylcoumarin (or AlexaFluor 350) fluorophores in 0.25% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. The coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted on glass slides with Prolong Gold anti-fade mounting solution (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images of neuronal cultures were collected using a Nikon Plan Apo ×60/1.40 objective on a Nikon Eclipse T300 microscope with a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera, driven by IPLab 4.0 (Scanalytics, Rockville, MD) acquisition software. For qualitative analysis, images were processed and merged for color co-localization using Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA), adjusting brightness and contrast as described elsewhere (38Christie S.B. De Blas A.L. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 2355-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For quantification of gephyrin cluster density, two independent transfection experiments were performed for each plasmid combination. For quantification of γ2 cluster density, two independent transfections were made for each plasmid combination. All plasmid combinations were run in each experiment. For each plasmid combination, a total of 36 dendritic fields (50 μm2 each) from six randomly selected neurons (3 neurons/transfection, 3 dendrites/neuron, 2 dendritic fields/dendrite) were analyzed. The maximum intensities of the fluorophore channels were normalized, and the low intensity and diffuse non-clustered background fluorescence signal seen in the dendrites was subtracted. Cluster density was calculated as the number of clusters/100 μm2 of dendritic surface. Calculated values for density (mean ± S.E.) were obtained from 148–520 gephyrin clusters and 120–387 γ2 clusters for each plasmid combination. In these low density cultures, neurons have relatively low GABAergic innervation; thus, for each plasmid combination, all of the GAD+ puncta contacting the soma and dendrites of 12 transfected neurons (from four transfection experiments, 3 neurons/transfection, randomly selected) were counted, and the density of the GAD+ presynaptic boutons was calculated as the number of GAD+ boutons contacting each neuron. Calculated values for GAD+ density was from 458–600 GAD+ puncta for each plasmid combination. For the quantification of cluster size, all of the clusters in 18 dendrites from six randomly selected neurons were analyzed (3 dendrites/neuron). GAD+ puncta size was calculated from 12 neurons. The size of gephyrin and GABAAR clusters and GAD+ puncta was determined by IPLab 4.0 software. Images were segmented based on fluorescence intensity levels, to create a binary mask that maximized the number of clusters for analysis while minimizing the coalescence of individual clusters. Calculated values for size (mean ± S.E.) were obtained from 174–346 gephyrin clusters, 140–286 γ2 clusters, and 242–351 GAD+ puncta for each plasmid combination. Cultured high density HP neurons (10 DIV) were transfected with 2 μg total of various plasmids using the CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (BD Biosciences), following the instructions of the manufacturer. Three days later after transfection, cells were subjected to immunofluorescence as described above. We used an adaptation of the method described by Ortinski et al. (39Ortinski P.I. Lu C. Takagaki K. Fu Z. Vicini S. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 1718-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for cerebellar neurons. Cultured HP neurons were continuously perfused with extracellular solution, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 15 mm sucrose, 0.25 mg/liter phenol red, and 10 μm d-serine adjusted to pH 7.4, with osmolarity of 295–305 mosm. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries and filled with a solution containing 145 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgATP, 0.2 mm Na2GTP, and 5 mm EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. Pipette resistance was 4–6 megaohms. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were made at −60 mV with a PC-501A amplifier (Warner Instruments), and access resistance was monitored throughout the recordings. Currents were filtered at 1 kHz with an 8-pole low pass Bessel filter, digitized at 5–10 kHz using a computer equipped with a Digidata 1322A data acquisition board and pCLAMP9.2 software, both from Axon Instruments (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Spontaneous and miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents were identified using semiautomated threshold-based minidetection software (Mini Analysis, Synaptosoft Inc., Fort Lee, NJ) and were visually confirmed. Curve fitting and figure preparation were performed with Clampfit 9.2 software. Drugs were locally applied by means of a Y tube (40Murase K. Ryu P.D. Randic M. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 103: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The mIPSCs and mEPSCs were recorded in the presence of 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin and 5 μm NBQX + 1 μm strychnine (for mIPSCs) or 20 μm bicuculline (for mEPSCs). Amplitude and frequency of mIPSCs and mEPSCs of individual neurons were recorded. Values are the mean ± S.E. of 14 neurons transfected with cMyc-CB2SH3−, gephyrin, and EGFP and 15 neurons transfected with EGFP. There were nine different transfection experiments, using the cMyc-CB2SH3−, gephyrin, and EGFP combination and the EGFP control pairing them in each transfection experiment. The average number ± S.E. of mIPSCs recorded from each neuron was 179 ± 58 for neurons transfected with cMyc-CB2SH3−, gephyrin, and EGFP and 125 ± 42 for neurons transfected with EGFP. The corresponding average numbers of recorded mEPSCs per neuron were 174 ± 56 and 204 ± 51, respectively. We first investigated whether some or all CB isoforms expressed by neurons target to the GABAergic synapse. We transfected HP neurons with tagged CB2SH3−, CB2SH3+, CB3SH3−, or CB3SH3+. Transfection of HP neurons with hPEM2SH3+-EGFP, which is the human orthologue of rat CB3SH3+, showed that this EGFP-tagged CB isoform targeted to the GABAergic postsynaptic complex (Fig. 1, A1–A4), as shown by co-localization (arrowheads) with gephyrin clusters or γ2 GABAAR subunit (not shown), and apposition to GAD+ presynaptic terminals. Similarly, transfection with hPEM2SH3−-EGFP showed accumulation of EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 1, B1 and B2, arrowheads), co-localizing with gephyrin clusters (red) apposed to GAD+ terminals (not shown). We have previously shown that in these cultures, gephyrin and GABAAR γ2 clusters have over 90% co-localization (22Christie S.B. Miralles C.P. De Blas A.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 684-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also checked whether the CB2 isoforms target to synapse and whether the location of the tag, using cMyc-tagged CB2 at the N terminus (cMyc-CB2) compared with the EGFP-tagged C terminus of CB3 used above (hPEM2-EGFP), affected CB synaptic targeting. Transfected neurons with cMyc-CB2 isoforms showed very strong cMyc immunofluorescence, which hampered the visualization of synaptic cMyc immunofluorescence. Nevertheless, it was clear that cMyc-CB2SH3+ (Fig. 1C1) and cMyc-CB2SH3− (Fig. 1D1) accumulated (cMyc green fluorescence) at GABAergic synapses, as shown by apposition (arrowheads) to GAD+ presynaptic terminals (blue in Fig. 1C2) and co-localization (arrowhead) with GABAAR γ2 clusters (red in Fig. 1D2) or gephyrin clusters (not shown). Fig. 1D2 shows the presence of GABAAR γ2 clusters in dendrites of both transfected (green) and non-transfected neurons. These results indicate that (i) CB2SH3+, CB2SH3−, CB3SH3+, and CB3SH3− target to and concentrate at GABAergic synapses and (ii) the tagging at the N or C terminus does not affect the synaptic targeting and accumulation of the various CB isoforms. We also investigated if endogenous CB accumulates at GABAergic synapses in non-transfected HP neurons. Triple label immunofluorescence of HP cultures using two different CB antibodies to different epitopes, the Ms anti-SH3 mAb (Fig. 2, A1–A5) and the rabbit anti-CB3 C terminus Ab (Fig. 2, B1–B5), demonstrated the presence of CB clusters (green) at GABAergic synapses that co-localized (arrowheads) with the postsynaptic GABAAR γ2 subunit (red) and were apposed to the GAD+ presynaptic GABAergic terminals (blue).

We have first used an in silico method called elementary mode analysis to identify inhibition of ALAT (L-alanine aminotransferase) as a putative target to promote mitochondrial metabolism. We then experimentally show that two competitive inhibitors of ALAT, L-cycloserine and β-chloro-L-alanine, inhibit L-alanine production and impair D-glucose uptake of LLC1 Lewis lung carcinoma cells. The latter inhibition is linked to an initial energy deficit, as quantified by decreased ATP content, which is then followed by an activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and subsequently increased respiration rates and mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, culminating in ATP replenishment in ALAT-inhibited LLC1 cells. Moreover, we observe altered phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase 14), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), and Rb1 (retinoblastoma 1) proteins, as well as decreased expression of Cdc25a (cell decision cycle 25 homolog A) and Cdk4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4). Importantly, these sequelae of ALAT inhibition culminate in similarly reduced anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth rates of LLC1 cells, together suggesting that inhibition of ALAT efficiently impairs cancer growth by counteracting the Warburg effect due to compensatory activation of mitochondrial metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2003347299,"Dietary exposures implicated as reducing or causing risk for colorectal cancer may reduce or cause DNA damage in colon tissue; however, no one has assessed this hypothesis directly in humans. Thus, we enrolled 16 healthy volunteers in a 4-week controlled feeding study where 8 subjects were randomly assigned to dietary regimens containing meat cooked at either low (100°C) or high temperature (250°C), each for 2 weeks in a crossover design. The other 8 subjects were randomly assigned to dietary regimens containing the high-temperature meat diet alone or in combination with 3 putative mutagen inhibitors: cruciferous vegetables, yogurt, and chlorophyllin tablets, also in a crossover design. Subjects were nonsmokers, at least 18 years old, and not currently taking prescription drugs or antibiotics. We used the Salmonella assay to analyze the meat, urine, and feces for mutagenicity, and the comet assay to analyze rectal biopsies and peripheral blood lymphocytes for DNA damage. Low-temperature meat had undetectable levels of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and was not mutagenic, whereas high-temperature meat had high HCA levels and was highly mutagenic. The high-temperature meat diet increased the mutagenicity of hydrolyzed urine and feces compared to the low-temperature meat diet. The mutagenicity of hydrolyzed urine was increased nearly twofold by the inhibitor diet, indicating that the inhibitors enhanced conjugation. Inhibitors decreased significantly the mutagenicity of un-hydrolyzed and hydrolyzed feces. The diets did not alter the levels of DNA damage in non-target white blood cells, but the inhibitor diet decreased nearly twofold the DNA damage in target colorectal cells. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that dietary factors can reduce DNA damage in the target tissue of fried-meat associated carcinogenesis.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00340743."
https://openalex.org/W1967504131,"Objective Drug use and receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were assessed in HIV-infected persons from the Comprehensive Care Center (CCC; Nashville, TN) and Johns Hopkins University HIV Clinic (JHU; Baltimore, MD) between 1999 and 2005. Methods Participants with and without injection drug use (IDU) history in the CCC and JHU cohorts were evaluated. Additional analysis of persons with history of IDU, non-injection drug use (NIDU), and no drug use from CCC were performed. Activity of IDU and NIDU also was assessed for the CCC cohort. HAART use and time on HAART were analyzed according to drug use category and site of care. Results 1745 persons were included from CCC: 268 (15%) with IDU history and 796 (46%) with NIDU history. 1977 persons were included from JHU: 731 (35%) with IDU history. Overall, the cohorts differed in IDU risk factor rates, age, race, sex, and time in follow-up. In multivariate analyses, IDU was associated with decreased HAART receipt overall (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: [0.45–0.84] and OR = 0.58, 95% CI: [0.46–0.73], respectively for CCC and JHU) and less time on HAART at JHU (0.70, [0.55–0.88]), but not statistically associated with time on HAART at CCC (0.78, [0.56–1.09]). NIDU was independently associated with decreased HAART receipt (0.62, [0.47–0.81]) and less time on HAART (0.66, [0.52–0.85]) at CCC. These associations were not altered significantly whether patients at CCC were categorized according to historical drug use or drug use during the study period. Conclusions Persons with IDU history from both clinic populations were less likely to receive HAART and tended to have less cumulative time on HAART. Effects of NIDU were similar to IDU at CCC. NIDU without IDU is an important contributor to HAART utilization."

However, receptor desensitization assays are often inferred at the single signaling molecule level, thus ligand-directed desensitization is poorly understood. Here we report a label-free biosensor whole cell assay with microfluidics to determine ligand-directed desensitization of the β(2)AR. Together with mechanistic deconvolution using small molecule inhibitors, the receptor desensitization and resensitization patterns under the short-term agonist exposure manifested the long-acting agonism of salmeterol, and differentiated the mechanisms of agonist-directed desensitization between a full agonist epinephrine and a partial agonist pindolol. This study reveals the cellular mechanisms of agonist-selective β(2)AR desensitization at the whole cell level."
https://openalex.org/W2066679153,"Phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of the IFNAR1 chain of type I interferon (IFN) receptor is a robust and specific mechanism that limits the magnitude and duration of IFNα/β signaling. Besides the ligand-inducible IFNAR1 degradation, the existence of an ""inside-out"" signaling that accelerates IFNAR1 turnover in the cells undergoing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated unfolded protein responses has been recently described. The latter pathway does not require either presence of ligands (IFNα/β) or catalytic activity of Janus kinases (JAK). Instead, this pathway relies on activation of the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and ensuing specific priming phosphorylation of IFNAR1. Here, we describe studies that identify the stress activated p38 protein kinase as an important regulator of IFNAR1 that acts downstream of PERK. Results of the experiments using pharmacologic p38 kinase inhibitors, RNA interference approach, and cells from p38α knock-out mice suggest that p38 kinase activity is required for priming phosphorylation of IFNAR1 in cells undergoing unfolded protein response. We further demonstrate an important role of p38 kinase in the ligand-independent stimulation of IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation and ensuing attenuation of IFNα/β signaling and anti-viral defenses. We discuss the distinct importance of p38 kinase in regulating the overall responses to type I IFN in cells that have been already exposed to IFNα/β versus those cells that are yet to encounter these cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2039142564,"Background Management of febrile neutropenic episodes (FE) is challenged by lacking microbiological and clinical documentation of infection. We aimed at evaluating the utility of monitoring blood procalcitonin (PCT) in FE for initial diagnosis of infection and reassessment in persistent fever. Methods PCT kinetics was prospectively monitored in 194 consecutive FE (1771 blood samples): 65 microbiologically documented infections (MDI, 33.5%; 49 due to non-coagulase-negative staphylococci, non-CNS), 68 clinically documented infections (CDI, 35%; 39 deep-seated), and 61 fever of unexplained origin (FUO, 31.5%). Results At fever onset median PCT was 190 pg/mL (range 30–26'800), without significant difference among MDI, CDI and FUO. PCT peak occurred on day 2 after onset of fever: non-CNS-MDI/deep-seated-CDI (656, 80–86350) vs. FUO (205, 33–771; p<0.001). PCT >500 pg/mL distinguished non-CNS-MDI/deep-seated-CDI from FUO with 56% sensitivity and 90% specificity. PCT was >500 pg/ml in only 10% of FUO (688, 570–771). A PCT peak >500 pg/mL (1196, 524–11950) occurred beyond 3 days of persistent fever in 17/21 (81%) invasive fungal diseases (IFD). This late PCT peak identified IFD with 81% sensitivity and 57% specificity and preceded diagnosis according to EORTC-MSG criteria in 41% of cases. In IFD responding to therapy, median days to PCT <500 pg/mL and defervescence were 5 (1–23) vs. 10 (3–22; p = 0.026), respectively. Conclusion While procalcitonin is not useful for diagnosis of infection at onset of neutropenic fever, it may help to distinguish a minority of potentially severe infections among FUOs on day 2 after onset of fever. In persistent fever monitoring procalcitonin contributes to early diagnosis and follow-up of invasive mycoses."
https://openalex.org/W2040584701,"Background Participant non-adherence and loss to follow-up can compromise the validity of clinical trial results. An assessment of these issues was made in a 3-year tuberculosis prevention trial among HIV-infected adults in Botswana. Methods and Findings Between 11/2004–07/2006, 1995 participants were enrolled at eight public health clinics. They returned monthly to receive bottles of medication and were expected to take daily tablets of isoniazid or placebo for three years. Non-adherence was defined as refusing tablet ingestion but agreeing to quarterly physical examinations. Loss to follow-up was defined as not having returned for appointments in ≥60 days. Between 10/2008–04/2009, survey interviews were conducted with 83 participants identified as lost to follow-up and 127 identified as non-adherent. As a comparison, 252 randomly selected adherent participants were also surveyed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify associations with selected risk factors. Men had higher odds of being non-adherent (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.24; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.24–4.04) and lost to follow-up (AOR 3.08; 95%CI 1.50–6.33). Non-adherent participants had higher odds of reporting difficulties taking the regimen or not knowing if they had difficulties (AOR 3.40; 95%CI 1.75–6.60) and lower odds associated with each year of age (AOR 0.95; 95%CI 0.91–0.98), but other variables such as employment, distance from clinic, alcohol use, and understanding study requirements were not significantly different than controls. Among participants who were non-adherent or lost to follow-up, 40/210 (19.0%) reported that they stopped the medication because of work commitments and 33/210 (15.7%) said they thought they had completed the study. Conclusions Men had higher odds of non-adherence and loss to follow-up than women. Potential interventions that might improve adherence in trial participants may include:targeting health education for men, reducing barriers, clarifying study expectations, educating employers about HIV/AIDS to help reduce stigma in the workplace, and encouraging employers to support employee health.

https://openalex.org/W1984021084,"Acidocalcisomes are acidic calcium stores found in diverse organisms, being conserved from bacteria to humans. They possess an acidic matrix that contains several cations bound to phosphates, which are mainly present in the form of short and long polyphosphate chains. Their matrix is acidified through the action of proton pumps such as a vacuolar proton ATPase and a vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase. Calcium uptake occurs through a Ca(2+)/H(+) countertransporting ATPase located in the membrane of the organelle. Acidocalcisomes have been identified in a variety of microorganisms, including Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium and Eimeria species, and in Toxoplasma gondii. We report the purification and characterization of an acidocalcisome fraction from T. gondii tachyzoites after subcellular fractionation and further discontinuous iodixanol gradient purification. Proton and calcium transport activities in the fraction were characterized by fluorescence microscopy and spectrophotometric methods using acridine orange and arsenazo III, respectively. This work will facilitate the understanding of the function of acidocalcisomes in Apicomplexan parasites, as we can now isolate highly purified fractions that could be used for proteomic analysis to find proteins that may clarify the biogenesis of these organelles."
https://openalex.org/W2079249283,"A large number of gene expression profiling (GEP) studies on prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been performed, but no reliable gene signature for prediction of CRC prognosis has been found. Bioinformatic enrichment tools are a powerful approach to identify biological processes in high-throughput data analysis.We have for the first time collected the results from the 23 so far published independent GEP studies on CRC prognosis. In these 23 studies, 1475 unique, mapped genes were identified, from which 124 (8.4%) were reported in at least two studies, with 54 of them showing consisting direction in expression change between the single studies. Using these data, we attempted to overcome the lack of reproducibility observed in the genes reported in individual GEP studies by carrying out a pathway-based enrichment analysis. We used up to ten tools for overrepresentation analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) categories or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in each of the three gene lists (1475, 124 and 54 genes). This strategy, based on testing multiple tools, allowed us to identify the oxidative phosphorylation chain and the extracellular matrix receptor interaction categories, as well as a general category related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, as the only significantly and consistently overrepresented pathways in the three gene lists, which were reported by several enrichment tools.Our pathway-based enrichment analysis of 23 independent gene expression profiling studies on prognosis of CRC identified significantly and consistently overrepresented prognostic categories for CRC.

https://openalex.org/W2152358414,"Background Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality among patients with serious mental illness (SMI) and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome—a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors—is significantly higher in these patients than in the general population. Metabolic monitoring among patients using second generation antipsychotics (SGAs)—a risk factor for metabolic syndrome—has been shown to be inadequate despite the release of several guidelines. However, patients with SMI have several factors independent of medication use that predispose them to a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Our study therefore examines monitoring and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with SMI, including those not using SGAs. Methods and Findings We retrospectively identified all patients treated at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center with diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder during 2005–2006 and obtained demographic and clinical data. Incomplete monitoring of metabolic syndrome was defined as being unable to determine the status of at least one of the syndrome components. Of the 1,401 patients included (bipolar disorder: 822; schizophrenia: 222; and schizoaffective disorder: 357), 21.4% were incompletely monitored. Only 54.8% of patients who were not prescribed SGAs and did not have previous diagnoses of hypertension or hypercholesterolemia were monitored for all metabolic syndrome components compared to 92.4% of patients who had all three of these characteristics. Among patients monitored for metabolic syndrome completely, age-adjusted prevalence of the syndrome was 48.4%, with no significant difference between the three psychiatric groups. Conclusions Only one half of patients with SMI not using SGAs or previously diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were completely monitored for metabolic syndrome components compared to greater than 90% of those with these characteristics. With the high prevalence of metabolic syndrome seen in this population, there appears to be a need to intensify efforts to reduce this monitoring gap."
https://openalex.org/W2095166132,"South African plant species of the genera Fadogia, Pavetta and Vangueria (all belonging to Rubiaceae) are known to cause gousiekte (literally 'quick disease'), a fatal cardiotoxicosis of ruminants characterised by acute heart failure four to eight weeks after ingestion. Noteworthy is that all these plants harbour endophytes in their leaves: nodulating bacteria in specialized nodules in Pavetta and non-nodulating bacteria in the intercellular spaces between mesophyll cells in Fadogia and Vangueria.Isolation and analyses of these endophytes reveal the presence of Burkholderia bacteria in all the plant species implicated in gousiekte. Although the nodulating and non-nodulating bacteria belong to the same genus, they are phylogenetically not closely related and even fall in different bacterial clades. Pavetta harborii and Pavetta schumanniana have their own specific endophyte--Candidatus Burkholderia harborii and Candidatus Burkholderia schumanniana--while the non-nodulating bacteria found in the other gousiekte-inducing plants show high similarity to Burkholderia caledonica. In this group, the bacteria are host specific at population level. Investigation of gousiekte-inducing plants from other African countries resulted in the discovery of the same endophytes. Several other plants of the genera Afrocanthium, Canthium, Keetia, Psydrax, Pygmaeothamnus and Pyrostria were tested and were found to lack bacterial endophytes.The discovery and identification of Burkholderia bacteria in gousiekte-inducing plants open new perspectives and opportunities for research not only into the cause of this economically important disease, but also into the evolution and functional significance of bacterial endosymbiosis in Rubiaceae. Other South African Rubiaceae that grow in the same area as the gousiekte-inducing plants were found to lack bacterial endophytes which suggests a link between bacteria and gousiekte. The same bacteria are consistently found in gousiekte-inducing plants from different regions indicating that these plants will also be toxic to ruminants in other African countries."

Here we report the crystal structures of several Ct-FDH mutants in which two essential catalytic residues adjacent to the nicotinamide ring of bound NADP+, Cys-707 and Glu-673, were replaced separately or simultaneously. The replacement of the glutamate with an alanine causes irreversible binding of the coenzyme without any noticeable conformational changes in the vicinity of the nicotinamide ring. Additional replacement of cysteine 707 with an alanine (E673A/C707A double mutant) did not affect this irreversible binding indicating that the lack of the glutamate is solely responsible for the enhanced interaction between the enzyme and the coenzyme. The substitution of the cysteine with an alanine did not affect binding of NADP+ but resulted in the enzyme lacking the ability to differentiate between the oxidized and reduced coenzyme: unlike the wild-type Ct-FDH/NADPH complex, in the C707A mutant the position of NADPH is identical to the position of NADP+ with the nicotinamide ring well ordered within the catalytic center. Thus, whereas the glutamate restricts the affinity for the coenzyme, the cysteine is the sensor of the coenzyme redox state. These conclusions were confirmed by coenzyme binding experiments.

Numerous crystal structures showed that subunits of different ALDHs have very similar fold with each composed of catalytic, nucleotide binding, and oligomerization domains (4Liu Z.J. Sun Y.J. Rose J.

Two members of the family, cytosolic ALDH1 and mitochondrial ALDH2, are essential components of the pathway metabolizing ethanol (2Marchitti S.A. Brocker C. Stagos D. Vasiliou V. Expert Opin. Drug. Metab. Toxicol. 2008; 4: 697-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 11Zakhari S. Alcohol Res. Health. 2006; 29: 245-254PubMed Google Scholar). ALDH2 is also involved in mediating the vasodilator activity of nitroglycerine (12Chen Z. Foster M.W. Zhang J. Mao L. Rockman H.A. Kawamoto T. Kitagawa K. Nakayama K.I. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of this enzyme correlates with reduced ischemic heart damage in rodent models (13Chen C.H. Budas G.R. Churchill E.N. Disatnik M.H. Hurley T.D. Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 2008; 321: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The polymorphism in the ALDH2 gene found in about 40% of the Asian population causes decreased tolerance to alcohol in heterozygous and homozygous individuals (14Yoshida A. Huang I.Y. Ikawa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This ALDH2 genetic variant, ALDH2*2, has a lysine instead of a glutamate at position 487 within the oligomerization domain of the tetrameric enzyme. This substitution induces conformational changes at the subunit interface, which are reflected by structural alterations within the catalytic center and the coenzyme binding site (5Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 15Larson H.N. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol.

The final outcome is a strong decrease in the affinity for NAD+ binding and a severely reduced catalytic activity (17Farrés J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the activity of the catalytically deficient mutant is restored in the presence of a small molecule identified by a high-throughput screening (13Chen C.H. Budas G.R. Churchill E.N. Disatnik M.H. Hurley T.D. Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 2008; 321: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). One of the effects of this activator was a significant reduction in the apparent Km for NAD+ (18Perez-Miller S. Younus H. Vanam R. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Hurley T.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the ALDH reaction occurs in two principal steps, acylation and deacylation (Fig. 1) (5Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 7Moore S.A. Baker H.M. Blythe T.J. Kitson K.E. Kitson T.M. Baker E.N.

Interact. 2001; 130–132: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the first step, the invariant active site cysteine 302 (the numbering is according to human ALDH2) conducts a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde molecule to form a thiohemiacetal intermediate. The hydride ion is then transferred from an aldehyde to the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring of NAD(P)+, which causes a collapse of the thiohemiacetal to a thioester intermediate. In the second step, an activated water molecule hydrolyzes the thioester, releasing the product. It has been suggested that deprotonation of the catalytic cysteine prior to the nucleophilic attack on the substrate, a required step in this mechanism, involves acceptance of a proton by either glutamate 268 or 399 (5Steinmetz C.G.

The resulting thiolate ion is likely stabilized by the positively charged nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme and/or adjacent main chain amide groups. It has also been suggested that, in tetrameric class 1 and 2 ALDHs, the proton abstracted by Glu-268 is shuttled to bulk water (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25González-Segura L. Rudiño-Piñera E. Muñoz-Clares R.A. Horjales E. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 385: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, Glu-268 is also the most likely residue activating a water molecule in the deacylation step of the reaction (5Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 7Moore S.A. Baker H.M. Blythe T.J. Kitson K.E. Kitson T.M. Baker E.N.

Rahuel-Clermont S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A distinct feature of ALDHs is the apparent requirement for coenzyme flexibility in the process of catalysis (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D.

Interact. 2009; 178: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For hydride transfer to occur, in the first step of this reaction the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring has to be in close proximity to the catalytic cysteine. After the hydride transfer, the reduced nicotinamide ring must exit the catalytic site to allow for the accessibility of a water molecule, which hydrolyzes the acyl-sulfur bond releasing the product. In agreement with this mechanism, numerous crystal structures of ALDH revealed two common conformations of the coenzyme, depending on its oxidation state: the extended (“hydride transfer”) conformation of NAD(P)+, with the nicotinamide ring positioned close to Cys-302; and the contracted (“hydrolysis”) conformation of NAD(P)H, with the nicotinamide ring found outside of the catalytic site or disordered (4Liu Z.J. Sun Y.J. Rose J. Chung Y.J. Hsiao C.D. Chang W.R. Kuo I. Perozich J. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Wang B.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Steinmetz C.G.

The mechanism by which ALDHs sense the oxidation state of the bound coenzyme and control its conformation is not fully understood. In humans there are 19 known aldehyde dehydrogenases (2Marchitti S.A. Brocker C. Stagos D. Vasiliou V. Expert Opin. Drug. Metab. Toxicol. 2008; 4: 697-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). One member of the ALDH family, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH, ALDH1L1), is the product of a natural fusion of three unrelated genes (31Krupenko S.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2009; 178: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A part of the ALDH1L1 gene encoding for the 500-amino acid residue long C-terminal domain (Ct-FDH) was derived from an ancestor ALDH gene. Expressed separately, this domain displays enzymatic and structural features of canonical class 1 or 2 ALDHs including the presence of two catalytically essential residues, glutamate 673 and cysteine 707 (corresponding to Glu-268 and Cys-302 of ALDH) (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Previously solved crystal structures of apo-Ct-FDH and its complexes with reduced or oxidized coenzyme indicated interactions between the two catalytic residues and the nicotinamide ring. Specifically, a reversible rotation of the glutamate side chain upon NADP+ binding and a covalent bond formation between the cysteine and the C4 atom of nicotinamide were observed (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the current work, we solved crystal structures of the E673A, E673A/C707A, E673Q, and C707A mutants of Ct-FDH and their complexes with NADP+ or NADPH to investigate the role of these catalytic residues in conformational flexibility of the bound coenzyme and in the retaining oxidized and discharging reduced coenzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing of the mutant constructs. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion technique in hanging drops over wells containing 1.4–1.9 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.4–6.8, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, or 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5–8.1, as described previously (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Crystals of binary complexes of the E673Q and C707A mutants with NADP+ or NADPH were produced by soaking protein crystals overnight in a solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm of the corresponding coenzyme, and the concentration of ammonium sulfate equal to that in the mother liquor. To maintain equivalent conditions, the crystals of apoproteins were soaked in the same solution containing no coenzymes before mounting. Prior to data collection, all crystals were passed through the same solution containing 27.5% glycerol and flash-frozen in situ at 100 K using an X-Stream Cryostream (Rigaku MSC). In the case of the binary complexes, the cryoprotecting solution also contained 5 mm of the corresponding coenzyme. The data sets were collected on an RAXIS IV++ image plate detector mounted on a RU-H3R rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA (Medical University of South Carolina) and at a wavelength of 1.0 Å on MAR300 CCD detector (MAR-USA) at the SER-CAT beamline ID22 at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). All the crystals belong to space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 258.6, b = 194.8, c = 97.4, and β = 108.8. The data were processed using HKL2000 (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as a search model. The coenzyme molecules were identified by examining the |Fo| − |Fc| and 2|Fo| − |Fc| electron density maps. The models were refined by alternating rounds of restrained refinement in REFMAC5 (35Vagin A.A. Steiner R.A. Lebedev A.A. Potterton L. McNicholas S. Long F. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). Water molecules were introduced using Coot and inspected manually. During refinement, 5% of the data were reserved to calculate the free R-factor and this assignment was maintained for all data sets. In all the structures, unidentified electron density of varying intensity was observed in the substrate entrance tunnel. In some subunits it could be filled with a MES molecule at 0.5 occupancy or with a combination of a glycerol molecule and a water molecule, as in the structures of wild-type Ct-FDH (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The stereochemistry of the models was verified by PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The figures were prepared using PyMol (www.pymol.org). Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with codes 3RHJ, 3RHL, 3RHM, 3RHO, 3RHP, 3RHQ, and 3RHR for the E673A mutant in complex with co-purified NADP+, E673A/C707A double mutant in complex with co-purified NADP+, E673Q mutant, E673Q mutant in complex with NADP+, C707A mutant, C707A mutant in complex with NADP+, and C707A mutant in complex with NADPH, respectively. To determine the oxidation state of the coenzyme that was co-purified with E673A and E673A/C707A mutants, a protein sample was diluted 1:80 with deionized water and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The protein was then denatured by addition of NaOH to increase the pH to 11.5. After a 1-h incubation, the lower molecular weight components were separated by filtration as described above. Concentrations of NADP+ and NADPH were then estimated from the absorbance spectra of the filtrates recorded in the 240–380 nm range using extinction coefficients 1.8 × 104 m cm−1 (NADP+ at 260 nm), 1.5 × 104 m cm−1 (NADPH at 260 nm), and 6.22 × 103 m cm−1 (NADPH at 340 nm). The presence of NADPH in the filtrate was additionally verified using a fluorescence spectrum excited at 330 nm and recorded from 400 to 550 nm. The protein concentration in the high molecular weight fraction was estimated by the method of Bradford. The approximate ratio of the coenzyme molar concentration to the protein subunit molar concentration was calculated from these data. The E673A and E673A/C707A mutants of Ct-FDH were subjected to 5 consecutive 24-h rounds of dialysis at 4 °C against either 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.02% NaN3 or 20 mm MES buffer, pH 5.6, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.5 mm DTT, at a protein sample to buffer ratio of 1:500. The sample was then concentrated and crystallized as described above or used for the coenzyme binding study. Wild-type Ct-FDH or mutant proteins were incubated with increasing concentrations of NADP+ (up to 5 × 10−5 m) or NADPH (up to 6 × 10−5 m) for 1 h at room temperature in 20 mm BisTris propane buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm DTT. Emission fluorescence spectra of proteins were recorded on a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer by scanning from 300 to 400 nm with excitation at 295 nm. Changes in NADPH fluorescence at 450 nm were recorded upon excitation at 330 nm. Kd values were determined by non-linear fitting of experimental data points to equations described under supplemental materials. All crystals produced in this study share the same C2 space group with unit cell dimensions and crystal packing identical to those of the crystals of WT Ct-FDH (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Root mean square deviations in positions of all Cα atoms between mutant structures and WT Ct-FDH (PDB code 2O2P) were within 0.32 Å, with the exception of the structure of the E673Q mutant in the absence of NADP+, which showed a root mean square deviation of 0.62 Å. In each structure, the four subunits maintain the same fold, and there were no large scale structural rearrangements due to introduction of the mutations or binding of NADP+/NADPH. The structure of the E673A mutant of Ct-FDH, crystallized without addition of the coenzyme, was determined at 1.9-Å resolution. The electron density in the active site of each subunit suggested the presence of a co-purified NADP+ molecule bound in the extended conformation (Fig. 2A). In contrast, WT Ct-FDH was crystallized as the apoenzyme in the absence of NADP+/NADPH (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After denaturing the protein, the bound coenzyme was extracted and identified as NADP+ based on the absorption spectrum (Fig. 2B) and the absence of fluorescence at 460 nm upon excitation at 330 nm, typical of NADPH. NADP+ molecules were introduced into the density and assigned occupancies of 0.75 based on minimizing the peaks in the |Fo| − |Fc| electron density map (Fig. 2C). This occupancy value is in agreement with the spectrophotometrically determined NADP+ to protein subunit molar ratio of 0.8 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Soaking the crystals in the presence of NADP+ increased the occupancy of the cofactor to 1.0 (data not shown). The structure of the active site of the mutant is identical to that of WT Ct-FDH in complex with NADP+ (Fig. 2C). The coenzyme is bound through a non-classical Rossmann fold with the pyrophosphate part open to the solvent and the nicotinamide moiety buried in a pocket adjacent to the active site, with no noticeable deviations between positions of amino acid residues involved in contacts with NADP+. Likewise, conformations of NADP+ in the two structures were identical. As we previously observed in the WT Ct-FDH structure (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), two conformations of the sulfur atom of the active site cysteine 707 were observed in electron density of the E673A mutant. However, the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring apparently forms a covalent bond with one of these conformers only in subunits B and D (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2), whereas in the wild-type protein such covalent bonds were formed in all four subunits. The covalent adduct with NADP+ was confirmed by the presence of a small but reliably detected absorbance peak at 320 nm in the spectrum of the E673A mutant (Fig. 2B). We showed previously that this peak is associated with formation of the Ct-FDH/NADP+ covalent adduct (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We attempted to remove NADP+ from the active site of the E673A mutant using extensive dialysis of the protein sample prior to crystallization trials. The resulting 2.7-Å structure showed strong electron density for NADP+ in all four subunits (supplemental Fig. S3A). The presence of bound NADP+ was confirmed using the aforementioned spectrophotometric assay (data not shown). In another approach, multiple rounds of soaking the E673A crystals in mother liquor in the absence of the cofactor did not influence the electron density with respect to NADP+. In contrast, a single “back-soaking” completely removes the coenzyme from WT Ct-FDH (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results indicate that replacing the catalytic glutamate of Ct-FDH with an alanine traps NADP+ in the active site without inducing noticeable structural rearrangements of the protein molecule. To strip the E673A mutant of NADP+ we had to destabilize the complex by decreasing the pH to 5.6 and increasing the sodium chloride concentration to 0.5 m. Prolonged dialysis at this condition resulted in removal of most of the coenzyme as demonstrated by the corresponding crystal structure solved at 2.0 Å (supplemental Fig. S3B). Of note, a further decrease in pH resulted in irreversible protein precipitation. We have previously demonstrated that the E673A mutant of Ct-FDH has essentially no ALDH activity (10Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, soaking the crystals of the mutant in the presence of propanal, a substrate for the Ct-FDH ALDH reaction, had no noticeable effect on the conformation of either the active site residues or the coenzyme (data not shown). In contrast, the same treatment of WT Ct-FDH in complex with NADP+ altered the positions of both the Glu-673 side chain and the nicotinam"

In Gram-negative bacteria, acylation proceeds through three sequential steps requiring lipoprotein diacylglyceryltransferase, lipoprotein signal peptidase, and finally lipoprotein N-acyltransferase. The apparent lack of genes coding for recognizable homologs of lipoprotein N-acyltransferase in Gram-positive bacteria and Mollicutes suggests that the final step of the protein acylation process may be absent in these organisms. In this work, we monitored the acylation state of eight major lipoproteins of the mollicute Acholeplasma laidlawii using a combination of standard two-dimensional gel electrophoresis protein separation, blotting to nitrocellulose membranes, and MALDI-MS identification of modified N-terminal tryptic peptides. We show that for each A. laidlawii lipoprotein studied a third fatty acid in an amide linkage on the N-terminal Cys residue is present, whereas diacylated species were not detected. The result thus proves that A. laidlawii encodes a lipoprotein N-acyltransferase activity. We hypothesize that N-acyltransferases encoded by genes non-homologous to N-acyltransferases of Gram-negative bacteria are also present in other mollicutes and Gram-positive bacteria.

Essential cellular activities such as transport, sensing, signal transduction, growth, adhesion, and pathogenesis require proteins localized on the cell surface. One of the strategies to anchor a protein at the lipid membrane is covalent modification of proteins by fatty acids or other lipids. All bacteria rely on acylation of N-terminal Cys residues of lipoproteins to allow tight anchorage on the membrane surface (1Schultz A.M. Henderson L.E. Oroszlan S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This uniquely bacterial modification was first observed in 1969 in a major outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli called Braun's lipoprotein and later detected in every bacterial organism studied (2Braun V. Rehn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 10: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Adhesion proteins and substrate-binding subunits of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 2The abbreviations used are: ABCATP-binding cassette3Ptriple palmitoyl2P1Sdual palmitoyl/monostearoyl1P2Sdouble stearoyl/monopalmitoyl2P1Mdouble palmitoyl/monomyristoylSPIIsignal peptidase II. transporters are known to be attached to the membrane in this manner. Thousands of proteins predicted to be lipoproteins “by similarity” according to the presence of consensus sequences of Sec Type II or Tat Type II signal peptides are also thought to be acylated (3Babu M.M.

ATP-binding cassette triple palmitoyl dual palmitoyl/monostearoyl double stearoyl/monopalmitoyl double palmitoyl/monomyristoyl signal peptidase II. Bacteria of the Mollicutes class are widespread in nature and are characterized by the lack of a rigid cell wall and drastically reduced genome sizes. In fact, representatives of this class are the simplest self-replicating organisms able to independently subsist, generate energy, and adapt to changing environments (4Razin S. Yogev D. Naot Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1094-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Most mollicutes depend on cholesterol and are partially or totally incapable of fatty acid synthesis and therefore depend on the host or the culture medium for a constant supply of these substances (5Andersson A.S. Rilfors L. Orädd G. Lindblom G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2877-2887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Acholeplasma laidlawii is a convenient model mollicute because of its relatively simple nutritional requirements and fast growth rate. A. laidlawii can synthesize limited amounts of saturated fatty acids when grown in a thoroughly lipid-depleted medium (6Saito Y. Silvius J.R. McElhaney R.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 66-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the absence of the periplasmic space, Mollicutes need an unusually large number of surface-exposed lipoproteins. The genome of A. laidlawii was recently determined in our laboratory (NCBI Project ID 19259). Among 325 predicted A. laidlawii membrane proteins, 62 have predicted Sec Type II signal peptides and can therefore be N-terminally acylated with long chain fatty acids to anchor on the cell surface. A conserved motif in Type II signal peptides directs future lipoprotein export through the Sec or Tat pathway to the membrane and then to the lipoprotein biogenesis machinery (3Babu M.M. Priya M.L. Selvan A.T. Madera M. Gough J. Aravind L. Sankaran K. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2761-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Bos M.P. Tommassen J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In Gram-negative bacteria, N-terminal acylation proceeds in three steps (schematically represented in Fig. 1). (i) Prolipoprotein diacylglyceryltransferase (Lgt) uses membrane phospholipid substrates and catalyzes the transfer of a diacylglyceryl moiety onto a strictly conserved cysteine via a thioether linkage. (ii) The signal peptide is then cleaved by lipoprotein signal Type II peptidase (Lsp in E. coli), leaving the lipid-modified Cys at the newly formed N terminus of the mature lipoprotein. (iii) Lipoprotein N-acyltransferase (Lnt) adds a third fatty acid residue to the backbone amino group of lipidated cysteine. The last step is important for lipoprotein transport to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria via the lipoprotein localization 1 pathway (8Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S.I. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Depletion of Lnt results in the accumulation of lipoproteins in the plasma membrane, which may be lethal to the cell. The first two steps of lipoprotein biogenesis are universally conserved in eubacteria as judged by the presence of genes whose products are homologous to diacylglyceryltransferase and signal Type II peptidase (3Babu M.M. Priya M.L. Selvan A.T. Madera M. Gough J. Aravind L. Sankaran K. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2761-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7Bos M.P. Tommassen J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). During A. laidlawii genome annotation, lgt and lsp were readily detected by sequence homology. However, A. laidlawii as well as other mollicutes and Gram-positive bacteria lack recognizable lnt gene homologs (9Hutchings M.I. Palmer T. Harrington D.J. Sutcliffe I.C. Trends Microbiol. 2009; 17: 13-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A question therefore arises whether the third step of protein acylation occurs in these organisms. There are conflicting data concerning N-acylation in Mollicutes. In a number of studies, major lipoproteins such as variable lipoproteins VlpA and VlpC from Mycoplasma hyorhinis, LP44 of Mycoplasma salivarium, and macrophage-activating lipoproteins from Mycoplasma fermentans and Mycoplasma gallisepticum were shown to lack this modification, consistent with the lack of lnt homologs in their genomes (10Mühlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Süssmuth R. Jung G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4804-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jan G. Le Hénaff M. Fontenelle C. Wróblewski H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 177: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the surface lipoprotein MG149 of Mycoplasma genitalium (12Shimizu T. Kida Y. Kuwano K. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 3672-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and spiralin of Spiroplasma melliferum were found to be N-acylated (13Le Hénaff M. Fontenelle C. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A standard way to study the acylation state of total lipoproteins present in the cell is to extract lipoproteins with a detergent, selectively hydrolyze ester or amide bonds connecting the lipid and protein moieties, and determine the ratio of [O-ester-bound chains + N-linked chains]/[O-ester bound chains] for cell lipoproteins. For Mycoplasma mycoides and A. laidlawii, this parameter is 1.2 (14Jan G. Fontenelle C. Verrier F. Le Hénaff M. Wróblewski H. Curr. Microbiol. 1996; 32: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and 1.1 (15Le Hénaff M. Chollet A. Fontenelle C. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), respectively, suggesting the predominant occurrence of O-ester-linked fatty acids in acylated proteins in these mollicutes. On the other hand, similar measurements performed for Mycoplasma agalactiae and M. gallisepticum lipoproteins revealed a ratio of 1.4 (16Le Hénaff M. Guéguen M.M. Fontenelle C. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 40: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 17Jan G. Fontenelle C. Le Hénaff M. Wróblewski H. Res. Microbiol. 1995; 146: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that a considerable fraction of lipoproteins is N-acylated and implying the existence of the third step of lipoprotein biogenesis. This notion, however, appears to contradict the finding with M. gallisepticum macrophage-activating lipoproteins (no N-acylation) referred to above (11Jan G. Le Hénaff M. Fontenelle C. Wróblewski H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 177: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Clearly, development of robust methods to quantitatively measure the acylation state is necessary for resolving the existing controversies for Mollicutes as well as Gram-positive bacterial lipoproteins. Mass spectrometric methods offer a unique advantage in this regard as they allow analyzing the protein acylation state directly without the requirement for prior hydrolysis of the lipid-protein juncture. In this study, we report the development of a new method of determination of the acylation state of lipoproteins that relies on a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis protein separation, transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, and MALDI-MS visualization of modified N-terminal tryptic peptides. We used this method to examine the acylation of eight major lipoproteins from A. laidlawii. We show definitively that all A. laidlawii lipoproteins examined are fully triacylated, implying the existence of robust N-acyltransferase activity in this organism. A. laidlawii PG8-A was cultivated in modified Edward medium (18Liska B. Smith P.F. Folia Microbiol. 1974; 19: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) containing (per liter) 20 g of tryptose, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, 5 g of CH3COONa, 1.3 g of KCl, and 3.6 g of Tris-HCl, pH 8. Before inoculation, 6% (w/w) horse serum, 0.5% (w/w) glucose, and 500 units/ml penicillin were added to the medium. A. laidlawii cultures were grown for 18 h at 30, 37, or 42 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 74 kBq of either palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1c), stearic acid (18:0), or linoleic acid (18:2c) (Amersham Biosciences) were added per 1 ml of growth medium. Exponentially growing cells were collected by centrifugation; washed twice with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4; and treated with a nuclease mixture (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were resolved by two-dimensional PAGE and silver-stained as described elsewhere (19Golovina A.Y. Sergiev P.V. Golovin A.V. Serebryakova M.V. Demina I. Govorun V.M. Dontsova O.A. RNA. 2009; 15: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed to a storage phosphor screen for 2 weeks. Images were acquired on a Typhoon scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were identified by in-gel trypsin digestion and MS analysis (20Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Cell pellets (10 μl) were resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1% Triton X-114, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After 15-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g (4 °C), the supernatants were transferred into a new tube and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min at which point the clear solution became cloudy due to micellae formation. Phase separation was performed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at room temperature. The upper aqueous phase was discarded, and proteins from the lower organic phase were precipitated by the addition of 4 volumes of acetonitrile. After two-dimensional or one-dimensional PAGE separation, lipoproteins were transferred onto Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences) via a standard electroblotting procedure and stained with Ponceau S (Fluka). The top layer of the membrane-containing stained protein spots was scrapped off, and crumbs of nitrocellulose (2–4 μl) were rinsed twice with 50 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.5 in 10% acetonitrile. Proteins were digested overnight with trypsin (Promega; 5 μl of a 20 mg/ml solution in 50 mm NH4HCO3) at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted stepwise at room temperature with 20 μl of aqueous 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in 10% acetonitrile for 10 min, and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in 20% acetonitrile for 10 min. Finally, a 10-min extraction with 10 μl of chloroform, methanol, and 20% formic acid (1:3:1, v/v/v) or chloroform, acetonitrile, and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (1:3:1, v/v/v) was performed. Sample aliquots (1–2 μl) were mixed on a steel target with 0.3 μl of 20 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and 30% acetonitrile water solution (Aldrich). Mass spectra were recorded on an Ultraflex II MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a neodymium laser. The [MH]+ or [M − H]− (for lipids) molecular ions were measured in reflector or linear mode; the accuracy of mass peak measurement was within 0.007%. Fragment ion spectra were obtained in Lift mode. The accuracy of fragment ion mass peak measurements was within 1 Da. Protein identification was carried out by peptide fingerprint search with the use of Mascot software (Matrix Science) through the NCBI A. laidlawii protein database. One missed cleavage, Met oxidation, and Cys-propionamide were permitted. Protein scores greater than 44 were considered to be significant (p < 0.05). Interpretation of MS-MS spectra and assignments of acylpeptides were performed with Biotools v.3 software (Bruker Daltonics), revealing a variety of attached long chain fatty acids (palmitate, stearate, etc.). To estimate the ratio of protein modification with a particular fatty acid, averaged values of normalized MS intensities Pi were used. For example, the extent of palmitoylation (PPal) was calculated using the following formula: PPal = P3P × 100% + (P2P1M + P3P+14 + P1P2S) × 66.6% + (P2P1M+14 + P2P1S+14 + P1P2S) × 33.3%. The extent of modification with other fatty acids was calculated in a similar way. Fatty acid analysis of A. laidlawii lipid membranes was performed after methyl esterification by gas chromatography according to Russian state standard specification R 51483-99. To identify the most abundant acylated proteins of A. laidlawii, various 14C-labeled fatty acids (palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1c), stearic (18:0), and linoleic (18:2c) acids) were added to A. laidlawii growth medium. Cells were grown and harvested, and proteins were resolved by two-dimensional PAGE. The profile of A. laidlawii proteins revealed after two-dimensional PAGE separation was highly reproducible (supplemental Fig. 1). Radioactively labeled proteins were revealed using a phosphorimaging system. The most efficient radioactive labeling was observed when cells were grown in the presence of [14C]palmitic acid, revealing a total of 17 major labeled spots (Fig. 2A). Much less efficient labeling was observed when proteins from cells grown on stearic acid-containing medium were subjected to two-dimensional PAGE analysis; however, the pattern of labeled proteins was the same (data not shown). No detectable labeling with oleic and linoleic acids was observed (not shown). We performed mass spectrometric identification of 209 A. laidlawii proteins from silver-stained gels subjected to autoradiography (shown in supplemental Fig. 1A) by tryptic peptide fingerprinting. The results are presented in supplemental Table 1. A total of 19 proteins from 17 radioactively labeled on-gel spots were identified (Fig. 2A and Table 1). 17 of the identified proteins possess Sec-(SPII) signal peptides and are predicted to be extracellular lipoproteins. Two proteins, translation elongation factor EF-G and dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, lack signal peptides and are generally known to be cytoplasmic. Their presence in the [14C]palmitate-labeled protein set is likely due to imperfect separation of proteins on two-dimensional gels. These proteins were therefore excluded from further analysis. None of the 192 proteins identified in non-radioactively labeled spots contained a predicted Sec-(SPII) signal.TABLE 1A. laidlawii proteins identified from [14C]palmitate-labeled two-dimensional PAGE spotsSpotNCBI numberProtein nameMraMr and pI calculated for unprocessed protein precursors.pIaMr and pI calculated for unprocessed protein precursors.ScoreSignal1GI:162447607Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin-type24,2524.78107Sec-(SPII)2GI:162447857ABC-type transport system, substrate-binding component29,9984.36167Sec-(SPII)3GI:162448142ABC-type transport system, substrate-binding component33,5834.96266Sec-(SPII)4GI:162447532Hypothetical surface-anchored protein35,3184.57154Sec-(SPII)5GI:162447253Hypothetical surface-anchored protein38,6674.34221Sec-(SPII)6GI:162446940Thiamine biosynthesis lipoprotein40,5614.58100Sec-(SPII)7GI:162448242Hypothetical surface-anchored protein44,8324.74197Sec-(SPII)8GI:162447521ABC-type transport system, ligand-binding component48,4854.64234Sec-(SPII)9GI:162446922Hypothetical protein50,9174.70239Sec-(SPII)10GI:162448245ABC-type transport system, substrate-binding component54,6285.00365Sec-(SPII)11GI:162447313Surface-anchored VWFAbvon Willebrand factor type A. domain protein54,2484.50187Sec-(SPII)12GI:162447010Hypothetical surface-anchored protein56,1945.39202Sec-(SPII)13aGI:162447139ABC-type transport system, substrate-binding component56,8664.69171Sec-(SPII)13bGI:162448149Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase57,2255.008914GI:162447363ABC-type transport system, ligand-binding component62,5944.5891Sec-(SPII)15GI:162447585Hypothetical protein61,1394.55166Sec-(SPII)16aGI:162447164Translation elongation factor EF-G76,2875.2934616bGI:162448066ABC-type transport system, substrate-binding component87,6294.55391Sec-(SPII)17GI:162447080Hypothetical surface-anchored protein120,1324.40257Sec-(SPII)a Mr and pI calculated for unprocessed protein precursors.b von Willebrand factor type A. Open table in a new tab All 17 [14C]palmitate-labeled A. laidlawii proteins were identified unambiguously (see the supplemental representative HTML Mascot files) and were found to be related to substrate-binding subunits of ABC transporters of carbohydrates, amino acids, and inorganic ions or are annotated as hypothetical surface-anchored proteins of unknown function (Table 1). These same proteins were identified in the case of stearic acid labeling (data not shown). We next performed protein extraction from A. laidlawii cells with the detergent Triton X-114, which selectively transfers some membrane proteins to the micelle detergent phase. Extracted lipoproteins were resolved by standard one-dimensional or two-dimensional PAGE (Fig. 2B). Major membrane proteins from one-dimensional and two-dimensional gels matched each other, indicating that most A. laidlawii lipoproteins are resolved by two-dimensional PAGE at our conditions. A total of 28 protein spots were observed on a Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gel. A. laidlawii proteins present in two-dimensional gel spots were identified by MALDI-MS and are presented in supplemental Table 2. Protein spots that matched radioactively labeled spots in Fig. 2A are indicated in the gel presented in Fig. 2B by corresponding numbers. Three radioactively labeled proteins (spots 1, 6, and 11) were absent from the Triton X-114 extracts probably due to their low abundance. Coomassie-stained proteins from the Triton X-114 extract that did not have a radioactively labeled counterpart did not contain a Sec-(SPII) signal (see supplemental Table 2). Most of them are major A. laidlawii proteins that should be regarded as contaminants. To determine the acylation state of eight major A. laidlawii lipoproteins extracted with Triton X-114, peptide fingerprints after in-gel tryptic digests were examined. Although numerous internal tryptic peptides were readily observed on MALDI mass spectra for each protein studied, we were unable to detect the presence of N-terminal peptides for any of the proteins despite the numerous attempts. The possible reasons for our failure to detect the expected acylated N-terminal peptides may include (but are not limited to) (i) low intensity of corresponding MS signals due to interference from other peptides and (ii) poor extraction of peptides bearing linked long chain fatty acids from polyacrylamide gels. To observe and analyze acylated peptides directly, we developed a new method that included transblotting of proteins separated by two-dimensional PAGE to nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer to the membrane, proteins were stained, and the most abundant protein spots were treated with trypsin. We expected that peptides modified with lipids, if present in a peptide spot, would be better retained on the membrane due to their hydrophobicity. Accordingly, trypsin-treated membrane samples were gently washed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to remove unmodified peptides. MALDI-MS analysis of peptides present in the washes confirmed that only unmodified internal peptides of A. laidlawii lipoproteins were present in the sample (data not shown). The final extraction of the membrane was performed by a chloroform-methanol-formic acid-water solution, and extracted material was subjected to MALDI-MS analysis. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the material eluted at this step contained, for each lipoprotein spot tested, a series of peaks, which were absent from the wash samples. Each peak in the series could be interpreted as a defined triacylated N-terminal tryptic peptide derived from a corresponding A. laidlawii lipoprotein. No peaks corresponding to diacylated N-terminal tryptic peptides were observed. We therefore conclude that the new procedure indeed allows efficient direct visualization of the lipoprotein acylation state. We further conclude that despite the absence of a recognizable N-acyltransferase homolog in A. laidlawii the third step of protein acylation is carried out to completion. For each lipopeptide series, a total of seven mass peaks were observed. Two major peaks were shifted by 788 and 816 mass units from calculated values of unmodified peptides. These peaks were interpreted, respectively, as triple palmitoyl- (3P; +788) and dual palmitoyl/monostearoyl (2P1S; +816)-modified versions of N-terminal lipoprotein peptides. Two minor peaks in each series were shifted by +760 and +844 mass units and correspond to double palmitoyl/monomyristoyl (2P1M; +760) and double stearoyl/monopalmitoyl (1P2S; +844) modifications. The four peaks described above can be arranged in an ascending series with each peak differing from another by 28 mass units corresponding to the presence of two CH2 groups. Curiously, in addition to these peaks, three peaks shifted by 14 mass units (a single CH2 group) were present. The appearance of these peaks cannot be explained in terms of the usual even-numbered saturated fatty acid modifications and may be due to infrequent modification with monomethyl-branched saturated fatty acids. The lipopeptide mass spectral profiles for each of the eight major A. laidlawii lipoproteins analyzed appeared to be highly reproducible because the ratios of individual peaks in each series were found to be constant for samples prepared from independently grown cell cultures (Table 2). The precision of these measurements was within 5% for major 3P and 2P1S peak signals and 2% for minor peaks. We assume that for each peak in the series the peak intensity ratio approximately reflects the quantitative ratio of differently acylated peptides and therefore reports the overall acylation state of a lipoprotein. Although this assumption is difficult to prove experimentally, published data on influenza type A virus hemagglutinin seem to support this notion (21Serebryakova M.V. Kordyukova L.V. Baratova L.A. Markushin S.G. Eur. J. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 12: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because the ratio of lipopeptide peaks for different A. laidlawii proteins was the same within the experimental error, we calculated an average frequency of modifications with different fatty acids for eight lipoproteins studied. By far, the most frequent modification is palmitic acid: it accounts for ∼74% of the total fatty acid modifications detected. The frequencies of stearic and myristic acid modifications are 16 and 3%, correspondingly. The remaining 7% of lipid modifications are due to potential odd-numbered fatty acid modifications (6%) and modifications with unsaturated fatty acids (<1% of total modifications; revealed as low intensity signals neighboring major peaks in Fig. 3). For major fatty acid modifications, these estimates are in good agreement with observed intensities of the 14C-fatty acid protein labeling experiment (Fig. 2).TABLE 2Relative intensities of individual mass peaks in N-terminal peptide series of eight A. laidlawii lipoproteinsProtein NCBI number[MH]+ calculated[MH]+ experimental (peak intensity %)aFor each peak, an [MH]+ value and relative peak intensities (presented in parentheses; averaged over at least four spectra obtained with material prepared from two independently grown cultures and normalized to sum intensity of triply acylated peptide peak series) are presented.2P1M2P1M+143P3P+142P1S2P1S+141P2SGI:1624478579671727 (4%)1741 (6%)1755 (37%)1769 (10%)1783 (34%)1797 (6%)1811 (5%)GI:16244814220712831 (5%)2845 (7%)2859 (41%)2873 (11%)2897 (28%)2901 (4%)2915 (4%)GI:1624475327071467 (4%)1481 (6%)1495 (38%)1509 (9%)1523 (33%)1537 (5%)1551 (5%)GI:162447253bSpectra were recorded in linear mode; average [MH]+ is stated.

Open table in a new tab The pronounced bias in frequencies of modification with individual fatty acids is at odds with published data, which suggest that the frequencies of various long fatty chains in this organism (myristic, palmitic, and stearic) are more balanced (22Niemi A.R. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1239: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the assortment of protein-attached fatty acids reflects the composition of A. laidlawii lipid membrane, standard analysis of A. laidlawii membrane fatty acids was performed (Fig. 4). The results indicated that stearate was the most abundant A. laidlawii membrane fatty acid (∼27%) followed by palmitate (25%) and oleic and linoleic acids (17 and 10%, respectively). Myristate was present in small (2–3%) amounts. Comparison of fatty acid frequencies in A. laidlawii lipoproteins and membranes thus reveals that the acylation machinery has a clear preference for palmitate and possibly myristate. Conversely, stearate and unsaturated fatty acids do not appear to be preferred acylation substrates. To regulate the lipid composition of its membrane and maintain a proper balance between various lipids, A. laidlawii alters the polar head group structure of phospho- and glycolipids (e.g. the proportion of mono-/diglucosyldiacylglycerols and monoacyldi-/monoglucosyldiacyl glycerols). In this way, the lipid composition of the membrane is changed as a function of growth temperature (22Niemi A.R. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1239: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Nyström S. Wallbrandt P. Wieslander A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Wieslander A. Christiansson A. Rilfors L. Khan A. Johansson L.B. Lindblom G. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1982; 4: S43-S49Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 25Lindblom G. Orädd G. Rilfors L. Morein S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11512-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We were interested in whether these changes lead to changes in protein acylation. Accordingly, we determined whether the composition of protein-associated fatty acids depends on growth temperature. A. laidlawii cultures were grown at 37, 30, or 42 °C for an identical amount of time. Because the A. laidlawii growth rate is highly temperature-dependent, considerably less biomass was collected from 30 and 42 °C cultures, which affected the quality of the resulting mass spectra (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, comparisons of Fig. 5 spectra with Fig. 2 data (obtained with material prepared from cultures grown at 37 °C) revealed that peak intensities of differently acylated peptides were the same at all three temperatures. This lack of differences in protein acylation was in stark contrast with the experimentally observed changes in lipid composition of membranes of A. laidlawii grown at different temperatures (Fig. 5B), which was in agreement with published data (22Niemi A.R. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1239: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Nyström S. Wallbrandt P. Wieslander A. Eur. J.

Thus, the composition of A. laidlawii protein-associated fatty acids does not depend on either growth temperature or membrane composition. Because a strong preference for incorporation of palmitate in A. laidlawii lipoproteins exists, we were interested to know at which step of the acylation process the less common stearate is incorporated. To address this question, we compared MS-MS spectra of 3P and 2P1S forms for N-terminal peptides from two lipoproteins, GI:162448066 and GI:162448245 (Fig. 6). For each lipopeptide variant, series of C-terminal y- and z-type daughter ions, which confirmed the amino acid structure of the peptide moieties (CTPK for GI:162448066 and CIGGER for GI:162448245), were observed. Most interestingly in each MS-MS spectrum, signals corresponding to a 256-mass unit loss from the parent ion were detected (Fig. 6, marked by asterisks). The only possibility to get such a mass difference is the elimination of the entire palmitic acid (CH3(CH2)14COOH) from the S-diacylglycerol moiety. Elimination of the CH3(CH2)16COOH stearic acid should have produced a shift of 284 mass units. However, the corresponding ions were not observed, suggesting that in 2P1S-modified lipopeptides stearate is not found on S-diacylglycerol. In other words, palmitates are predominantly O-linked in 2P1S forms. It therefore follows that stearate residues are mainly amide-linked in these forms, reflecting stage specificity of the acylation process. In this work, we report the development of a robust MS-based method that allows direct determination of the acylation status of bacterial lipoproteins. Using this method, we show that every studied lipoprotein of the mollicute A. laidlawii is triacylated. By extension, we hypothesize that lipoproteins in other mollicutes are also triacylated. The existence of A. laidlawii lipoproteins in triacylated form is unexpected because a gene encoding recognizable homologs of N-acyltransferases responsible for incorporation of the third fatty acid in lipoproteins from Gram-negative bacteria is absent from the A. laidlawii genome. Identification of triacylation as the major (perhaps the only) state of A. laidlawii lipoproteins is in contrast with published data, which suggest the predominant involvement of O-ester-linked fatty acids but not amide-linked fatty acids in protein acylation in A. laidlawii (14Jan G. Fontenelle C. Verrier F. Le Hénaff M. Wróblewski H. Curr. Microbiol. 1996; 32: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Nyström S. Johansson K.E. Wieslander A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the latter work, the authors showed that globomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide specifically inhibiting signal peptidase II, had no dramatic effect on the extent of acylation of A. laidlawii lipoproteins, suggesting the preferential absence of amide-linked acyl chains. The reasons for the discrepancy with previous data are unknown but may be related to the fact that both Le Hénaff and co-workers (14Jan G. Fontenelle C. Verrier F. Le Hénaff M. Wróblewski H. Curr. Microbiol. 1996; 32: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Nyström et al. (26Nyström S. Johansson K.E. Wieslander A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) analyzed fatty acids that were released from lipoproteins by various chemical treatments. The failure to detach even trace amounts of non-covalently associated lipids from their lipoprotein preparations or imperfection of releasing reactions could have heavily influenced the outcome of their measurements. In our work, we visualized acyl chains attached to N-terminal peptides directly, thus avoiding the issue of contaminating lipids. The only possible source of biases in our method is related to acylpeptide solubility and extraction efficiency. However, the procedure that we developed for lipopeptide extraction from nitrocellulose membranes (mild washes followed by elution at harsh conditions) and thorough control of the wash and elution stages by mass spectrometry makes this possibility unlikely. In addition, the results of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separation of radioactively labeled A. laidlawii lipoproteins reveal that most lipoproteins form predominantly single spots (Fig. 2A), indicating the existence of one major modification, which according to MS analysis is triacylation. The enzyme that is responsible for A. laidlawii lipoprotein acylation remains to be identified. Our method enables us not just to detect lipoprotein N-peptide acylation but also to determine the amounts of different fatty acids linked to a peptide. The ratios of various long chain fatty acids were found to be similar for all A. laidlawii lipoproteins studied. At the same time, these ratios were dramatically different from the fatty acid composition of lipid membranes. Specifically, a strong preference for incorporation of palmitate in lipoproteins was revealed. Changes in membrane composition that resulted from growth temperature change had no effect on the ratios of fatty acid incorporation in lipoproteins. Hence, the fatty acids attached to lipoproteins of A. laidlawii are not correlated with lipid composition of its membrane. MS-MS analysis of A. laidlawii lipoprotein N-terminal peptides revealed that palmitate is exclusively attached via S-glycerol. It therefore follows that selection of N-linked fatty acids is less stringent. Together, these observations point toward specificity of the protein acylation process. The preferential occurrence of palmitates in O-linkages indicates that A. laidlawii lipoprotein diacylglyceryltransferase (Lgt) uses mainly dipalmitoylglycerophospholipid substrate at the first step of lipoprotein biogenesis. This preference may be caused by true specificity of Lgt at the stage of lipid substrate selection or may be an indirect consequence of the local lipid content of the immediate membrane surroundings of Lgt. Development of in vitro protein acylation systems with membranes of defined content should help clarify this important issue. While our work was under review, an important study by Asanuma et al. (27Asanuma M. Kurokawa K. Ichikawa R. Ryu K.H. Chae J.H. Dohmae N. Lee B.L. Nakayama H. FEBS J. 2011; 278: 716-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) appeared where the authors report that SitC and four other major lipoproteins from Staphylococcus aureus are triacylated despite the apparent absence of the lnt (N-acyltransferase) gene in this organism. It therefore appears that triacylation of lipoproteins is a global phenomenon in the bacterial world. It thus follows that a third stage of protein acylation (Fig. 1) exists in microorganisms that lack identifiable lnt homologs. At least in E. coli, the lnt gene is essential (8Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S.I. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). By extension, genes coding for Lnt analogs may be essential in Mollicutes and Gram-positive bacteria. However, in these organisms, N-acylation cannot serve to direct proteins to the outer membrane as this membrane is absent. The physiological significance of N-acylation in Mollicutes and Gram-positive bacteria remains to be determined. Identification of novel enzymes responsible for triacylation in organisms lacking lnt homologs is another important avenue of future research. We thank Dr. V. G. Baykov (Nutrition Institute of the Russian Academy of Medical Science) for standard fatty acid analysis of A. laidlawii lipid membranes and Dr. K.

https://openalex.org/W2013021666,"Background Humans and other animals change the way they perceive the world due to experience. This process has been labeled as perceptual learning, and implies that adult nervous systems can adaptively modify the way in which they process sensory stimulation. However, the mechanisms by which the brain modifies this capacity have not been sufficiently analyzed. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the neural mechanisms of human perceptual learning by combining electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity and the assessment of psychophysical performance during training in a visual search task. All participants improved their perceptual performance as reflected by an increase in sensitivity (d') and a decrease in reaction time. The EEG signal was acquired throughout the entire experiment revealing amplitude increments, specific and unspecific to the trained stimulus, in event-related potential (ERP) components N2pc and P3 respectively. P3 unspecific modification can be related to context or task-based learning, while N2pc may be reflecting a more specific attentional-related boosting of target detection. Moreover, bell and U-shaped profiles of oscillatory brain activity in gamma (30–60 Hz) and alpha (8–14 Hz) frequency bands may suggest the existence of two phases for learning acquisition, which can be understood as distinctive optimization mechanisms in stimulus processing. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that there are reorganizations in several neural processes that contribute differently to perceptual learning in a visual search task. We propose an integrative model of neural activity reorganization, whereby perceptual learning takes place as a two-stage phenomenon including perceptual, attentional and contextual processes."
https://openalex.org/W2001518510,"Hsp70 genes may influence the expression of wing abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster but their effects on variability in quantitative characters and developmental instability are unclear. In this study, we focused on one of the six Hsp70 genes, Hsp70Ba, and investigated its effects on within-and among-individual variability in orbital bristle number, sternopleural bristle number, wing size and wing shape under different environmental conditions. To do this, we studied a newly constructed deletion, Df(3R)ED5579, which encompasses Hsp70Ba and nine non-Hsp genes, in the heterozygous condition and another, Hsp70Ba304, which deletes only Hsp70Ba, in the homozygous condition. We found no significant effect of both deletions on within-individual variation quantified by fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of morphological traits. On the other hand, the Hsp70Ba304/Hsp70Ba304 genotype significantly increased among-individual variation quantified by coefficient of variation (CV) of bristle number and wing size in female, while the Df(3R)ED5579 heterozygote showed no significant effect. The expression level of Hsp70Ba in the deletion heterozygote was 6 to 20 times higher than in control homozygotes, suggesting that the overexpression of Hsp70Ba did not influence developmental stability or canalization significantly. These findings suggest that the absence of expression of Hsp70Ba increases CV of some morphological traits and that HSP70Ba may buffer against environmental perturbations on some quantitative traits."
https://openalex.org/W2033081705,"Division of labour (DoL) is a fundamental organisational principle in human societies, within virtual and robotic swarms and at all levels of biological organisation. DoL reaches a pinnacle in the insect societies where the most widely used model is based on variation in response thresholds among individuals, and the assumption that individuals and stimuli are well-mixed. Here, we present a spatially explicit model of DoL. Our model is inspired by Pierre de Gennes' 'Ant in a Labyrinth' which laid the foundations of an entire new field in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate the emergence, even in a simplified one-dimensional model, of a spatial patterning of individuals and a right-skewed activity distribution, both of which are characteristics of division of labour in animal societies. We then show using a two-dimensional model that the work done by an individual within an activity bout is a sigmoidal function of its response threshold. Furthermore, there is an inverse relationship between the overall stimulus level and the skewness of the activity distribution. Therefore, the difference in the amount of work done by two individuals with different thresholds increases as the overall stimulus level decreases. Indeed, spatial fluctuations of task stimuli are minimised at these low stimulus levels. Hence, the more unequally labour is divided amongst individuals, the greater the ability of the colony to maintain homeostasis. Finally, we show that the non-random spatial distribution of individuals within biological and social systems could be caused by indirect (stigmergic) interactions, rather than direct agent-to-agent interactions. Our model links the principle of DoL with principles in the statistical mechanics and provides testable hypotheses for future experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1968558399,"Background Honeybee foragers can transmit the information concerning the location of food sources to their nestmates using dance communication. We previously used a novel immediate early gene, termed kakusei, to demonstrate that the neural activity of a specific mushroom body (MB) neuron subtype is preferentially enhanced in the forager brain. The sensory information related to this MB neuron activity, however, remained unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we used kakusei to analyze the relationship between MB neuron activity and types of foraging behavior. The number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was higher in the round dancers that had flown a short distance than in the waggle dancers that had flown a long distance. Furthermore, the amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs inversely related to the waggle-phase duration of the waggle dance, which correlates with the flight distance. Using a narrow tunnel whose inside was vertically or axially lined, we manipulated the pattern of visual input, which is received by the foragers during flight, and analysed kakusei expression. The amount of kakusei transcript in the MBs was related to the foraging frequency but not to the tunnel pattern. In contrast, the number of kakusei-positive MB neurons was affected by the tunnel patterns, but not related to foraging frequency. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that the MB neuron activity depends on the foraging frequency, whereas the number of active MB neurons is related to the pattern of visual input received during foraging flight. Our results suggest that the foraging frequency and visual experience during foraging are associated with different MB neural activities."
https://openalex.org/W1991488973,"There is a paradox offered up by the cancer stem cell hypothesis. How are the mixed populations that are characteristic of heterogeneous solid tumors maintained at constant proportion, given their high, and different, mitotic indices? In this study, we evaluate a well-characterized mouse model of human basaloid tumors (induced by the oncogene Wnt1), which comprise mixed populations of mammary epithelial cells resembling their normal basal and luminal counterparts. We show that these cell types are substantially inter-dependent, since the MMTV LTR drives expression of Wnt1 ligand in luminal cells, whereas the functional Wnt1-responsive receptor (Lrp5) is expressed by basal cells, and both molecules are necessary for tumor growth. There is a robust tumor initiating activity (tumor stem cell) in the basal cell population, which is associated with the ability to differentiate into luminal and basal cells, to regenerate the oncogenic paracrine signaling cell pair. However, we found an additional tumor stem cell activity in the luminal cell population. Knowing that tumors depend upon Wnt1-Lrp5, we hypothesized that this stem cell must express Lrp5, and found that indeed, all the stem cell activity could be retrieved from the Lrp5-positive cell population. Interestingly, this reflects post-transcriptional acquisition of Lrp5 protein expression in luminal cells. Furthermore, this plasticity of molecular expression is reflected in plasticity of cell fate determination. Thus, in vitro, Wnt1-expressing luminal cells retro-differentiate to basal cell types, and in vivo, tumors initiated with pure luminal cells reconstitute a robust basal cell subpopulation that is indistinguishable from the populations initiated by pure basal cells. We propose this is an important proof of concept, demonstrating that bipotential tumor stem cells are essential in tumors where oncogenic ligand-receptor pairs are separated into different cell types, and suggesting that Wnt-induced molecular and fate plasticity can close paracrine loops that are usually separated into distinct cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2058473331,"Background CUG-BP and ETR-3-like factor (CELF) proteins regulate tissue- and developmental stage-specific alternative splicing in striated muscle. We previously demonstrated that heart muscle-specific expression of a nuclear dominant negative CELF protein in transgenic mice (MHC-CELFΔ) effectively disrupts endogenous CELF activity in the heart in vivo, resulting in impaired cardiac function. In this study, transgenic mice that express the dominant negative protein under a skeletal muscle-specific promoter (Myo-CELFΔ) were generated to investigate the role of CELF-mediated alternative splicing programs in normal skeletal muscle. Methodology/Principal Findings Myo-CELFΔ mice exhibit modest changes in CELF-mediated alternative splicing in skeletal muscle, accompanied by a reduction of endomysial and perimysial spaces, an increase in fiber size variability, and an increase in slow twitch muscle fibers. Weight gain and mean body weight, total number of muscle fibers, and overall muscle strength were not affected. Conclusions/Significance Although these findings demonstrate that CELF activity contributes to the normal alternative splicing of a subset of muscle transcripts in vivo, the mildness of the effects in Myo-CELFΔ muscles compared to those in MHC-CELFΔ hearts suggests CELF activity may be less determinative for alternative splicing in skeletal muscle than in heart muscle. Nonetheless, even these small changes in CELF-mediated splicing regulation were sufficient to alter muscle organization and muscle fiber properties affected in myotonic dystrophy. This lends further evidence to the hypothesis that dysregulation of CELF-mediated alternative splicing programs may be responsible for the disruption of these properties during muscle pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982793971,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with anti-viral drugs is currently in clinical trials for the prevention of HIV infection. Induction of adaptive immune responses to virus exposures during anti-viral drug administration, i.e., a “chemo-vaccination” effect, could contribute to PrEP efficacy. To study possible chemo-vaccination, we monitored humoral and cellular immune responses in nine rhesus macaques undergoing up to 14 weekly, low-dose SHIVSF162P3 rectal exposures. Six macaques concurrently received PrEP with intermittent, oral Truvada; three were no-PrEP controls. PrEP protected 4 macaques from infection. Two of the four showed evidence of chemo-vaccination, because they developed anti-SHIV CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; SHIV-specific antibodies were not detected. Control macaques showed no anti-SHIV immune responses before infection. Chemo-vaccination-induced T cell responses were robust (up to 3,940 SFU/106 PBMCs), predominantly central memory cells, short-lived (≤22 weeks), and appeared intermittently and with changing specificities. The two chemo-vaccinated macaques were virus-challenged again after 28 weeks of rest, after T cell responses had waned. One macaque was not protected from infection. The other macaque concurrently received additional PrEP. It remained uninfected and T cell responses were boosted during the additional virus exposures. In summary, we document and characterize PrEP-induced T cell chemo-vaccination. Although not protective after subsiding in one macaque, chemo-vaccination-induced T cells warrant more comprehensive analysis during peak responses for their ability to prevent or to control infections after additional exposures. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring these responses in clinical PrEP trials and suggest that a combination of vaccines and PrEP potentially might enhance efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1986984578,"We previously reported that isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), a derivative of oxypurine, inhibits citrulline synthesis by an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that IBMX and other oxypurines containing a 2,6-dione group interfere with the binding of glutamate to the active site of N-acetylglutamate synthetase (NAGS), thereby decreasing synthesis of N-acetylglutamate, the obligatory activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthase-1 (CPS1). The result is reduction of citrulline and urea synthesis. Experiments were performed with (15)N-labeled substrates, purified hepatic CPS1, and recombinant mouse NAGS as well as isolated mitochondria. We also used isolated hepatocytes to examine the action of various oxypurines on ureagenesis and to assess the ameliorating affect of N-carbamylglutamate and/or l-arginine on NAGS inhibition. Among various oxypurines tested, only IBMX, xanthine, or uric acid significantly increased the apparent K(m) for glutamate and decreased velocity of NAGS, with little effect on CPS1. The inhibition of NAGS is time- and dose-dependent and leads to decreased formation of the CPS1-N-acetylglutamate complex and consequent inhibition of citrulline and urea synthesis. However, such inhibition was reversed by supplementation with N-carbamylglutamate. The data demonstrate that xanthine and uric acid, both physiologically occurring oxypurines, inhibit the hepatic synthesis of N-acetylglutamate. An important and novel concept emerging from this study is that xanthine and/or uric acid may have a role in the regulation of ureagenesis and, thus, nitrogen homeostasis in normal and disease states."

Two-chain uPA and uPA-PAI-1 complexes (1-20 nM) increased the permeability of monolayers of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) in vitro and lung permeability in vivo. The effects of uPA-PAI-1 were abrogated by the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME (N(D)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester). Two-chain uPA (1-20 nM) and uPA-PAI-1 induced phosphorylation of endothelial NOS-Ser(1177) in PMVECs, which was followed by generation of NO and the nitrosylation and dissociation of β-catenin from VE-cadherin. uPA-induced phosphorylation of eNOS was decreased by anti-low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP) antibody and an LRP antagonist, receptor-associated protein (RAP), and when binding to the uPA receptor was blocked by the isolated growth factor-like domain of uPA. uPA-induced phosphorylation of eNOS was also inhibited by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, myristoylated PKI, but was not dependent on PI3K-Akt signaling. LRP blockade and inhibition of PKA prevented uPA- and uPA-PAI-1-induced permeability of PMVEC monolayers in vitro and uPA-induced lung permeability in vivo. These studies identify a novel pathway involved in regulating PMVEC permeability and suggest the utility of uPA-based approaches that attenuate untoward permeability following acute lung injury while preserving its salutary effects on fibrinolysis and airway remodeling."

The molecular events that control the cell cycle occur in a sequential process to ensure a tight regulation, which is important for the survival of a cell and includes the detection and repair of genetic damage and the prevention of uncontrolled cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2037923902,"Background Mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons (mDA) and serotonergic (5-HT) neurons are clinically important ventral neuronal populations. Degeneration of mDA is associated with Parkinson's disease; defects in the serotonergic system are related to depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. Although these neuronal subpopulations reveal positional and developmental relationships, the developmental cascades that govern specification and differentiation of mDA or 5-HT neurons reveal missing determinants and are not yet understood. Methodology We investigated the impact of the transcription factor Sim1 in the differentiation of mDA and rostral 5-HT neurons in vivo using Sim1-/- mouse embryos and newborn pups, and in vitro by gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Principal Findings We show a selective significant reduction in the number of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons in Sim1-/- newborn mice. In contrast, 5-HT neurons of other raphe nuclei as well as dopaminergic neurons were not affected. Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanism revealed that tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) and the transcription factor Pet1 are regulated by Sim1. Moreover, the transcription factor Lhx8 and the modulator of 5-HT1A-mediated neurotransmitter release, Rgs4, exhibit significant higher expression in ventral hindbrain, compared to midbrain and are target genes of Sim1. Conclusions The results demonstrate for the first time a selective transcription factor dependence of the 5-HT cell groups, and introduce Sim1 as a regulator of DRN specification acting upstream of Pet1 and Tph2. Moreover, Sim1 may act to modulate serotonin release via regulating RGS4. Our study underscores that subpopulations of a common neurotransmitter phenotype use distinct combinations of transcription factors to control the expression of shared properties."
https://openalex.org/W2074011552,"The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel regulates pancreatic β-cell function by linking metabolic status to electrical activity. Syntaxin-1A (Syn-1A), a SNARE protein mediating exocytotic fusion, binds and inhibits the KATP channel via the nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs) of its sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) regulatory subunit. In this study, we elucidated the precise regions within the NBFs required for Syn-1A-mediated KATP inhibition, using in vitro binding assays, whole cell patch clamp and FRET assay. Specifically, NBF1 and NBF2 were each divided into three subregions, Walker A (WA), signature sequence linker, and Walker B (WB), to make GST fusion proteins. In vitro binding assays revealed that Syn-1A associates with WA and WB regions of both NBFs. Patch clamp recordings on INS-1 and primary rat β-cells showed that Syn-1A-mediated channel inhibition was reversed by co-addition of NBF1-WB (not NBF1-WA), NBF2-WA, and NBF2-WB. The findings were corroborated by FRET studies showing that these truncates disrupted Syn-1A interactions with full-length SUR1. To further identify the binding sites, series single-site mutations were made in the Walker motifs of the NBFs. Only NBF1-WA (K719M) or NBF2-WA (K1385M) mutant no longer bound to Syn-1A; K1385M failed to disrupt Syn-1A-mediated inhibition of KATP channels. These data suggest that NBF1-WA (Lys-719) and NBF2-WA (Lys-1385) are critical for Syn-1A-KATP channel interaction. Taken together, Syn-1A intimately and functionally associates with the SUR1-NBF1/2 dimer via direct interactions with WA motifs and sites adjacent to WB motifs of NBF1 and NBF2 but transduces its inhibitory actions on KATP channel activity via some but not all of these NBF domains.

Harrison D.E. Ashcroft S.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Under resting metabolic conditions, the KATP channel is primarily responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential. Upon an increase in cytosolic ATP, as a result of increased glucose uptake and metabolism, the KATP channel closes, causing the membrane to depolarize. This consequently activates voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and ultimately triggers insulin exocytosis (2Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The KATP channel is an octameric complex composed of four repeats of two distinct subunits: the central pore-forming Kir6.2 and the regulatory SUR1 (3Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement 4th, J.P. Namba N.

Each NBF (see Fig. 1A) contains three characteristic motifs: Walker A (WA), linker or signature sequence, and Walker B (WB). It is primarily through these motifs that the NBFs are able to coordinate molecules of ATP, a process essential to proper nucleotide regulation of the channel (9Campbell J.D. Sansom M.S.

In the context of the pancreatic islet β-cell and insulin exocytosis, we have previously shown that Syntaxin-1A (Syn-1A), a core member of this SNARE complex, appears to play multiple roles during this secretory process, effectively regulating various channels involved in both the triggering and cessation of membrane fusion (15Leung Y.M. Kwan E.P. Ng B. Kang Y. Gaisano H.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To date, Syn-1A has been demonstrated to regulate β-cell voltage-gated K+ channels (16Michaelevski I. Chikvashvili D. Tsuk S. Fili O. Lohse M.J. Singer-Lahat D. Lotan I. J. Biol.

Syn-1A perhaps possesses a conserved binding pocket in all of these molecules; or alternatively, Syn-1A could be a structurally flexible molecule capable of assuming many conformations that render specificity to respective ion channels in the local neighborhood (microdomain) of the plasma membrane. Syn-1A is indeed distributed along the entire plasma membrane of neurons and neuroendocrine cells (including β-cells) to be involved in not only the exocytotic apparatus per se (i.e. synapse) but also ion channels (K+) located more distantly from exocytotic sites (15Leung Y.M. Kwan E.P. Ng B. Kang Y. Gaisano H.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For β-cell KATP channels, we had shown that Syn-1A binds SUR1 at both NBF1 and NBF2 and not the Kir6.2 subunit (19Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol.

Furthermore, it appears that at least some Syn-1A is endogenously bound to the β-cell KATP channels, because botulinum neurotoxin C1 proteolytic cleavage of endogenous Syn-1A increased KATP channel activity (19Pasyk E.A.

Moreover, physiologic changes in cytosolic ATP concentrations in β-cells could profoundly modulate Syn-1A interactions with KATP channels presumably acting on Walker motifs (21Kang Y. Zhang Y.

These NBFs are large with complex functional domains; thus this work was directed at examining what putative domains within SUR1-NBF1 and -NBF2 bind Syn-1A to transduce Syn-1A inhibitory actions on insulin-secreting β-cell KATP channels. The INS-1 (832/13) cell line was a gift from Dr. Christopher Newgard (Duke University Medical Centre, Durham, NC). The cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. One day prior to whole cell voltage clamp recordings, the cells were trypsinized and plated onto glass coverslips. For binding studies, we used HEK293 cells infected with recombinant adenoviruses containing wild type rat Kir6.2 with a tetracycline-inhibited transactivator, and wild type hamster SUR1 expressed in a tetracycline-inhibited transactivator-regulated gene (both gifts from Dr. S. L. Shyng, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR) (22Lin Y.W. Bushman J.D. Yan F.F. Haidar S. MacMullen C. Ganguly A. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. J. Biol.

The transfected HEK cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM high glucose 1× with l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For overexpression of Syn-1A, the HEK cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Syn-1A using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For FRET imaging studies, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Syn-1A-mCherry and SUR1-EGFP (gift from Dr. C. G. Nichols, Washington University, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) plus Kir6.2 (gift from Dr. S. Seino, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were examined 2 days post-transfection. Islets were isolated from male Wistar rats by collagenase digestion as described previously 0.015% trypsin (17Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsuk S. Lotan I. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17532-17538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Dispersed single β-cells for electrophysiological recordings were obtained by islet treatment with 0.015% trypsin in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were plated on glass coverslips and cultured in 2.8 mm glucose (with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 0.25% sodium, and 100 g/ml streptomycin) prior to recordings. The pGEX 4T-1-Syn-1A plasmid was a gift from W. Trimble (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). The constructs (see Fig. 1A) expressing truncated SUR1-NBF1 and -NBF2 containing WA (NBF1, amino acids 696–731; NBF2, amino acids 1358–1397), linker (NBF1, amino acids 732–841; NBF2, 1398–1493), or WB (NBF1, amino acids 842–894; NBF2, amino acids 1494–1536), respectively, were generated using the PCR method and hamster SUR1 as template (a gift from Dr. Lydia Aguilar-Bryan, Pacific Northwest Diabetes Research Institute, Seattle, WA). Mutants on WA and WB motifs in these truncated NBF1 (K719M and D854N, respectively) and NBF2 (K1385M and D1506N, respectively) regions were also generated (see Fig. 5A) using QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing (ACGT Corp., Toronto, Canada). The resulting PCR products were subsequently cloned into the pGEX 4T-1 vector for expression as GST fusion proteins. GST fusion protein expression and purification were performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Syn-1A was obtained by cleavage of GST-Syn-1A immobilized on agarose beads using thrombin (Sigma). In vitro binding assays were performed as described previously (19Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with thrombin-cleaved Syn-1A (10 μg) in 250 μl of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C for 2 h with constant agitation. The beads were then washed twice with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KOAC, 1 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100). The precipitated proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and identified with specific antibody against Syn-1A (1:2000; Sigma). For binding assays using overexpressed Syn-1A cell lysate, the transfected HEK293 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in lysis buffer (15 mm MES plus 15 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1.5% Triton X-100, 2 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were sonicated on ice (30 s/1 ml) and then left on ice for 30 min before removal of insoluble material by centrifugation at 55,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min. GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione agarose beads (400 pmol each) were each individually incubated with cell lysate extract (300 μg) at 4 °C for 2 h. The samples were then washed with lysis buffer, separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, and probed for Syn-1A by Western blot analysis. Whole cell patch clamping recordings (ruptured) were made from INS-1 and β-cells using an EPC-9 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Pipettes were pulled from 1.5-mm borosilicate glass capillary tubes and were fire-polished to a tip resistance of 3–5 MΩ. Pipettes were filled with intracellular solution containing 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH). External bath solution contained 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.6 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.3 with NaOH). Recombinant proteins were premixed with intracellular pipette solution (1 μm or as indicated) and delivered to cell cytosol through the patch pipette after whole cell configuration was made. Current was evoked by a series of 250-ms step voltage protocols of −110 mV stimulating potential from a holding potential of −70 mV. Maximum current was verified by the recording of 10 consecutive pulses with no further increase after a suspected maximum to ensure no larger current was observed. Tolbutamide (0.3 mm) was added to the bath solution following maximum current to verify the current identity. Current density (pA/pF), as a means of normalization across different cells, was calculated by dividing the current over cell membrane capacitance. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. All of the recordings were performed at room temperature. FRET imaging was performed as we recently reported (21Kang Y. Zhang Y. Liang T. Leung Y.M. Ng B. Xie H. Chang N. Chan J. Shyng S.L. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5876-5883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were plated on autoclaved glass coverslips overnight and then imaged in intracellular buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm NaCl, 140 mm potassium gluconate, and 1 MgCl2, and pre-equilibrated with 95:5 O2:CO2, pH 7.4) at 37 °C using an Nikon TE-2001U inverted microscope fitted with an argon laser unit (480 ± 10 nm; Spectra-Physics), a helium-neon laser units (545 ± 10 nm; Melles Griot), and a Quantum 512SC charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) controlled by NIS software (Nikon). For FRET measurements, a Plan apo ×60 oil immersion objective (1.65 NA), a Dual-View imaging system (Optical Insights, Tucson, AZ) containing a EGFP/mCherry dual band dichroic splitter (565dcxr), and an emission filter (HQ530/30 for EGFP and HQ630/50 for mCherry) were combined together to allow simultaneous two-channel monitoring of emission fluorescence. The images were acquired at 900-ms exposure time. The cells were permeabilized by incubation in intracellular buffer containing digitonin (50 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequently maintained in intracellular buffer. For FRET image analysis, EGFP fused with SUR1 was used as FRET donor and mCherry fused with Syn-1A as FRET acceptor. Four images including donor excitation/donor emission (Dd), donor excitation/acceptor emission (Da), acceptor excitation/acceptor emission (Aa), and acceptor excitation/donor emission (Ad) were acquired in the same condition in each FRET experiment. In addition, donor-only sample and acceptor-only sample were acquired as part of the FRET protocol before each experiment for calculation of bleedthrough. FRET efficiency was used to indicate the interaction of the two proteins, calculated as FRETcorr = FRETraw − (CoB × DdFRET) − (CoA × AaFRET)). FRET efficiency% = (FRETcorr/DdFRET)*100%. CoB means the amount of donor bleedthrough in the absence of an acceptor, and CoA means the amount of acceptor bleedthrough in the absence of a donor. To examine only the molecular interactions of Syn-1A and SUR1 on the surface of the plasma membrane and avoid contamination from intracellular FRET signals, we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to optically isolate the plasma membrane, enabling high spatial image resolution of the protein interactions on entire surfaces of the plasma membrane. This advantage of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is attributed to the exponentially decaying evanescent wave that enables illumination of only the fluorescent signal within a thin layer (<200 nm) at and beneath the plasma membrane and thus significantly reduces out-of-focus background fluorescence. For statistical analysis of FRET efficiency, we draw regions of interest around the entire area of the plasma surface expressing any FRET signal (in blue, green, and red; see pseudocolor bar) as indicated and do not include the purple areas where there is no FRET signal. For example, see Fig. 4A(i). From these regions of interest, we calculated the average FRET efficiency and then tracked the change of FRET efficiency in the same region of interest under the indicated different conditions. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis of electrophysiology and FRET data were carried out using SigmaStat v3.1 (Systat Software Inc.). Differences between experimental groups were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey post hoc test with p < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. We reported previously that NBF1 and NBF2 of SUR1 appear to encode the binding domains for Syn-1A to inhibit insulin secreting islet β-cell KATP channels (19Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Cui N. Kang Y. He Y. Leung Y.M. Xie H. Pasyk E.A. Gao X. Sheu L. Hansen J.B. Wahl P. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53259-53265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that Syn-1A must require specific putative subdomains within each NBFs to coordinate protein assembly and transduce channel regulation onto the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit. To further identify the putative regions in each NBF critical for this interaction, NBF truncations were constructed and expressed as GST fusion proteins. Specifically, each NBF was divided into three individual sections (Fig. 1A), each containing a characteristic motif: WA (NBF1, amino acids 696–731; NBF2, amino acids 1358–1397), linker (NBF1, amino acids 732–841; NBF2, amino acids 1398–1493), and WB (NBF1, amino acids 842–894; NBF2, amino acids 1494–1536). Each set of the three truncated domains proteins would encompass the full-length region of NBF1 (amino acids 696–894) and NBF2 (amino acids 1358–1536). When applied to in vitro GST-binding assays, the truncated fragments containing NBF1-WA, NBF1-WB, NBF2-WA, and NBF2-WB bound to agarose beads were all individually able to pull down thrombin-cleaved recombinant Syn-1A (Fig. 1, B and C). Similar results were obtained when using cell lysate of HEK293 cells overexpressing Syn-1A (data not shown), that these NBF fragments pulled down expressed Syn-1A. In contrast, NBF1-linker and NBF2-linker containing fragments were unable to pull down Syn-1A. Full-length NBF1 and NBF2 were included as positive controls, each of which bound to Syn-1A as previously reported (19Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the domains on NBF1 that bind Syn-1A would transduce Syn-1A inhibitory actions on KATP channels. This was examined through whole cell patch clamp analysis on the rat insulinoma INS-1 cell line (23Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). As per our previous study (19Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), recombinant proteins were introduced into the cell interior via patch pipette during dialysis, which also allowed for washout of cytosolic ATP and thus maximization of KATP channel current. We first compared the effect of GST-syn-1A (positive control) with GST-only (negative control) on the current to confirm the inhibitory effect of Syn-1A on KATP, as previously reported (19Pasyk E.A.

As shown in Fig. 2, the current density (pA/pF) recorded from GST-Syn-1A (1 μm) dialyzed INS-1 cells (97.9 ± 3.3 pA/pF; n = 20) was 36% less than that from GST (1 μm) control cells (151.9 ± 4.6 pA/pF; n = 19). Having established the base level of the Syn-1A-induced current inhibition, we then proceeded to investigate combinations of GST-Syn-1A with single truncated proteins. GST-Syn-1A was premixed with a NBF truncate in equal concentrations (1 μm) in the pipette solution before loading and establishment of whole cell configuration. This allowed GST-Syn-1A to prebind the recombinant NBF truncate protein first (assuming interaction), thus blocking the ability of Syn-1A to functionally interact with endogenous SUR1. Co-dialysis of GST-Syn-1A with NBF1-WA (112.2 ± 5.6 pA/pF; n = 15) or NBF1-linker (112.6 ± 5.9 pA/pF; n = 10) yielded current densities similar to that of the Syn-1A positive control (p > 0.05), indicative of the fact that neither NBF1-WA nor linker could interrupt Syn-1A action on KATP channel activity. In contrast, the NBF1-WB significantly reduced Syn-1A blockade of KATP channels (133.5 ± 10.7 pA/pF; n = 9; p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). Because Syn-1A inhibition remained despite co-dialysis with WA or the linker, we dialyzed these NBF truncates into the cells alone to ensure that they were not able to inhibit current activity. Indeed, when dialyzed alone, both NBF1-WA (150 ± 4.9 pA/pF; n = 7) and NBF1-linker (148.7 ± 5.7 pA/pF; n = 8) yielded current densities similar to GST control cells. Because cell lines, although excellent surrogate models, may not completely represent the true physiological model, we proceeded to confirm our results on freshly isolated rat pancreatic islet β-cells (Fig. 3A). Similar to that seen in INS-1 cells, GST-Syn-1A reduced current activity by 39% (75.5 ± 3.2 pA/pF; n = 6) when compared with GST control currents (123.7 ± 8.2 pA/pF; n = 6, p < 0.05) (left traces in Fig. 3A and summary in Fig. 3B). The addition of NBF1-WB (middle bottom trace) significantly reversed Syn-1A-mediated inhibition with resulting current activity of 114.2 ± 2.5 pA/pF (n = 5, p < 0.05), whereas NBF1-WA (middle top trace, 84.5 ± 5.2 pA/pF; n = 5) or NBF1-linker (middle trace, 89.4 ± 6.7 pA/pF; n = 5) did not affect the Syn-1A block. Taken together, our data showed that although Syn-1A bound to both NBF1-WA and -WB domains in SUR1 (Fig. 1B), its binding of WB domain transduces Syn-1A inhibition of KATP channel activity. The WA domain of NBF1 thus appears to play a more important role in stabilizing the binding of Syn-1A without actually transducing Syn-1A actions. We next examined the functional roles of NBF2 domains in Syn-1A-mediated blockade effect on KATP channels, using the similar approaches for NBF1. In INS-1 cells, co-dialysis of GST-Syn-1A with NBF2-WA (153.5 ± 9.6 pA/pF; n = 10) and NBF2-WB (149.7 ± 8.8 pA/pF; n = 10) yielded currents significantly different from the Syn-1A but not the GST control cells (Fig. 2). Similar to NBF1, NBF2-linker (105.3 ± 6.6 pA/pF; n = 10) was unable to significantly suppress Syn-1A-mediated channel inhibition. Once again, to ensure that the NBF2-linker truncate was unable to inhibit the channel alone, we dialyzed it into cells alone and yielded currents similar to GST control cells (151.1 ± 4.8 pA/pF; n = 8). Findings from the INS-1 cell line were again verified in primary rat islet β-cells (Fig. 3A, right traces), which yielded results identical to those of INS-1 cells. NBF2-WA (103.2 ± 3.7 pA/pF; n = 5) and NBF2-WB (118.8 ± 6.7 pA/pF; n = 5) were both able to significantly reverse Syn-1A-mediated inhibition but not NBF2-linker (86.1 ± 10.2 pA/pF; n = 5) (Fig. 3B). As with NBF1, the NBF2-linker truncate was not predicted to have a functional effect on Syn-1A inhibition of channel activity based on GST binding assay results. Therefore, for NBF2, it appears that Syn-1A interaction with both WA and WB regions are required for functional inhibition of the KATP channel. Based on binding and functional data, Syn-1A is able to coordinate at NBF1/NBF2 via the WA and WB domains; however, it would appear that only three of four of these Walker domains are critical for transducing channel inhibition. SUR1 exists in highly complex intramolecular interactions, including the formation of the NBF1 and NBF2 dimer, and intermolecular interactions with the Kir6.2 subunit. It is possible that Syn-1A intimately binds to the NBF1/2 dimer along with the existing SUR1/Kir6.2 complex and thus regulates the KATP channel properties. We thus explored this possibility to test whether each of these small Syn-1A-binding NBF subdomains is sufficient to disrupt this intimate association of this tri-protein complex in vivo. Here, we employed FRET analysis in living cells expressing these three interacting proteins in their physiological configuration and targeted to their native compartment, the plasma membrane, as we had recently reported (21Kang Y. Zhang Y. Liang T. Leung Y.M. Ng B. Xie H. Chang N. Chan J. Shyng S.L. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol.

The quantitative traits that map to environmental variables are underlain by hundreds or thousands of interacting genes whose allele frequencies and epistatic relationships must change appropriately for adaptation to occur. Extending an earlier model in which individuals possess an ecologically-critical trait encoded by gene networks of 16 to 256 genes and random or scale-free topology, I test the hypothesis that smaller, scale-free networks permit longer persistence times in a constantly-changing environment. Genetic architecture interacting with the rate of environmental change accounts for 78% of the variance in trait heritability and 66% of the variance in population persistence times. When the rate of environmental change is high, the relationship between network size and heritability is apparent, with smaller and scale-free networks conferring a distinct advantage for persistence time. However, when the rate of environmental change is very slow, the relationship between network size and heritability disappears and populations persist the duration of the simulations, without regard to genetic architecture. These results provide a link between genes and population dynamics that may be tested as the -omics and bioinformatics fields mature, and as we are able to determine the genetic basis of ecologically-relevant quantitative traits."
https://openalex.org/W2000164723,"Choanoflagellates are considered to be the closest living unicellular relatives of metazoans. The genome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis contains a surprisingly high number and diversity of tyrosine kinases, tyrosine phosphatases, and phosphotyrosine-binding domains. Many of the tyrosine kinases possess combinations of domains that have not been observed in any multicellular organism. The role of these protein interaction domains in M. brevicollis kinase signaling is not clear. Here, we have carried out a biochemical characterization of Monosiga HMTK1, a protein containing a putative PTB domain linked to a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain. We cloned, expressed, and purified HMTK1, and we demonstrated that it possesses tyrosine kinase activity. We used immobilized peptide arrays to define a preferred ligand for the third PTB domain of HMTK1. Peptide sequences containing this ligand sequence are phosphorylated efficiently by recombinant HMTK1, suggesting that the PTB domain of HMTK1 has a role in substrate recognition analogous to the SH2 and SH3 domains of mammalian Src family kinases. We suggest that the substrate recruitment function of the noncatalytic domains of tyrosine kinases arose before their roles in autoinhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2013174192,"The association between obesity in adults and excess morbidity and mortality is well established, but the health impact throughout adult life of being obese in early adulthood needs elucidation. We investigated somatic morbidity, including fatal morbidity, throughout adulthood in men starting adult life as obese.Among 362,200 Danish young men, examined for military service between 1943 and 1977, all obese (defined as BMI≥31.0 kg/m(2)), and, as controls, a random 1% sample of the others was identified. In the age range of 18-25 years, there were 1,862 obese, which encompass the men above the 99.5 percentile, and 3,476 controls. Information on morbidity was obtained via national registers. Cox regression models were used to estimate the relative morbidity assessed as first incidence of disease, occurrence of disease in the year preceding death and prevalent disease at time of death.From age 18 through 80 years the obese had an increased risk of becoming diseased by or die from a broad range of diseases. Generally, the incidence of first event, occurrence in the year prior to death, and prevalence at time of death showed the same pattern. As an example, the relative hazard of type 2 diabetes was constant throughout life at 4.9 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 4.1-5.9), 5.2 (95% CI: 3.6-7.5), and 6.8 (95% CI: 4.6-10.1), respectively.Our findings strongly support the continued need to avoid beginning adult life as obese, as obese young men experience an increased morbidity, including fatal morbidity, from many diseases throughout life."
https://openalex.org/W1984397594,"Ecologists have increasingly come to understand that evolutionary change on short time-scales can alter ecological dynamics (and vice-versa), and this idea is being incorporated into community ecology research programs. Previous research has suggested that the size and topology of the gene network underlying a quantitative trait should constrain or facilitate adaptation and thereby alter population dynamics. Here, I consider a scenario in which two species with different genetic architectures compete and evolve in fluctuating environments. An important trade-off emerges between adaptive accuracy and adaptive speed, driven by the size of the gene network underlying the ecologically-critical trait and the rate of environmental change. Smaller, scale-free networks confer a competitive advantage in rapidly-changing environments, but larger networks permit increased adaptive accuracy when environmental change is sufficiently slow to allow a species time to adapt. As the differences in network characteristics increase, the time-to-resolution of competition decreases. These results augment and refine previous conclusions about the ecological implications of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, emphasizing a role of adaptive accuracy. Along with previous work, in particular that considering the role of gene network connectivity, these results provide a set of expectations for what we may observe as the field of ecological genomics develops."
