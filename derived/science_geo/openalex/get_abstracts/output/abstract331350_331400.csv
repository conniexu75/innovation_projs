https://openalex.org/W1991654210,"Independent domestication of sorghum, rice, and maize involved convergent selection for large seeds, reduced disarticulation of the mature inflorescence, and daylength-insensitive flowering. These similar phenotypes are largely determined by a small number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that correspond closely in the three taxa. The correspondence of these QTLs transcends 65 million years of reproductive isolation. This finding supports models of quantitative inheritance that invoke relatively few genes, obviates difficulties in map-based cloning of QTLs, and impels the comparative mapping of complex pheno-types across large evolutionary distances, such as those that separate humans from rodents and domesticated mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2058489963,"A coupled ocean-atmosphere data assimilation procedure yields improved forecasts of El Niño for the 1980s compared with previous forecasting procedures. As in earlier forecasts with the same model, no oceanic data were used, and only wind information was assimilated. The improvement is attributed to the explicit consideration of air-sea interaction in the initialization. These results suggest that EI Niño is more predictable than previously estimated, but that predictability may vary on decadal or longer time scales. This procedure also eliminates the well-known spring barrier to EI Niño prediction, which implies that it may not be intrinsic to the real climate system."

This information has implications for the phase relations of iron in Earth's core."
https://openalex.org/W2033223258,"Molecular assemblies held together by weak intermolecular bonds exhibit a rich variety of geometries. Even a simple complex formed by only two molecules can adopt several conformations corresponding to different geometrical isomers. Isomers of small polar dimers can be isolated nondestructively by taking advantage of a selective and reversible ionization process, with the use of a mass spectrometry method that allows the determination and control of the geometrical configuration of neutral or negatively charged molecular complexes in supersonic beams. Here, the method is applied to isolated nucleic acid base pairs that can be selected in stacked or H-bonded configurations."
https://openalex.org/W2053106963,"Spiral-defect populations in low-Prandtl number Rayleigh-Bénard convection with slow rotation about a vertical axis were measured in carbon dioxide at high pressure. The results indicate that spirals act like ""thermally excited"" defects and that the winding direction of a spiral is analogous to a magnetic spin. Rotation about a vertical axis, the spiral analog of the magnetic field, breaks the zero-rotation chiral symmetry between clockwise and counterclockwise spiral defects. Many properties of spiral-defect statistics are well described by an effective statistical-mechanical model."

https://openalex.org/W2026379034,This article discusses the conclusions of a National Academy of Sciences panel that examined the US governments`s global change research program. The panel report rebuits some Republican changes that the program was designed by Democrates fixated on global warming fears. Instead it comments that the research explores fundamental questions about geophysical forces on Early. However the panel criticizes the White House for inadequate attention and legislators for inadequate and reliable support.
