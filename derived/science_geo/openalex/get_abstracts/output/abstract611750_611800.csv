https://openalex.org/W2806569362,"Food's environmental impacts are created by millions of diverse producers. To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers."

An essential step to address this knowledge gap is to measure the dynamics of neuromodulatory signals while simultaneously manipulating the elements of the target circuit during behavior. Patriarchi et al. developed fluorescent protein–based dopamine indicators to visualize spatial and temporal release of dopamine directly with high fidelity and resolution. In the cortex, two-photon imaging with these indicators was used to map dopamine activity at cellular resolution. Science , this issue p. eaat4422"
https://openalex.org/W2806766210,"A common theme in the self-organization of multicellular tissues is the use of cell-cell signaling networks to induce morphological changes. We used the modular synNotch juxtacrine signaling platform to engineer artificial genetic programs in which specific cell-cell contacts induced changes in cadherin cell adhesion. Despite their simplicity, these minimal intercellular programs were sufficient to yield assemblies with hallmarks of natural developmental systems: robust self-organization into multidomain structures, well-choreographed sequential assembly, cell type divergence, symmetry breaking, and the capacity for regeneration upon injury. The ability of these networks to drive complex structure formation illustrates the power of interlinking cell signaling with cell sorting: Signal-induced spatial reorganization alters the local signals received by each cell, resulting in iterative cycles of cell fate branching. These results provide insights into the evolution of multicellularity and demonstrate the potential to engineer customized self-organizing tissues or materials."

Reardon et al. surveyed the cortical and subcortical structure of more than 3000 human brains by noninvasive imaging (see the Perspective by Van Essen). They found that the scaling of different regions across the range of brain sizes is not consistent: Some brain regions are metabolically costly and are favored in larger brains. This shifts the balance between associative and sensorimotor brain systems in a brain size–dependent way. Science , this issue p. 1222 ; see also p. 1184"

https://openalex.org/W2806867830,"This paper documents a positive relationship between maize productivity in western Kenya and women's empowerment in agriculture, measured using indicators derived from the abbreviated version of the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index. Applying a cross-sectional instrumental-variable regression method to a data set of 707 maize farm households from western Kenya, we find that women's empowerment in agriculture significantly increases maize productivity. Although all indicators of women's empowerment significantly increase productivity, there is no significant association between the women's workload (amount of time spent working) and maize productivity. Furthermore, the results show heterogenous effects with respect to women's empowerment on maize productivity for farm plots managed jointly by a male and female and plots managed individually by only a male or female. More specifically, the results suggest that female- and male-managed plots experience significant improvements in productivity when the women who tend them are empowered. These findings provide evidence that women's empowerment contributes not only to reducing the gender gap in agricultural productivity, but also to improving, specifically, productivity from farms managed by women. Thus, rural development interventions in Kenya that aim to increase agricultural productivity-and, by extension, improve food security and reduce poverty-could achieve greater impact by integrating women's empowerment into existing and future projects."
https://openalex.org/W2806586030,"Intercropping is an important agronomic practice adopted to increase crop production and resource efficiency in areas with intensive agricultural production. Two sequential field trials were conducted in 2015–2016 to investigate the effect of shading on the morphological features, leaf structure, and photosynthetic characteristics of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system. Three treatments were designed on the basis of different row configurations A1 (“50 cm + 50 cm” one row of maize and one row of soybean with a 50 cm spacing between the rows), A2 (“160 cm + 40 cm” two rows of maize by wide-narrow row planting, where two rows of soybean were planted in the wide rows with a width of 40 cm, and with 60 cm row spacing was used between the maize and soybean rows), and CK (sole cropping of soybean, with 70 cm rows spacing). Results showed that the photosynthetically active radiation transmittances of soybean canopy at V5 stage under A2 treatment (31.1%) were considerably higher than those under A1 (8.7%) treatment, and the red-to-far-red ratio was reduced significantly under A1 (0.7) and A2 (1.0) treatments compared with those under CK (1.2). By contrast with CK, stem diameter, total aboveground biomass, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate decreased significantly except plant height under A1 and A2. The thickness of palisade tissue and spongy tissue of soybean leaf under A1 and A2 were significantly reduced at V5 stage compared with CK. The leaf thicknesses under A1 and A2 were lower than those in CK by 39.5% and 18.2%, respectively. At the R1 stage of soybean (after maize harvest), the soybean plant height, stem biomass, leaf biomass and petiole biomass under A1 and A2 treatments were still significantly lower than those under CK, but no significant differences were observed in Chl a/b, Pn, epidermis thickness and spongy tissue thickness of soybean leaves in A2 compared with CK. In addition, the soybean yields (g plant-1) under A1 and A2 were 54.69% and 16.83% lower than those in CK, respectively. These findings suggested that soybean plants can regulate its morphological characteristics and leaf anatomical structures under different light environments."

Telfer et al. used images taken by the New Horizons spacecraft to identify dunes in the Sputnik Planitia region on Pluto (see the Perspective by Hayes). Modeling shows that these dunes could be formed by sand-sized grains of solid methane ice transported in typical Pluto winds. The methane grains could have been lofted into the atmosphere by the melting of surrounding nitrogen ice or blown down from nearby mountains. Understanding how dunes form under Pluto conditions will help with interpreting similar features found elsewhere in the solar system. Science , this issue p. 992 ; see also p. 960"
https://openalex.org/W2805178508,"Inflammation is a major driver of tumor progression and metastasis, although the mechanisms by which proinflammatory cytokines drive metastatic invasion are unknown. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that is elevated in individuals with pancreatic cancer (PDAC), is required for PDAC progression in mice, and increases tumor cell invasion in vitro. Here, we provide insights into the mechanisms by which IL-6 activates tumor cell invasion. We found that IL-6 stimulation rapidly and robustly activates the small GTPase cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) in human PDAC cells and promotes the formation of premigratory filopodia. The CDC42 activation was required for IL-6–induced invasion as blocking CDC42 activity rendered the cells insensitive to IL-6's proinvasive effects. Loss of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) prevented IL-6–mediated CDC42 activation, indicating that IL-6 activates CDC42 through both JAK2 and STAT3. However, the rapid activation of CDC42 suggested that this activation may be distinct from canonical STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation. Importantly, we observed an interaction between STAT3 and IQ motif–containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), a scaffolding platform that binds CDC42. STAT3 colocalized with CDC42 and IQGAP1 at the plasma membrane, suggesting cross-talk between IL-6–mediated STAT3 signaling and CDC42 activation. These results suggest that IL-6 promotes metastatic invasion, at least partially, through CDC42 and that, along with its pleiotropic effects on tumor growth and progression, IL-6 signaling also activates proinvasive GTPase signaling, priming tumor cells for metastatic invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2805481869,"Membrane association of α-synuclein (α-syn), a neuronal protein associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), is involved in α-syn function and pathology. Most previous studies on α-syn–membrane interactions have not used the physiologically relevant N-terminally acetylated (N-acetyl) α-syn form nor the most naturally abundant cellular lipid, i.e. phosphatidylcholine (PC). Here, we report on how PC membrane fluidity affects the conformation and aggregation propensity of N-acetyl α-syn. It is well established that upon membrane binding, α-syn adopts an α-helical structure. Using CD spectroscopy, we show that N-acetyl α-syn transitions from α-helical to disordered at the lipid melting temperature (Tm). We found that this fluidity sensing is a robust characteristic, unaffected by acyl chain length (Tm = 34–55 °C) and preserved in its homologs β- and γ-syn. Interestingly, both N-acetyl α-syn membrane binding and amyloid formation trended with lipid order (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) > 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/sphingomyelin/cholesterol (2:2:1) ≥ DOPC), with gel-phase vesicles shortening aggregation kinetics and promoting fibril formation compared to fluid membranes. Furthermore, we found that acetylation enhances binding to PC micelles and small unilamellar vesicles with high curvature (r ∼16–20 nm) and that DPPC binding is reduced in the presence of cholesterol. These results confirmed that the exposure of hydrocarbon chains (i.e. packing defects) is essential for binding to zwitterionic gel membranes. Collectively, our in vitro results suggest that N-acetyl α-syn localizes to highly curved, ordered membranes inside a cell. We propose that age-related changes in membrane fluidity can promote the formation of amyloid fibrils, insoluble materials associated with PD."
https://openalex.org/W2805541004,"Small molecules not only represent cellular building blocks and metabolic intermediates, but also regulatory ligands and signaling molecules that interact with proteins. Although these interactions affect cellular metabolism, growth, and development, they have been largely understudied. Herein, we describe a method, which we named PROtein–Metabolite Interactions using Size separation (PROMIS), that allows simultaneous, global analysis of endogenous protein–small molecule and of protein–protein complexes. To this end, a cell-free native lysate from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, followed by quantitative metabolomic and proteomic analyses. Proteins and small molecules showing similar elution behavior, across protein-containing fractions, constituted putative interactors. Applying PROMIS to an A. thaliana extract, we ascertained known protein–protein (PPIs) and protein–metabolite (PMIs) interactions and reproduced binding between small-molecule protease inhibitors and their respective proteases. More importantly, we present examples of two experimental strategies that exploit the PROMIS dataset to identify novel PMIs. By looking for similar elution behavior of metabolites and enzymes belonging to the same biochemical pathways, we identified putative feedback and feed-forward regulations in pantothenate biosynthesis and the methionine salvage cycle, respectively. By combining PROMIS with an orthogonal affinity purification approach, we identified an interaction between the dipeptide Tyr–Asp and the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In summary, we present proof of concept for a powerful experimental tool that enables system-wide analysis of PMIs and PPIs across all biological systems.

The dataset obtained here comprises nearly 140 metabolites and 5000 proteins, which can be mined for putative interactors. Small molecules represent cellular building blocks and metabolic intermediates and also regulatory ligands and signaling molecules, exerting their functions via interaction with macromolecules, most commonly proteins. In fact, one way to see the cell is as “an entity in which proteins are embedded in a sea of metabolites” (1.Li X. Snyder M. Metabolites as global regulators: a new view of protein regulation.Bioessays. 2011; 33 (21495048): 485-48910.1002/bies.201100026Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In line with this, it has been speculated that many more small molecules than known today interact, and by doing so they modulate the function of their protein partners (2.Yang G.X. Li X. Snyder M. Investigating metabolite–protein interactions: an overview of available techniques.Methods. 2012; 57 (22750303): 459-46610.1016/j.ymeth.2012.06.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3.Tholl D.

Recent years have seen significant technological advances, allowing for “omics”-scale analysis of PMIs, starting either from a protein or a metabolite of interest that is used to capture the respective metabolite or protein partners from native cellular lysate. Advances in proteomics and metabolomics, increased sensitivity, and better compound identification helped in improving PMI studies. The most promising approaches include the following: 1) purification and characterization of protein–metabolite complexes using affinity-tagged protein baits (4.Li X. Gianoulis T.A. Yip K.Y.

While showing certain success, these methods are limited to the metabolite or protein bait, and thus are not suitable for global analysis of PMIs. We therefore set out to test other approaches that allow a system-wide detection of metabolite–protein complexes and that thereby obviate the need for metabolite or protein bait (11.Veyel D. Kierszniowska S. Kosmacz M. Sokolowska E.M. Michaelis A. Luzarowski M. Szlachetko J. Willmitzer L. Skirycz A. System-wide detection of protein-small molecule complexes suggests extensive metabolite regulation in plants.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28205532): 4238710.1038/srep42387Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our starting point was the notion that the small-molecule pool of each biological system is distributed between two states: either bound to a protein (subsequently called “bound”) or not bound to a protein (subsequently called “free”). These two forms differ in one main and simple parameter, size. Thus, employing size-separation methods should separate free small molecules in low-molecular weight fraction(s) and metabolite–protein complexes in high-molecular weight fraction(s). We have proven this assumption by demonstrating that the application of a simple size-filtration to a native cellular lysate is sufficient to separate bound from free small molecules (11.Veyel D. Kierszniowska S. Kosmacz M. Sokolowska E.M. Michaelis A. Luzarowski M. Szlachetko J. Willmitzer L. Skirycz A.

Rep. 2017; 7 (28205532): 4238710.1038/srep42387Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Building on this observation, we have additionally shown that size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) can be used to separate small-molecule–protein complexes based on their molecular weight. We detected nearly 100 different polar metabolites co-eluting with the protein fraction and displaying one or several discrete peaks across the chromatographic separation range, indicating the presence of specific protein–small-molecule complexes (11.Veyel D. Kierszniowska S. Kosmacz M. Sokolowska E.M. Michaelis A. Luzarowski M. Szlachetko J. Willmitzer L. Skirycz A.

Our previous work provided a proof of concept but lacked final experimental confirmation, i.e. the identification of known as well as previously unknown small-molecule–protein complexes. Combining SEC separation with parallel metabolomic and proteomic analysis of the fractions using co-elution to indicate interaction, we here demonstrate that SEC is suitable for the identification of protein–small-molecule complexes. This is on par with studies demonstrating SEC applicability for the characterization of protein–protein complexes (12.Aryal U.K. Xiong Y. McBride Z. Kihara D. Xie J. Hall M.C. Szymanski D.B.

We believe that our approach, which we named PROtein–Metabolite Interactions using Size separation (PROMIS), describes a generic method that allows system-wide detection of protein–small-molecule interactions across different biological systems. The goal of this study was to develop a workflow to allow global monitoring of protein–small-molecule complexes. The overall strategy is outlined in Fig. 1, A and B and in Ref. 11.Veyel D. Kierszniowska S. Kosmacz M. Sokolowska E.M. Michaelis A. Luzarowski M. Szlachetko J. Willmitzer L. Skirycz A.

Rep. 2017; 7 (28205532): 4238710.1038/srep42387Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. In brief, a native cellular extract (soluble fraction) was prepared from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures. Protein and small-molecule complexes were separated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). A total of 57 fractions (A01–D04) collected from four independent biological replicas were subjected to metabolomic analysis, as described previously (11.Veyel D. Kierszniowska S. Kosmacz M. Sokolowska E.M. Michaelis A. Luzarowski M. Szlachetko J. Willmitzer L. Skirycz A. System-wide detection of protein-small molecule complexes suggests extensive metabolite regulation in plants.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28205532): 4238710.1038/srep42387Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These fractions comprised 37 protein-containing fractions (A04–C10), referred to as “separation range” (1215 to 13 kDa), and 17 protein-free fractions collected up to one total mobile-phase volume of the column. As expected, the majority of the metabolic features (signal from LC-MS analysis representing specific m/z and retention time; putative small molecule) were detected in fractions outside the protein separation range, as nonprotein bound. However, 4229 unique metabolic features eluted in the protein-containing fractions, displaying one or several discrete peaks across the separation range, indicating their presence in specific protein complexes (Dataset S1A). In total, 342 metabolic features could be annotated to a metabolite using the exact mass and retention time of a reference-compound library, of which 158 (46%) were present in the protein fractions (Dataset S1B). These 158 metabolites included 18 nucleosides and nucleotides, 8 amino acids, 12 cofactors, and 106 dipeptides. Note that the remaining metabolic features correspond to hundreds of additional small molecules, but as we could not assign their identity, we removed these from the analysis. Next, the same fractions were analyzed for their protein composition using our proteomics platform. Proteins were analyzed in the 37 fractions from three of the four independent biological replicas spanning the entire separation range. In total, we identified 7214 proteins (Dataset S2). Subcellular localization analysis using SUBA 4.0 (15.Hooper C.M. Castleden I.R. Tanz S.K. Aryamanesh N. Millar A.H. SUBA4: the interactive data analysis centre for Arabidopsis subcellular protein locations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (27899614): D1064-D107410.1093/nar/gkw1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) confirmed that these were mainly of cytoplasmic origin (cytosol, mitochondrion, and plastid), with a significant under-representation of membrane-associated proteins (Fig. S1). Analysis of the data revealed that in a number of cases there was only one peak for a given metabolite or a given protein and in other cases multiple peaks for one given metabolite or protein. In the case of proteins, this can be easily explained by the presence of the given protein in mono- and oligomeric state and/or in homo- and hetero-oligomers. As for metabolites, several of them, such as co-factors, will have multiple protein partners and thus would be present in several protein complexes, eluting at different times from the size-exclusion column. As stated above, a first approach of assigning a given metabolite to a potential protein partner is based on the assumption that if present as one complex their chromatographic behavior should be highly similar. To be able to apply this criterion also in case of multiple protein or metabolite peaks, as described above, we split the data profiles into single peaks by finding local valleys in the data; this is referred to as deconvolution. We then applied three additional filters to the dataset. We first only took into further account proteins and metabolites that were found in all three/four replicas. Second, to exclude spurious signals, we limited the analysis to proteins and metabolites that appeared at least in three consecutive fractions. Third, we removed proteins and metabolites that peaked near the start (1215 kDa) or the end (13 kDa) of the protein separation range, respectively. Applying these three filters plus the deconvolution resulted in a final dataset of 4627 proteins (appearing in 5527 protein peaks) and 137 metabolites (appearing in 212 metabolite peaks) (Dataset S3, A and B, and Dataset S4). A median calculated from the independent experiments was used to calculate a Pearson correlation between metabolites and proteins to delineate potential interactors (Dataset S5). To define potential interactors, we used a Pearson correlation of >0.7 and allowed deviation of peak maxima of ±1 fraction (COR >0.7 and MAX ± one fraction) (for rationale, see below). By doing so, we found ∼300–500 proteins co-eluting with every metabolite peak, thus representing the potential binding partner. One important observation was the remarkable reproducibility between the independently performed experiments. The Pearson correlation calculated between corresponding fractions between any two replicas was on average >0.95 for both proteins and metabolites (Fig. 1C and Dataset S6, A and B). Finally, we inspected the quality of our experimental dataset by checking the co-elution of the proteasome subunits, as done previously (12.Aryal U.K. Xiong Y. McBride Z. Kihara D. Xie J. Hall M.C. Szymanski D.B. A proteomic strategy for global analysis of plant protein complexes.Plant Cell. 2014; 26 (25293756): 3867-388210.1105/tpc.114.127563Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The 26S proteasome holoenzyme consists of two regulatory particles (RPs) capping each end of the barrel-shaped catalytic 20S core particle (CP) (16.Tanahashi N. Murakami Y. Minami Y. Shimbara N. Hendil K.B. Tanaka K. Hybrid proteasomes–induction by interferon-gamma and contribution to ATP-dependent proteolysis.J. Biol.

CP and RPs are composed of multiple subunits, all sized roughly 25–30 kDa, and eluted as two separate complexes. In our experiment we identified 23 and 29 CP and RP subunits, respectively, of which 23 and 27 co-fractionated together (COR >0.9), with the maximum intensity measured in the two neighboring fractions corresponding to complexes of 574/650 kDa and 735/835 kDa (Fig. 2A). Proteasome co-elution demonstrated that allowing deviation of peak maxima by ±1 adjacent fraction is a rationale criterion to define potential interactors. Importantly, the proteasome is just one of the multiprotein complexes present in the PROMIS dataset (Fig. 2B). In this study, we focused on the PMIs. However, our dataset can be used to query protein–protein complexes on par with the study of Ref. 12.Aryal U.K. Xiong Y. McBride Z. Kihara D. Xie J. Hall M.C. Szymanski D.B. A proteomic strategy for global analysis of plant protein complexes.Plant Cell. 2014; 26 (25293756): 3867-388210.1105/tpc.114.127563Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. In summary, we generated a highly reproducible dataset comprising roughly 140 annotated metabolites and 5000 proteins, which can be used to investigate protein–protein and protein–small-molecule complexes. The data described above demonstrate that our experimental procedure retains the integrity of protein–protein complexes. We next aimed to confirm the presence of small-molecule–protein interaction partners by querying the data for the presence of known small-molecule–protein complexes as defined by the co-elution criterion. To this end we used the Stitch database (18.Szklarczyk D. Santos A. von Mering C. Jensen L.J. Bork P. Kuhn M. STITCH 5: augmenting protein–chemical interaction networks with tissue and affinity data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26590256): D380-D38410.1093/nar/gkv1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) to identify known protein–metabolite interactions, however, restricting our analysis to cases that were experimentally proven in Arabidopsis. Moreover, we restricted the analysis to cases where both metabolite and protein were detected anywhere in our dataset. This resulted in 51 interactions reported for 48 proteins and 13 metabolites detected in our PROMIS experiment (Table S1). We subsequently asked whether or not, by applying the criterion of co-elution, we would retrieve a significant number of the metabolite–protein complexes from the results of the PROMIS experiment. Indeed, this was clearly the case. Of the 51 interactions we could have potentially found in our dataset, 21 interactions were retrieved when applying a Pearson correlation cutoff of 0.7 between protein and metabolite elution (Fig. 3A). This is five times more than expected and thus is statistically significant (Fisher exact test <0.05), greatly supporting our experimental approach (Fig. 3B). Examples include interaction between enzymes involved in oxylipin metabolism, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 1 (OPR1) and OPR3, and the cofactor flavin mononucleotide (FMN) (19.Han B.W. Malone T.E. Kim D.J. Bingman C.A. Kim H.J. Fox B.G. Phillips G.N. Crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana 12-oxophytodienoate reductase isoform 3 in complex with 8-iso prostaglandin A(1).Proteins. 2011; 79 (21915915): 3236-324110.1002/prot.23153Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and between amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, cysteine synthase 1 (OASA1) (20.Bonner E.R.

Cherney M.M. van Belkum M.J. Marcus S.L. Flegel M.D. Clay M.D. Deyholos M.K. Vederas J.C. James M.N.

To see how a shift in the Pearson correlation influences the detection of true (known) interactions, we performed an analysis where we varied the Pearson correlation between 1 and −1 (Table S1). As shown in Fig. 3B, lowering the correlation cutoff drastically reduced the true positives to false positives ratios, leading us to decide against it. Based on these results, we decided to apply a Pearson correlation value of 0.7 for the analysis of the entire dataset. The same result is also reflected in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Finally, we were interested in finding out whether or not there is a relation between binding affinity and our results. To this end, we tried to gather Kd data for the 51 known interactions. However, only for six examples are Kd values reported, ranging from low millimolar to mid nanomolar. Obviously, this dataset is too small to allow any further conclusion with respect to the applicability of our experimental approach to specific (high-affinity) binding events, for example. In the previous paragraph we asked whether the co-elution criterion can be used to retrieve proven metabolite–protein interactions. As the Stitch database contains a comprehensive listing of essentially all proven metabolite–protein interactions, we next wondered whether the SEC data would allow gaining additional support for metabolite–protein interactions validated in systems other than A. thaliana based on protein homology. To this end, we decided to test eight cofactors present in our metabolomics dataset (Table S2). PLP (22.Mooney S. Hellmann H. Vitamin B6: killing two birds with one stone?.Phytochemistry. 2010; 71 (20089286): 495-50110.1016/j.phytochem.2009.12.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) will be described here as an example. Of the 138 proteins annotated in the Stitch database as interacting with PLP, we found 76 in our proteomics data of the PROMIS experiment (Table S3). For only six of these 76 proteins, the interaction with PLP had been demonstrated previously for A. thaliana. For the remaining 70 proteins, whose interaction with PLP had been shown in systems other than A. thaliana, we used the most homologous proteins for the subsequent analysis. In our dataset, PLP eluted as two distinct peaks with maxima at 211 and 68 kDa. The list of proteins predicted as potential interactors (COR >0.7 and MAX ±1 fraction) totaled 355 and 414 proteins for the two peaks, respectively. Of the 70 proteins annotated as PLP binding in the Stitch database, 11 and 20 were contained in the first and second peak, respectively, which is 2.1 and 3.2 times higher than expected by chance (F test < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). Even more striking, when we overlaid the elution profiles of PLP and the known and predicted PLP interactors (76 proteins), we found that 69 of the 76 proteins were contained in the PLP-containing fractions (Fig. 4B). The fact that only half of the proteins were detected when applying the cutoff and correlation approach as described above is due to the relative broadness of the PLP elution peaks, with additional local maxima (394 and 88 kDa), albeit too minor to be reliably selected during deconvolution. In case of the other seven cofactors: for three of them (NADP, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, and nicotinamide), the overlaps between PROMIS-predicted interactions and the data from the Stitch database were again significantly higher than expected by chance (Fig. 4A and Table S2). For the remaining four, we did not find significant enrichment. In contrast to positive results, as in the case of PLP, negative results are harder to interpret and can have a number of reasons as follows: binding predictions retrieved from Stitch may be false; predictions are correct but the binding is development- and/or environment-specific and thus absent in the cell cultures; or the predictions are correct but the binding is not retained during our experimental procedure. In summary, SEC can be used to support predicted PMIs. PLP is an example of a metabolite that interacts with a large number of proteins, with a complex elution behavior, which may require adjusting the criteria by which protein interactors are selected. Still, it is also an exciting example, as the data described above clearly demonstrate that a large number of protein–metabolite complexes are retained during our experimental procedure, which was not anticipated before (see “Discussion”). To further challenge our approach, we tested whether PROMIS can be used to reproduce known PMIs. Our attention was drawn to the commercial protease inhibitors present in the lysis buffer. If PROMIS is effective in separating true protein–metabolite complexes, we expected to find these in the protein-containing fractions, co-eluting together with their protease targets. Both of the above assumptions proved true. Three of the six commercial protease inhibitors present in the lysis buffer and known to exhibit reversible binding behavior separated in the protein-containing fractions in minimum one and maximum three distinctive elution peaks (Fig. 5; Dataset S7). Remarkably, in each case the elution behavior of the protease inhibitor could be traced down to a known protease target. More specifically, bestatin is an aminopeptidase inhibitor. Of the five aminopeptidases present in our dataset and annotated in Stich as bestatin interactors, all five, including the family of the three leucine aminopeptidases (LAP1–3), eluted together with either one of the two bestatin peaks. Pepstatin A, an aspartyl protease inhibitor, eluted as one peak mirrored by the elution behavior of one of the four aspartyl proteases present in the PROMIS dataset and annotated in Stich as pepstatin interactors.

However, since 2013, no study investigated the prevalence and determinants of hypertension in Nepal involving nationally representative sample. Therefore, this study aimed to find out the current prevalence of hypertension in Nepal and its determinants using the latest nationally representative data obtained from Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2016. The NDHS 2016 collected data on hypertension from 13,304 men and women aged 18 years and above from 5,520 urban and 5,970 rural households covering seven administrative provinces and three ecological zones. Participants were considered as hypertensive when their systolic blood pressure was ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure was ≥90 mmHg and/or they reported taking antihypertensive medication. A total of 19.9% study participants were diagnosed as hypertensive of which majority were male (male-24.3%, female-16.9%), ever married (ever married-21.7%, unmarried-6.1%) and residents of urban area (urban-20.9%, rural-18.3%). Hypertension prevalence has shown growing trend with the increase of age. This prevalence was also higher among rich and overweight/obese individuals. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, older age, male gender, better education, residence at urban area and province 4 and 5 and being overweight/obese were found positive association with having hypertension. When the determinants of hypertension were stratified by sex of the participants, difference was observed in case of age group, education and place of residence. As one out of every five individuals in Nepal are hypertensive, public health initiatives are immediately required for prevention and control of hypertension to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with this progressive disease."

Few redox proxies can track secular variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations around threshold levels for metazoan survival in the upper ocean. We present an extensive compilation of iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonates. Our record supports a major rise in the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere at ~400 million years (Ma) ago and reveals a step change in the oxygenation of the upper ocean to relatively sustainable near-modern conditions at ~200 Ma ago. An Earth system model demonstrates that a shift in organic matter remineralization to greater depths, which may have been due to increasing size and biomineralization of eukaryotic plankton, likely drove the I/Ca signals at ~200 Ma ago."
https://openalex.org/W2805148677,"Introduction High incidence of HIV infection among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) has been attributed to the numerous and often layered vulnerabilities that they encounter including violence against women, unfavourable power relations that are worsened by age-disparate sexual relations, and limited access to sexual and reproductive health information and services. For AGYW living in urban informal settlements (slums), these vulnerabilities are compounded by pervasive poverty, fragmented social networks, and limited access to social services including health and education. In this paper, we assess sexual risk behaviours and their correlates among AGYW in two slum settlements in Nairobi, Kenya, prior to the implementation of interventions under the Determined Resilient Empowered AIDS-free Mentored and Safe (DREAMS) Partnership. Methods We drew on secondary data from the Transition to Adulthood study, the most recent representative study on adolescent sexual behaviour in the two settlements. The study was nested within the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS). Data were collected in 2009 from 1,390 AGYW aged 12–23 years. We estimated the proportions of AGYW reporting ever tested for HIV, condom use, multiple sexual partners and age-disparate sex by socio-demographic characteristics. “High risk” sexual behaviour was defined as a composite of these four variables and age at first sex. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with risk behaviours. Results Fifty-one percent of AGYW reported that they had ever tested for HIV and received results of their last test, with the proportion rising steeply by age (from 15% to 84% among those <15 years and 20–23 years, respectively). Of 578 AGYW who were sexually active in the 12 months preceding the survey, 26% reported using a condom at last sex, 4% had more than one sexual partner, and 26% had sex with men who were at least 5 years older or younger. All girls aged below 15 years who had sex (n = 9) had not used condoms at last sex. The likelihood of engaging in “high risk” sexual risk behaviour was higher among older AGYW (19–23 years), those in marital unions, of Luo ethnicity, out of school, living alone or with a friend (versus parents), living with spouse (versus parents), and those whose friends engaged in risky/anti-social behaviours. In contrast, Muslim faith, co-residence with both parents, and belonging to an organised social group were associated with lower odds of risky sexual behaviours. Conclusion Our study findings suggest that multifaceted approaches addressing the educational and social mediators of AGYW’s vulnerability and that also reach the people with whom AGYW live and interact, are needed to reduce the rapid onset of sexual risk during the adolescent years. There is a particular need to reach the youngest adolescent girls in poor urban settings, among whom condom use and awareness of HIV status is rare."

We evaluated secular trends in the burden of hyperuricaemia from 2006–2014 within the Irish health system. Methods Data from the National Kidney Disease Surveillance Programme was used to determine the prevalence of elevated sUA in adults, age > 18 years, within the Irish health system. Hyperuricaemia was defined as sUA > 416.4 μmol/L in men and > 339.06 μmol/L in women, and prevalence was calculated as the proportion of patients per year with mean sUA levels above sex-specific thresholds. Temporal trends in prevalence were compared from 2006 to 2014 while general estimating equations (GEE) explored variation across calendar years expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence intervals (CI). Results From 2006 to 2014, prevalence of hyperuricaemia increased from 19.7% to 25.0% in men and from 20.5% to 24.1% in women, P<0.001. The corresponding sUA concentrations increased significantly from 314.6 (93.9) in 2006 to 325.6 (96.2) in 2014, P<0.001. Age-specific prevalence increased in all groups from 2006 to 2014, and the magnitude of increase was similar for each age category. Adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics and illness indicators, the likelihood of hyperuricemia was greatest for patients in 2014; OR 1.45 (1.26–1.65) for men and OR 1.47 (1.29–1.67) in women vs 2006 (referent). Factors associated with hyperuricaemia included: worsening kidney function, elevated white cell count, raised serum phosphate and calcium levels, elevated total protein and higher haemoglobin concentrations, all P<0.001. Conclusions The burden of hyperuricaemia is substantial in the Irish health system and has increased in frequency over the past decade. Advancing age, poorer kidney function, measures of nutrition and inflammation, and regional variation all contribute to increasing prevalence, but these do not fully explain emerging trends."
https://openalex.org/W2806711858,"Background Empathy is a fundamental humanistic component of patient care which facilitates efficient and patient-centered clinical encounters. Despite being the principal recipient of physician empathy little work on how patients perceive/report receiving empathy from their physicians has been undertaken. In the context of doctor-patient interactions, knowledge about empathy has mostly originated from physicians’ perspectives and has been developed from studies using self-assessment instruments. In general, self-assessment may not correlate well with the reality observed by others. Objectives To investigate: 1—the relationship between physicians’ self-assessed empathy and patients’ measures of physicians’ empathy; 2 –Environmental factors that could influence patients’ perceptions; and 3 –the correlation between two widely used psychometric scales to measure empathy from the perspective of patients. Methods This is an observational study which enrolled 945 patients and 51 physicians from radiology, clinical, and surgical specialties. The physicians completed the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSE) and the International Reactivity Index (IRI), and patients completed the Consultation and Relational Empathy scale (CARE), and the Jefferson Scale of Patient’s Perceptions of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE). Results We did not observe any significant correlation between total self-assessed empathy and patients’ perceptions. We observed a small correlation (r = 0,3, P<0,05) between the sub-dimension Perspective Taking-JSE and JSPPPE. JSPPPE and CARE had a positive and moderate correlation (0,56; p<0,001). Physicians’ gender and sector influenced the JSPPPE score. Sector, medical specialty and the nature of the appointment (initial versus subsequent) influenced the CARE measure. Conclusions The lack of correlation between self-assessed empathy levels and patients’ perceptions suggests patients be included in the process of empathy evaluation. Practice implications Training strategies aiming the development of empathy should include patients’ evaluations and perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W2807144987,"Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) constricts mitochondria as a mechanochemical GTPase during mitochondrial division. The Drp1 gene contains several alternative exons and produces multiple isoforms through RNA splicing. Here we performed a systematic analysis of Drp1 transcripts in different mouse tissues and identified a previously uncharacterized isoform that is highly enriched in the brain. This Drp1 isoform is termed Drp1ABCD because it contains four alterative exons: A, B, C, and D. Remarkably, Drp1ABCD is located at lysosomes, late endosomes, and the plasma membrane in addition to mitochondria. Furthermore, Drp1ABCD is concentrated at the interorganelle interface between mitochondria and lysosomes/late endosomes. The localizations of Drp1ABCD at lysosomes, late endosomes, and the plasma membrane require two exons, A and B, that are present in the GTPase domain. Drp1ABCD assembles onto these membranes in a manner that is regulated by its oligomerization and GTP hydrolysis. Experiments using lysosomal inhibitors show that the association of Drp1ABCD with lysosomes/late endosomes depends on lysosomal pH but not their protease activities. Thus, Drp1 may connect mitochondria to endosomal-lysosomal pathways in addition to mitochondrial division."

Here, perturbation of the p53 core domain (p53C) with subdenaturing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride and high hydrostatic pressure revealed native-like molten globule (MG) states, a subset of which were highly prone to amyloidogenic aggregation. We found that MG conformers of p53C, probably representing population-weighted averages of multiple states, have different volumetric properties, as determined by pressure perturbation and size-exclusion chromatography.

Fluorescence experiments revealed conformational changes of the single Trp and Tyr residues before p53 unfolding and the presence of MG conformers, some of which were highly prone to aggregation. p53C exhibited marginal unfolding cooperativity, which could be modulated from unfolding to aggregation pathways with chemical or physical forces. We conclude that trapping amyloid precursor states in solution is a promising approach for understanding p53 aggregation in cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2806177586,"Objectives Previous research has documented associations of physical strength and facial morphology predominantly in men of Western societies. Faces of strong men tend to be more robust, are rounder and have a prominent jawline compared with faces of weak men. Here, we investigate whether the morphometric patterns of strength-face relationships reported for members of industrialized societies can also be found in members of an African pastoralist society, the Maasai of Northern Tanzania. Materials and methods Handgrip strength (HGS) measures and facial photographs were collected from a sample of 185 men and 120 women of the Maasai in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. In young-adults (20–29 years; n = 95) and mid-adults (30–50 years; n = 114), we digitized 71 somatometric landmarks and semilandmarks to capture variation in facial morphology and performed shape regressions of landmark coordinates upon HGS. Results were visualized in the form of thin-plate plate spline deformation grids and geometric morphometric morphs. Results Individuals with higher HGS tended to have wider faces with a lower and broader forehead, a wider distance between the medial canthi of the eyes, a wider nose, fuller lips, and a larger, squarer lower facial outline compared with weaker individuals of the same age-sex group. In mid-adult men, these associations were weaker than in the other age-sex groups. Discussion We conclude that the patterns of HGS relationships with face shape in the Maasai are similar to those reported from related investigations in samples of industrialized societies. We discuss differences between the present and related studies with regard to knowledge about the causes for age- and sex-related facial shape variation and physical strength associations."
https://openalex.org/W2806623352,"Colorectal epithelial tumors occur spontaneously in dogs, and the pathogenesis seems to parallel that of humans. The development of human colorectal tumorigenesis has been linked to alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. This study characterized the fecal- and mucosa-associated microbiota in dogs with colorectal epithelial tumors (n = 10). The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA analysis and compared with that of control dogs (n = 13). We also determined the mucosa-associated microbiota composition in colonic tumor tissue (n = 8) and in adjacent non-tumor tissue (n = 5) by 16S rDNA- and rRNA profiling. The fecal microbial community structure in dogs with tumors was different from that of control samples and was distinguished by oligotypes affiliated with Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus, and lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Slackia, Clostridium XI and Faecalibacterium. The overall community structure and populations of mucosal bacteria were not different based on either the 16S rDNA or the 16S rRNA profile in tumor tissue vs. adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, the proportion of live, potentially active bacteria appeared to be higher in non-tumor tissue compared with tumor tissue and included Slackia, Roseburia, unclass. Ruminococcaeceae, unclass. Lachnospiraceae and Oscillibacter. Colorectal tumors are rarely diagnosed in dogs, but despite this limitation, we were able to show that dogs with colorectal tumors have distinct fecal microbiota profiles. These initial results support the need for future case-control studies that are adequately powered, as well as age-matched and breed-matched, in order to evaluate the influence of bacteria on colorectal cancer etiopathogenesis and to determine whether the bacteria may have potential as biomarkers in clinical settings."

The substrate-degrading ability of G. lucidum could be related to its growth. CAZy proteins were more abundant in its genome than in the other white rot fungi models. Among these CAZy proteins, changes in lignocellulolytic enzymes during growth have not been well studied. Using genomic, transcriptomic and secretomic analyses, this study focuses on the lignocellulolytic enzymes of G. lucidum strain G0119 to determine which of these degradative enzymes contribute to its growth. From the genome sequencing data, genes belonging to CAZy protein families, especially genes involved in lignocellulose degradation, were investigated. The gene expression, protein abundance and enzymatic activity of lignocellulolytic enzymes in mycelia over a growth cycle were analysed. The overall expression cellulase was higher than that of hemicellulase and lignin-modifying enzymes, particularly during the development of fruiting bodies. The cellulase and hemicellulase abundances and activities increased after the fruiting bodies matured, when basidiospores were produced in massive quantities till the end of the growth cycle. Additionally, the protein abundances of the lignin-modifying enzymes and the expression of their corresponding genes, including laccases and lignin-degrading heme peroxidases, were highest when the mycelia fully spread in the compost bag. Type I cellobiohydrolase was observed to be the most abundant extracellular lignocellulolytic enzyme produced by the G. lucidum strain G0119. The AA2 family haem peroxidases were the dominant lignin-modifying enzyme expressed during the mycelial growth phase, and several laccases might play roles during the formation of the primordium. This study provides insight into the changes in the lignocellulose degradation ability of G. lucidum during its growth and will facilitate the discovery of new approaches to accelerate the growth of G. lucidum in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2807640976,"Background Both skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and systemic bacterial infections are common in people who inject drugs (PWID), but data on incidence and risk factors are lacking. We compared registered diagnoses for such infections in Swedish criminal justice clients with regard to injecting drug use. Methods Baseline interview data from the Swedish Prison and Probation Service on drug use in PWID and non-PWID with problematic alcohol use were linked to follow-up data from national Swedish registers on hospital diagnoses and/or death. Associations between drug use and later diagnosis of SSTI and systemic bacterial infection (septicemia or bacterial infection of the heart, bone/joints or central nervous system) were analyzed by Cox regression. Results Incidence rates of SSTI was 28.3 per 1,000 person-years for PWID (n = 2,444) and 10.0 for non-PWID with problematic alcohol use (n = 735). Incidence rates of systemic bacterial infection was 9.1 per 1,000 person-years for PWID and 2.7 per 1,000 person-years for non-PWID. Injection drug use was associated with a significantly increased risk of bacterial infections, for main drugs heroin (SSTI: Hazard ratio [HR] 2.45; systemic infection: HR 2.75), amphetamine (SSTI: HR 1.60; systemic infection: HR 2.19), and polysubstance use (SSTI: HR 1.92; systemic infection: HR 2.01). In relation to injection use of amphetamine and polysubstance use, PWID mainly using heroin had higher risk of SSTI. Conclusions Injection drug use predicted both SSTI and systemic bacterial infection, with a particularly high risk of SSTI in PWID mainly using heroin. The results imply the need for increased attention to bacterial infections among PWID, in terms of clinical management, prevention and research."
https://openalex.org/W2806454348,"Endothelial cells play an essential role in regulating an immune response through promoting leukocyte adhesion and cell migration and production of cytokines such as TNFα. Regulation of endothelial cell immune function is tightly regulated and recent studies suggest that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are prominently involved in this process. However, the importance of EVs in regulating endothelial activation in the context of a bacterial infection is poorly understood. To begin addressing this knowledge gap we characterized the endothelial cell response to EVs released from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infected macrophages. Our result showed increased macrophage migration through the monolayer when endothelial cells were pretreated with EVs isolated from Mtb-infected macrophages. Transcriptome analysis showed a significant upregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion and the inflammatory process in endothelial cells treated with EVs. These results were validated by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that several immune response-related pathways were up-regulated. Endothelial cells were also treated with EVs isolated from the serum of Mtb-infected mice. Interestingly, EVs isolated 14 days but not 7 or 21 days post-infection showed a similar ability to induce endothelial cell activation suggesting a change in EV function during the course of an Mtb infection. Immunofluorescence microscopy result indicated that NF-κB and the Type 1 interferon pathways were involved in endothelial activation by EVs. In summary, our data suggest that EVs can activate endothelial cells and thus may play an important role in modulating host immune responses during an Mtb infection."

https://openalex.org/W2806677855,"Amyloids are associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, motivating investigations into their structure and function. Although not linked to a specific disease, albumins have been reported to form many structural aggregates. We were interested in investigating host immune responses to amyloid fibrils assembled from the model protein ovalbumin. Surprisingly, upon subjecting ovalbumin to standard denaturing conditions, we encountered giant protein nanosheets harboring amyloid-like features and hypothesized that these nanosheets might have potential in clinical or therapeutic applications. We found that the nanosheets, without the administration of any additional adjuvant, evoked a strong antibody response in mice that was higher than that observed for native ovalbumin. This suggests that amyloid nanosheets have a self-adjuvanting property. The nanosheet-induced immune response was helper T cell 2 (Th2) biased and negligibly inflammatory. While testing whether the nanosheets might form depots for the sustained release of precursor proteins, we did observe release of ovalbumin that mimicked the conformation of native protein. Moreover, the nanosheets could load the anticancer drug doxorubicin and release it in a slow and sustained manner. Taken together, our results suggest that amyloid nanosheets should be further investigated as either an antigen delivery vehicle or a multifunctional antigen and drug co-delivery system, with potential applications in simultaneous immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

Moreover, amyloid-based supramolecular assemblies are gaining attention as immune adjuvant and antigen delivery systems because of their potential to release the precursor protein/peptide and resistance to proteolytic attack that extends their residence time in circulation (16.Tufail S. Owais M. Kazmi S. Balyan R. Khalsa J.K. Faisal S.M. Sherwani M.A. Gatoo M.A. Umar M.S. Zubair S. Amyloid form of ovalbumin evokes native antigen-specific immune response in the host: prospective immuno-prophylactic potential.J. Biol.

This feature allows them to boost the immune system time and again in the absence of external boosters. Under specific denaturation conditions, ovalbumin has been reported to form aggregates in vitro (8.Lara C. Gourdin-Bertin S. Adamcik J. Bolisetty S. Mezzenga R. Self-assembly of ovalbumin into amyloid and non-amyloid fibrils.Biomacromolecules. 2012; 13 (23098330): 4213-422110.1021/bm301481vCrossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A decrease in α-helical content and binding of thioflavin T or Congo red to the albumin aggregates suggest formation of β-sheet–type structures (17.Taboada P. Barbosa S. Castro E. Mosquera V. Amyloid fibril formation and other aggregate species formed by human serum albumin association.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110 (17048876): 20733-2073610.1021/jp064861rCrossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Albumin aggregates of diverse morphologies have been reported, and interestingly, the morphologies obtained seem to have direct correlation with the kind of denaturing environment provided to the protein. For example, human serum albumin (the human counterpart of ovalbumin) has been observed to form both fibrillar and nonfibrillar aggregates under various environmental conditions (17.Taboada P. Barbosa S. Castro E. Mosquera V. Amyloid fibril formation and other aggregate species formed by human serum albumin association.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110 (17048876): 20733-2073610.1021/jp064861rCrossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Like fibrillar aggregates, some of its nonfibrillar aggregates (displaying a certain filamentous structure but not the conventional fibril form) have been found to possess a typical negative peak in CD spectra at wavelengths close to 220 nm and bind Congo red. The different precursor states that result from different solution conditions can generate fibrillar or nonfibrillar aggregates with similar β-sheet content but with distinct morphological features. For human serum albumin, the flat ribbons observed are very much different from cylindrical forms of amyloid fibrils and relatively thick rodlike specimens, although each one of them can bind to the β-sheet–binding dye Congo red and exhibits a minimum at 220 nm for CD spectra (17.Taboada P. Barbosa S. Castro E. Mosquera V. Amyloid fibril formation and other aggregate species formed by human serum albumin association.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110 (17048876): 20733-2073610.1021/jp064861rCrossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). One of the denaturing conditions provided to trigger amyloid nucleation is agitation of the protein solutions (18.Sasahara K. Yagi H. Sakai M. Naiki H. Goto Y. Amyloid nucleation triggered by agitation of β2-microglobulin under acidic and neutral pH conditions.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18211100): 2650-266010.1021/bi701968gCrossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19.Buttstedt A. Wostradowski T. Ihling C. Hause G. Sinz A. Schwarz E. Different morphology of amyloid fibrils originating from agitated and non-agitated conditions.Amyloid. 2013; 20 (23570235): 86-9210.3109/13506129.2013.784962Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Once the amyloidal seeds are formed, the aggregates mature rapidly without any detectable lag phase during the incubation period. Agitation of proteins has been reported to form amyloids of very distinct morphologies (19.Buttstedt A. Wostradowski T. Ihling C. Hause G. Sinz A. Schwarz E. Different morphology of amyloid fibrils originating from agitated and non-agitated conditions.Amyloid. 2013; 20 (23570235): 86-9210.3109/13506129.2013.784962Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present study, we agitated ovalbumin to induce formation of amyloid fibrils. However, to our surprise, the aggregate obtained upon shaking for 24 h exhibited a nanosheet-like morphology instead of the fibrillar form. This is in analogy with a recent report where shaken but not stirred peptoid monolayer was found to form free-floating, stable nanosheets (20.Sanii B. Kudirka R. Cho A. Venkateswaran N. Olivier G.K. Olson A.M. Tran H. Harada R.M. Tan L. Zuckermann R.N. Shaken, not stirred: collapsing a peptoid monolayer to produce free-floating, stable nanosheets.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133 (21939206): 20808-2081510.1021/ja206199dCrossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because nanosheets were formed in an amyloid-inducing ambience, we investigated their amyloidal character. The various biophysical studies ascertained the amyloid character of nanosheets. Further, the nanosheets were tested for release of the precursor proteins and for whether the released precursors carried the native antigen conformation. The amyloid nanosheets were evaluated for their potential to evoke immune response. The antibodies evoked upon nanosheet immunization were tested for cross-reactivity with native antigen. We anticipated that the availability of both obverse and reverse surfaces in nanosheets may facilitate high drug loading. Therefore, we examined whether the anticancer drug doxorubicin can be loaded onto nanosheets and later be released. Next, we tested whether the amyloid nanosheet formation is a characteristic of only very amyloidogenic proteins like albumins or amyloid nanosheets can be formed by other proteins/peptides, especially cell-surface antigens, as they are the potential targets of immunotherapy. Because they are whole protein bodies, the nanosheets can themselves act as antigen delivery vehicles. Moreover, their free obverse and reverse surfaces can provide ample area for additional drug loading. Hence, these nanosheets may emerge as a novel class of biomaterials with applications in simultaneous immunotherapy and chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first study to elucidate the discovery of amyloid-like nanosheets for ovalbumin and also illuminates the immune responses evoked upon immunizing amyloid nanosheets. Fluorescence intensity was monitored to detect aggregation in agitated ovalbumin. A marked increase in fluorescence intensity was observed in the ovalbumin samples kept on agitation (Fig. 1A) as compared with native ovalbumin. The 12- and 24-h aggregates exhibited ∼5- and 10-fold increases in fluorescence intensity, respectively, as compared with the native form. The 3-h ovalbumin exhibited only a slight increase in fluorescence intensity compared with the native form, so the chances of aggregation at this state could be ruled out. The turbidity measurements for protein samples agitated for more than 10 h also revealed markedly enhanced turbidity compared with native ovalbumin, thus providing further evidence in support of aggregate formation (Fig. 1B). Thioflavin T is a benzothiazole dye that exhibits enhanced fluorescence emissions upon binding to amyloid fibrils and does not bind to amorphous aggregates as well as nonamyloid structures (21.LeVine 3rd, H. Quantification of β-sheet amyloid fibril structures with thioflavin T.Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309 (10507030): 274-28410.1016/S0076-6879(99)09020-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 22.Ban T. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Direct observation of amyloid fibril growth monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12646572): 16462-1646510.1074/jbc.C300049200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, a thioflavin T binding assay was performed to examine the amyloid character of aggregates formed by shaking ovalbumin. The agitated protein samples exhibited strong thioflavin T binding, as revealed by markedly enhanced thioflavin T fluorescence compared with unshaken native ovalbumin (Fig. 1C). The results indicate the formation of β-sheet–rich ordered aggregates. Fluorescence microscopy was also exploited to observe thioflavin T binding. The ovalbumin aggregate obtained at 24 h of shaking was incubated with thioflavin T and monitored for thioflavin T fluorescence by fluorescence microscopy. The aggregate exhibits a nanosheet-like structure with seemingly numerous amyloidal seeds in the vicinity (Fig. 1D (a)). Fig. 1D (b) shows a mature nanosheet with numerous folds and crumples. To monitor the formation of amyloid aggregates, Congo red dye is diagnostically used. Amyloid binding to Congo red causes a red shift in the absorbance spectrum of the dye (23.Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Quantifying amyloid by Congo Red spectral shift assay.Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309 (10507031): 285-30510.1016/S0076-6879(99)09021-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Aliquots of agitated ovalbumin collected at various time points were mixed with Congo red, and spectra were obtained. Absorbance intensity was found to increase with increase in agitation time; however, a red shift started to appear only from the aggregate formed at 12 h of agitation. Interestingly, a marked increase in absorption and significant red shift was observed for aggregate formed at 24 h, indicating β-sheet–rich amyloid formation (Fig. 2A). Aggregates obtained upon agitation for more than 24 h exhibited negligible change in thioflavin T binding as compared with that observed for 24-h aggregates (data not shown). This indicates that 24 h is the saturation point for nanosheet formation, and shaking beyond this time does not produce any more sheets. Once thioflavin T and Congo red binding to the aggregates was ascertained, we also determined secondary structure content of the aggregates by far-UV CD. Native ovalbumin was observed to show double minima at 208 and 222 nm, which is a hallmark of α-helical forms. On the contrary, 24-h aggregates exhibited a single negative peak at around 220 nm, suggesting their transition to the β-sheet conformation (Fig. 2B). The morphology of aggregates formed was further investigated using transmission EM. The 6- and 12-h aggregates did not reveal any typical amyloid morphology (Fig. 2C, a and b); however, the aggregates obtained at 24 h exhibited a unique sheetlike morphology (Fig. 2C, c and d). The sheets are seen to be crumpled and have numerous folds. We also calculated nanosheet yield in the 24-h aggregates. Nanosheet yield was found to be 67.6%. This indicates that 67.6% of the monomeric ovalbumin converted to nanosheets, and the rest made the unpolymerized ovalbumin pool. In our previous study (16.Tufail S. Owais M. Kazmi S. Balyan R. Khalsa J.K. Faisal S.M. Sherwani M.A. Gatoo M.A. Umar M.S. Zubair S. Amyloid form of ovalbumin evokes native antigen-specific immune response in the host: prospective immuno-prophylactic potential.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (25512377): 4131-414810.1074/jbc.M113.540989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we suggested exploitation of amyloids for vaccine development, considering their property to act as depots for release of precursor proteins and resistance to enzymatic degradation that extends their time in circulation. We wondered whether the nanosheets also release precursor proteins like those observed for fibrils; therefore, we evaluated release of precursor ovalbumin from amyloid nanosheet over a period of 15 days. Interestingly, the ovalbumin nanosheets were found to release the precursor proteins in a time-dependent manner and were found to be superior depots for the protein release as compared with the fibrillar form of ovalbumin (Fig. 3A). This might have happened because the sheets may be formed of laterally assembled fibrils, and several fibrils may be releasing the precursors from their termini in the nanosheets. The fibril form of ovalbumin released ovalbumin precursors in a sustained manner over a period of 15 days; however, the amount released was lower than that observed for the nanosheets. To analyze the state of released precursors from the nanosheet depot, we performed size-exclusion chromatography of the released proteins. Both fibrillar and nanosheet forms of ovalbumin could be seen to release monomers, dimers, and higher-order oligomers (Fig. 3B). However, the dominant species that is released is the monomeric form. It may be possible that oligomeric forms were first released that subsequently released monomeric forms, but we did not get into these details, as our concern was whether the precursor proteins are released or not. The released precursor proteins, whether in monomeric/dimeric/multimeric forms, may serve the purpose of boosting the immune system repeatedly. We believe that similar to existence of fibril-monomer equilibrium in conditions of fibril depolymerization, a dynamic equilibrium between the released monomers and nanosheets is also established. Concomitantly, we characterized the nanosheet dissociation equilibrium by calculating t½, Kd, and Koff of the nanosheets. The t½, Kd, and Koff of nanosheets are found to be 50 days, 3.3 μm, and 1.64 × 10−7 s−1, respectively (Table 1). The details of these are provided under “Materials and methods.”Table 1Properties of ovalbumin aggregatesOvalbumin aggregateKdt½Koffμmdayss−1Fibril1.61067.5 × 10−8Nanosheet3.3501.6 × 10−7 Open table in a new tab Next, we studied the nature of the precursor proteins released from nanosheets. Intriguingly, as is observed for fibrillar amyloids, the released precursors from amyloid nanosheets mimicked native ovalbumin for light scattering and thioflavin T binding (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, the CD spectrum of released precursors was found to be similar to that obtained for native ovalbumin (Fig. 3, E and F). These results indicate that the released ovalbumin from the nanosheet depot may be refolding to native conformation. It is interesting to observe that the near-UV CD spectrum of released monomers, which indicates the tertiary structure of proteins (24.Kelly S.M. Price N.C. The use of circular dichroism in the investigation of protein structure and function.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1 (12369905): 349-38410.2174/1389203003381315Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), is quite similar to that obtained for native ovalbumin. This demonstrates that not only are the secondary structures conserved (as observed from the far-UV CD spectrum), but so is the tertiary conformation of the released monomers. It has been observed previously that there is a marked difference in the near-UV CD spectrum of disulfide-reduced and disulfide-intact (native) ovalbumin (25.Takahashi N. Koseki T. Doi E. Hirose M. Role of an intrachain disulfide bond in the conformation and stability of ovalbumin.J. Biochem. 1991; 109 (1939004): 846-85110.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reckoning with this, the native-like near-UV CD spectrum of released ovalbumin monomers, in the present study, can be said to suggest conservation of native conformation along with the native disulfide bond. BALB/c mice were immunized with ovalbumin nanosheets, and the immune response evoked was evaluated. Intriguingly, nanosheets were found to induce significantly higher antibody titers compared with that induced by native ovalbumin (Fig. 4A). The antibody titers induced by nanosheets were even higher than those induced by native ovalbumin given in complete Freund's adjuvant. Of note, the strong antibody responses evoked against nanosheets are without co-administration of any additional adjuvant. As the native form of ovalbumin did not produce a strong antibody response, the self-assembly of ovalbumin to amyloid nanosheet structure can be said to be responsible for the robust antibody responses. This indicates that amyloid nanosheets have a self-adjuvanting property as well. Nanosheet antisera were also found to react with ovalbumin monomers released from nanosheets. There was a practically insignificant difference between the reactivity of anti-nanosheet antibodies with intact nanosheets and released monomers. This indicates that both the multivalency of the sheets and released precursors might be contributing to the overall immunogenicity of the nanosheets. Our purpose of exploiting the nanosheet as a vaccine candidate is fulfilled whether the host system favors multivalency of the sheets or the released precursors for generating immune response. Whatever the source of immunogenicity, as long as nanosheets are able to evoke immune response against native antigen, the purpose of exploiting them as vaccine candidates is accomplished. The cross-reactivity of the nanosheet antisera with native antigen was also tested. The nanosheet antisera were found to be strongly cross-reactive with native ovalbumin (Fig. 4B), indicating that nanosheet immunization is capable of eliciting high antibody titers against native ovalbumin, by virtue of retaining native antigen epitopes and/or releasing precursors carrying native epitopes. Precursors released from nanosheets were analyzed for reactivity with anti-native ovalbumin antibodies. Interestingly, the released precursors from nanosheets were found to react with anti-native ovalbumin polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 4C). This indicates that the released precursors might be harboring native antigen epitopes. To test the conformational integrity of released precursors, we tested the reactivity of released ovalbumin with 2D11 mAb. This antibody reacts with native ovalbumin but not aggregated forms (Fig. 4D), which indicates that it recognizes a conformational epitope. The precursor ovalbumin released from nanosheets was found to be reactive to 2D11 antibody (Fig. 4E), indicating retention of native ovalbumin conformation owing to the possible presence of conformational epitope(s). The biophysical and immunological results described above indicate that released precursors from the nanosheet depot may harbor native protein conformation. The nature of the immune response was determined by evaluating the isotypes of the responding antibodies in the nanosheet-immunized group. IgG1 was found to be the dominant isotype with lower levels of IgG2a, which supports elicitation of a predominantly Th2 biased immune response (Fig. 5, A and B). We also evaluated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ 4The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferon2Dtwo-dimensionalILinterleukinPBphosphate buffer. and IL-12 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 to examine whether any inflammatory response is also evoked upon nanosheet immunization. Nanosheets were found to produce negligible levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 in nanosheet-immunized mice compared with animals immunized with native ovalbumin (Fig. 5, C and D). On the contrary, IL-4 level was found to be significantly higher in nanosheet-immunized animals than in mice immunized with native ovalbumin (Fig. 5E). This establishes a Th2 biased response and indicates that amyloid nanosheets are noninflammatory despite being immunogenic. interferon two-dimensional interleukin phosphate buffer. To ascertain the results of the immune response to ovalbumin amyloid nanosheets in BALB/c mice, a prototypical Th2 mouse strain, we evaluated the immune response to nanosheets in C57BL/6 mice (a prototypical Th1 mouse strain) as well. Similar to that observed in BALB/c mice, a robust antibody response is evoked upon immunizing C57BL/6 mice with amyloid nanosheets (Fig. S1A). In this case as well, nanosheets were found to evoke higher antibody titers than native ovalbumin without co-administration of any adjuvant, confirming the self-adjuvanting property of amyloid nanosheets. Practically similar levels of IgG2a to IgG1 ratio and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-12) are observed in groups immunized with native OVA and amyloid nanosheet (Fig. S1, B–D). However, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-4, is found to be higher in the nanosheet-immunized group (Fig. S1E). These results indicate that a negligibly inflammatory and Th2 biased immune response is evoked in C57BL/6 mice as well, validating the results obtained in BALB/c mice. Although the pattern for antibody isotypes and cytokines appears to be similar to that observed in BALB/c mice, when we look at the cytokine levels separately in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, we observe that levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are slightly higher and anti-inflammatory cytokines are lower for each group in C57BL/6 mice than observed in BALB/c mice. This is in agreement with the fact that C57BL/6 mice, being a prototypical Th1 mouse strain, may favor generation of a higher pro-inflammatory response than the Th2 prototypical strain of BALB/c mice. Nanosheets were incubated with doxorubicin and were monitored for possible interaction. An increase in absorption intensity of doxorubicin and a red shift indicate interaction of nanosheets with doxorubicin. Moreover, quenching of fluorescence intensity of doxorubicin upon incubation with nanosheets also indicates possible binding of doxorubicin to nanosheets (Fig. 6, A and B). The release of doxorubicin loaded onto nanosheets was also monitored. Doxorubicin was found to be released from the sheets in a slow and sustained manner over time at pH 7.4 as well as pH 5.0 (Fig. 6C). However, the release was found to be significantly higher at pH 5.0. Overexpressed tumor antigens represent attractive targets for immunotherapy. We selected antigens overexpressed in several cancers and examined their tendency to form amyloid nanosheets. We chose a tandem repeat fragment of mucin 1 (MUC1) (VTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAHG) (26.Bánóczi Z.

https://openalex.org/W2806704593,"The main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a 12-week water aerobics program in a real-life context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults. Fifteen volunteers (58.80 ± 14.32 years old) were part of an experimental group (Exercise), and eight volunteers (59.00 ± 12.26 years old) were part of the control group (Control). The Exercise performed 45 min of water aerobics twice a week for 12 weeks; no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period. The evaluations were performed the week before (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry, lipid profile and blood pressure. Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in post-training moment. However, there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs (ηp2 = 0.17), reduced body fat (ηp2 = 0.17), reduced systolic blood pressure (ηp2 = 0.14) and triglycerides (ηp2 = 0.19) in Exercise. Within groups changes showed that the training program caused an increase mainly in explosive strength in the upper limbs (0.26 m, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.49; ES = 0.63) In addition, there was a significant decrease in fat mass (-0.89%, 95% CI, -1.74, -0.03; ES = 0.61) and in the systolic blood pressure (-0.83 mmHg, -1.46, -0.19; ES = 0.71). Nonetheless, no significant changes were observed for the lipid profile. These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles."

Using CD analysis, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and transmission EM, we report here a surprising cooperative effect of heparin and the green tea polyphenol (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a known inhibitor and modulator of amyloid formation, on apoA-I fibrils. We found that heparin, a proxy for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides that co-localize ubiquitously with amyloid in vivo, accelerates the rate of apoA-I formation from monomeric protein and associates with insoluble fibrils. Mature, insoluble apoA-I fibrils bound EGCG (KD = 30 ± 3 μm; Bmax = 40 ± 3 μm), but EGCG did not alter the kinetics of apoA-I amyloid assembly from monomer in the presence or absence of heparin. EGCG selectively increased the mobility of specific backbone and side-chain sites of apoA-I fibrils formed in the absence of heparin, but the fibrils largely retained their original morphology and remained insoluble. By contrast, fibrils formed in the presence of heparin were mobilized extensively by the addition of equimolar EGCG, and the fibrils were remodeled into soluble 20-nm-diameter oligomers with a largely α-helical structure that were nontoxic to human umbilical artery endothelial cells. These results argue for a protective effect of EGCG on apoA-I amyloid associated with atherosclerosis and suggest that EGCG-induced remodeling of amyloid may be tightly regulated by GAGs and other amyloid co-factors in vivo, depending on EGCG bioavailability.

The objectives of this article are to describe the design and methodology of the first Mother and Infant Study Cohort (MISC) in UAE; present the baseline demographic characteristics of the study participants; and discuss the challenges of the cohort and their respective responding strategies.The MISC is an ongoing two-year prospective cohort study which recruited Arab pregnant women in their third trimester from prenatal clinics in Dubai, Sharjah and Ajman. Participants will be interviewed six times (once during pregnancy, at delivery, and at 2, 6, 12 and 24months postpartum). Perinatal information is obtained from hospital records. Collected data include socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, dietary intake and anthropometry; infant feeding practices, cognitive development; along with maternal and infant blood profile and breast milk profile.The preliminary results reported that 256 completed baseline assessment (mean age: 30.5±6.0 years; 76.6% multiparous; about 60% were either overweight or obese before pregnancy). The prevalence of gestational diabetes was 19.2%. Upon delivery, 208 women-infant pairs were retained (mean gestational age: 38.5±1.5 weeks; 33.3% caesarean section delivery; 5.3% low birthweight; 5.7% macrosomic deliveries). Besides participant retention, the main encountered challenges pertained to cultural complexity, underestimation the necessary start-up time, staff, and costs, and biochemical data collection.Despite numerous methodological, logistical and sociocultural challenges, satisfactory follow-up rates are recorded.

https://openalex.org/W2806528949,"The conformational conversion of pentameric C-reactive protein (pCRP) to monomeric CRP (mCRP) has been shown to play important roles in the action of CRP in inflammation regulation. In vivo studies revealed the origin of mCRP and provided insights into how pCRP dissociation affected its functions. However, the interplay and exact bioactivities of CRP isoforms still remain uncertain due to the rapid conformational conversion and complex milieu in vivo. Herein, we have used surface-immobilization of pCRP to generate a preservable intermediate with dual antigenicity expression of both pCRP and mCRP. The intermediate has been further shown to exhibit modified bioactivities, such as a high affinity with solution-phase pCRP and an enhanced capacity of complement interaction. These results thus not only provide the conformational conversion details of CRP, but also propose a simple way in vitro to study how the functions of CRP are tuned by distinct isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2805159867,"Background Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a high throughput technique that measures absorbance of specific wavelengths of light by biological samples and uses this information to classify the age of lab-reared mosquitoes as younger or older than seven days with an average accuracy greater than 80%. For NIRS to estimate ages of wild mosquitoes, a sample of wild mosquitoes with known age in days would be required to train and test the model. Mark-release-recapture is the most reliable method to produce wild-caught mosquitoes of known age in days. However, it is logistically demanding, time inefficient, subject to low recapture rates, and raises ethical issues due to the release of mosquitoes. Using labels from Detinova dissection results in a mathematical model with poor accuracy. Alternatively, a model trained on spectra from laboratory-reared mosquitoes where age in days is known can be applied to estimate the age of wild mosquitoes, but this would be appropriate only if spectra collected from laboratory-reared and wild mosquitoes are similar. Methods and findings We performed k-means (k = 2) cluster analysis on a mixture of spectra collected from lab-reared and wild Anopheles arabiensis to determine if there is any significant difference between these two groups. While controlling the numbers of mosquitoes included in the model at each age, we found two clusters with no significant difference in distribution of spectra collected from lab-reared and wild mosquitoes (p = 0.25). We repeated the analysis using hierarchical clustering, and similarly, no significant difference was observed (p = 0.13). Conclusion We find no difference between spectra collected from laboratory-reared and wild mosquitoes of the same age and species. The results strengthen and support the on-going practice of applying the model trained on spectra collected from laboratory-reared mosquitoes, especially first-generation laboratory-reared mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2805698832,"Due to the rapid emergence of resistance to classical antibiotics, novel antimicrobial compounds are needed. It is desirable to selectively kill pathogenic bacteria without targeting other beneficial bacteria in order to prevent the negative clinical consequences caused by many broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as reducing the development of antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent an alternative to classical antibiotics and it has been previously demonstrated that Cap18 has high antimicrobial activity against a broad range of bacterial species. In this study we report the design of a positional scanning library consisting of 696 Cap18 derivatives and the subsequent screening for antimicrobial activity against Y. ruckeri, A. salmonicida, S. Typhimurium and L. lactis as well as for hemolytic activity measuring the hemoglobin release of horse erythrocytes. We show that the hydrophobic face of Cap18, in particular I13, L17 and I24, is essential for its antimicrobial activity against S. Typhimurium, Y. ruckeri, A. salmonicida, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, L. lactis, L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis. In particular, Cap18 derivatives harboring a I13D, L17D, L17P, I24D or I24N substitution lost their antimicrobial activity against any of the tested bacterial strains. In addition, we were able to generate species-specific Cap18 derivatives by particular amino acid substitutions either in the hydrophobic face at positions L6, L17, I20, and I27, or in the hydrophilic face at positions K16 and K18. Finally, our data showed the proline residue at position 29 to be essential for the inherent low hemolytic activity of Cap18 and that substitution of the residues K16, K23, or G21 by any hydrophobic residues enhances the hemolytic activity. This study demonstrates the potential of generating species-specific AMPs for the selective elimination of bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2806446092,"Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo) in the rat is a widely used animal model of vascular dementia and a valuable tool for preclinical pharmacological drug testing, although the varying degrees of acute focal ischemic lesions it induces could interfere with its translational value. Recently, a modification to the BCCAo model, the stepwise occlusion of the two carotid arteries, has been introduced. To acquire objective translatable measures, we used longitudinal multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the effects of semi-chronic (8 days) donepezil treatment in this model, with half of the Wistar rats receiving the treatment one week after the stepwise BCCAo. With an ultrahigh field MRI, we measured high-resolution anatomy, diffusion tensor imaging, cerebral blood flow measurements and functional MRI in response to whisker stimulation, to evaluate both the structural and functional effects of the donepezil treatment and stepwise BCCAo up to 5 weeks post-occlusion. While no large ischemic lesions were detected, atrophy in the striatum and in the neocortex, along with widespread white matter microstructural changes, were found. Donepezil ameliorated the transient drop in the somatosensory BOLD response in distant cortical areas, as detected 2 weeks after the occlusion but the drug had no effect on the long term structural changes. Our results demonstrate a measurable functional MRI effect of the donepezil treatment and the importance of diffusion MRI and voxel based morphometry (VBM) analysis in the translational evaluation of the rat BCCAo model."
https://openalex.org/W4229822107,"Paddy rice fields are one of the most important sources of anthropogenic methane. Improving the accuracy in the CH4 budget is fundamental to identify strategies to mitigate climate change. Such improvement requires a mechanistic understanding of the complex interactions between environmental and agronomic factors determining CH4 emissions, and also the characterization of the annual temporal CH4 emissions pattern in the whole crop cycle. Hence, both the growing and fallow seasons must be included. However, most of the previous research has been based on single-factor analyses that are focused on the growing season. In order to fill this gap, a study was conducted in a Mediterranean rice agrosystem (Ebre Delta, Catalonia) following a farm-to-farm approach with the purpose of 1) evaluating the cumulative and temporal pattern of CH4 emission, and 2) conducting a multi-variate analyses to assess the associative pattern, relative contribution and temporal variation of the main explanatory variables concerning the observed CH4 emissions. Measurements of CH4 emissions and agronomic and environmental parameters in 15 commercial rice fields were monitored monthly, during a whole crop field cycle. The temporal pattern of CH4 emission followed a bi-modal distribution peaking in August and October. The cumulative annual CH4 emissions from rice fields amounted 314 kg CH4 kg ha-1, of which ca. 70% were emitted during the fallow season. The main controlling factors of the CH4 emission rate in the growing season were positive related to water level and plant cover, while soil redox was negatively related. The main controlling factors in the fallow season were water level (negatively related, conversely to the growing season), as well as straw incorporation and soil temperature (positively related). The results of this study highlight the importance of the often neglected fallow season in the accurate estimation of CH4 emissions and, thus, the necessity of measurement programs that cover the whole crop field cycle. This information is the first step for setting effective mitigation strategies based on straw and water management."
https://openalex.org/W2805087105,"Restoration of access to lost habitat for threatened and endangered fishes above currently impassable dams represents a major undertaking. Biological monitoring is critical to understand the dynamics and success of anadromous recolonization as, in the case of Oncorhynchus mykiss, anadromous steelhead populations are reconnected with their conspecific resident rainbow trout counterparts. We evaluate three river systems in the Lower Columbia River basin: the White Salmon, Sandy, and Lewis rivers that are in the process of removing and/or providing passage around existing human-made barriers in O. mykiss riverine habitat. In these instances, now isolated resident rainbow trout populations will be exposed to competition and/or genetic introgression with steelhead and vice versa. Our genetic analyses of 2,158 fish using 13 DNA microsatellite (mSAT) loci indicated that within each basin anadromous O. mykiss were genetically distinct from and significantly more diverse than their resident above-dam trout counterparts. Above long-standing natural impassable barriers, each of these watersheds also harbors unique rainbow trout gene pools with reduced levels of genetic diversity. Despite frequent releases of non-native steelhead and rainbow trout in each river, hatchery releases do not appear to have had a significant genetic effect on the population structure of O. mykiss in any of these watersheds. Simulation results suggest there is a high likelihood of identifying anadromous x resident individuals in the Lewis and White Salmon rivers, and slightly less so in the Sandy River. These genetic data are a prerequisite for informed monitoring, managing, and conserving the different life history forms during upstream recolonization when sympatry of life history forms of O. mykiss is restored."
https://openalex.org/W2805334510,"The consistent supply of fresh fish to commercial markets may mask growing fishing footprints and localized depletions, as fishing expands to deeper/further reefs, smaller fish, and more resilient species. To test this hypothesis, species-based records and fisher interviews were gathered over one year within a large, demand-driven coral-reef fishery in Chuuk, Micronesia. We first assessed catch statistics with respect to high windspeeds and moon phases that are known to constrain both catch and effort. While lower daily catch success was predicted by higher windspeeds and greater lunar illumination, total daily landings fluctuated less than fishing success across environmental gradients. Instead, daily landings were mainly driven by the number of flights from Chuuk to Guam (i.e., international demand). Given that demand masked local drivers of overall catch volume, we further evaluated species-based indicators of fisheries exploitation. Most target species (75%) had either a positively skewed size distribution or proportional contributions that were dependent upon favorable conditions (i.e. season and moon phases). Skewed size distributions indicated truncated growth associated with fishing mortality, and in turn, suggested that size-based management policies may be most effective for these species. In contrast, environmentally-constrained catch success indicated species that may be more susceptible to growing fishing footprints and may respond better to gear/quota/area policies compared to size policies. Species-based responses offered a simplified means to combine species into fisheries management units. Finally, a comparison of commercial and subsistence landings showed higher vulnerability to fishing among species preferentially targeted by commercial fisheries, offering new insights into how commercial harvesting can disproportionately impact resources, despite having lower annual catch volumes."
https://openalex.org/W2805984656,"Context processing involves a flexible and continually updated representation of task relevant information and is a core aspect of cognitive control. The expectancy AX Continuous Performance Test (AXCPT) was designed to specifically measure context processing and has been widely applied to elucidate mechanisms of cognitive control and their impairments in conditions such as aging and schizophrenia. Here we present a large-sample, cross-sectional study of context processing aimed at characterizing its normal development from childhood to early adulthood (8 to 22 years old). We track the age-related changes in the standard AXCPT performance measures and also investigate their validity using detailed data-driven method. We show how critical maturational changes in context processing can be validly tracked from mid-adolescence onward with increasing reliance on preparatory, proactive strategies well into early adulthood. However, the early maturation from childhood into adolescence showed a sharp, two-fold discontinuity: while standard measures provide partially conflicting results suggesting an early worsening of proactive strategies, further analyses do not support their validity during this period. Our findings advocate the existence of multiple preparatory strategies that cannot be captured by indices that assume a simple dichotomy of proactive vs. reactive strategies. When evaluating context processing differences over development or in clinical populations, we advocate the explicit testing of the assumptions underlying standard AXCPT indices through complementary data-driven methods."
https://openalex.org/W2806161082,"Climate variability plays a central role in the dynamics of marine pelagic ecosystems shaping the structure and abundance changes of plankton communities, thereby affecting energy pathways and biogeochemical fluxes in the ocean. Here we have investigated complex interactions driven a climate-hydrology-plankton system in the southern East China Sea over the period 2000 to 2012. In particular, we aimed at quantifying the influence of climate phenomena playing out in tropical (El Nino 3.4) and middle-high latitudes (East Asia Winter Monsoon, EAWM, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO) on pelagic copepods. We found that the EAWM and El Nino 3.4 showed a non-stationary and non-linear relationship with local temperature variability. In the two cases, the strength of the relationship, as indexed by the wavelet coherence analysis, decreased along with the positive phase of the PDO. Likewise, the influence of EAWM and El Nino3.4 on copepods exhibited a non-stationary link that changed along with the PDO state. Indeed, copepods and EAWM were closely related during the positive phase, while the link copepods–El Nino 3.4 was stronger during the negative phase. Our results pointed out cascading effects from climate to plankton driven by the positive phase of the PDO through its effect on temperature conditions, and likely through a larger southward transport of nutrient-rich water masses to northern Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. We suggest a chain of mechanisms whereby the PDO shapes interannual dynamics of pelagic copepods and highlight that these results have implications for integrative management measures, as pelagic copepods plays a prominent role in food web dynamics and for harvested fish in the East China Sea."

Night shifts and weekends experience understaffing and other organizational hurdles in comparison with the weekday morning shifts, and this may influence the risk of maternal deaths. Objective To analyze the hourly variation of maternal mortality within Mexican health institutions. Methods We performed a cross-sectional multivariate analysis of 3,908 maternal deaths and 10,589,444 births that occurred within health facilities in Mexico during the 2010–2014 period, using data from the Health Information Systems of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We fitted negative binomial regression models with covariate adjustment to all data, as well as similar models by basic cause of death and by weekdays/weekends. The outcome was the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), defined as the number of deaths occurred per 100,000 live births. Hour of day was the main predictor; covariates were day of the week, c-section, marginalization, age, education, and number of pregnancies. Results Risk rises during early morning, reaching 52.5 deaths per 100,000 live births at 6:00 (95% UI: 46.3, 62.2). This is almost twice the lowest risk, which occurred at noon (27.1 deaths per 100,000 live births [95% U.I.: 23.0, 32.0]). Risk shows peaks coinciding with shift changes, at 07:00, and 14:00 and was significantly higher on weekends and holidays. Conclusions Evidence suggests strong hourly fluctuations in the risk of maternal death with during early morning hours and around the afternoon shift change. These results may reflect institutional management problems that cause an uneven quality of obstetric care."

In mesic forests it nests primarily in tree cavities, but also uses various types of external platform nests in drier forests. We describe 1717 northern spotted owl nests in 16 different tree species in five study areas in Washington and Oregon in the Pacific Northwest, USA. The vast majority of nests (87%) were in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees, except on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, where nests were about equally abundant in Douglas-fir, western red cedar (Thuja plicata), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) trees. Distribution of nests was 57.9% in top cavities of trees with broken tops, 20.3% in side cavities of hollow tree trunks, and 21.8% on external platforms of trees. Platforms were most common in the two driest study areas in the Eastern Cascades Physiographic Province, Washington (89% of nests), and the Klamath Province, Oregon (32%). The vast majority (89%) of nests were in trees with intact or declining crowns. Nests in dead trees were most common on the Olympic Peninsula. Nest trees with top and side cavities were larger and much more prevalent in study areas where annual precipitation was highest (Olympic Peninsula, Oregon Coast Range). Large nest cavities and platforms used by northern spotted owls occur almost exclusively in old forest. Managing for the retention of such forests and for their replacement is a significant challenge for land managers, especially in the face of climate change and an increasing human population, but will likely be required for the persistence of viable populations of northern spotted owls."
https://openalex.org/W2807484141,"Immediately following a fracture, a fibrin laden hematoma is formed to prevent bleeding and infection. Subsequently, the organized removal of fibrin, via the protease plasmin, is essential to permit fracture repair through angiogenesis and ossification. Yet, when plasmin activity is lost, the depletion of fibrin alone is insufficient to fully restore fracture repair, suggesting the existence of additional plasmin targets important for fracture repair. Previously, activated matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was demonstrated to function in fracture repair by promoting angiogenesis. Given that MMP-9 is a defined plasmin target, it was hypothesized that pro-MMP-9, following plasmin activation, promotes fracture repair. This hypothesis was tested in a fixed murine femur fracture model with serial assessment of fracture healing. Contrary to previous findings, a complete loss of MMP-9 failed to affect fracture healing and union through 28 days post injury. Therefore, these results demonstrated that MMP-9 is dispensable for timely fracture union and cartilage transition to bone in fixed femur fractures. Pro-MMP-9 is therefore not a significant target of plasmin in fracture repair and future studies assessing additional plasmin targets associated with angiogenesis are warranted."

An integrated verbal and social autopsy toolwas developed and verbal autopsies of 600 adult deaths, occurring over a reference period of one year, were conducted in 2014. Quantitative analysis described the socio-demographic characteristics of the deceased, number and type of consultations from health care providers, and type of care received during illness. Qualitative data was analyzed to find out social causes of death by thematic analysis. The median duration of illness from symptom onset till death was 9 days (IQR = 1-45 days). At the onset of illness, 72 (12%) deceased utilized home remedies and 424 (70.7%)received care from a clinic/hospital, and 104 (17.3%) died withoutreceiving any care. The number of medical consultations varied from one to six (median = 2). The utilization of government health facilities and qualified allopathic doctor increased with each consultation (p value<0.05). The top five social causes of adult deaths in a rural area of Punjab in India. (1) Non availability of medical practitioner in the vicinity, (2) communication gaps between doctor and patient on regular intake of medication, (3) delayed referral by service provider, (4) poor communication with family on illness, and (5) perception of illness to be 'mild' by the family or care taker. To conclude, social autopsy tool should be integrated with verbal autopsy tool for identification of individual, community, and health system level factors associated with adult mortality."

However, few patients present clinically significant symptoms. Using a decision-tree approach, this study aimed to identify risk profiles for psychological problems based on measures that can be easily scored and interpreted by healthcare professionals in pediatric settings. The participants were 736 children and adolescents between 8-18 years of age with asthma, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, type-1diabetes or obesity. The children and adolescents completed self-report measures of health-related quality of life (DISABKIDS-10) and psychological problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from their parents/ physicians. Children and adolescents were classified into the normal (78.5%) or borderline/clinical range (21.5%) according to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire cut-off values for psychological problems. The overall accuracy of the decision-tree model was 78.1% (sensitivity = 71.5%; specificity = 79.9%), with 4 profiles predicting 71.5% of borderline/clinical cases. The strongest predictor of psychological problems was a health-related quality of life standardized score below the threshold of 57.5 for patients with cerebral palsy, epilepsy or obesity and below 70.0 for patients with asthma or diabetes. Other significant predictors were low socio-economic status, single-parent household, medication intake and younger age. The model showed adequate validity (risk = .28, SE = .02) and accuracy (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve = .84; CI = .80/.87). The identification of pediatric patients at high risk for psychological problems may contribute to a more efficient allocation of health resources, particularly with regard to their referral to specialized psychological assessment and intervention."

Patients with reduced ITPase activity showed improved treatment efficacy when treated with IFN/RBV. In addition, a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene is associated with an improved response to IFN/RBV treatment. RBV has been an important component of IFN-containing regimens, and is currently recommended in combination with several IFN-free regimens for treatment of harder to cure HCV infections. Aim To evaluate whether genetic variations that reduce ITPase activity impact RBV-induced anemia in IFN-free/RBV regimens Methods In this study, genetic analyses were conducted in the PEARL-IV trial to investigate the effect of activity-reducing ITPA variants as well as IL28B polymorphism on anemia, platelet (PLT) counts, and virologic response in HCV genotype1a-infected patients treated with the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir±RBV. Results Reduction in ITPase activity and homozygosity for the IL28Brs12979860 CC genotype protected against RBV-induced anemia. In patients receiving RBV, reduced ITPase activity was associated with reduced plasma RBV concentration and higher PLT counts. ITPase activity had no impact on response to DAA treatment, viral kinetics, or baseline IP-10 levels. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that genetics of ITPA and IL28B may help identify patients protected from RBV-induced anemia when treated with IFN-free regimens. Our work demonstrates for the first time that IL28B genetics may also have an impact on RBV-induced anemia. This may be of particular significance in patients with difficult-to-cure HCV infections, such as patients with decompensated cirrhosis where RBV-containing regimens likely will continue to be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2805197965,"This paper is concerned with the derivation of a well-balanced kinetic scheme to approximate a shallow flow model incorporating non-flat bottom topography and horizontal temperature gradients. The considered model equations, also called as Ripa system, are the non-homogeneous shallow water equations considering temperature gradients and non-uniform bottom topography. Due to the presence of temperature gradient terms, the steady state at rest is of primary interest from the physical point of view. However, capturing of this steady state is a challenging task for the applied numerical methods. The proposed well-balanced kinetic flux vector splitting (KFVS) scheme is non-oscillatory and second order accurate. The second order accuracy of the scheme is obtained by considering a MUSCL-type initial reconstruction and Runge-Kutta time stepping method. The scheme is applied to solve the model equations in one and two space dimensions. Several numerical case studies are carried out to validate the proposed numerical algorithm. The numerical results obtained are compared with those of staggered central NT scheme. The results obtained are also in good agreement with the recently published results in the literature, verifying the potential, efficiency, accuracy and robustness of the suggested numerical scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2806966836,"In this paper we report an initial validation of the Shape Trail Test-Child Version (STT-CV) with a non-clinical sample of children aged 6 to 9 years. The STT-CV has been developed as an age-appropriate and culturally fair direct downward extension of the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of cognitive flexibility. Children completed the STT-CV and four established measures of executive functions that assessed working memory, inhibitory control and task switching. Results showed the expected age-based differences in completion times for both parts of the STT-CV (Trail A and Trail B). Children's performance on the STT-CV correlated significantly with all four measures of executive functions. After controlling for the effects of chronological age, completion times for Trail B remained correlated with most other measures of executive functions. These findings provide emerging evidence for the utility of the STT-CV, and highlight the need for designing and using appropriate variants of the TMT in the behavioural assessment of cognitive flexibility in developmentally and culturally diverse populations."
https://openalex.org/W2806221537,"Philip Hopkins, a theoretical astrophysicist at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, likes to prank his colleagues. An expert in simulating formation of galaxies, Hopkins sometimes begins his talks by projecting images of his creations next to photos of real galaxies and defying his audience to tell them apart. We can even trick astronomers, Hopkins says. For decades, scientists have tried to simulate how trillions of galaxies in observable universe arose from clouds of gas after big bang. But only in past few years have simulations begun to reproduce both details of individual galaxies and their distribution of masses and shapes. As fake universes improve, their role is also changing. Previously, information flowed one way: from astronomers studying real galaxies to modelers trying to simulate them. Now, insight is flowing other way, too, with models helping guide astronomers and astrophysicists. The models suggest that earliest galaxies were oddly pickle-shaped, that wafer-thin spiral galaxies are surprisingly rugged in face of collisions, and, perhaps most important, that galaxies must form stars far more slowly than astrophysicists expected. Progress is coming so fast, says Tiziana Di Matteo, a numerical cosmologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that the whole thing has reached this little golden age."
