https://openalex.org/W2087876594,"The structure of a complex between a peptide inhibitor with the sequence N-acetyl-Thr-Ile-Nle-psi[CH2-NH]-Nle-Gln-Arg.amide (Nle, norleucine) with chemically synthesized HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus 1) protease was determined at 2.3 A resolution (R factor of 0.176). Despite the symmetric nature of the unliganded enzyme, the asymmetric inhibitor lies in a single orientation and makes extensive interactions at the interface between the two subunits of the homodimeric protein. Compared with the unliganded enzyme, the protein molecule underwent substantial changes, particularly in an extended region corresponding to the ""flaps"" (residues 35 to 57 in each chain), where backbone movements as large as 7 A are observed."
https://openalex.org/W2146702776,"The ability of the Rev protein of HIV to regulate the cytoplasmic level of unspliced RNA from a beta-globin gene containing the Rev response element was dependent on the integrity of the 5' and 3' splice sites. A beta-globin pre-mRNA containing the Rev response element is not under regulation by Rev but is made Rev responsive by a mutation at either the 5' or 3' splice site. These mutant RNAs accumulated in the nucleus as unspliced precursors owing to recognition by splicing components. Only in the presence of Rev did these unspliced RNAs appear in the cytoplasm. Thus, regulation by Rev probably involves the dissociation of splicing components and pre-mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2012020894,"The prohormone-processing endoprotease (KEX2 gene product) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a membrane-bound, 135,000-dalton glycoprotein, which contains both asparagine-linked and serine- and threonine-linked oligosaccharide and resides in a secretory compartment. Analysis of mutant kex2 genes truncated at their 3' end indicates that carboxyl terminal domains of the enzyme are required for its proper localization within the cell. A human gene product, ""furin,"" shares 50% identity with the catalytic domain of Kex2 protease and is, therefore, a candidate for a human prohormone-processing enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1990000982,"The transcriptional induction of heat shock genes is mediated by the heat shock transcription factor (HSF). We have investigated the oligomerization state of HSF from S. cerevisiae and find that it forms a trimer in solution and when bound to DNA. Trimerization is mediated by a region of HSF that, like the leucine zipper, is characterized by the occurrence of hydrophobic amino acids every 7 residues. We propose that it forms a three-stranded coiled coil."

https://openalex.org/W2056550647,"SIR1, one of several genes required for repression of yeast silent mating type loci, has a unique role in repression of the HML alpha locus. Single-cell assays revealed that cells with mutant alleles of SIR1, including presumptive null alleles, existed as populations of genetically identical cells whose members were in one of two different regulatory states. A minority of cells had a repressed HML alpha locus whereas the majority had a derepressed HML alpha locus. The two states were mitotically stable, although rare changes in state were observed during mitotic growth, possibly reflecting heritable changes to the HML alpha locus at or before replication. Analysis of changes in state suggests that SIR1 protein has a role in the establishment but not the maintenance of repression of silent mating type genes, whereas SIR2, SIR3, and SIR4 are required for maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1491433568,"We recently showed that HeLa cell lamin B is modified by a mevalonic acid derivative. Here we identified the modified amino acid, determined its mode of linkage to the mevalonic acid derivative, and established the derivative′s structure. A cysteine residue is modified because experiments with lamin B that had been biosynthetically labeled with [3H]mevalonic acid or [35S]cysteine and then extensively digested with proteases yielded 3H- or 35S-labeled products that co-chromatographed in five successive systems. A thioether linkage rather than a thioester linkage is involved because the mevalonic acid derivative could be released from the 3H-labeled products in a pentane-extractable form by treatment with Raney nickel but not with methanolic KOH. The derivative is a farnesyl moiety because the Raney nickel-released material was identified as 2,6,10-trimethyl-2,6,10-dodecatriene by a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The thioether-modified cysteine residue appears to be located near the carboxyl end of lamin B because treatment of 3H-labeled lamin B with cyanogen bromide yielded a single labeled polypeptide that mapped toward this end of the cDNA-inferred sequence of human lamin B."
https://openalex.org/W2047034219,"Immunization with chemically detoxified pertussis toxin can prevent severe whooping cough with an efficacy similar to that of the cellular pertussis vaccine, which normally gives unwanted side effects. To avoid the reversion to toxicity and the loss of immunogenicity that may follow chemical treatment of pertussis toxin, inactive toxins were constructed by genetic manipulation. A number of genetically engineered alleles of the pertussis toxin genes, constructed by replacing either one or two key amino acids within the enzymatically active S1 subunit, were introduced into the chromosome of strains of Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. bronchiseptica. These strains produce mutant pertussis toxin molecules that are nontoxic and immunogenic and that protect mice from the intracerebral challenge with virulent Bordetella pertussis. Such molecules are ideal for the development of new and safer vaccines against whooping cough."
https://openalex.org/W1551027803,"A cDNA clone for the catalytic subunit of murine cAMP-dependent protein kinase was placed into two expression vectors, pLWS-3 and pLSW-4. For pLWS-3, the entire coding region of the catalytic subunit was inserted into the NdeI site of pT7-7 under the control of the T7 promoter. pLWS-4 contains a polycistronic transcript under control of the lac UV5 promoter encoding for the type I regulatory subunit followed by the catalytic subunit. Significant expression was achieved with pLWS-4 in Escherichia coli 222 and JM101; however, the catalytic subunit was produced in an insoluble form. In the case of the catalytic subunit produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) by pLWS-3, the catalytic subunit accounted for approximately 30% of the total bacterial protein. Up to 5 mg of this catalytic subunit per liter of culture was in the soluble extract. Solubility was improved substantially when induction was carried out at 30 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. This recombinant catalytic subunit was purified by phosphocellulose chromatography, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration. A Mr of 38,000 was estimated based on size exclusion chromatography and on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant protein had a free alpha-amino-terminal Gly in contrast to the mammalian enzyme which is myristylated at the amino-terminal glycine. The lack of acylation did not significantly alter the activity of the enzyme. The specific activity of 19 mumol/min/mg is comparable to the mammalian enzyme. The Km values for Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) (43 microM) and MgATP (18.5 microM also were comparable. The absence of the acyl group also did not prevent holoenzyme formation. Holoenzyme activation by cAMP was indistinguishable for holoenzyme made with mammalian catalytic subunit and recombinant catalytic subunit. The recombinant enzyme was more sensitive than the mammalian enzyme to heat denaturation at 49 degrees C. The t1/2 for the recombinant catalytic subunit was 0.7 min in contrast to 3.9 min for the mammalian enzyme. This difference in stability may be attributable to the lack of the acyl group. The recombinant enzyme was particularly sensitive to heat denaturation in the presence of low concentrations (0.01%) of Triton X-100."
https://openalex.org/W2084914743,"We have cloned the tus gene that encodes the replication terminator protein of Escherichia coli and have efficiently expressed its gene product. The overproducer strain has been used to purify the terminator (ter) protein in high yield to near homogeneity. The protein is a single 36 kd polypeptide. Using the ter protein and highly purified dnaB helicase, we show that the terminator protein is a DNA sequence-specific contra-helicase, i.e., the protein when bound to its recognition sequence (tau) strongly impedes the ATP-dependent unwinding of double-stranded DNA. This contra-helicase activity is polar, i.e., the impedance to unwinding takes place in only one orientation of the tau sequence. The results illuminate the mechanism of replication termination specifically at tau."
https://openalex.org/W2031748942,"We have designed a vector to express the mammalian GAP protein in the yeast S. cerevisiae. When expressed in yeast, GAP inhibits the function of the human H-rasgly12 protein, but not that of the H-rasval12 protein, and complements the loss of IRA1. IRA1 is a yeast gene that encodes a protein with homology to GAP and acts upstream of RAS. Mammalian GAP can therefore function in yeast and interact with yeast RAS. Because expression of GAP complements ira1− mutants, we propose that GAP shares some biochemical functions with IRA1. Other studies indicate that IRA1 controls the level of RAS activity, presumably by regulating GTP hydrolysis. By analogy, we propose that GAP may play a similar role."
https://openalex.org/W1562416468,"N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is an oncofetal antigen in humans and is developmentally regulated in rodents. We have explored the biology of N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of the parent sialic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to Neu5Gc. We show that the major sialic acid in all compartments of murine myeloma cell lines is Neu5Gc. Pulse-chase analysis in these cells with the sialic acid precursor [6-3H]N-acetylmannosamine demonstrates that most of the newly synthesized Neu5Gc appears initially in the cytosolic low-molecular weight pool bound to CMP. The percentage of Neu5Gc on membrane-bound sialic acids closely parallels that in the CMP-bound pool at various times of chase, whereas that in the free sialic acid pool is very low initially, and rises only later during the chase. This implies that conversion from Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc occurs primarily while Neu5Ac is in its sugar nucleotide form. In support of this, the hydroxylase enzyme from a variety of tissues and cells converted CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc, but showed no activity towards free or alpha-glycosidically bound Neu5Ac. Furthermore, the majority of the enzyme activity is found in the cytosol. Studies with isolated intact Golgi vesicles indicate that CMP-Neu5Gc can be transported and utilized for transfer of Neu5Gc to glycoconjugates. The general properties of the enzyme have also been investigated. The Km for CMP-Neu5Ac is in the range of 0.6-2.5 microM. No activity can be detected against the beta-methylglycoside of Neu5Ac. On the other hand, inhibition studies suggest that the enzyme recognizes both the 5'-phosphate group and the pyrimidine base of the substrate. Taken together, the data allow us to propose pathways for the biosynthesis and reutilization of Neu5Gc, with initial conversion from Neu5Ac occurring primarily at the level of the sugar nucleotide. Subsequent release and reutilization of Neu5Gc could then account for the higher steady-state level of Neu5Gc found in all of the sialic acid pools of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1553017304,"Abstract Expression and synthesis of sucrase-isomaltase (SI) were studied in human jejunum and in the colon tumor cell lines Caco-2 and HT-29. Twelve monoclonal antibodies produced against the adult human intestinal enzyme were shown to recognize specifically SI by immunoprecipitation of 14C-labeled membrane proteins, analysis of enzyme activities in the immunoprecipitates, and immunoblotting. These antibodies produced markedly different patterns of immunofluorescent staining of the intestinal mucosa. Three of them were specific for the absorptive villus cells, while the other nine also stained the luminal membrane of the proliferative crypt cells, with different intensities which paralleled their ability to recognize SI in immunoblots. Sequential immunoprecipitation of SI solubilized from purified brush borders or entire jejunum with four selected antibodies demonstrated the presence of different forms of the enzyme, expressed by either villus or crypt cells. Two immunologically distinct forms of high mannose precursor (hmP1 and hmP2) were also identified in both jejunal mucosa and colon tumor cells. They were present as monomers and their immunological differences were preserved under various ionic and pH conditions. Pulse-chase studies indicated that, in Caco-2 cells, hmP1 is converted into hmP2 within 30 min of chase, and hmP2 is then processed into the complex-glycosylated precursor destined for the brush border membrane. hmP1 was immunologically related to the mature SI present in crypt cells and lacked the epitopes specific for mature SI expressed by villus cells. These results demonstrated that sucrase-isomaltase is synthesized by both crypt and villus cells, but processing of the cotranslationally glycosylated high mannose precursor is dependent on the state of differentiation of the enterocytes. This may represent a general mechanism for the regulation of expression of differentiated cell products at the post-translational level."
https://openalex.org/W2027138957,"The basal rate of DNA sequence evolution in enterobacteria, as seen in the extent of divergence between Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, varies greatly among genes, even when only ""silent"" sites are considered. The degree of divergence is clearly related to the level of gene expression, reflecting constraints on synonymous codon choice. However, where this constraint is weak, among genes not expressed at high levels, divergence is also related to the chromosomal location of the gene; it appears that genes furthest away from oriC, the origin of replication, have a mutation rate approximately two times that of genes near oriC."
https://openalex.org/W2060233137,Host cell factors act together with regulatory genes of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to control virus production. Human-Chinese hamster ovary hybrid cell clones were used to probe for human chromosomes involved in regulating HIV gene expression. DNA transfection experiments showed that 4 of 18 clones had high levels of HIV gene expression measured by both extracellular virus production and transactivation of the HIV long terminal repeat in the presence of the trans-activator (tat) gene. Karyotype analyses revealed a 94% concordance (17/18) between human chromosome 12 and HIV gene expression. Other chromosomes had an 11 to 72% concordance with virus production.
https://openalex.org/W1512102774,"The 33-, 23-, and 16-kDa proteins of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex are synthesized as precursors in the cytoplasm and transported into the thylakoid lumen of higher plant chloroplasts. In this report we have analyzed the import and maturation of these precursors, using reconstituted protein import assays and partially purified preparations of the processing peptidases involved. Precursors of the 33- and 23-kDa proteins from Spinacia and Triticum aestivum are processed by a stromal peptidase to intermediate forms; polypeptides of similar size are observed during the transport of these precursors and possibly that of the 16-kDa protein, into isolated chloroplasts. Complete maturation of the 33- and 23-kDa proteins is carried out by a thylakoidal peptidase shown previously to be involved in plastocyanin biogenesis. The data support an import mechanism involving successive cleavages by the stromal and thylakoidal processing peptidases."
https://openalex.org/W2057176842,"A single-site mutant of Escherichia coli glutaminyl-synthetase (D235N, GlnRS7) that incorrectly acylates in vivo the amber suppressor supF tyrosine transfer RNA (tRNA(Tyr] with glutamine has been described. Two additional mutant forms of the enzyme showing this misacylation property have now been isolated in vivo (D235G, GlnRS10; I129T, GlnRS15). All three mischarging mutant enzymes still retain a certain degree of tRNA specificity; in vivo they acylate supE glutaminyl tRNA (tRNA(Gln] and supF tRNA(Tyr) but not a number of other suppressor tRNA's. These genetic experiments define two positions in GlnRS where amino acid substitution results in a relaxed specificity of tRNA discrimination. The crystal structure of the GlnRS:tRNA(Gln) complex provides a structural basis for interpreting these data. In the wild-type enzyme Asp235 makes sequence-specific hydrogen bonds through its side chain carboxylate group with base pair G3.C70 in the minor groove of the acceptor stem of the tRNA. This observation implicates base pair 3.70 as one of the identity determinants of tRNA(Gln). Isoleucine 129 is positioned adjacent to the phosphate of nucleotide C74, which forms part of a hairpin structure adopted by the acceptor end of the complexed tRNA molecule. These results identify specific areas in the structure of the complex that are critical to accurate tRNA discrimination by GlnRS."
https://openalex.org/W1527359370,"In the x-ray structure of the human dihydrofolate reductase, phenylalanine 31 and phenylalanine 34 have been shown to be involved in hydrophobic interactions with bound substrates and inhibitors. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and a bacterial expression system producing the wild-type and mutant human dihydrofolate reductases at levels of 10% of the bacterial protein, we have constructed, expressed, and purified a serine 31 (S31) mutant and a serine 34 (S34) mutant. Fluorescence titration experiments indicated that S31 bound the substrate H2folate 10-fold tighter and the coenzyme NADPH 2-fold tighter than the wild-type human dihydrofolate reductase. The serine 31 mutation had little effect on the steady-state kinetic properties of the enzyme but produced a 100-fold increase in the dissociation constant (Kd) for the inhibitor methotrexate. The serine 34 mutant had much greater alterations in its properties than S31; specifically, S34 had a 3-fold reduction in the Km for NADPH, a 24-fold increase in the Km for H2folate, a 3-fold reduction in the overall reaction rate kcat, and an 80,000-fold increase in the Kd for methotrexate. In addition, the pH dependence of the steady-state kinetic parameters of S34 were different from that of the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that phenylalanine 31 and phenylalanine 34 make very different contributions to ligand binding and catalysis in the human dihydrofolate reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1528896791,"Abstract Amino acids were found to play an integral role in modulating glucose-induced desensitization of the glucose transport system (GTS). When adipocytes were treated for 6 h in a defined buffer containing 25 ng/ml insulin, 20 mM glucose, plus the 15 amino acids found in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, we observed marked desensitization of the GTS, manifested by a 60% decrease in maximal insulin responsiveness (MIR) and a 2.5-fold reduction in insulin sensitivity. In contrast, little or no desensitization was seen under similar conditions in the absence of amino acids. The ability of amino acids to co-regulate the GTS appears to be directly attributable to amino acids per se since desensitization was still observed in cycloheximide-treated cells. Moreover, the action of amino acids is specific to glucose-induced desensitization since amino acids were not required for dexamethasone-induced desensitization of the GTS. Of the 15 amino acids contained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, one group of 8 amino acids was fully effective in mediating loss of both MIR and insulin sensitivity, whereas the remaining 7 amino acids were ineffective. Interestingly, this second group selectively retained the ability to modulate loss of insulin sensitivity. Upon screening the individual amino acids, we found that L-glutamine (but not D-glutamine) was as effective as total amino acids in modulating loss of MIR, whereas glycine and threonine were only partially effective. Since isoleucine and serine enhanced both MIR and insulin sensitivity of the protein synthesis system without influencing the GTS, it appears that amino acids can influence several insulin effector systems with notable differences in rapidity of action, direction of regulation, and specificity of amino acids. From these studies we conclude: 1) desensitization of the GTS requires three components--glucose, insulin, and selective amino acids; 2) insulin resistance of the GTS can be induced through several mechanisms, but only glucose-induced desensitization requires amino acids; 3) glucose-induced desensitization is mediated primarily by metabolic events independent of de novo protein synthesis; and 4) glutamine is the primary amino acid modulating glucose-induced loss of MIR. Overall, these studies reveal that amino acids play an important role in modulating insulin action at the cellular level and provide new insights into the metabolic mechanisms mediating insulin resistance of the glucose transport system."
https://openalex.org/W2024754915,"Thymotaxin, an 11-kilodalton protein chemotactic for rat bone marrow hematopoietic precursors, was purified from media conditioned by a rat thymic epithelial cell line. The NH2-terminal sequence of thymotaxin was identical to that of rat beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m). Antibodies to beta 2m removed thymotaxin activity from the fraction containing the 11-kilodalton protein. Chemotactic activity was observed with rat plasma beta 2m, human beta 2m, and mouse recombinant beta 2m, further supporting the identity of thymotaxin with beta 2m. The directional migration, as opposed to random movement, of the cells was also confirmed. The only rat bone marrow cells that migrated toward beta 2m were Thy1+ immature lymphoid cells devoid of T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell differentiation markers."
https://openalex.org/W1495489244,"The biosynthesis of the tyrosine-derived cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin has been studied with a microsomal preparation obtained from etiolated seedlings of sorghum. The biosynthetic pathway involves tyrosine, N-hydroxytyrosine, and p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime as early intermediates (Moller, B. L. and Conn, E. E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 8575-8583). The use of deuterium-labeled tyrosine and mass spectrometric analyses demonstrate that the alpha-hydrogen atom of tyrosine is retained in the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime. This excludes p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid oxime as intermediate in the pathway. A high pressure liquid chromatography method was developed to separate the (E)- and (Z)-isomers of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime. The microsomal enzyme system was found to produce initially the (E)-isomer of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime. An isomerase then converts the (E)-isomer to the (Z)-isomer, which is the isomer preferentially utilized by the microsomal enzyme system in the subsequent biosynthetic reactions. The (E)-isomer produced in situ is more efficiently converted to the (Z)-isomer than exogenously added (E)-isomer and may thus be metabolically channeled."

https://openalex.org/W1548235245,"The beta-lactamase signal peptide alone is not sufficient to direct secretion of chicken muscle triosephosphate isomerase, a normally cytoplasmic protein, into the periplasm of Escherichia coli. The signal peptide and at least the first 3 residues of the mature beta-lactamase are required before any secretion of the isomerase can be observed. At this point the level of secretion is very low, but the addition of further residues of the mature beta-lactamase enhances the secretion of the hybrid protein. The maximum level of secretion is achieved when 12 or more residues of the mature beta-lactamase intervene between the signal peptide and the isomerase. It is the proximity of an arginine residue at position 3 of the isomerase that is responsible for the blockade to secretion of these hybrid proteins (see Summers, R.G., Harris, C.R., and Knowles, J.R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20082-20088). With 12 residues of the mature beta-lactamase between the signal peptide and the isomerase, the offending arginine now lies at position 15 of the hybrid. The 14 residues that immediately follow the signal peptide therefore define a region of constrained properties that is critical to the secretability of proteins from E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1494841331,"Abstract The conformation of the Escherichia coli initiator tRNA has been investigated using enzymatic and chemical probes. This study was conducted on the naked tRNA and on the tRNA involved in the various steps leading to the formation of the 30 S.IF-2.GTP.fMet-tRNA.AUG complex. A three-dimensional model of the initiator tRNA is presented, which displays several differences with yeast tRNAPhe: (i) the anticodon arm is more rigid; (ii) the presence of an additional nucleotide in the D loop results in specific features in both T and D loops; (iii) C1 and A72 might form a noncanonical base pair. Aminoacylation and formylation induce subtle conformational adjustments near the 3' end, the T arm and the D loop. Initiation factor (IF) 2 interacts with a rather limited portion of the tRNA, covering the T loop and the minor groove of the T stem, and induces an increased flexibility in the anticodon arm. The specific structural features observed in the T loop are probably recognized by IF-2. In the 30 S.IF-2.GTP.fMet-tRNA.AUG complex, additional protections are observed in the acceptor stem and in the anticodon arm, resulting from a strong steric hindrance and from the codon-anticodon interaction within the subunit decoding site."
https://openalex.org/W1545101555,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) regulates the expression of c-myc protooncogene in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (Reitzma, P. H., Rothberg, P. G., Astrin, S. M., Trial, J., Barshavit, Z., Hall, A., Teitelbaum, S. U., and Kahn, A. J. (1983) Nature 306, 492-494). The regulation of c-myc expression occurs at least in part at the transcriptional level (Simpson, R. U., Hsu, T., Begley, D. A., Mitchell, B. S., and Alizadeh, B. N. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4104-4108). Also, 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulates an increase in protein kinase C (PKC) levels and inhibitors of PKC block 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells (Martell, R. E., Simpson, R. U., and Taylor, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5570-5575). In this report we demonstrated that sphinganine, an inhibitor of PKC that is mechanistically and structurally distinct from 1-(5-isoquinoline sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine-HCl (H-7), also blocks 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of HL-60 cell differentiation. The effect of inhibitors of PKC on 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of c-myc transcription was examined. H-7 (18 microM) and sphinganine (3 and 6 microM) blunted 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced reduction of c-myc transcription as assessed by nuclear run-off assays. We showed that c-myc/beta-actin ratios (cpm/cpm, % of control mean +/- S.E.) were as follows: ethanol control, 100 +/- 14%; 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3, 17 +/- 5%; 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 6 microM H-7, 13 +/- 6%; 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 18 microM H-7, 53 +/- 6% 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 18 microM N-[2-guanidinoethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide (HA-1004), 10 +/- 8%; 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 6 microM sphinganine, 49 +/- 8%. No significant differences in c-myc transcription between control, 18 microM H-7, 18 microM HA-1004, and 3 or 6 microM sphinganine-treated cells were observed. The block in c-myc transcription was beyond exon 1, and regulation of exon 1 transcription by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was not detected. Furthermore, we demonstrated that expression of markers for HL-60 cell differentiation was more rapidly induced by 25 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate than 50 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3, suggesting that direct activation of PKC by phorbol esters may make processes required for 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of differentiation unnecessary. In summary, these data suggest that a primary effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cells is to regulate PKC levels, and regulation of c-myc transcription by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is a result of this action."
https://openalex.org/W1512390959,"Abstract Genetic studies in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and biochemical data in oocytes and eggs of Xenopus laevis have implicated the product of the cdc2+ gene as critical for the G2 to M transition in the cell cycle. The product of the cdc2+ gene is a 34-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase, designated p34cdc2, that is a component of purified maturation-promoting factor (MPF) and also of purified mammalian growth-associated histone H1 kinase. The biochemical properties of p34cdc2 H1 kinase activity in the MPF complex were studied. Phosphorylation of the p45cyclin component in the MPF complex by p34cdc2 exhibited kinetics consistent with an intramolecular reaction. On glycerol gradient centrifugation, MPF kinase against several substrates sedimented with an apparent Mr = 45,000-55,000. p34cdc2 was found to utilize ATP, GTP, and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) with apparent Km values of 75, 700, and 250 microM, respectively. The kinase activity was inhibited by beta-glycerophosphate, NaF, and zinc, whereas p-nitrophenyl phosphate was slightly stimulatory. The relative rates of phosphorylation of various substrates by MPF and growth-associated H1 kinase were similar. These findings should prove useful in further work on the regulation of MPF kinase activity and characterization of its substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1515556443,"Normal Rat-1 fibroblasts and Rat-1 cells transformed by the H-ras oncogene (Rat-1-EJ) were analyzed for cell-associated growth factor activity. The two cell lines grew at the same rate, but at any given stage of growth the Rat-1-EJ cells synthesized two to four times more cell-associated growth factor activity than did the Rat-1 cells. For each cell line, the level of cell-associated growth factor activity was five to eight times greater at confluent densities compared to sparse densities. Heparin affinity chromatography and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the cell-associated growth factor was basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The bFGF synthesized by the Rat-1-EJ cells appeared in two molecular mass forms, about 40% as an 18-kDa form which comigrated with recombinant bFGF and about 60% as a higher molecular mass doublet of about 22 kDa. The two forms of bFGF were biologically active and could be separated on a Mono S cation exchange column. Separation and purification to homogeneity of both the 18-kDa bFGF and the 22-kDa bFGF doublet were achieved by a combination of CM-Sepharose cation exchange, heparin affinity-fast performance liquid chromatography, and C4 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1555392973,"Achromobacter protease I (API) is a lysine-specific serine protease which hydrolyzes specifically the lysyl peptide bond. A gene coding for API was cloned from Achromobacter lyticus M497-1. Nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA fragment revealed that the gene coded for a single polypeptide chain of 653 amino acids. The N-terminal 205 amino acids, including signal peptide and the threonine/serine-rich C-terminal 180 amino acids are flanking the 268 amino acid-mature protein which was identified by protein sequencing. Escherichia coli carrying a plasmid containing the cloned API gene overproduced and secreted a protein of Mr 50,000 (API') into the periplasm. This protein exhibited a distinct endopeptidase activity specific for lysyl bonds as well. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of API' was the same as mature API, suggesting that the enzyme retained the C-terminal extended peptide chain. The present experiments indicate that API, an extracellular protease produced by gram-negative bacteria, is synthesized in vivo as a precursor protein bearing long extended peptide chains at both N and C termini."
https://openalex.org/W1547641578,"We have screened approximately 10,000 colonies of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells immobilized on polyester cloth for mutants defective in [14C]ethanolamine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable phospholipids. In mutant 29, discovered in this way, the activities of enzymes involved in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway were normal; however, the intracellular pool of phosphorylethanolamine was elevated, being more than 10-fold that in the parental CHO-K1 cells. These results suggested that the reduced incorporation of [14C]ethanolamine into phosphatidylethanolamine in mutant 29 was due to dilution of phosphoryl-[14C]ethanolamine with the increased amount of cellular phosphorylethanolamine. Interestingly, the rate of incorporation of serine into phosphatidylserine and the content of phosphatidylserine in mutant 29 cells were increased 3-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with the parent cells. The overproduction of phosphorylethanolamine in mutant 29 cells was ascribed to the elevated level of phosphatidylserine biosynthesis, because ethanolamine is produced as a reaction product on the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylserine, which is catalyzed by phospholipid-serine base-exchange enzymes. Using both intact cells and the particulate fraction of a cell extract, phosphatidylserine biosynthesis in CHO-K1 cells was shown to be inhibited by phosphatidylserine itself, whereas that in mutant 29 cells was greatly resistant to the inhibition, compared with the parental cells. As a conclusion, it may be assumed that mutant 29 cells have a lesion in the regulation of phosphatidylserine biosynthesis by serine-exchange enzyme activity, which results in the overproduction of phosphatidylserine and phosphorylethanolamine as well."
https://openalex.org/W1561296796,"Abstract We have determined the relative affinities in solution for various metals which bind to the lone calcium-binding site of the D-galactose-binding protein which resembles the EF-hand loop. In order of affinity the metals are: Ca2+ approximately Tb3+ approximately Pb2+ greater than Cd2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Mg2+ much greater than Ba2+. The binding affinity for calcium (Kd = 2 microM) and the slow off-rate determined for terbium (1 x 10(-3) s-1) and that the metal-binding site is unperturbed by sugar binding argue for a structural role. Furthermore, we have crystallographically refined the structure of the binding protein with the calcium substituted by cadmium, compared it with the calcium-bound structure, and found them to be identical. The results of these structural and solution studies support the hypothesis that for a given metal-binding loop, cation hydration energy, size, and charge are major factors contributing to binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1891582045,"Ribosome releasing factor (RRF) is responsible for the release of ribosomes from messenger RNA at the termination of Escherichia coli protein biosynthesis (Hirashima, A., and Kaji, A. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 4037-4044). RRF has been partially analyzed by Edman degradation to obtain its amino acid sequence. Based on this analysis, a 47-nucleotide probe was synthesized and used to screen clones from the Clarke and Carbon Gene Bank which carry sequences within the 0-10 min region of the E. coli gene map. The entire RRF cistron was detected on the plasmid pLC6-32. The DNA sequence of RRF was determined, and it was deduced that RRF consists of 185 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 20,639. A rho-independent transcriptional termination sequence was found immediately downstream of the RRF cistron. The RRF gene was subcloned into the vector pUC19, and the resulting plasmid was named pRR1. E. coli harboring this plasmid expressed much more RRF than cells containing pUC19, and it was biologically active."
https://openalex.org/W1489672007,"Abstract The Escherichia coli UvrABC endonuclease is a multisubunit enzyme that initiates the repair of a wide variety of DNA lesions in vivo by making dual incisions on a damaged strand at the eighth or ninth phosphodiester bond 5' and the fourth or fifth phosphodiester bond 3' to the modified base. It has been hypothesized that UvrABC is able to recognize a broad spectrum of lesions because it does not recognize the lesion per se but rather gross helical distortions that the lesion induces in the DNA. Several lesions have recently been studied which are thermal stabilizing and are not believed to distort the DNA grossly, including the CC-1065-N-3-adenine and anthramycin-N-2-guanine adducts. We have studied the activity of UvrABC in vitro on another thermal stabilizing and nondistortive adduct, N-methylmitomycin A (NMA), a bifunctional DNA-alkylating agent that reacts with guanine on the side facing the minor groove, yielding either monoadducts or interstrand cross-links. NMA adducts increase the thermal stability of DNA, and theoretical calculations indicate that NMA adducts do not grossly distort the DNA helix. Our results show that UvrABC makes incisions at the eighth phosphodiester bond 5' and the fifth phosphodiester bond 3' to an NMA monoadduct, consistent with the incision pattern observed for the majority of other lesions that are also recognized by UvrABC. DNA containing a site-specific NMA cross-link was also recognized and incised by UvrABC. The rate of incision of NMA cross-linked DNA was about 200-fold higher in supercoiled molecules than in relaxed molecules, whereas the rate of incision of DNA containing NMA monoadducts was stimulated approximately 2-fold by supercoiling. The signal for UvrABC recognition and incision of damaged DNA is discussed in relation to the ability of UvrABC to incise NMA adducts as well as other nondistortive lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1596204333,"Abstract The murine adipocyte lipid binding protein (ALBP) has been cloned into Escherichia coli, purified from expressing cultures, and its ligand binding and phosphorylation properties studied. In the cloning strategy, the recombinant, pT7-5 rALBP, was transformed into E. coli strain K38 harboring plasmid pGP1-2 which directs the synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase. Upon shifting the temperature from 30 to 42 degrees C to induce T7 RNA polymerase expression, the 14.6-kDa recombinant ALBP (rALBP) was expressed for approximately 2 h and accumulated to about 1% of total E. coli protein. The recombinant ALBP was soluble in E. coli extracts and resistant to bacterial proteolysis. A procedure for purifying rALBP was developed utilizing immuno-chemical detection based upon reactivity with anti-murine ALBP antiserum. A combination of acidic ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel permeation chromatography, and carboxymethyl ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography separation was used to prepare homogeneous rALBP. Sequence analysis of rALBP indicated that the initiating methionine residue had been removed and the amino-terminal cysteine residue was not blocked. Purified rALBP exhibited stoichiometric, saturable binding of oleic acid (n = 1.0, K0.5 approximately 100 microM) and retinoic acid (n = 1.0, K0.5 approximately 170 microM). Incubation of rALBP with wheat germ agglutinin-purified insulin receptor, ATP, and 100 nM insulin resulted in a 5-fold stimulation of rALBP phosphorylation above the basal state. Kinetic analysis of rALBP phosphorylation by the 3T3-L1 insulin receptor kinase yielded a Michaelis constant (Km) of 50 microM and a maximal velocity of 1 mol of rALBP phosphorylated/min/mol insulin binding sites. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that phosphorylation occurred upon tyrosine. These results indicate that murine ALBP has been cloned and expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and is a substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosyl kinase in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1529440371,"We have studied the time sequence degradation of native insulin by insulin protease from human fibroblast using multiple steps involving purification of the products by high performance liquid chromatography, determination of peak composition by amino acid sequence analysis, and confirmation of structure by mass spectrometry and thus elucidated the sites of cleavage of insulin by human insulin protease. We observed that as early as 0.5 min of incubation, three major new peptide peaks, intact insulin, and four smaller peptide peaks can be detected. The major peptides are portions of the insulin molecule, with the amino ends of the A and B chains or the carboxyl ends of the A and B chains still connected by disulfide bonds. Peptide peak I is A1-13-B1-9. Peptide peak II is A1-14-B1-9. Peptide peak III is A14-21-B14-30. The smaller peptide peaks are A14-21-B17-30, A15-21-B14-30, A15-21-B10-30, and A14-21-B10-30. The major peptide bond cleavage sites therefore consist of A13-14, A14-15, B9-10, B13-14, and B10-17. With longer incubation times, peptide peak II appears to lose the A14 tyrosine to form peptide peak I. This peptide I, which is the amino end of the A and B chains, is not further degraded even after 1.5 h of incubation. With longer incubation times, the peptides containing the carboxyl ends of the A and B chains are further degraded to form products from cleavage at the A18-19, B14-15, B25-26, and a small amount of A19-20, B10-11, and B24-25 cleavage and the emergence of 2-5-amino acid peptide chains, tyrosine, alanine, histidine, and leucine-tyrosine. We conclude, based on the three-dimensional structure of insulin, that human insulin protease recognizes the alpha-helical regions around leucine-tyrosine bonds and that final degradation steps to small peptides do not require lysosomal involvement."
https://openalex.org/W1533404971,"The fluorescent nucleotide 2',3'-trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP) binds at the triphosphate substrate binding site of the large (Klenow) fragment of DNA polymerase I (Pol I) as detected by direct binding studies measuring the increase in fluorescence of this ligand (n = 1.0, KD = 0.07 microM). The enzyme-TNP-ATP complex binds Mg2+ and Mn2+ tightly (KD = 0.05 microM) as measured by an increase in fluorescence on titrating with these metals. The substrate dGTP competitively displaces TNP-ATP from the enzyme (KD = 5.7 microM) de-enhancing the fluorescence. The polymerase reaction is half-maximally inhibited by 0.8 microM TNP-ATP in the presence of dATP (10 microM) as substrate. A region of the amino acid sequence of Pol I (peptide I) consisting of residues 728-777 has been synthesized and found to contain significant secondary structure by CD both in water and 50% methanol/water. In water at 3 degrees C, peptide I binds the substrate analog TNP-ATP (KD = 0.03 microM) with a stoichiometry of 0.2. In 50% methanol at 3 degrees C, peptide I binds TNP-ATP with a higher stoichiometry than in water, consistent with a 1:1 complex, but biphasically (16% of the peptide, KD = 0.09 microM; 84% of the peptide, KD = 5.0 microM), and competitively binds the Pol I substrates dATP, TTP, and dGTP (KD = 230-570 microM). Evidence from size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography suggests that these two forms of the peptide are monomer and dimer, respectively. Significantly, the peptide I-TNP-ATP complex binds duplex DNA, tightly (KD = 0.1-0.5 microM) and stoichiometrically, and single stranded DNA more weakly. The peptide I-duplex DNA complex binds both TNP-ATP (KD = 0.5-1.5 microM) and Pol I substrates (KD = 350-2100 microM) stoichiometrically. In a control experiment, a second peptide, peptide II, based on residues 840-888 of the Pol I sequence, retains secondary structure, as detected by CD, but displays no binding of TNP-ATP. The ability of peptide I, which represents only 8% of the large fragment of Pol I, to bind both substrates and duplex DNA indicates that residues 728-777 constitute a major portion of the substrate binding site of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1492832889,"We have investigated the effect of colcemid-induced disassembly of microtubules, which is accompanied by retraction of the endoplasmic reticulum and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, on glycoprotein biosynthesis and transport in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CHO cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [6- 3H]galactose or [2- 3H]mannose in the presence of either 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide or 10 microM colcemid in dimethyl sulfoxide. The fine structure of glycoprotein asparagine-linked oligosaccharide structures synthesized in the presence or absence of colcemid was analyzed by lectin affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and methylation analysis using radiolabeled glycopeptides prepared by Pronase digestion. The fractionation patterns of [3H]mannose- and [3H]galactose-labeled glycopeptides on immobilized lectins indicated that processing to complex N-linked chains and poly-N-acetyllactosamine modification were similar in control and colcemid-treated cells. In addition, colcemid treatment did not alter the extent of sialylation or the linkage position of sialic acid residues to galactose. Using a trypsin release protocol, it was also found that the transport of newly synthesized glycoproteins to the cell surface was not affected by colcemid. These results demonstrate that the morphologically altered ER and Golgi apparatus in colcemid-treated CHO cells are completely functional with respect to the rate and fidelity of protein asparagine-linked glycosylation. Furthermore, movement of newly synthesized glycoproteins to and through the ER and Golgi apparatus and their transport to the cell surface in nonpolarized cells appears to be microtubule-independent."
https://openalex.org/W1491364236,"Using an in vivo mini-Mu cloning system, we have cloned the polB gene of Escherichia coli into the multicopy plasmid, pUC18. A chromosomal insert of 4.9 kilobases gave 30-40-fold overproduction of DNA polymerase II, and the cells containing the plasmid showed normal growth. The restriction pattern of the polB gene does not match that of either the polA gene or polC gene. Plasmid-directed protein synthesis demonstrates peptides of 99 and 82 kDa which are not expressed by derivative plasmids without DNA polymerase II activity. It appears from in situ gel assays and high performance liquid chromatography that 82- and 55-kDa proteins are derived from the 99-kDa protein by degradation, but all retain activity. DNA polymerase I or DNA polymerase III antibody does not inhibit the synthesis reaction of partially purified DNA polymerase II, but DNA polymerase II antibody does. By the criteria of restriction pattern of the polB gene, molecular weight of the protein, and antibody inhibition of reaction, DNA polymerase II can be demonstrated to be a distinct DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1503758842,"The entC and entA genes, coding for the enzymes isochorismate synthase and 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase, respectively, were subcloned behind the T7 promoter in the expression plasmid pGEM3Z. Their protein products were overproduced and partially purified for in vitro analysis of the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate. Whereas previous genetic experiments suggested that the EntA enzyme has a role in this conversion, this study clearly indicates that EntC alone catalyzes the reaction. Addition of EntA had no effect on isochorismate synthase activity. As a result, the mutation (previously designated entC401) in strain AN191 was characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis. The lesion is a single base substitution in the entA gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-for-glycine substitution at the penultimate amino acid (residue 247) of the EntA enzyme. The mutant protein was partially purified and shown to be devoid of 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase activity, whereas the entC gene product from strain AN191 exhibited normal isochorismate synthase function. These results conflict with the earlier characterization of the entC401 mutation in a different genetic background. The data presented herein establish that the EntA protein does not contribute to isochorismate synthase activity and that the mutant strain that led to this suggestion harbors a defective allele of entA rather than entC."
https://openalex.org/W1585905765,"Abstract Two related carcinogen adducts, N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene (AF) or N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF), were introduced into the lacZ' gene at base position 6253 of the minus strand of M13mp9 viral DNA. The construction of this site-specifically modified DNA was accomplished by first preparing a gapped heteroduplex missing 7 nucleotides at position 6251-6257 followed by ligation with an unmodified heptamer or with a heptamer containing either an AF or AAF adduct. These site-specifically modified templates were transfected into competent wild-type Escherichia coli cells (JM103) and a uvrA strain (SMH12). The mutation spectrum was determined by phenotypic selection of colorless plaques indicating a defective beta-galactosidase marker enzyme and by an in situ hybridization procedure to detect single base pair mismatches in the adduct region. DNA sequencing was used to characterize 179 of the mutants obtained. We found that both adducts were capable of inducing base substitution mutations at the adduct site and in the local region of the adduct. A specific frameshift (+1G) was also observed at a displaced site. All of the frameshift mutations occurred at the ligation site of the modified oligonucleotide. Control experiments with an unmodified oligonucleotide did not show an enhancement of mutations at this site, indicating that the adducts may have been responsible for these frameshifts. The mutations spectra induced by these adducts suggest that mutagenesis depends not only on adduct structure but also the sequence in which the adduct is located and the host cell type used for mutation expression."
https://openalex.org/W1978107776,"Expression of the c-myc oncogene is deregulated in a variety of malignancies. Rearrangement and mutation of the c-myc locus is a characteristic feature of human Burkitt's lymphoma. Whether deregulation is solely a result of mutation of c-myc or whether it is influenced by the transformed B cell context has not been determined. A translocated and mutated allele of c-myc was stably transfected into fibroblasts. The rearranged allele was expressed indistinguishably from a normal c-myc gene: it had serum-regulated expression, was transcribed with normal promoter preference, and was strongly attenuated. Thus mutations by themselves are insufficient to deregulate c-myc transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1569105153,"Many secreted proteins are synthesized with aminoterminal propeptides which are removed prior to secretion. There is increasing interest in the physiological roles of these propeptides, especially as mediators of intracellular protein trafficking. To investigate whether or not the propeptide of serum albumin offers an advantage in albumin secretion, we used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to delete the 18 base pairs which encode the propeptide from a cDNA gene for rat serum albumin (RSA), inserted the deleted gene into COS cells, and studied the secretion of the gene product (RSA delta pro). Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of medium from transfected cells showed that RSA delta pro was secreted at about 64% of the level of RSA. Furthermore, pulse-chase protein labeling studies demonstrated that the rate of secretion for RSA delta pro was greatly decreased relative to RSA. Immunofluorescent analyses of transfected cells showed accumulation of RSA delta pro in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that transport through and/or exit from the ER was affected. The electrophoretic migration of secreted and intracellular forms of RSA and RSA delta pro indicated that they were the same molecular weight, and a specific amino-terminal binding assay, using nickel 63, confirmed the absence and proper cleavage of the prepeptide. These findings demonstrate that transport of RSA delta pro through the secretion pathway is inhibited and that the inhibition is due to the absence of the propeptide."

Here we have used quantitative hybridization of pulse-labeled RNA to cloned, immobilized sequences derived from the external transcribed spacer of yeast rDNA, coupled with determinations of relative changes in ATP pool specific activities, to show that the heat shock associated with the transfer of growing cells from 23 to 36 degrees C caused decreased transcription of the rRNA genes. This decrease in hybridization to DNA sequences complementary to the immediate 5' end of the pre-rRNA transcript suggests that the decreased transcription reflects decreased initiation of pre-rRNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1573781534,"Abstract The genes coding for the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of photosystem II (cab) in wheat are regulated by phytochrome and an endogenous circadian clock. The regulation by these factors has been shown to be at the transcriptional level. Here we show that the phase of cab gene expression is reset by light to dark transition of the previous day. The time of light to dark transition is linearly related to the time of maximal cab gene expression under free running conditions in darkness. We propose that in nature the onset of darkness resets the phase of the circadian clock, which regulates the timing of cab gene expression, so as to anticipate the time of sunrise in the following day."

https://openalex.org/W1582232355,"Abstract The influence of cortisol and other culture conditions on insulin degradation by the chloroquine-sensitive pathway and the chloroquine-nonsensitive pathway (CNP) was investigated in fetal rat hepatocytes during 3 days of culture. The proportions of the chloroquine nonsensitive release of 125I-insulin degradation products into the conditioned medium/h increased from the 1st to the 3rd day of culture, i.e. from 19 to 50% by cells grown in the presence of cortisol and from 17 to 82% by those grown in the absence of cortisol. Replacement of the conditioned medium with the respective fresh medium dramatically enhanced cellular insulin degradation by CNP, i.e. from 22 to 58%, and 19 to 85% in cells grown for 2 days in the presence and absence of cortisol, respectively. Thus, the conditioned medium contained some factor(s) that inhibited CNP. Therefore, we used the inhibited insulin and alpha-casein degradation by papain in vitro as an assay to investigate the nature of the putative anti-(insulin) protease. Cycloheximide completely prevented the appearance of anti-papain activity in the medium. Conditioned medium obtained from cells grown in the presence of cortisol contained about 2-fold more anti-papain activity than the medium that was obtained in the absence of the steroid. The release of anti-papain activity also declined with time from 1 to 3 days of culture and showed an inverse relationship with the magnitude of cellular insulin degradation by CNP. The inhibition of papain-mediated insulin degradation by the anti-(insulin) protease was noncompetitive. The anti-(insulin) protease was nondialyzable (up to the 10-kDa exclusion limit) and inactivated by heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 30 min. These results suggest that fetal hepatocytes synthesize and secrete a glucocorticoid-regulated heat-labile low molecular mass (less than 25 kDa) anti-(insulin) protease, which may contribute to the suppression of insulin degradation caused by the enzymes involved in CNP."
https://openalex.org/W1518397361,"In Escherichia coli infected with the filamentous phage f1, a number of the abundant phage mRNAs, species C-G, are products of post-transcriptional processing. The approach of cloning the phage sequences likely to include the processing signals in a plasmid under transcriptional control of the lambda PL promoter (Blumer, K. J., and Steege, D. A. (1984) Nucleic Acids Res. 12, 1847-1861) was extended to additional sites to show that processing at all five major sites is mediated by nuclease activity encoded by the bacterial genome. Primer extension methods were used to map more accurately in the f1 DNA sequence the 5' end points of the processed RNAs. The DNA segments that encode the mRNA processing signals were delimited from parallel series of 5'-3' and 3'-5' deletions made into the regions in which the RNA 5' ends map. For each deletion variant, in vivo f1 mRNA processing activity was assessed by primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping methods. The data indicate that the processing signals are comprised of relatively local regions near the point of RNA cleavage. Whereas cleavage occurs at the 5' border of the sequences that comprise the D, E, and F processing sites and thereby places most of the recognition information in the mature or product portion of the precursor, it occurs more centrally within the region comprising the C site. The C and D sites function independently as substrates for cleavage, with the necessary information contained in regions of 70 and 90 nucleotides, respectively. Cleavage at the E site appears to require a region of 130 nucleotides which completely contains the F site. From the effects on processing activity of deleting sequences in this region, the overlapping E and F processing sites appear to consist functionally of two subdomains. Each has a cleavage site at its immediate 5' end which can be substituted by foreign sequences, but both utilize a common recognition domain downstream from the point of strand scission."
