https://openalex.org/W2168761911,"Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific secretory protein that circulates in serum as a hexamer of relatively low molecular weight (LMW) and a larger multimeric structure of high molecular weight (HMW). Serum levels of the protein correlate with systemic insulin sensitivity. The full-length protein affects hepatic gluconeogenesis through improved insulin sensitivity, and a proteolytic fragment of adiponectin stimulates β oxidation in muscle. Here, we show that the ratio, and not the absolute amounts, between these two oligomeric forms (HMW to LMW) is critical in determining insulin sensitivity. We define a new index, SA, that can be calculated as the ratio of HMW/(HMW + LMW). db/db mice, despite similar total adiponectin levels, display decreased SA values compared with wild type littermates, as do type II diabetic patients compared with insulin-sensitive individuals. Furthermore, SA improves with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist treatment (thiazolidinedione; TZD) in mice and humans. We demonstrate that changes in SA in a number of type 2 diabetic cohorts serve as a quantitative indicator of improvements in insulin sensitivity obtained during TZD treatment, whereas changes in total serum adiponectin levels do not correlate well at the individual level. Acute alterations in SA (ΔSA) are strongly correlated with improvements in hepatic insulin sensitivity and are less relevant as an indicator of improved muscle insulin sensitivity in response to TZD treatment, further underscoring the conclusions from previous clamp studies that suggested that the liver is the primary site of action for the full-length protein. These observations suggest that the HMW adiponectin complex is the active form of this protein, which we directly demonstrate in vivo by its ability to depress serum glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner.

Adipocytes, beyond their role in lipid storage, can influence whole-body metabolism through modulation of systemic free fatty acid levels as well as secretion of cell-specific proteins collectively known as adipokines. Recent work has underscored the importance of these adipocyte-secreted molecules in energy homeostasis and metabolism (1Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffel M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M.

Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar). Some of these adipokines have synergistic effects, whereas others, such as resistin and adiponectin/Acrp30 (adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa), have competing effects; pharmacological doses of resistin deactivate the repressive effects of insulin on gluconeogenesis (4Rajala M.W. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), whereas adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity, leading to enhanced inhibition of hepatic glucose output (5Combs T.P. Berg A.H. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Inv. 2001; 108: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Genetic variability within the adiponectin gene leads to alteration of serum levels of the protein and predisposes carriers of specific polymorphisms to insulin resistance (reviewed in Ref. 6Vasseur F. Lepretre F. Lacquemant C. Froguel P. Curr. Diab. Rep. 2003; 3: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Decreased serum adiponectin is now considered a feature of obesity, and levels correlate with lowered indices of insulin sensitivity (7Weyer C. Funahashi T. Tanaka S. Hotta K. Matsuzawa Y.

Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that decreased serum adiponectin levels are contributory and not simply diagnostic of systemic insulin resistance.The potential importance of adiponectin as a therapeutic target is underscored by the dramatic up-regulation of this adipokine in response to treatment with the antidiabetic, insulin-sensitizing agents known as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) 1The abbreviations used are: TZD, thiazolidinedione; LMW, low molecular weight form; HMW, high molecular weight form; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; BMI, body mass index. 1The abbreviations used are: TZD, thiazolidinedione; LMW, low molecular weight form; HMW, high molecular weight form; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; BMI, body mass index.

TZDs have proven to be active in animal models of genetic or acquired insulin resistance as well as in type 2 diabetic patients in clinical settings, suggesting that these drugs improve insulin sensitivity regardless of the underlying cause (12Day C. Diabet. Med. 1999; 16: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of TZD action are still not fully understood. The presumptive target of TZDs, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, suggesting that adipocytes may play a critical role in mediating the antidiabetic effects of these drugs (13Lehmann J.M.

This hypothesis has been supported by studies of “fatless” mice that displayed reduced metabolic improvement in response to TZD treatment (14Chao L. Marcus-Samuels B. Mason M.M. Moitra J. Vinson C. Arioglu E. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in this same mouse model demonstrated amelioration of defects in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle with TZD administration but exacerbation of hepatic insulin resistance in these animals, leading to no significant net antidiabetic effect (15Kim J.K. Fillmore J.J. Gavrilova O. Chao L. Higashimori T. Choi H. Kim H.J. Yu C. Chen Y. Qu X. Haluzik M. Reitman M.L. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).A number of studies have demonstrated that in mice and humans, TZD treatment effects transcriptional up-regulation accompanied by increased production and secretion of adiponectin from adipocytes (9Combs T.P.

Kuriyama H. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2094-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). However, whether the TZD-mediated induction of adiponectin is causative or simply diagnostic of improved insulin sensitivity remains under debate, since discordance between improvements in insulin sensitivity and induction in serum adiponectin levels has been reported (10Yu J.G. Javorschi S. Hevener A.L. Kruszynska Y.T. Norman R.A. Sinha M. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Although the vast majority of patients induce adiponectin expression and secretion in response to TZD treatment, only 50–70% of patients demonstrate clinically improved insulin sensitivity (reviewed in Ref. 16Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). This suggests that induction of adiponectin in any particular individual is neither predictive nor correlative to quantitative improvements in insulin sensitivity and led us to hypothesize that increased adiponectin levels alone are insufficient to explain the wide range of clinical responses to TZD treatment. We have recently demonstrated that adiponectin exists in minimally two forms in serum, as a hexamers referred to as a low molecular weight (LMW) complex and as a high molecular weight (HMW) complex consisting of 12–18 subunits (17Pajvani U.B.

Here, we show that the ratio between these two oligomeric forms (HMW to LMW), not absolute amounts of circulating adiponectin, is critical in determining TZD-mediated improvements in insulin sensitivity.MATERIALS AND METHODSVelocity Sedimentation/Gel Filtration Chromatography for Separation of Adiponectin Complexes5–20% sucrose gradients in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl were poured stepwise in 2-ml thin walled ultracentrifuge tubes (Becton Dickinson) and allowed to equilibrate overnight at 4 °C. Following layering of the sample on top (diluted 1:10 with 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl), gradients were spun at 55,000 rpm for 4 h at 4 °C in a TLS55 rotor in a Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge. 150-μl gradient fractions were sequentially retrieved and analyzed by quantitative Western blot analysis as described below. Adiponectin complex distribution was independently confirmed by gel filtration chromatography, as previously described (17Pajvani U.B. Du X. Combs T.P. Berg A.H. Rajala M.W. Schulthess T. Engel J. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9073-9085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar).ImmunoblottingSeparation of proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (18Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 1% bovine serum albumin. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For quantitative Western blotting, proteins were transferred to BA83 nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), and membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (in TBS-T). An affinity-purified rabbit anti-adiponectin antibody raised against a peptide comprising the N-terminal hypervariable region (EDDVTTTEELAPALV, mouse; DQETTTQGPGV, human) was used; these antibodies recognize a single band of 30 kDa by Western analysis and have equal affinity for all oligomeric forms of the protein. Blots were decorated with an 125I-derivatized secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions 4–6 (hexamers) and 9–11 (HMW adiponectin) from velocity sedimentation were quantitated with ImageQuant software.In Vivo Animal StudiesMale db/db mice and control mice (db/+; Jackson Laboratories) were housed at 5 mice/cage and allowed ad libitum access to ground Purina rodent chow 5001 and water. The animals were dosed daily by gavage with vehicle (0.25% carboxymethylcellulose) with or without 10 mg/kg per day of rosiglitazone for 11 days or 10 mg/kg per day of PPARα agonist for 7 days (compound 10, an O-arylmandelic acid derivative (trifluromethyl benzisoxazole) (19Adams A.D.

Lett. 2003; 13: 3185-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). Plasma adiponectin, glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels were determined from blood obtained by tail bleeds at 3–4-day intervals during the studies. Wild type animals (C57/Bl6J) used in adipose extraction and adiponectin knockout animals for in vivo adiponectin activity studies were maintained in the same manner. All animal protocols were approved by the Albert Einstein Animal Committee.Human Clinical Study ProtocolsStudy A—This was a single center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with treatments including placebo and rosiglitazone (4 mg twice daily) for 14 days. Twenty nondiabetic males were treated in this analysis (n = 10/group). Plasma for adiponectin concentration determination was obtained predose on day 1 (base line) and 2 h after the last dose on day 14. These subjects refrained from all other medication use from 14 days prior to completion of the trial and demonstrated no evidence or family history of diabetes mellitus. All subjects gave written informed consent, and the clinical protocol was approved by Commissie voor Medische Ethiek (Antwerp, Belgium).Study B—The study group consisted of 18 middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients treated with either diet or sulfonylureas, the latter being withdrawn for 4 weeks prior to entry into the treatment phase of the study. The treatment phase consisted of daily administration of troglitazone at a dose of 200–800 mg/day for 12 weeks as previously reported (20Prigeon R.L. Kahn S.E. Porte Jr., D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The data reported here are from the 13 individuals who underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test to measure insulin sensitivity (SI calculated by minimal model analysis) before and after troglitazone treatment. The protocol was approved by the human subjects review committee of the University of Washington, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.Study C—Hispanic women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus were recruited to the Troglitazone in Prevention of Diabetes study if they had a sum of five glucose values on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test that was above the median for a large cohort of women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Subjects underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test to measure insulin sensitivity (SI, calculated by minimal model analysis) prior to enrollment and then again following 3 months of troglitazone treatment (400 mg/day). 108 women had measurements of insulin sensitivity at base line and three months post-treatment; plasma was obtained after overnight fasts from women who demonstrated >80% drug compliance (as measured by pill counts) and whose changes in insulin sensitivity between base line and 3 months was either the lowest (n = 20) or the highest (n = 20) in the cohort. At base line, the groups had similar oral glucose tolerance test glucose sum (736 ± 15 versus 765 ± 15 mg/dl). SI in women defined as low responders went from 3.3 ± 0.4 × 10–4 at base line to 3.8 ± 0.4 × 10–4 min–1 per microunit/ml after 3 months of troglitazone treatment. In the high responders, SI went from 2.7 ± 0.3 × 10–4 at base line to 5.1 ± 0.7 × 10–4 min–1 per microunit/ml at 3 months. All subjects gave consent for participation in the study, which was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Southern California.Study D—Ten subjects with type 2 diabetes and 17 nondiabetic control subjects (8 lean (BMI < 27 kg/m2) and 9 obese (BMI > 27 kg/m2)) participated in the study. Subjects were excluded if they had active cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease or if they had long term complications from diabetes. The diabetic subjects were asked to discontinue taking their medications at least 2 weeks before their base-line studies. Each subject underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp at base line and again after 3 months of treatment with 600 mg/day troglitazone. Following a 10-h overnight fast, a catheter was inserted in an antecubital vein, and a constant infusion was started of [3-3H]glucose (0.25 μCi/min) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). At 0700 h, another catheter was inserted in a retrograde fashion in a hand vein, and at ∼0800 h, four basal blood samples were drawn for measurement of plasma glucose concentration and specific activity of insulin. Intravenous insulin infusion (Humulin; Lilly) diluted in 0.15 mol/liter saline containing 1% (w/v) human albumin was then begun at a rate of 80 milliunits·m–2·min–1. Blood samples were obtained every 5 min with a glucose analyzer (YSI 2700 analyzer; YSI, Yellow Springs, OH) for measurement of plasma glucose. A variable infusion of [3-3H]glucose-enriched 20% glucose was delivered to maintain a plasma glucose concentration of 5 mmol/liter. During the last 40 min of the insulin infusion, blood samples were obtained at 10-min intervals for determination of plasma glucose concentration and insulin. The study protocol was approved by the Human Subjects Committee of the University of California San Diego. This study was described in Ref. 10Yu J.G. Javorschi S. Hevener A.L. Kruszynska Y.T.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSDiabetic Mice Display Decreased HMW/Total Adiponectin Ratio Despite Comparable Levels of Total Serum Adiponectin—Whereas adiponectin levels are significantly reduced in states of decreased insulin sensitivity in humans under essentially all circumstances, insulin resistance in mice is often but not always associated with reduced adiponectin levels. This is particularly relevant for monogenic lesions such as the ones found in db/db and ob/ob mice. We have previously shown that db/db mice demonstrate comparable levels of circulating adiponectin as lean heterozygote littermates (9Combs T.P. Wagner J.A. Berger J. Doebber T. Wang W.-J. Zhang B.B. Tanen M. Berg A.H. O'Rahilly S. Savage D.S. Chatterjee K. Weiss S. Larson P.J. Gottesdiener K.M. Gertz B.G. Charron M.J. Scherer P.E. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 998-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). To determine whether differences between these animals could partially be explained on the basis of differential distribution of adiponectin complexes in serum, we analyzed serum from male db/db and db/+ mice by velocity sedimentation followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Similar to our previous findings, lean and obese animals had comparable total levels of adiponectin circulating in serum (Fig. 1B). However, db/db mice demonstrate a significantly decreased percentage of adiponectin in the HMW form (Fig. 1C). Similar reductions in percentage of HMW adiponectin can be seen in a number of other diabetic mouse models, including the ob/ob mouse (not shown).Thiazolidinedione Treatment Affects Circulating HMW/LMW Adiponectin Complex Ratios in Mice and Humans—TZD treatment leads to an induction of serum adiponectin and ameliorates the hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance in the db/db mouse model within an 11-day course of treatment (9Combs T.P. Wagner J.A. Berger J. Doebber T. Wang W.-J. Zhang B.B. Tanen M. Berg A.H. O'Rahilly S. Savage D.S. Chatterjee K. Weiss S. Larson P.J. Gottesdiener K.M. Gertz B.G. Charron M.J. Scherer P.E. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 998-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). To determine whether TZD treatment affects the relative circulating concentrations of adiponectin oligomers in serum, a cohort of male db/db mice was treated with rosiglitazone, and adiponectin complexes were analyzed by velocity sedimentation. Prior to treatment, adiponectin is predominantly found in the LMW (hexameric) form of adiponectin, consistent with values from wild type male mice. However, following 11 days of rosiglitazone treatment, the percentage of adiponectin found in the HMW form nearly doubled, to ∼45% of total circulating adiponectin (Fig. 1D). Rosiglitazone treatment of ob/ob mice gave rise to similar induction in HMW adiponectin (not shown). Placebo treatment did not result in any significant change in adiponectin oligomeric distribution (not shown); nor did a 7-day treatment with PPARα agonist that was equally successful in reducing serum glucose, triglyceride, and insulin levels (by 45, 45, and 80%, respectively). This indicates that this shift in complex distribution can be attributed directly to TZD treatment and is not an indirect consequence of a systemic metabolic improvement (Fig. 1E).In order to see if this relative improvement in HMW adiponectin can also be observed in human subjects treated with TZDs, we initially tested the effects in a cohort of nondiabetic males (Study A (9Combs T.P. Wagner J.A. Berger J. Doebber T. Wang W.-J. Zhang B.B. Tanen M. Berg A.H. O'Rahilly S. Savage D.S. Chatterjee K. Weiss S. Larson P.J. Gottesdiener K.M. Gertz B.G. Charron M.J. Scherer P.E. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 998-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar)). Since these were lean nondiabetic patients, no significant changes in fasting insulin or glucose were seen during the treatment period (2 weeks) with either rosiglitazone or placebo (not shown). Adiponectin complexes were analyzed in a double-blind fashion by velocity sedimentation before and after treatment (Fig. 2A). Only minor changes in total circulating adiponectin levels or in either adiponectin complex were seen in placebo-treated patients. Rosiglitazone-treated patients demonstrated significantly increased total adiponectin, primarily as a result of a dramatic increase in circulating HMW form (Fig. 2B). As a consequence, the HMW/total adiponectin ratio is significantly increased in rosiglitazone-treated individuals, with the post-treatment value reaching nearly 50% (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2TZD treatment induces HMW adiponectin in serum. Normal male volunteers were treated with either placebo (n = 10) or rosiglitazone (n = 10), and adiponectin complex formation was assessed by velocity sedimentation pre- and post-treatment.

In one cohort, patients were treated with troglitazone for a period of 3 months (Study B (20Prigeon R.L. Kahn S.E. Porte Jr., D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)), and insulin sensitivity (SI) was determined before and after treatment. Insulin sensitivity of the group as a whole increased. Nearly all (12 of 13) subjects demonstrated an increase in circulating adiponectin levels, ranging from 20 to 150% above base-line levels. There was no significant correlation between the increase in total adiponectin levels and the improvement in insulin sensitivity (Fig. 3A), consistent with previous reports in the literature that suggest that although most patients demonstrate an increase in circulating adiponectin levels post-TZD treatment, these increased levels in individual patients do not correspond to the magnitude of increase in insulin sensitivity (10Yu J.G. Javorschi S. Hevener A.L. Kruszynska Y.T. Norman R.A. Sinha M. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In fact, in this particular cohort, approximately half of the patients demonstrated improvement in circulating levels of adiponectin by 25% or more without any significant change in insulin sensitivity. By contrast, there was good correlation between changes in insulin sensitivity and improvements in percentage of HMW/total adiponectin values (Fig. 3B). Similar to the trend observed in nondiabetic subjects, the absolute levels of HMW adiponectin increased in serum from most patients following thiazolidinedione treatment; however, there were type 2 diabetic patients who induced both total and HMW adiponectin levels to a similar degree and, thus, failed to improve their HMW/total ratio and demonstrated no improvement in insulin sensitivity. In order to not only account for absolute levels of HMW but to also take the total amount of adiponectin into consideration, we defined a new index (SA) reflecting the relative contribution of the HMW complex to circulating adiponectin levels (SA = HMW/total). SA rather than total adiponectin levels accounts for the patients in the cohort seen in Fig. 3A that do not demonstrate a quantifiable improvement in insulin sensitivity, and the very tight correlation observed underlines the emerging finding that the proportion of adiponectin in the HMW form rather than absolute circulating levels may play an important role in the amelioration in insulin resistance following treatment with TZDs.Fig. 3Change in HMW/total adiponectin ratio, but not in total adiponectin, correlates with improvements in insulin sensitivity post-troglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetic patients. Male, moderately obese (average BMI = 27.7 kg/m2) type 2 diabetic patients (n = 13) were treated with varying doses of troglitazone (200–800 mg/day), and improvements in insulin sensitivity (as measured by ΔSI) were assayed before and after 3 months of treatment.

However, the mechanism by which these DMVs form has not been determined. Using genetic, biochemical, and cell imaging approaches, the role of autophagy in DMV formation and MHV replication was investigated. The results demonstrated that replication complexes co-localize with the autophagy proteins, microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 and Apg12. MHV infection induces autophagy by a mechanism that is resistant to 3-methyladenine inhibition. MHV replication is impaired in autophagy knockout, APG5–/–, embryonic stem cell lines, but wild-type levels of MHV replication are restored by expression of Apg5 in the APG5–/–cells. In MHV-infected APG5–/–cells, DMVs were not detected; rather, the rough endoplasmic reticulum was dramatically swollen. The results of this study suggest that autophagy is required for formation of double membrane-bound MHV replication complexes and that DMV formation significantly enhances the efficiency of replication. Furthermore, the rough endoplasmic reticulum is implicated as the possible source of membranes for replication complexes.

Autophagy is a cellular stress response that functions to recycle proteins and organelles (1Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D.

The mechanism of autophagy has been extensively studied in yeast, with more than 15 genes identified that are required for functional autophagy (1Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D.

Autophagy has been most widely studied as a response to amino acid starvation; however, the role that autophagy may play in development, disease pathogenesis, and microbial infections is only beginning to be examined. Studies with Sindbis virus and herpes simplex virus-1 have demonstrated that autophagy may be an important defense mechanism against infection with those viruses (3Talloczy Z. Jiang W.

For all of these viruses, replication complexes have been shown to form as double membrane vesicles (DMVs) in the cytoplasm, which is suggestive of an autophagic origin. For poliovirus and MHV, multiple organelle markers have been reported to co-localize or co-fractionate with replication complexes, also consistent with an autophagy-like process (6Suhy D.A.

In addition, poliovirus and MHV replication complexes have been reported to acquire lysosomal markers over the course of infection similar to the maturation of autophagosomes. These studies have demonstrated that replication complexes formed by these viruses share features of autophagosomes; however, it is not known whether cellular autophagy is required for the formation of replication complexes. Recently, markers for autophagic vacuoles in mammalian cells have been described: microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and Apg12 (14Drosten C. Gunther S. Preiser W. Van Der Werf S.

In addition, murine embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking a critical gene product in the pathway of cellular autophagy (Apg5) have been established (12Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y.

Together, these advances provide new approaches to investigating the role of cellular autophagy in viral infections. Coronaviruses are enveloped positive sense RNA viruses that replicate entirely in the cytoplasm of cells. Coronaviruses are important causes of disease in many domesticated animals and are responsible for up to 30% of human colds. In addition, a newly recognized human coronavirus has recently been identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (13Ksiazek T.G. Erdman D. Goldsmith C. Zaki S.R.

Thus, studies of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication complex formation may be critical to understanding the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of coronavirus infections. MHV is the prototype coronavirus for studies of replication complex formation and function. MHV replication complexes form in the cytoplasm of infected cells and are first detectable at 4–5 h p.i. by immunofluorescence in MHV-infected delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells (9Shi S.T. Schiller J.J. Kanjanahaluethai A. Baker S.C. Oh J.W. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5957-5969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Denison M.R. Spaan W.J. van der Meer Y. Gibson C.A. Sims A.C. Prentice E. Lu X. J.

Prentice E. Denison M.R. Virology. 2001; 285: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Replication complexes appear as punctate perinuclear foci, with the number and size of replication complexes increasing over the course of infection (9Shi S.T. Schiller J.J. Kanjanahaluethai A. Baker S.C. Oh J.W. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5957-5969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Denison M.R. Spaan W.J. van der Meer Y. Gibson C.A. Sims A.C. Prentice E. Lu X. J.

These complexes are active in viral RNA synthesis and contain all replicase proteins tested to date, as well as the structural nucleocapsid (N) protein (9Shi S.T. Schiller J.J. Kanjanahaluethai A. Baker S.C. Oh J.W. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5957-5969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Denison M.R. Spaan W.J. van der Meer Y. Gibson C.A. Sims A.C. Prentice E. Lu X. J.

Prentice E. Denison M.R. Virology. 2001; 285: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that components of the replication complex, the helicase (hel) and N proteins, translocate between 6 and 8 h p.i. from sites of RNA replication to sites of viral assembly in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (25Bost A.G. Prentice E. Denison M.R. Virology. 2001; 285: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine whether cellular autophagy was induced by, and required for, MHV replication complex formation and viral replication. Cell imaging and biochemical and genetic approaches were used to demonstrate that MHV replication complexes were associated with the autophagic markers LC3 and Apg12 and that MHV proteins known to translocate away from replication complexes also lost their association with LC3 over time. Furthermore, MHV infection induced autophagy, and inhibition of autophagy inhibited MHV growth. These results indicate that the process of autophagy plays an important role in the replication of MHV. Viruses, Cells, and Starvation—MHV, strain A59, was used for infections throughout this study. All infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell (pfu/cell) unless otherwise indicated. DBT cells were used in LC3 localization, translocation studies, and long-lived protein degradation experiments (27Hirano N. Ono K. Goto N.

For this report, italicized capitalized nomenclature (e.g. APG5) refers to the gene, whereas an initial capital letter followed by lowercase lettering (e.g. Apg5) refers to the protein. APG5 was knocked out in A11 and B22 cells by targeted homologous recombination of the APG5 locus in R1 parental ES cells and were generated as described previously (12Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The APG5 cDNA was cloned into pCI-neo (Promega), and stable APG5 transformants (WT13) were created by genomic integration of the plasmid into APG5–/–ES cells (A11) (12Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). ES cells were maintained on gelatinized 60-mm dishes in complete ES medium (high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mml-glutamine, nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, antibiotics, and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, Inc.). Long-lived Protein Degradation Assay—Measurement of long-lived protein degradation was performed as described previously (3Talloczy Z. Jiang W. Virgin IV, H.W. Leib D.A. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Eskelinen E.L. Levine B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Results are of representative experiments performed in triplicate ± S.D. Briefly, DBT cells were labeled for 72 h in medium containing 65 μm concentrations of unlabeled leucine and [3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml). The cells were then washed and incubated in medium containing excess cold leucine (2 mm) for 24 h to allow for degradation of short-lived proteins. These labeled cells were then infected, amino acid starved, or maintained in 10% FCS-containing DMEM. At 0, 4, and 8 h after infection or starvation, media supernatants were analyzed for acid-soluble radioactivity. Total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity of the cell monolayers was assayed at the end of the time course, and the percentage of long-lived protein degradation at each time point was determined by the formula: % degradation = (3H counts at time point/sum of 3H counts at each time point + total cell-associated radioactivity) × 100. Viral Growth Analysis—All results presented are of experiments performed in triplicate, with each experiment being assayed in duplicate. Error bars represent 1 standard deviation. T75 flasks of cells were infected with MHV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 pfu/cell, and the virus was allowed to adsorb at room temperature for 1 h. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed three times with pre-warmed PBS before being overlaid with 10 ml of the appropriate medium (DMEM, 10% FCS for DBT cells, ES cell medium for all other cells). 250-μl samples of media were removed at 1, 4, 10, 16, 24, and 32 h p.i. with replacement of 250 μl of media at each time point. The amount of virus in the media at each time point was quantitated by plaque assay. The results represent viral yield, which is defined as peak titer/input titer, and have been adjusted for differences in cell numbers between cell types. 24 h p.i. represented the time of peak titer in all experiments. Antibodies—The B1 (αhel) and αp1a-22 antibodies have been described previously (22Denison M.R. Spaan W.J. van der Meer Y. Gibson C.A. Sims A.C. Prentice E. Lu X. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6862-6871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bost A.G. Carnahan R.H. Lu X. Denison M.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3399-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The αM (J.1.3) and αN (J.3.3) mouse monoclonal antibodies were provided by John Fleming (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The LC3, Apg5, and Apg12 antibodies were generated in rabbits as described previously (29Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18619-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The antibody against β-tubulin was purchased from Sigma. Western Blotting—Whole-cell lysates were prepared with a lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS in PBS with protease inhibitors). Western blotting was performed as described previously (12Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence experiments, DBT cells were plated on glass coverslips. Infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection = 10 pfu/cell at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% FCS. The inoculum was removed at 1 h p.i., and the cells were washed three times with pre-warmed DMEM and replaced with DMEM containing 10% FCS. At the times indicated, the cells were washed once with Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and fixed and permeabilized by the addition of –20 °C 100% methanol. The cells were rehydrated in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). For dual labeling experiments, in which one primary antibody was derived from mouse and the other from rabbit, the primary antibodies were combined in a diluent containing PBS, 2% goat serum, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1% BSA. Antibodies were allowed to adsorb for 1 h at room temperature and then washed twice with PBS, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1% BSA. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit and/or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were washed twice with PBS, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1% BSA and then once with PBS prior to being rinsed in deionized H2O and mounted onto glass slides with Aquapolymount (Polysciences, Inc.). For the p22/LC3 dual label experiment, in which both primary antibodies were generated in rabbits, anti-p22 was purified and directly conjugated to a fluorescent dye (Alexa 488). Staining for LC3 was performed as above. Following LC3 staining, conjugated anti-p22 was diluted 1:50 in PBS, 2% goat serum, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1% BSA and allowed to adsorb for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1% BSA, once with PBS, and once with deionized H2O prior to mounting. Immunofluorescence was detected at 488 and 543 nm using a 40× oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture = 1.3) on a Zeiss 510 laser scanning microscope. Quantitation of Protein Co-localization—Immunofluorescence images were acquired with maximal dynamic range. For each protein pair and time point, 10 fields of view were acquired and processed for co-localization measurement. The average number of infected cells/field was five. Images were exported to MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging) for quantitative analysis of fluorescence. In MetaMorph, images were split into the red and green channels. A background threshold had been determined for these experiments by application of anti-p22 to mock-infected DBT cells and processing with the appropriate secondary antibody. The resulting detected fluorescence was considered background, and the lower limit threshold was set to exclude pixels below that level. The upper limit threshold was set to exclude saturated pixels. Co-localization measurements were then performed on the images, and the resultant data was exported to Microsoft Excel for generation of time course graphs. Electron Microscopy—DBT, R1, A11, and WT cells were mock-infected, infected for 6 h, or starved for 2 h, and then washed once with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. The cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer at 37 °C for 1 h and then overnight at 4 °C. Cell pellets were then postfixed with 1% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature and dehydrated stepwise with ethanol. The dehydrated pellets were rinsed with propylene oxide for 30 min at room temperature and then embedded in Spurr resin for sectioning. Images of thin sections were acquired using a CM-12 microscope running at 80 keV. Replicase Proteins Co-localize with Markers for Autophagic Vacuoles—To determine whether MHV replication complexes were forming on the surface of autophagosomes, the subcellular localization of replication complexes and markers for autophagic vacuoles, microtubule-associated protein 1 LC3 and Apg12, were compared by immunofluorescence laser scanning confocal microscopy in MHV-infected DBT cells (29Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar). In mock-infected DBT cells, LC3 was detected as small discrete foci distributed throughout the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). When DBT cells were infected with MHV, some LC3 was concentrated in larger foci. The coalescence of LC3 into larger complexes has been shown previously to correspond to association of LC3 with autophagic vacuoles (29Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar). When MHV-infected cells were probed at 6 h p.i. for LC3 and MHV proteins known to localize to replication complexes (p22 and N), both p22 and N co-localized with a subset of LC3-positive foci (Fig. 1A). Quantitation of co-localization showed that N and LC3 were 75% co-localized, whereas p22 and LC3 were 84% co-localized (Fig. 1B). Significantly, p22 and N were co-localized primarily with the larger foci of LC3 accumulation that were characteristic of autophagosomes. N was 77% co-localized with Apg12, a protein demonstrated to localize to autophagic isolation membranes (Fig. 1). Thus, MHV replication complexes were associated with two independent protein markers for autophagic membranes. To determine whether the co-localization with autophagosomal markers was specific to replication complexes, the localization of LC3 was compared with the MHV membrane (M) protein. LC3 and M (which is known to target to sites of virus assembly in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and Golgi) were 17% co-localized, demonstrating that LC3 was not significantly associated with membranes derived from Golgi or ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or with sites of virus assembly (Fig. 1). LC3 has also been reported to be associated with microtubules. However, not all of the LC3 in an infected cell co-localized with replication complexes. Thus, to determine whether replication complexes and the replication complexassociated LC3 were associated with microtubules, we compared the localization of MHV-p22 to β-tubulin in MHV-infected cells. β-Tubulin was only 18% co-localized with p22, indicating that the majority of replication complexes and LC3 were not associated with microtubules (Fig. 1). LC3 Remains Associated with Replication Complexes throughout Infection—Having shown that replication complexes co-localized with LC3, we next determined if LC3 remained associated with replication complexes throughout the course of infection. The co-localization of LC3, hel, N, p22, and M was determined quantitatively at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 h p.i. At 5 and 6 h p.i., hel and M were 12 and 13% co-localized, but by 7 h p.i., the two proteins were 40% co-localized, and by 8 h p.i., hel and M were 64% co-localized. When the localization of the hel and N proteins were compared, hel and N were >85% co-localized throughout the infection (Fig. 2). Together, these results provided quantitative confirmation of previous observations demonstrating that the hel and N proteins translocate away from replication complexes to sites of viral assembly, possibly to deliver newly synthesized RNA nucleocapsids for integration into newly forming virions (25Bost A.G. Prentice E. Denison M.R. Virology. 2001; 285: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When LC3 localization was compared with N and M at 5 and 6 h p.i., N and LC3 were 74% co-localized, but by 7 h p.i., N and LC3 were only 55% co-localized and by 8 and 9 h p.i. were only 17% co-localized. When the localization of LC3 and M were compared, LC3 and M were <18% co-localized throughout the course of the infection (Fig. 2). Thus, LC3 did not translocate with hel and N to sites of assembly. To confirm that LC3 remained associated with replication complexes, the localization of LC3 was compared with the replication complex-associated protein, p22 (25Bost A.G. Prentice E. Denison M.R. Virology. 2001; 285: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LC3 and p22 remained 85% co-localized throughout the course of infection (Fig. 2). These experiments demonstrated that LC3 did not change localization over time but remained associated with proteins in viral replication complexes. Autophagy Is Induced by MHV Infection—The co-localization of replicase proteins with LC3 suggested that replication complexes were forming on autophagic vacuoles. A possible mechanism for targeting of replicase proteins to autophagic vacuoles would be the specific induction of cellular autophagy by MHV. The rate of degradation of long-lived proteins is a well characterized method shown to provide an accurate measure of the level of autophagy in cells (1Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar, 3Talloczy Z. Jiang W. Virgin IV, H.W. Leib D.A. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Eskelinen E.L. Levine B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). To determine whether MHV infection induced autophagy, the rate of long-lived protein degradation was determined in DBT cells that were either amino acid-starved, MHV-infected, starved and MHV-infected, or incubated with normal media (Fig. 3). DBT cells that were starved increased their long-lived protein degradation from 1.2 to 2.9% (p < 0.0001, Student’s t test) compared with DBT cells incubated with normal media. In MHV-infected cells, protein degradation was significantly increased to 2.1% (p < 0.0006, Student’s t test) over control cells, and when cells were both starved and infected, protein degradation was increased to 2.9% (p < 0.0001, Student’s t test) compared with control cells. When cells were starved in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), the increase in protein degradation was blocked. In contrast, long-lived protein degradation increased to 2.6% (p < 0.0001, Student’s t test) in 3-MA-treated infected cells, demonstrating that MHV-induced protein degradation was 3-MA insensitive (Fig. 3). 3-MA did inhibit MHV growth in a dose-dependant manner (data not shown). However, 3-MA is a nucleoside analog that may interfere with viral RNA replication and transcription. Nevertheless, our results suggest that MHV induced autophagy via a unique pathway or was able to complement the 3-MA-inhibited steps resulting in functional autophagy. To determine whether an intact autophagic pathway was required for the MHV-induced stimulation of long-lived protein degradation, analysis of long-lived protein degradation was performed in murine embryonic stem cell lines expressing Apg5 (R1) or in APG5 knockout (A11) cells under the conditions used for DBT cells. The knockout of APG5 has been shown to pr"

Recent evidence suggests that ceramide is likely to reside and function within lipid rafts; ordered sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich lipid domains believed to exist within many eukaryotic cell membranes. Using lipid vesicles containing co-existing raft domains and disordered fluid domains, we find that natural and saturated synthetic ceramides displace sterols from rafts. Other raft lipids remain raft-associated in the presence of ceramide, showing displacement is relatively specific for sterols. Like cholesterol-containing rafts, ceramide-rich “rafts” remain in a highly ordered state. Comparison of the sterol-displacing abilities of natural ceramides with those of saturated diglycerides and an unsaturated ceramide demonstrates that tight lipid packing is critical for sterol displacement by ceramide. Based on these results, and the fact that cholesterol and ceramides both have small polar headgroups, we propose that ceramides and cholesterol compete for association with rafts because of a limited capacity of raft lipids with large headgroups to accommodate small headgroup lipids in a manner that prevents unfavorable contact between the hydrocarbon groups of the small headgroup lipids and the surrounding aqueous environment. Minimizing the exposure of cholesterol and ceramide to water may be a strong driving force for the association of other molecules with rafts. Furthermore, displacement of sterol from rafts by ceramide is very likely to have marked effects upon raft structure and function, altering liquid ordered properties as well as molecular composition. In this regard, certain previously observed physiological processes may be a result of displacement.

Ceramide is a membrane lipid involved in many biological processes. Sphingomyelinase action can result in a rapid increase in ceramide levels in which a large fraction of cellular sphingomyelin is converted to ceramide (1Chatterjee S. J. Biol.

They can co-exist with disordered fluid state membrane domains rich in unsaturated lipids (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Memb.

It can also induce the formation of unusually large raft domains (“platforms”) in plasma membranes (3Grassme H. Jendrossek V. Riehle A. von Kurthy G. Berger J. Schwarz H. Weller M. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Nat. Medicine. 2003; 9: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that natural ceramides or ceramides with long saturated acyl chains, and analogous diglycerides, efficiently displace cholesterol from rafts in model membranes. Other raft-associating molecules were not displaced from rafts by ceramide or diglyceride. A model for the origin of this displacement phenomenon is proposed. This model may provide insights into how various molecules, including proteins, participate in raft formation. Displacement of sterols from rafts is likely to have a variety of important consequences for raft function. For example, displacement of cholesterol from rafts can explain the displacement of cholesterol from plasma membranes upon ceramide generation, and may have implications for the association of cholesterol-bound proteins with rafts. Materials and Sample Preparation—Unlabeled lipids (including sphingosine-based ceramides) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Dehydroergosterol (DHE) 1The abbreviations used are: DHE, dehydroergosterol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SM, sphingomyelin; cer, ceramide; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; DPH, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; DPPC, dipalmitoylphoshatidylcholine; DPH-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-(diphenylhexatrienyl)-propanoyl-phosphatidylcholine; LcTMADPH, 22-(diphenylhexatrienyl)docosyltrimethylammonium; MLV, multilamellar vesicles; 12 SLPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-(12-doxyl)-stearoyl-phosphatidylcholine; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles. and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1-palmitoyl-2-(3-(diphenylhexatrienyl)propanoyl)-phosphatidylcholine (DPH-PC) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 22-(Diphenylhexatrienyl)docosyltrimethylammonium, (long chain TMADPH, LcTMADPH) was a kind gift from G. Duportail and D. Heissler (Université Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg). Lipids and probes were stored dissolved in ethanol at –20 °C. Concentrations were determined by dry weight. Radiolabeled dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dipalmitoylphoshatidylcholine (DPPC) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Radiolabeled palmitoyl (C16:0) ceramide was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Lipid (including radiolabeled lipid) purity was confirmed by TLC. Acetyl-K2W2L8AL8W2K2-amide (LW peptide) was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and purified as described previously (18Fastenberg M.E. Shogomori H. Xu X. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12376-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) were prepared at a concentration of 500 μm lipid in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7) as described previously (19Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Dried lipid mixtures were dispersed in buffer at 70 °C using a multitube vortexer for 15 min and cooled to 25 °C. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) at a concentration of 50 μm lipid in PBS were prepared by ethanol dilution as described previously (20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Lipids mixed in ethanol were diluted slightly more than 50-fold in PBS buffer heated to 70 °C, briefly vortexed, incubated at 70 °C for about 5 min, re-vortexed, and cooled to 25 °C. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence was measured on a SPEX Fluorolog 3. Excitation and emission wavelength sets used (in nm) were: (358, 427) for DPH and LcTMADPH, (358, 436) for DPH-PC, (324, 376) for DHE, and (280, 340) for LW peptide. Fluorescence intensity in background samples lacking fluorophore was subtracted when significant. Unless otherwise noted fluorophore concentrations were 0.1 mol% for LcTMADPH and DPH-PC and 1.5 mol% for LW peptide Insolubility Assay of Raft Content—The detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) were isolated by insolubility at 23 °C as described previously (19Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The DRM fraction from a 1-ml MLV sample was collected after 2 h of incubation in 0.5%(w/v) Triton X-100 by pelleting at 14,000 rpm for 15 min in an Eppendorf 5415C tabletop centrifuge. The fluorescence of 970–990 μl of supernatant and of the pellet suspended in 975 μl of PBS were compared. For calculating % pelleting corrections were made for differences in fluorophore intensity (quantum yield) in lipid and Triton X-100. Radioactive tracers were used at 0.02–0.1 μCi per sample. Average values and the range for duplicate experiments were calculated. (In most cases, for these and the fluorescence studies described below, additional experiments that are not reported gave similar results.) Fluorescence Quenching Assays—Quenching of fluorophores incorporated into SUV was measured at 23 °C as described previously (17Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Fluorescence (F) of samples containing 12SLPC was normalized (Fo) to that in samples in which DOPC replaced 12SLPC. Control experiments confirmed that quenching of DHE was not affected by the length of time that samples were incubated after preparation, or by whether MLV or SUV samples were prepared. Average values and the range for duplicate experiments were calculated. The temperature dependence of quenching was used to evaluate the thermal stability of rafts as described previously (17Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 19Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Samples containing 0.3 mol% LcTMADPH were heated at about 3 °C per min, and fluorescence periodically measured during heating. Average values for duplicate experiments were calculated. Polarization Measurements—Anisotropy measurements were made at 23 °C using a SPEX Glan-Thompson automated polarizer accessory. SUV samples were prepared as described above except that 1mol% DPH or LcTMADPH was used. Background intensities were negligible. Average values and the range for duplicate experiments were calculated. Measurement of DHE to LcTMADPH Energy Transfer—SUV samples were prepared with either LcTMADPH or with LcTMADPH plus DHE. Samples containing DHE were composed of 12:12:61:7.5:7.5 (mol: mol) DPPC:cer:DOPC:DHE:cholesterol (Fraft+) or 85:7.5:7.5 DOPC:DHE:cholesterol (Fhomog+). Samples lacking DHE were composed of 12: 12:61:15 (mol:mol) DPPC:cer:DOPC:cholesterol (Fraft–) or 85:15 DOPC: cholesterol (Fhomog–). Sensitized LcTMADPH emission was measured at excitation 324 nm and emission 427 nm. Energy transfer was measured from the fractional increase of LcTMADPH emission in the presence of DHE. Fractional increase in LcTMADPH fluorescence is given by ([F+/F–] – 1) and the relative fractional increase is given by ([Fraft+/Fraft–] – 1)/([Fhomog+/Fhomog–] – 1). No correction was made for quenching of DHE by LcTMADPH when corrections for background fluorescence (from samples lacking LcTMADPH) were made. We estimate correction for this would increase the enhancement of LcTMADPH fluorescence we measured by a factor of one-quarter to one-third under conditions in which the bilayer was homogeneous. This should have little effect on the results obtained because the correction would be the same, and thus cancel out, for samples with and without DPPC/ceramide under conditions in which the bilayer was homogeneous. Average values from duplicates were calculated. Detection of Displacement of Sterol from Rafts by Ceramide using a Detergent Insolubility Assay—The effect of ceramide upon association of various molecules with ordered lipid domains was measured starting with model membrane vesicles containing sterol and a 1:1 mixture of the saturated lipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and the unsaturated lipid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Previous studies have shown that such vesicles form bilayers containing co-existing ordered “raft” domains rich in DPPC and sterol and non-raft regions rich in DOPC (19Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E.

J. 2001; 81: 2257-2267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the first series of experiments, the insolubility of ordered domains in Triton X-100 at 23 °C was used to evaluate raft association. A DRM pellet was isolated by centrifugation, and then the amount of the molecule of interest that was DRM-associated was measured (19Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 23Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 24Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). This value was normalized to the fraction of total lipid that was detergent insoluble, i.e. the fraction of total lipid found in DRM. Using multilamellar vesicles, which scatter much more light than detergent-solubilized material, the fraction of undissolved lipid could be estimated from the % optical density (%OD) remaining after addition of Triton X-100. Although detergent insolubility of lipids is sensitive to a number of variables (25Heerklotz H. Szadkowska H. Anderson T. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) previous studies have shown that under the conditions in our experiments the level of detergent-insolubility reflect the amount of lipids and other molecules associated with ordered domains reasonably well (19Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 27Wang T.Y. Leventis R. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13031-13040Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Detergent insolubility was measured for radiolabeled DPPC, DOPC, C16:0 ceramide, and cholesterol, and also for DPH-PC, a fluorescently labeled phosphatidylcholine, DHE, a fluorescent sterol with properties similar to those of cholesterol (28Hale J.E. Schroeder F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and LcTMADPH, a derivative of DPH attached to a trimethyl-amino-terminated C22:0 hydrocarbon chain (29Beck A. Heissler D. Duportail G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1993; 66: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the affinity for ordered domains is highest for LcTMADPH, relatively high in the case of DPPC, ceramide and cholesterol, lower but still significant for DPH-PC, and least for DOPC (16Wang T.-Y. Silvius J.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol.

In reasonable agreement with this order, Fig. 1, A and B show that in the absence of ceramide relative association with DRM (given by the ratio % pelleting/% OD) decreased in the order LcTMADPH>ceramide>DPPC=cholesterol=DHE=DPH-PC>DOPC. These measurements were repeated using samples in which almost half of the unlabeled DPPC was replaced by an equimolar amount of stearoyl (C18:0) ceramide. Fig. 1, A and B show that in the presence of C18:0 ceramide both LcTMADPH and C16:0 ceramide remained strongly associated with DRM, while DPPC association with DRM actually increased. In contrast, the presence of ceramide resulted in the strong displacement of both cholesterol and DHE from DRM. (In a control experiment, it was found that C16:0 ceramide displaced cholesterol at least as well as C18:0 ceramide (data not shown).) DPH-PC was moderately displaced from the DRM by ceramide. Fig. 1, C and D show that both cholesterol and DHE exhibited a progressive displacement as ceramide concentration was increased. Sterol displacement did not parallel the ceramide dependence of the overall fraction of lipids within DRM, which tended to remain relatively constant as judged by % OD. Detection of Displacement of Sterol from Rafts by Ceramide using Fluorescence Quenching—DRM isolated by use of Triton X-100 can overestimate or underestimate raft levels, and % OD is a crude measure of total raft levels (25Heerklotz H. Szadkowska H. Anderson T. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). For these reasons, studies were also carried out using fluorescence quenching. Fluorescent probes were incorporated into vesicles containing both raft-forming lipids and 1-palmitoyl 2-(12-doxyl)stearoyl PC (12SLPC), a fluorescence quenching lipid that, like DOPC, is relatively excluded from rafts (20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). 12SLPC is a short-range quencher that has to be in near contact with a fluorescent molecule in order to quench its fluorescence (30Chattopadhyay A.

When rafts and non-raft regions co-exist in 12SLPC-containing vesicles the intensity of fluorescence from a membrane-bound probe depends on whether it associates with rafts or not. In mixtures of DPPC (or sphingomyelin) with cholesterol and 12SLPC, rafts have a low % of 12SLPC while the remainder of the bilayer, which is in a disordered fluid state, is enriched in 12SLPC (19Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 32London E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A molecule that associates with rafts fluoresces relatively strongly, because there is a good chance it will not be next to a 12SLPC molecule. A molecule that remains in the non-raft regions of the bilayer will fluoresce weakly because the chance it will be next to a 12SLPC is high. Therefore, the level of quenching will reflect the degree of association with rafts (18Fastenberg M.E. Shogomori H. Xu X. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12376-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the ceramide dependence of quenching of the fluorescence of DHE, LcTMADPH, DPH-PC, and LW peptide (acetyl-K2W2L8AL8W2K2-amide), a synthetic transmembrane polypeptide that does not associate with lipid rafts (18Fastenberg M.E. Shogomori H. Xu X. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12376-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The y-axis gives the difference between fluorescence in raft-containing samples and that in control samples forming homogeneous bilayers, i.e. lacking rafts. (Without subtraction of control values, the inherently different quenching sensitivity of different types of fluorescent groups would partially obscure differences between their raft association.) In raft-containing samples lacking ceramide (i.e. 0% ceramide values in Fig. 2A), fluorescence was most weakly quenched relative to the homogeneous control samples for LcTMADPH, consistent with the strong association of LcTMADPH with lipid rafts. In contrast, the Trp fluorescence of the peptide was more strongly quenched in raft-containing samples than in the control samples. This reflects the relative exclusion of LW peptide from rafts, as found previously (18Fastenberg M.E. Shogomori H. Xu X. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12376-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Quenching levels were intermediate for DPH-PC and DHE, showing that they associate with rafts to a significant degree. Partial substitution of DPPC with ceramide had little effect on quenching of LcTMADPH and peptide fluorescence, showing the locations of these molecules was not greatly altered by ceramide. (The small changes observed in their quenching at high ceramide concentrations may reflect a small change in raft association or ceramide-induced displacement of some of the residual raft-associated 12SLPC from rafts.) In contrast, as ceramide concentrations increased a large and progressive increase in the quenching of DHE fluorescence was observed, confirming DHE displacement from rafts. DPH-PC fluorescence showed a much smaller increase in quenching as ceramide concentration was increased, indicating a more modest extent of displacement. Overall, the fluorescence quenching experiments are in agreement with those based upon detergent insolubility. Utilizing quenching, ceramide-induced displacement of sterol from rafts was also observed when brain sphingomyelin (SM) and a brain ceramide mixture were substituted for DPPC and C18:0 ceramide, respectively (Fig. 2B). This shows that displacement is similar for analogous chemically defined and natural lipid mixtures. Comparison of the ability of different sphingolipids to displace sterol (Fig. 2C) showed that partial substitution of SM for DPPC had no effect on quenching of DHE fluorescence, whereas partial substitution of a cerebroside mixture for DPPC increased quenching, but to a much lesser degree than substitution of DPPC by C18:0 ceramide. The behavior of cerebroside-containing mixtures suggests that sterols associate with cerebroside-rich rafts to much higher degree than to ceramide-rich rafts but to a lesser degree than those formed by SM or DPPC, consistent with previous studies (17Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Comparison of Diglyceride and Ceramide Behavior—The effect of ceramide and diglyceride on raft stability and sterol displacement were compared. Both of these lipids contain two hydrocarbon chains and relatively small polar headgroups, but they differ in the details of their polar headgroup structure. In one experiment, their effects on raft stability were compared when added to mixtures of DPPC, 12SLPC, cholesterol, and LcTMADPH. As noted above, when rafts are present they bind LcTMADPH so that its fluorescence is only weakly quenched by 12SLPC (17Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, at temperatures above that at which rafts are stable all lipids mix in a relatively homogeneous fashion, and thus quenching increases because LcTMADPH molecules come into increased contact with 12SLPC molecules. The temperature dependence of quenching can be used to monitor the thermal stability of rafts. The midpoint of a quenching versus temperature curve (raft “melting” temperature) is a measure of raft stability (17Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 19Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Fig. 3, A and B show that substitution of 4 mol%, 9 mol%, or 18 mol% DPPC with an equimolar amount of either C18:0 ceramide or 1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol-stabilized rafts. The degree of stabilization by the C18:0 ceramide and dipalmitoylglycerol was similar. In contrast, unsaturated oleoyl (C18:1) ceramide decreased raft stability (Fig. 3A). We next compared the ability of dipalmitoylglycerol and ceramide to displace sterols from rafts. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D dipalmitoylglycerol was able to displace sterol from rafts even more efficiently than C18:0 ceramide, whereas C18:1 ceramide only induced weak displacement relative to C18:0 ceramide. Together these results suggest that acyl chain saturation is a more important factor than the details of the polar headgroup structure for both raft stabilization and sterol displacement. (Whether natural diglycerides would affect raft structure or formation is unclear. Preliminary studies indicate that 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl glycerol can displace cholesterol from rafts, although to a lesser extent than dipalmitoylglycerol. 2Megha and E. London, unpublished observations.) Ceramide-rich Domains Are Highly Ordered—Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made on samples containing LcTMADPH and DPH incorporated into various lipid bilayers to probe the effect of ceramide upon lipid order (Fig. 4A). As expected, for both probes anisotropy va"

Iron(III)-phytosiderophores are subsequently taken up by roots via YS1 transporters, that belong to the OPT oligopeptide transporter family. Despite its physiological importance at alkaline pH, uptake of Fe-phytosiderophores into roots of wild-type maize plants was greater at acidic pH and sensitive to the proton uncoupler CCCP. To access the mechanism of Fe-phytosiderophore acquisition, ZmYS1 was expressed in an iron uptake-defective yeast mutant and in Xenopus oocytes, where ZmYS1-dependent Fe-phytosiderophore transport was stimulated at acidic pH and sensitive to CCCP. Electrophysiological analysis in oocytes demonstrated that Fephytosiderophore transport depends on proton cotransport and on the membrane potential, which allows ZmYS1-mediated transport even at alkaline pH. We further investigated substrate specificity and observed that ZmYS1 complemented the growth defect of the zinc uptake-defective yeast mutant zap1 and transported various phytosiderophore-bound metals into oocytes, including zinc, copper, nickel, and, at a lower rate, also manganese and cadmium. Unexpectedly, ZmYS1 also transported Ni(II), Fe(II), and Fe(III) complexes with nicotianamine, a structural analog of phytosiderophores, which has been shown to act as an intracellular metal chelator in all higher plants. Our results show that ZmYS1 encodes a proton-coupled broad-range metal-phytosiderophore transporter that additionally transports Fe- and Ni-nicotianamine.

These biochemical properties indicate a novel role of YS1 transporters for heavy metal homeostasis in plants. Although iron is the second most abundant metal in the earth's crust, the bioavailability of this essential micronutrient is extremely low. Many microorganisms and graminaceous plant species overcome this problem by secreting siderophores, which are hydroxamate-, hydroxypyridonate-, catechol-, or aminocarboxylate-type chelators with a particular high affinity for Fe(III) (1Sugiura Y. Nomoto K. Struct. Bond. 1984; 58: 107-135Crossref Google Scholar, 2Neilands J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26723-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). After mobilization of Fe(III), e.g. from sparingly soluble precipitates, siderophore-bound iron is subsequently taken up by specific transport systems, which have been well characterized in prokaryotic organisms (3Braun V. Killmann H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 104-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Yeast or dicotyledonous and non-graminaceous monocotyledonous plants increase proton secretion by H+-ATPases as well as Fe(III) reduction capacity by ferric chelate reductases at the root plasma membrane and induce the Fe(II) transporter IRT1 (4Schmidt W. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 188-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This reduction-based strategy, however, is prone to inhibition by high pH and elevated bicarbonate levels in calcareous soils, due to the pH dependence of chemical Fe(III) solubilization and enzymatic Fe(III) reduction (5Toulon V. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.-B. Soler A. Clarkson D. Grignon C. Planta. 1989; 179: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By contrast, graminaceous plant species constitutively express the reduction-dependent pathway for iron uptake at a comparatively low level, but enhance capacities for phytosiderophore release and Fe(III)-phytosiderophore uptake under iron deficiency (6Römheld V. Marschner H. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 175-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological studies showed that Fe-phytosiderophore transport in graminaceous plants is unaffected by the presence of strong Fe(II) chelators, such as BPDS (6Römheld V. Marschner H. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 175-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but recognizes the backbone structure of mugineic acid-derived phytosiderophores, which are aminocarboxylate-type, hexadentate Fe(III) chelators (Refs. 1Sugiura Y. Nomoto K. Struct. Bond. 1984; 58: 107-135Crossref Google Scholar and 7Ma J.F. Kusano G. Kimura S. Nomoto K. Phytochem. 1993; 34: 599-603Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). In roots of maize high-affinity Fe(III)-phytosiderophore uptake is required to produce non-chlorotic, healthy plants, and is strongly dependent on the YS1 gene product (8von Wirén N. Mori S. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Transposon-tagging of the YS1 gene in maize allowed to identify ZmYS1 as a highly hydrophobic protein with 14 putative transmembrane-spanning domains that confers growth of the iron uptake-defective yeast mutant fet3 fet4 on phytosiderophore-bound iron, even in the presence of the Fe(II) chelator BPDS 1The abbreviations used are: BPDS, bathophenanthroline disulfonate; DMA, 2′-deoxymugineic acid; NA, nicotianamine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.

This study confirmed earlier uptake experiments with double-labeled Fe-phytosiderophores in the ys1 mutant indicating a stochiometric uptake of metal and ligand (10von Wirén N. Marschner H. Römheld V. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 93: 611-616Crossref Google Scholar). The non-reductive transport pathway of Fe-phytosiderophores seems especially effective at alkaline pH and very low concentrations of Fe(III)-phytosiderophore complexes (11Shi W.-M. Chino M. Youssef R.A. Mori S. Takagi S. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1988; 34: 585-592Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Marschner H. Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). Although showing high affinity for ferric, phytosiderophores of the mugineic acid family do also chelate other heavy metals. Phytosiderophore-enriched root exudates efficiently mobilized copper, manganese, and zinc as well as other non-essential heavy metals (13Treeby M. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Soil. 1989; 114: 217-226Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 14Römheld V. Awad F. J. Plant Nutr. 2000; 23: 1857-1866Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, uptake studies with labeled metal-phytosiderophores indicated that barley roots possess uptake activities for phytosiderophore-complexed zinc and copper (7Ma J.F. Kusano G. Kimura S. Nomoto K. Phytochem. 1993; 34: 599-603Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Zhang F. Römheld V. Marschner H. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1991; 37: 671-678Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and that ZmYS1 is responsible for the import of Zn(II)-phytosiderophores in maize roots (16von Wirén N. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, the plant phytosiderophore system could potentially also serve for the acquisition of metals other than iron, which is supported by the observation that phytosiderophore release is not only triggered under iron-deficient growth conditions, but also induced under zinc deficiency (15Zhang F. Römheld V. Marschner H. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1991; 37: 671-678Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Tolay I. Erenoglu B. Römheld V. Braun H.J. Cakmak I. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In plants, metal-phytosiderophore uptake is not only important for covering the micronutrient demand of the plant, but might also be important for employing plants in future for phytoremediation purposes. In the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana eight ZmYS1 homologs (AtYSL1–8) have been identified (9Curie C. Panaviene Z. Loulergue C. Dellaporta S.L. Briat J.-F. Walker E.L. Nature. 2001; 409: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Since the release of phytosiderophores has so far not yet been observed in dicotyledonous plants, it is possible that YSL proteins function to transport metal-nicotianamine (NA) chelates. Nicotianamine, which occurs in all higher plants, is structurally similar to phytosiderophores and serves as a precursor in their biosynthetic pathway (Ref. 18Shojima S. Nishizawa N.K. Fushiya S. Nozoe S. Irifune T. Mori S. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1497-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). A strong link between NA and iron metabolism is reflected in the NA-less tomato mutant chloronerva that shows severe symptoms of iron deficiency due to a deletion in a gene encoding nicotianamine synthase (19Ling H.-Q. Koch G. Bäumlein H. Ganal M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7098-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NA has been shown to chelate not only Fe(III) but also Fe(II), in particular at higher pH, which may allow it to serve as an intracellular Fe(II) scavenger thereby protecting the cell from Fe(II)-mediated oxidative damage (20von Wirén N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.-F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The recent success of chemical synthesis of NA (21Miyakoshi K. Oshita J. Kitahara T. Tetrahedron. 2001; 573355Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) allowed us also to investigate metal-NA chelate transport. In order to understand iron-phytosiderophore transport under alkaline conditions and to characterize metal and ligand specificity by the ZmYS1 transporter in maize, we expressed ZmYS1 in two heterologous systems and verified its transport properties in the ys1 maize mutant. We found that ZmYS1 mediates transport of phytosiderophore-bound Fe(III) and other metals by H+-coupled cotransport and permeates also NA-complexed Fe(II), Fe(III), and Ni(II). Plasmids, Yeast Strains, and Growth Conditions—Plasmid preparation, restriction enzyme digestion, and DNA ligation were performed using standard methods (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The ZmYS1 open reading frame containing a 32-bp 5′-untranslated region was subcloned from pYPGE15 (9Curie C. Panaviene Z. Loulergue C. Dellaporta S.L. Briat J.-F. Walker E.L.

Media were prepared using standard recipes (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed.

To support growth of the fet3 fet4 mutant, solid YNB medium contained additionally 30 μm FeCl3, while the liquid YPD medium was acidified to pH 5.0 with HCl. Yeast was transformed with either pDR196 or pDR196-ZmYS1 using the LiAc method (27Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 201425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on uracil-deficient YNB medium containing 0.1% arginine as nitrogen source and the appropriate supplements. For growth tests a single colony from BY4741 and fet3 fet4 transformants was washed in 1 ml of 10× TE (pH 7.5) and resuspended in sterile MQ water to obtain an OD of 0.09. Cells were streaked on uracil-deficient YNB medium, containing 0.1% arginine, 3% glucose, 0.01% tryptophane, histidine, methionine, leucine, and the respective iron source. For complementation of the zap1 mutant, cells were streaked on a modified LIM medium (28Eide D. Guarente L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) without sodium citrate, zinc sulfate, and ammonium, but supplemented with 0.1% arginine, 3% glucose, 0.01% histidine, methionine, and leucine, 50 mm MES/Tris (pH 7.0) and the respective zinc source. For uptake experiments single colonies of transformed BY4741 cells were cultured in liquid YNB medium containing 3% glucose, the appropriate supplements and 30 μm NiSO4, harvested at mid-log phase, washed at 4 °C in ice cold uptake buffer consisting of 3% glucose, 40 mm NaH2PO3 (pH 6.5) and resuspended on ice in uptake buffer to obtain OD 12. Before the uptake experiment, cells were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C (500 rpm). Uptake was started by addition of 1 volume of solution containing 3% glucose, 100 mm MES/Tris (pH 6.5) and the respective 63Ni(II)-chelate (specific activity 143 Ci mol-1). 100 μl of uptake reaction was diluted in 10 ml of 10 mm EDTA (pH 6.5) and filtered (Whatman, 1822 025) before analyzing filter membranes by scintillation counting. Electrophysiological Studies in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Capped cRNA was transcribed from pOO2-ZmYS1 in vitro using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), after linearization of the plasmid with Eco72I. Oocyte experiments were performed as described in (29Liu L. Ludewig U. Frommer W.B. von Wirén N. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 790-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Metal-chelate-induced currents in oocytes were detected by two electrode voltage clamp 3 days after cRNA injection. Preparation of Metal Chelates—Deoxymugineic acid (DMA) was produced, and NA was chemically synthesized as described previously (16von Wirén N. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Miyakoshi K. Oshita J. Kitahara T. Tetrahedron. 2001; 573355Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fe-DMA was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of a 10 mm FeCl3 solution, pH <2, and MES/Tris buffer and, if not indicated otherwise, with a 10-fold excess of DMA for 2–3 h at RT. Fe(II)-NA was obtained by mixing a freshly prepared Fe(II) stock solution consisting of 10 mm FeCl2 and 20 mm ascorbate in 200 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.0 or 7.5, with the appropriate amount of a 10 mm NA solution and MES/Tris buffer, pH 7.0 or 7.5, followed by 10 min of incubation at 65 °C. According to this procedure successful complex formation had been verified (20von Wirén N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.-F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 35von Wirén N. Khodr H. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Formation of the Fe(II)-NA complex was monitored by disappearance of the purple Fe-ascorbate complex. The Fe(III)- and Ni(II)-NA complexes were prepared similarly by dissolving FeCl3 or NiSO4 in 10 mm HCl to obtain a 10 mm metal solution, and mixing with the appropriate amount of MES/Tris buffer and NA, followed by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. In all solutions NA was in 20% excess if not indicated otherwise. All chelate solutions were centrifuged or filtered (0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) to remove precipitated iron hydroxides. Iron concentrations of supernatants or filtrates were verified by AAS or scintillation counting. 59Fe-labeled Fe-phytosiderophore Uptake Studies in Maize—Maize plants were precultured and subjected to uptake studies using 59Fe-labeled Fe-DMA (8von Wirén N. Mori S. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16von Wirén N. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). CCCP was added from 1 mm or 10 mm stock solutions in methanol to uptake solutions to final concentrations of 10 or 100 μm (solutions w/o CCCP contained methanol alone). Uptake solutions were buffered with MES/Tris or HEPES. Fe-Phytosiderophore Transport in Maize Roots Is pH-dependent—Since graminaceous plant species are dependent on Fe(III)-phytosiderophore uptake in particular at alkaline soil pH, uptake of 59Fe-labeled Fe(III)-DMA was compared in wild type (Alice) and ys1 mutant plants at different pH values of the uptake solution. At alkaline pH (pH 7.5) uptake rates of Fe(III)-DMA were 5-fold higher in wild type maize compared with ys1 mutant plants. However in wild type maize decreasing pH caused an increase in uptake which was almost 2-fold higher at pH 4.5 compared with pH 7.5 (Fig. 2A). The majority of this Fe(III)-DMA uptake could be ascribed to ZmYS1, since uptake rates in the ys1 mutant were five to ten times lower and did not change with external pH. To confirm a pH dependence of Fe-phytosiderophore uptake further, the effect of the proton uncoupler CCCP on root uptake of labeled Fe(III)-DMA was tested in Fe-deficient wild-type plants. Addition of CCCP at concentrations of 10 and 100 μm led to a 10–20-fold decrease in Fe(III)-DMA uptake (Fig. 2B), suggesting a dependence of Fe(III)-DMA transport on the proton gradient across the root plasma membrane. Transport Properties of ZmYS1 in Yeast—ZmYS1 has been shown to complement growth of the fet3 fet4 mutant (9Curie C. Panaviene Z. Loulergue C. Dellaporta S.L. Briat J.-F. Walker E.L. Nature. 2001; 409: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), which is defective in high and low affinity iron transport and cannot grow on Fe-limited medium (30Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). As expected, fet3 fet4 cells transformed with pDR196-ZmYS1 grew well on medium containing 7.5 μm Fe(III)-2′-DMA, whereas transformants with the empty vector did not (Fig. 3A). Growth complementation was pH-dependent. ZmYS1 transformants appeared earlier (data not shown), and colony number increased with decreasing pH (Fig. 3A). To test ligand specificity of ZmYS1-mediated transport, ZmYS1-transformed fet3 fet4 cells were grown on NA-chelated iron. After 7-days growth complementation was achieved by 40 μm of either Fe(II)-NA or Fe(III)-NA (Fig. 3B), while growth was not complemented using 7.5 μm Fe-NA (data not shown). With supply of 30 μm FeCl3 differences between yeast transformants disappeared (Fig. 3C). Zn(II)-phytosiderophore transport was investigated employing the zinc uptake-defective yeast strain zap1, which carries a deletion in the zinc-responsive transcriptional activator Zap1 (31Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and does not grow on modified LIM medium containing less than 400 μm zinc when transformed with pDR196 alone (Fig. 3D). Transformation of zap1 with pDR196-ZmYS1, however, permitted growth on 0.7 mm Zn(II)-DMA as zinc source, showing that ZmYS1 also transports phytosiderophore-chelated zinc (Fig. 3D). To investigate ZmYS1-mediated transport of nickel complexes, we first examined time-dependent uptake of 63Ni-DMA in the wt yeast strain BY4741. Little uptake was detected at 4 °C for either ZmYS1-expressing or control cells (Fig. 4A). At 30 °C, ZmYS1 expression led to an almost linear increase in 63Ni accumulation over 20 min, while control cells hardly accumulated any 63Ni. Nickel(II)-DMA uptake activity stopped immediately after addition of CCCP, while cells receiving the solvent alone continued to accumulate 63Ni(II)-DMA (Fig. 4B). Uptake activity of 63Ni(II)-NA was also CCCP-sensitive and increased almost linearly over time, though at a 3-fold lower rate (Fig. 4C). Concentration-dependent uptake of both nickel complexes in a range between 1 and 300 μm yielded saturable kinetics, and Lineweaver-Burk transformation allowed calculatation of a Km of ZmYS1 for Ni(II)-NA of 165 μm compared with a Km of 19 μm for Ni(II)-DMA (Fig. 4D). Hence nickel was transported by ZmYS1 in a similar manner to iron, i.e. as a DMA- or NA-chelate and in a CCCP-sensitive manner. Electrophysiological Characterization of ZmYS1-mediated Transport in Oocytes—To study the transport mechanism employed by ZmYS1 in more detail, the protein was expressed heterologously in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Oocytes were voltage-clamped to -70 mV in choline-based buffer solution at pH 6.0 and then superfused with buffer containing different concentrations of Fe(III)-DMA. In oocytes injected with cRNA encoding ZmYS1, currents induced by Fe(III)-DMA corresponded to the net influx of positive charge, reversed after withdrawal of substrate and were voltage and concentration-dependent (Fig. 5A). Currents were absent in water- or non-injected control oocytes (data not shown). Fe(III)-DMA-dependent currents increased with more negative voltage and increasing substrate concentrations up to ∼25 μm Fe(III)-DMA (Fig. 5B). Thus, Fe(III)-DMA transport was saturable, and the Fe(III)-DMA concentration that permitted half-maximal uptake was between 5 and 10 μm with the tendency to decrease at more positive voltage (Fig. 5C). A decreasing Km with less negative voltage indicates binding of a negatively charged substrate to the transport protein. Fe(III)-DMA-induced currents strongly depended on external pH. Highest currents were obtained at pH 5.0 and gradually decreased by increasing the pH to 9.5 (Fig. 6A). Plotting substrate-induced currents against H+ concentrations showed that Fe(III)-DMA-induced currents increased up to proton concentrations of 100 nm, corresponding to a pH of 7, but saturated at higher proton concentrations (Fig. 6B). Replacing choline by sodium (100 mm, pH 9.5) did not stimulate transport, indicating that sodium could not substitute protons to drive metalchelate uptake (Fig. 6A). Since yeast uptake experiments provided evidence that ZmYS1 might also transport other heavy metals chelated with phytosiderophores (Fig. 4), different metal-chelates were tested for the induction of currents in ZmYS1-injected oocytes. When supplied at 100 μm external concentration, Ni(II)-, Zn(II)-, and Cu(II)-DMA provoked currents of similar size to those achieved with Fe(III)-DMA (Fig. 7A). By contrast, Mn(II)- and Cd(II)-bound DMA induced significantly smaller currents and negligible currents were induced by the unchelated ligand. Ferrous and ferric complexes with the synthetic chelator EDTA or unchelated metals (data not shown) induced little if any current. Since ZmYS1 might be saturated at <100 μm, currents were also assayed at 5 μm corresponding to the Km for Fe(III)-DMA (Fig. 5C). Currents induced by Ni(II)-, Zn(II)-, and Cu(II)-DMA were smaller relative to those induced by Fe(III)-DMA, while currents induced by Mn(II)- and Cd(II)-DMA approached zero (Fig. 7B), indicating that Cd- and Mn-phytosiderophore transport by ZmYS1 will be relatively insignificant in the presence of more competitive metals like iron, nickel, zinc, and copper. Smaller currents induced by 5 μm Ni(II)-DMA compared with 5 μm Fe(III)-DMA were consistent with the higher Km value of ZmYS1 for Ni(II)-DMA (Fig. 4D) compared with Fe(III)-DMA (Fig. 7A). Currents induced by DMA-chelated Fe(III) were then compared with NA-chelated iron at a concentration of 5 μm, clearly showing that ZmYS1 transports Fe(III)-DMA more efficiently than Fe(II)- or Fe(III)-NA (Fig. 7B). Together with the observation in yeast, where ZmYS1-mediated uptake of Ni(II)-DMA was higher than uptake of Ni(II)-NA, we concluded that metal-DMA complexes are more favored substrates for ZmYS1 compared with metal-NA complexes. At higher concentration and more negative membrane potential a discrimination between Fe(II)- and Fe(III)-NA transport could be achieved. Currents induced by 100 μm Fe(II)-NA increased steeply with voltage and were 3-fold larger than those for Fe(III)-NA (Fig. 7C). The induction of currents by NA complexes with both iron forms clearly agreed with the growth complementation of ZmYS1-transformed yeast cells on Fe(II)- and Fe(III)-NA (Fig. 3B). ZmYS1 Mediates H+-coupled High Affinity Fe-Phytosiderophore Transport—In three different systems we observed that ZmYS1-mediated Fe(III)-DMA transport depends on the availability of protons: (i) in maize roots Fe(III)-DMA uptake was severely inhibited by CCCP, and the contribution of ZmYS1 to transport of the iron chelate increased with the concentration of external protons (Fig. 2); (ii) in yeast, low pH values improved growth complementation by ZmYS1 of the iron uptake-defective yeast mutant fet3 fet4 (Fig. 3A) and uptake of 63Ni(II)-DMA was strongly inhibited by CCCP (Fig. 4B); and (iii) oocytes expressing ZmYS1 exhibited a positive inwardly rectifying and voltage-dependent current in response to supply with negatively charged Fe(III)-DMA and this current was proton dependent (Figs. 5 and 6). Considering the almost stochiometric uptake of double-labeled 59Fe- and 65Zn-14C-DMA by maize roots (8von Wirén N. Mori S. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16von Wirén N. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we conclude that ZmYS1 represents a H+-Fe(III)-phytosiderophore cotransporter. These data provide the first description of the transport mechanism employed by a member of the OPT family of oligopeptide transporters. In view of the pH and CCCP sensitivity of oligopeptide transport in yeast by ScOPT1 (32Lubkowitz M.A. Barnes D. Breslav M. Burchfield A. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 28: 729-741Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Hauser M. Donhardt A.M. Barnes D. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3037-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which belongs to a different cluster within the OPT family (34Yen M.-R. Teng Y.H. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2881-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it is likely that energization by H+-cotransport also holds true for other OPT members. Proton cotransport is surprising in view of the environmental conditions, under which the uptake of Fe(III)-phytosiderophores has to take place. The release of phytosiderophores by graminaceous species is enhanced as a response to low availability of soluble iron, which naturally occurs at high pH, such as is found in calcareous soils. In contrast to plants employing reduction-dependent iron acquisition, iron deficiency in grasses shows little if any correlation with elevated bicarbonate concentrations (12Marschner H. Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar), since iron acquisition does not rely on an Fe(III) reduction step. Our investigations uncovered another factor that contributes to more efficient iron acquisition in grasses: coupling the transport of Fe-phytosiderophores, which are negatively charged at neutral pH (35von Wirén N. Khodr H. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), to protons allows efficient root uptake even at high soil pH, because transport of the proton-coupled substrate can be driven as long as the overall difference of the electrochemical potential remains negative. This is emphasized by the Fe-DMA-induced currents in ZmYS1-expressing oocytes at pH 9.5, where currents appeared already at membrane potentials below -120 mV (Fig. 6A). Since the membrane potentials of root cells in grasses are usually between -120 and -180 mV, Fe-phytosiderophore uptake can still be driven until the availability of protons as a co-substrate becomes limiting. In oocytes proton availability limited Fe-DMA transport between pH 7 and 9.5 (Fig. 6B); but in soil-grown plants proton limitation probably occurs even at higher soil pH, because P-type ATPase-mediated proton extrusion may generate a local pH gradient favoring substrateproton cotransport (36Thibaud J.-B. Davidian J.-C. Sentenac H. Soler A. Grignon C. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1469-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, even at high proton buffering capacities in bicarbonate-rich soils, the electrochemical potential drives accumulation mainly by generating a strongly negative membrane potential. Under these conditions ZmYS1 can exhibit a high substrate affinity (Km of 5–10 μm, Fig. 5C) that would address the micromolar phytosiderophore concentrations found in the rhizosphere of grasses (11Shi W.-M. Chino M. Youssef R.A. Mori S. Takagi S. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1988; 34: 585-592Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Several plant transporters employ proton cotransport for negatively charged substrates, such as sulfate, nitrate or amino acids (37Chrispeels M.J. Crawford M.N. Schroeder J.I. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 661-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 38Fischer W.-N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Fe(III)-DMA complexes are negatively charged at neutral pH, while at pH 5 the majority of complexes is uncharged (35von Wirén N. Khodr H. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The slight tendency of ZmYS1 to increase the affinity for DMA-complexed Fe(III) at more positive voltage (Fig. 5C) tempts us to speculate that the negatively charged substrate and protons bind to different sites of ZmYS1 prior to transport. Since Fe(III)-DMA transport generated a positive inward current, at least two protons are cotransported with each complex. Interestingly, the net current with different saturating metal-complex concentrations was similar irrespectively of the valency of substrate charge (Fig. 7A). As phytosiderophore complexes with divalent cations such as copper, zinc, or nickel, are predicted to carry two negative charges at neutral pH (35von Wirén N. Khodr H. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the positive inward current demands that at least three protons are cotransported with these substrates. ZmYS1 Shows a Broad Metal Specificity—Growth complementation and oocyte transport studies clearly showed that ZmYS1 also transports phytosiderophore-chelated Zn(II). This has been substantiated in planta by lower uptake rates of 65Zn-phytosiderophores in the ys1 mutant compared with wild type maize (16von Wirén N. Marschner H. Römheld V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Since phytosiderophore release is also enhanced under zinc deficiency in several graminaceous species, zinc-phytosiderophore transport by ZmYS1 most likely represents one part of a concerted adaptive response to low zinc availability. Thus, phytosiderophore release, metal chelation and chelate uptake apply for iron and zinc, which is ecologically reasonable, since poor availability of both metal micronutrients can limit plant growth on calcareous soils (12Marschner H. Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). However, ZmYS1 also transported phytosiderophore-chelated nickel and copper at a similar rate to iron and zinc (Fig. 7A), although low availabilities of nickel and copper are apparently not limiting growth factors in calcareous soils. The specificity of phytosiderophore-mediated metal chelation and transport might thus be regarded as low, suggesting that metal-chelate transport by ZmYS1 primarily depends on the probability of complex formation and on regulation of ZmYS1. Since metal-phytosiderophore transport by ZmYS1 shows a similar poor selectivity for iron, as does metal transport by the major iron transporter IRT1 (30Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 39Vert G. Grotz N. Dédaldéchamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.-F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar), for which a complex regulation at the transcript level by iron and cadmium and at the protein level by iron and zinc was found (40Conolly E.L. Fett J.P. Guerinot M.L. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1347-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), it might be expected that ZmYS1 also responds to the availability of multiple metal elements. The broad range of metal transport therefore suggests that regulation of ZmYS1 by other metals is required as a prerequisite for plants to maintain metal ion homeostasis. On the other hand, the broad metal specificity of ZmYS1 opens up the possibility that the demand of other micronutrients, such as nickel, might also be satisfied by the phytosiderophore system and paves the way to employ phytosiderophore-releasing species for phytoremediation. Since phytosiderophore-overproducing rice plants have already been generated and shown to increase iron acquisition on calcareous soils (41Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Kawasaki S. Nishizawa N.K. Mori S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), we suggest to test such engineered plant lines also for the hyperaccumulation of other heavy metals. ZmYS1 Also Transports Fe- and Ni-nicotianamine—In contrast to phytosiderophores NA is not only synthesized by graminaceous plant species but by all higher plants and appears essential for chlorosis-free plant growth (19Ling H.-Q. Koch G. Bäumlein H. Ganal M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7098-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 42Takahashi M. Terada Y. Nakai I. Nakanishi H. Yoshimura E. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1263-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Due to the structural similarity of NA with phytosiderophores, we reasoned that ZmYS1 or ZmYS1-related proteins might also transport Fe-NA. Indeed, in both heterologous systems ZmYS1 transported also NA-chelated iron and Ni(II) (Figs. 3B, 4, and 7). Fe- and Ni-NA transport by ZmYS1 is of particular physiological importance, since NA is believed to fulfill a physiological role, which is different from phytosiderophores. Based on the formation of stable complexes between NA and Fe(II) or Fe(III) (20von Wirén N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.-F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), the occurrence of NA in aqueous extracts of leaves and roots (43Walter A. Pich A. Scholz G Marschner H. Römheld V. J. Plant Nutr. 1995; 18: 1577-1593Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the likely accumulation of Fe-NA complexes in the cytoplasm and the vacuole (44Pich A. Manteuffel R. Hillmer S. Scholz G. Schmidt W. Planta. 2001; 213: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), NA may find its physiological role in iron chelation for the intracellular delivery of iron and long-distance trafficking of iron, zinc, and copper (44Pich A. Manteuffel R. Hillmer S. Scholz G. Schmidt W. Planta. 2001; 213: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NA-chelated Fe(II), which exhibits a relatively high kinetic stability (20von Wirén N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.-F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), could even provide the opportunity for membrane transport of a ferrous iron chelate by maintaining a low risk for the generation of free superoxide radicals compared with the transport of free ferrous iron as mediated by IRT- or NRAMP-family transporters (39Vert G. Grotz N. Dédaldéchamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.-F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 45Thomine S. Wang R. Ward J.R. Crawford N.M. Schroeder J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4991-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Since Arabidopsis possesses eight ZmYS1-like genes (AtYSL1–8) (9Curie C. Panaviene Z. Loulergue C. Dellaporta S.L. Briat J.-F. Walker E.L. Nature. 2001; 409: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) but does not synthesize phytosiderophores, transport of Fe-NA might represent a major function for this transporter family in dicotyledonous plant species. Thus, YS1 and YSL proteins might act in a complementary manner to IRT and NRAMP transporters, since membrane transport could be mediated without involving a reduction step. An alternative physiological role of YS1 and YSL proteins is indicated by our finding that ZmYS1 mediates transport of Ni(II)-NA (Fig. 4). Supported by the observation that one NA synthase gene from maize, ZmNAS3, is up-regulated by iron sufficiency, which provides evidence for NA synthesis independent of phytosiderophore biosynthesis (46Mizuno D. Higuchi K. Sakamoto T. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a novel role for NA in heavy metal transport and detoxification is indicated. Indeed, recent investigations on the physiological basis of nickel tolerance in the hyperaccumulator species Thlaspi caerulescens identified enhanced chelation of Ni(II) by NA in the xylem as a response to toxic levels of external nickel (47Vacchina V. Mari S. Czernic P. Marques L. Pianelli K. Schaumlöffel D. Lebrun M. Lobinski R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This response implies the existence of membrane transporters for NA-chelated Ni(II), that are most likely represented by YS1 and YSL homologs. Future experiments should therefore focus on the membrane localization of YS1 and YSL proteins in graminaceous and dicotyledonous plants as well as on overexpression of YS1 and YSL genes, which might become an important foundation for future phytoremediation strategies. We thank Catherine Curie for providing the ZmYS1 cDNA clone, Günther Winkelmann for providing the fet3 fet4 mutant, Dominique Loqué, Maria Ruckwied, and Nadine Drews for excellent technical assistance, and Toru Fujiwara, Junpei Takano, Wolfgang Schmidt, and Mike Merrick for critically reading the manuscript."

Immunol. 1999; 29: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) Fc residues believed to be important in mediating pH-dependent binding. The results of the mutagenesis studies are consistent with the interpretation of a crystallographic study of the Fc·FcRn interaction (18Martin W.L. West Jr., A.P. Gan L. Bjorkman P.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 867-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In the current study, molecular modeling was used to identify residues in the human IgG Fc near the FcRn binding site that, when mutated, might alter binding to FcRn without affecting the pH dependence of this interaction. Following exhaustive mutagenesis at these positions, several IgG2 mutants were identified with improved binding to FcRn at pH 6.0 that retained the property of pH-dependent release. A pharmacokinetics study in rhesus monkeys showed that two mutant IgG2 antibodies with increased FcRn binding affinity had considerably longer serum half-lives than the wild-type antibody.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Modeling—Molecular models of the human Fc·FcRn complex were generated based on the crystal structures (18Martin W.L.

Biol. 1998; 282: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) of the rat Fc·FcRn complex. First, the rat β2m and FcRn α chains of the complex were replaced, respectively, with the human β2m (21Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 277-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) and FcRn α chains (22West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9698-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Next, the rat Fc residues of the complex were replaced with the corresponding human IgG1 Fc residues (23Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar), and then energy minimization calculations were done using SEGMOD and ENCAD (24Levitt M. J. Mol.

The process was repeated to produce a model of the complex of human FcRn and the M3 variant of human IgG2 (IgG2M3) (26Cole M.S. Anasetti C. Tso J.Y. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3613-3621PubMed Google Scholar).IgG Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification—The light and heavy chain cDNAs from a trioma cell line expressing the human anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody OST577 (27Ehrlich P.H. Moustafa Z.A. Justice J.C. Harfeldt K.E. Kelley R.L. Ostberg L. Hum. Antibodies Hybridomas. 1992; 3: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were cloned by PCR. The light and heavy chain V-genes were converted by PCR into mini-exons and subcloned, respectively, into pVλ2, a derivative of pVk (28Co M.S. Avdalovic N.M. Caron P.C. Avdalovic M.V. Scheinberg D.A.

Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar) was used to generate random amino acid substitutions at positions 250, 314, or 428 (numbered according to the EU index (23Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed.

The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into pVAg2M3-OST577, a derivative of the M3 variant of pVg2.D.Tt containing the pUC18 replication origin (30Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11425) Google Scholar).Human kidney cell line 293-H (Invitrogen) was transiently cotransfected with the antibody expression plasmids using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Culture supernatants were concentrated and buffer exchanged into PBS, pH 6.0, with Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). Mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was stably cotransfected by electroporation. OST577-IgG2M3 antibodies were purified from culture supernatants by protein A column chromatography. For in vivo studies, the protein A eluate was further purified by size exclusion chromatography.FcRn Cloning and Surface Expression—Human β2m and FcRn α chain cDNAs were cloned by PCR from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and subcloned into pDL172, a derivative of pVk containing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage signal from human decay-accelerating factor (31Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rhee L. Weddell G. Martin Jr., D.W. Nussenzweig V. Nature. 1987; 325: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) fused to the FcRn α chain, resulting in pDL208. Mouse myeloma cell line NS0 (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK) was stably transfected with pDL208 by electroporation, yielding cell line NS0-HuFcRn.Competitive Binding Assays—Transiently expressed IgG2M3 wild-type and mutant antibodies were tested for binding to human FcRn in a single-point competitive binding assay. Briefly, 2 × 105 NS0-HuFcRn cells/test were washed with FACS binding buffer (FBB) (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3), pH 8.0, and then with FBB, pH 6.0, and resuspended in 120 μl of biotinylated OST577-IgG2M3 (8.3 μg/ml) and concentrated supernatant (containing 8.3 μg/ml of competitor antibody) in FBB, pH 6.0. After 1 h on ice, the cells were washed with FBB, pH 6.0, and resuspended in 25 μl of 2.5 μg/ml streptavidin-conjugated R-PE (BioSource, Camarillo, CA) in FBB, pH 6.0. After 30 min on ice, the cells were washed with FBB, pH 6.0, resuspended in 1% formaldehyde in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Purified IgG2M3 wild-type and mutant antibodies were further tested in a competitive binding assay using purified competitor antibody (2-fold serial dilutions from 208 to 0.102 μg/ml) as described above. IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism, version 3.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).Rhesus Pharmacokinetics Study—A non-GLP (“good laboratory practice”) pharmacokinetics (PK) study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted at the California National Primate Research Center (University of California, Davis). Twelve male rhesus macaques were randomized by weight and assigned to one of three study groups. Each animal received a single intravenous dose of wild-type or one of two mutants of OST577-IgG2M3 at 1 mg/kg by infusion over a span of 15 min. Blood samples were drawn prior to dosing on day 0, at 1 and 4 h after dosing, and at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 days. The concentrations of the OST577-IgG2M3 wild-type and mutant antibodies in rhesus serum samples were determined using a qualified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Appropriately diluted serum samples and calibrators were captured with a mouse anti-OST577-IgG1 idiotype monoclonal antibody (OST577-γ1 anti-id; Protein Design Labs, Inc.) and detected with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-human λ light chain antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). The serum antibody concentration data were fitted with a two-compartment model using WinNonlin Enterprise Edition, version 3.2 (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of IgG Mutants with Altered Binding to FcRn—Molecular models of the human Fc·FcRn complex (Fig. 1) guided the selection of positions 250, 314, and 428 of the human IgG heavy chain for mutagenesis. Although the wild-type amino acids at these positions are located near the Fc·FcRn interface, it does not appear likely that they directly contribute to the pH-dependent interaction between Fc and FcRn. Inspection of the molecular models suggested that amino acid substitutions at these positions might increase or decrease the affinity of Fc for FcRn, without disrupting pH-dependent binding and release, by affecting the conformation of Fc amino acids that do interact with FcRn. Since the amino acids at and around these positions are conserved among all four human IgG subtypes (23Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar), it is reasonable to expect that the FcRn binding phenotype resulting from an amino acid substitution in one IgG subtype could be transferred to the other three IgG subtypes. In this study, an IgG2M3 form (26Cole M.S. Anasetti C. Tso J.Y. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3613-3621PubMed Google Scholar) of the human anti-HBV monoclonal antibody OST577 (27Ehrlich P.H. Moustafa Z.A. Justice J.C. Harfeldt K.E. Kelley R.L. Ostberg L. Hum. Antibodies Hybridomas. 1992; 3: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was chosen for mutagenesis because it would not be expected to bind either to antigen or Fcγ receptors in HBV-free primates.PCR mutagenesis was used to generate all 19 single amino acid substitutions at each position. Transiently expressed OST577-IgG2M3 mutants were screened for binding to NS0-HuFcRn cells in a single-point competitive binding assay (Fig. 2). Several of the mutants at positions 250 (e.g. Glu and Gln) (Fig. 2A) and 428 (e.g. Phe and Leu) (Fig. 2C) appeared to be stronger competitors in this assay than the wild-type antibody, indicating that these mutants have increased binding to FcRn at pH 6.0. At position 250, it appears that the presence of a hydrogen bond acceptor in the appropriate geometry (e.g. Glu or Gln) is important for better FcRn binding, since smaller but chemically related residues (e.g. Asp or Asn) reduced binding to FcRn. At position 428, a large hydrophobic amino acid confers better FcRn binding. None of the mutations at position 314 (Fig. 2B) resulted in increased binding to FcRn.Fig. 2Single-point competitive binding assay of OST577-IgG2M3 wild-type and mutant antibodies to human FcRn. The binding of biotinylated OST577-IgG2M3 antibody to NS0-HuFcRn cells in the presence of wild-type or mutant OST577-IgG2M3 competitor antibodies in FBB, pH 6.0, was detected with streptavidin-conjugated R-PE and analyzed by flow cytometry. The mean channel fluorescence and standard deviation of replicate samples are shown for wild-type OST577-IgG2M3 (far left bar in each panel) compared with all 19 mutants at positions 250 (A), 314 (B), or 428 (C). The data in each panel are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In a previous study (13Dall'Acqua W.F. Woods R.M. Ward E.S. Palaszynski S.R. Patel N.K. Brewah Y.A. Wu H. Kiener P.A. Langermann S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5171-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), human IgG1 Fc position 428 was randomly mutated, and mutants were screened for binding to mouse FcRn by phage display; however, no mutants at this position with increased binding to mouse FcRn were obtained. This could be because of biases in the construction of the library, the loss of certain sequences during propagation in Escherichia coli, or incomplete sampling of the library during screening. Another explanation is that mouse rather than human FcRn was used to pan the human IgG1 Fc mutant library in the previous study (13Dall'Acqua W.F. Woods R.M. Ward E.S. Palaszynski S.R. Patel N.K. Brewah Y.A. Wu H. Kiener P.A. Langermann S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5171-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Because the amino acids at and around position 428 are not conserved between the mouse and human Fc regions, it follows that an Fc mutant at position 428 may interact differently with mouse and human FcRn.The best competitors among the mutants at positions 250 and 428 were stably expressed either alone (T250Q, M428L) or in combination (T250Q/M428L), and purified antibodies were compared in a competitive binding assay to human FcRn (Fig. 3). Comparison of the IC50 values indicated that the single mutants T250Q and M428L showed an increase in binding to human FcRn at pH 6.0 of ∼3- and 7-fold, respectively, whereas the double mutant T250Q/M428L showed an increase in binding of ∼28-fold. To confirm that binding was pH-dependent, the antibodies were allowed to bind to NS0-HuFcRn cells at pH 6.0 and were removed by washing the cells at pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, or 8.0. As the pH value of the washes in successive samples was raised from pH 6.0 to 8.0, the binding of the wild-type and mutant antibodies to human FcRn was comparably diminished, with essentially no binding observed at pH 7.5 or above (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when these mutant antibodies were tested for binding to rhesus FcRn. The binding of the T250Q, M428L, and T250Q/M428L IgG2M3 mutants to rhesus FcRn at pH 6.0 was ∼4-, 8-, and 27-fold better than the wild-type antibody, respectively, and binding to rhesus FcRn was pH-dependent (data not shown).Fig. 3Competitive binding assay of OST577-IgG2M3 wild-type and mutant antibodies to human FcRn. The binding of biotinylated OST577-IgG2M3 antibody to NS0-HuFcRn cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of purified OST577-IgG2M3 wild-type (•), T250Q (▿), M428L (□), or T250Q/M428L (□) competitor antibodies in FBB, pH 6.0, was detected with streptavidin-conjugated R-PE and analyzed by flow cytometry. The mean channel fluorescence was plotted against the competitor concentration (μg/ml) for each antibody. The data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pharmacokinetics of IgG Wild-type and Mutant Antibodies in Rhesus Monkeys—The PK behavior of the OST577-IgG2M3 wild-type, M428L, and T250Q/M428L antibodies was examined in rhesus monkeys. The PK profiles of the two mutants are clearly distinct from that of the wild-type (Fig. 4). The mean serum antibody concentrations of the M428L and T250Q/M428L mutants were maintained at higher levels than wild-type OST577-IgG2M3 at all time points. Because the mean maximum serum antibody concentration (Cmax, Table I) was very similar among the three test groups, indicating that the administered antibodies were distributed to the circulation in a similar manner, the higher concentrations of the mutant IgG2M3 antibodies thereafter are attributable to their increased persistence in the serum. Analysis of the mean clearance (CL) indicated that this was the case. The mean CL, the volume of serum antibody cleared per unit of time, was ∼1.8-fold lower for the M428L mutant (0.0811 ± 0.0384 ml/h/kg; p = 0.057), and ∼2.8-fold lower for the T250Q/M428L mutant (0.0514 ± 0.0075 ml/h/kg; p = 0.029) compared with wild-type OST577-IgG2M3 (0.144 ± 0.047 ml/h/kg) (Table I), indicating a significant decrease in the clearance of the OST577-IgG2M3 M428L and T250Q/M428L mutants.Fig. 4Pharmacokinetics of OST577-IgG2M3 wild-type, M428L, and T250Q/M428L antibodies in rhesus monkeys. The modeled data (simulated based on each group's geometric mean of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters) as well as the observed mean serum antibody concentration (μg/ml) and the standard deviation for each group of four animals were plotted as a function of time (days after infusion) for the OST577-IgG2M3 wild-type (•), M428L (▵), or T250Q/M428L (□) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISummary of pharmacokinetic parameters Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNonlin (Pharsight).

Since the area under the curve (AUC) is inversely proportional to CL, it follows that the mean AUC, the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated from time zero to infinity, was ∼2.0-fold higher for the M428L mutant (15,200 ± 8,700 h·μg/ml; p = 0.057) and ∼2.6-fold higher for the T250Q/M428L mutant (19,800 ± 2,900 h·μg/ml; p = 0.029) compared with wild-type OST577-IgG2M3 (7,710 ± 3,110 h·μg/ml) (Table I), indicating a significant increase in the total exposure of the OST577-IgG2M3 M428L and T250Q/M428L mutants.Finally, the mean elimination (β-phase) half-life (t½) was ∼1.8-fold longer for the M428L mutant (642 ± 205 h) and ∼1.9-fold longer for the T250Q/M428L mutant (652 ± 28 h; p = 0.029) compared with wild-type OST577-IgG2M3 (351 ± 121 h) (Table I). The elimination half-life for wild-type OST577-IgG2M3 in this study is similar to that for OST577-IgG1 (324 ± 85 h) in a previous PK study in rhesus monkeys (27Ehrlich P.H. Moustafa Z.A. Justice J.C. Harfeldt K.E. Kelley R.L. Ostberg L. Hum. Antibodies Hybridomas. 1992; 3: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Although there is an indication from the CL and AUC parameters that the T250Q/M428L mutant may have increased serum persistence compared with the M428L mutant, this difference may not be significant. Since the elimination half-lives of the two mutants appear similar, it is possible that a maximal increase in serum persistence has been achieved in rhesus monkeys with these mutants. The T250Q mutant, which showed a modest increase in binding to rhesus and human FcRn, may be expected to show an intermediate increase in serum half-life in primates.While the M428L and T250Q/M428L amino acid substitutions are presumed to account for the observed increase in the elimination half-lives of the IgG2M3 antibodies, it is possible that post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation, Met oxidation) might affect their PK properties. However, it is unlikely that glycosylation differences would account for the observed half-life differences because previous studies have indicated that glycosylated and aglycosylated IgG antibodies have similar half-lives in mice (32Tao M.H. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar) and chimpanzees (33Simmons L.C. Reilly D. Klimowski L. Raju T.S. Meng G. Sims P. Hong K. Shields R.L. Damico L.A. Rancatore P. Yansura D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 263: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Moreover, carbohydrate analysis of the OST577-IgG2M3 wild-type and mutant antibodies revealed only minor differences in their glycosylation patterns (data not shown).Engineered antibodies with increased serum half-lives might prove valuable in antibody therapy. For example, it may be possible to reduce the frequency of administration of such antibodies. This will be a great benefit to patients undergoing long-term antibody therapy. Based on the results described in this study, it is reasonable to expect that human IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 antibodies with longer serum half-lives also may be engineered by transferring the M428L or T250Q/M428L mutations into these IgG subtypes. In addition, it should now also be possible to alter the serum half-lives of other IgG-related therapeutics such as IgG Fc fusion proteins using this approach. Provided that the mutations described in this study do not substantially increase the immunogenicity of these therapeutics in humans, IgG antibodies and Fc fusion proteins with longer serum half-lives should represent a potent new class of human therapeutics. Antibody therapy is coming of age, with 15 monoclonal antibodies approved for therapeutic use in the United States and many others currently undergoing clinical trials (1Waldmann T.A. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The advent of antibody engineering over the past two decades has contributed to the recent clinical success of therapeutic antibodies. The development of chimeric (2Morrison S.L. Johnson M.J.

Nature. 1986; 321: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) antibodies not only reduced the potent immunogenicity of rodent antibodies in humans but also improved the serum half-lives and efficacy of such therapeutics compared with rodent antibodies. Phage display (4Hoogenboom H.R. Chames P. Immunol.

First, cleavage by α- or β-secretases releases the large extracellular part of APP (called APPS) leaving the CTF (C-terminal fragment), which is composed of a small remaining extracellular stub, the TMR, and the cytoplasmic tail to remain. The CTF of APP is then cut by γ-secretase at multiple positions in the TMR (see Refs. 8Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C.

In addition, γ-cleavage generates small peptides that are derived from the TMR and adjacent extracellular sequences. These peptides include Aβ40 and -42, the major components of amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer disease (14Lu D.C. Rabizadek S. Chandra S. Pietrzik C.U. Koo E.H. Nat.

Minopoli G. Zambrano N. Russo T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation by the AICD, as measured using heterologous DNA binding domains that are fused to APP, requires binding of Fe65 to the AICD (12Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Fe65 contains three conserved domains that are necessary for transcriptional activation, an N-terminal WW domain whose ligand is unknown, a central phosphotyrosine binding domain that binds to the nuclear chromosome remodeling protein Tip60, and a second C-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain that mediates the interaction of Fe65 with the AICD (12Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The potent transactivation of transcription by the AICD-Fe65 complex via binding to Tip60 suggests a model whereby the cytoplasmic tail of APP, liberated by the γ-cleavage, translocates to the nucleus as a complex with Fe65 and binds to nuclear Tip60 to transactivate transcription. Although the endogenous DNA binding domains (beyond those associated with Tip60 (20Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Natatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar)) have not been identified, this model is supported by three findings. First, the cytoplasmic tail of APP is detectable in the nucleus of cultured cells, albeit at low levels (10Kimberly W.T. Zheng J.B. Guenette S.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40288-40292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 11Cupers P. Orlans I. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1168-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Second, unmodified APP together with Fe65 is a potent transactivator of Gal4 fused to Tip60, which is inactive in transcription without Fe65 and APP (12Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Third, a direct target gene (the KAI1 gene encoding a tetraspanin) for the AICD-Fe65-Tip60 complex was identified in a study on how interleukin-1β activates transcription (21Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), thereby demonstrating the in vivo relevance of the original experiments using heterologous DNA binding domains.APP belongs to a gene family that includes two additional members, APLP1 and APLP2 (22Wasco W.

Schrader S.K. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). APP, APLP1, and APLP2 are closely related and exhibit the same domain structure (see Fig. 1A). Knock-out mice revealed that APP, APLP1, and APLP2 are functionally redundant (25Heber S. Herms J. Gajic V. Hainfellner J. Aguzzi A. Rulicke T. von Kretzschmar H. von Koch C. Sisodia S. Tremml P. Lipp H.P. Wolfer D.P. Müller U. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7951-7963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to APP, APLPs appear to be cleaved by extracellular proteases followed by proteolytic processing by γ-secretase (26Naruse S. Thinkaran G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Qian X.

Kimberly W.T. Wasco W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6664-6673Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gal4 fusion proteins of APLPs also transactivate Gal4-dependent transcription in an Fe65-dependent manner (27Scheinfeld M.H. Ghersi E. Laky K. Fowlkes B.J. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44195-44201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Walsh D.M. Fadeeva J.V. LaVoie M.J. Paliga K. Eggert S. Kimberly W.T. Wasco W. Selkoe D.J.

These observations suggest that APLPs may be proteolytically processed by mechanisms similar to APP and may have similar functions. However, not all evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. It is noticeable that although the extracellular domains and the AICDs of APP and APLPs are highly homologous, the linker sequences connecting these domains exhibit no homology (Fig. 1B). Because this linker sequence in APP is the substrate for α- and β-secretases, it is unclear whether the same extracellular proteases digest APP and APLPs. This is a particularly important question for BACE 1, the primary β-secretase (29Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashier J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E.

Psychiatry. 1999; 4: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This question is not only important for understanding BACE 1 function but also for insight into the biological role of APP and APLPs, because a common cleavage of these proteins by BACE 1 would support the notion that proteolytic processing of these proteins by a common set of enzymes serves to regulate a physiological function such as transcriptional activation.In the present study, we have investigated whether APLPs can be substrates for BACE 1 even though APLPs exhibit no sequence homology to the BACE 1 cleavage site in APP and whether BACE 1 cleavage has an effect on the putative transcriptional activation function of APP and APLPs. Our data demonstrate that BACE 1 alters proteolytic processing of APLPs in transfected cells, suggesting that APLPs are substrates for BACE 1 in vivo. We demonstrate that APLP1 is cut by BACE 1 at a position that is within 13 residues of the TMR resulting in the secretion of essentially the entire extracellular sequences of APLP1. In the same assay, ADAM 9 (which is one of several candidate α-secretases for APP (34Weskamp G. Kratzschmar J. Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 35Hotoda N. Koike H. Sasagawa N. Ishiura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)) specifically cleaved APP but not APLP1. Furthermore, we show that BACE 1 substrate recognition is specific because other cell surface proteins are not cleaved in the same assay and that a short sequence from APP (seven residues) is sufficient to confer BACE 1 cleavage onto a normally non-cleaved protein. These results indicate that BACE 1 may have a coordinate function in regulating APP and APLP processing in neurons.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Most of the plasmids used for the transactivation assays, such as pG5E1B-luc (Gal4 reporter plasmid), pCMV-LacZ (β-galactosidase control plasmid), pM-Tip60 (expression of Gal4-Tip60 fusion protein), pCMV-Fe65, and pCMV-APP, were reported previously (12Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1-APLP2 encoding APLP2 was constructed by inserting a 3.0-kb DNA fragment from pOTB7-hAPLP2 (Image clone ID 2820109) into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1. pCMV-Sport6-APLP1 encoding APLP1 was acquired from ATCC (Image clone ID 3865417). pCMV-SynCAM and pCMV-Nrx1β were described previously (36Biederer T.

The mismatch will be randomly repaired after transformation in the E. coli cells. Half of the constructs contained the wild-type APP sequence, and the other half contained the Swedish mutation as confirmed by sequencing. pCMV-NrxAPP was constructed by ligating a 0.6-kb fragment encoding residues 494-695 of APP695 into the NotI site of pCMV-Nrx1β. pcDNA3.1-ADAM9 encoding ADAM 9 and pcDNA3.1-Myc-BACE (BACE) were kindly provided by Dr. C. Blobel and Dr. G. Yu, respectively.Antibodies—APP, APLP1, and APLP2 antibodies were raised in rabbits as described (12Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) to synthetic peptides containing their C-terminal sequences (APPc: U955, GYENPTYKFFEQMQN; APLP1c: U2976, YENPTYRFLEERP; APLP2c: U2977, NKMQNHGYENPTYKYLEQMQI) and to an interior peptide from APLP1 (APLP1x, U4787; residues 554-567, VPRGEPFHSSEIQR). Monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular domain of APP (5A3 and 1G7 (38Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, HEK293, HeLa, and COS7 cells were transfected at 50-80% confluency in 6-well plates using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). For Gal4-Tip60 transactivation assays, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with five plasmids: 1) pG5E1B-luc, 0.15 μg, 2) pCMV-LacZ, 0.10 μg, 3) pM-Tip60, 0.5 μg, 4) pCMV-FE65, 0.5 μg, and 5) 0.05-1.0 μg of pCMV-APP, 0.025-0.5 μg of pCMV-Sport6-APLP1, or 0.05-1.0 μg of pcDNA3.1-APLP2 as indicated. For the Fe65 titration experiment, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with five plasmids: 1) pG5E1B-luc, 0.15 μg, 2) pCMV-LacZ, 0.10 μg, 3) pM-Tip60, 0.5 μg, 4) 0.5 μg of APP, 0.25 μg of APLP1, or 0.5 μg of APLP2, and 5) 0-2.0 μg of pCMV-Fe65. γ-Secretase inhibition experiments were performed essentially the same way except that 1.0 μg of pCMV-FE65 and 0.5 μg of APP, APLP1, or APLP2 were used to achieve optimal transactivation for all three proteins. DAPT was added at 2 and 10 μm 1 h after transfection. For Gal4-Tip60 transactivation assays and the Fe65 titration experiment, cells were harvested 2 days after transfection in 0.25 ml/well reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and their luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined with the Promega luciferase assay kit using a chemiluminescence reader from Berthold and with the O-nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside assay for β-galactosidase, respectively (12Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was standardized by the β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiency and was normalized further with the transactivation level with cells expressing no APPs or Fe65. Values shown on the y axis are averages of transactivation assays performed in triplicates. For immunoblotting analyses, HEK293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of expression plasmids encoding APP, APLP1, APLP2, SynCAM, or neurexin 1β, with or without 0.25 μg of BACE 1 expression vector. For APLP1 cleavage experiments, 1 μg of APLP1 or APP was co-transfected with BACE (0.25 and 0.5 μg) or ADAM 9 (0.5 and 1.0 μg) in HEK293, HeLa, and COS cells. The cell extracts or media were harvested 24 h after the transfection. Where indicated (Figs. 4 and 6), γ-secretase inhibitor IX (DAPT, Calbiochem) was added (2 μm final concentration) 6 h before harvesting the cells.Fig. 4Cleavage of APP, APLP1, and APLP2 by BACE 1. HEK293 cells were transfected with control DNA (lane 1), BACE 1 vector (lane 2), vectors expressing either APP, APLP1, APLP2, Nrx1β, or SynCAM (lanes 3 and 5), or these same vectors together with the BACE 1 expression vector (lanes 4 and 6). Transfected cells were incubated in the absence (lanes 1-4) or presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (2 mm; lanes 5 and 6). Transfected proteins (indicated on the right) were examined by immunoblotting (20 μg of cell protein/lane) using regular SDS-PAGE (top panel for each protein) to monitor the full-length proteins (FL), or by Tricine gel electrophoresis to detect their CTFs (bottom panel for each protein). All transfected proteins are type I transmembrane proteins, and all immunoblotting was carried out with antibodies to the cytoplasmic C termini of the proteins. Non-transfected cells and cells transfected only with BACE 1 (lanes 1 and 2) were used as controls to ensure that the various antibodies did not recognize an endogenous or BACE 1-dependent signal. Asterisks in lane 4 for APP, APLP1, and APLP2 indicate BACE 1-dependent CTFs. Numbers on the left display positions of molecular weight markers.

A, diagrams of the structures of APP, the neurexin 1β/APP hybrid protein (Nrxβ/APP), and the modified neurexin 1β (Nrx1β*). Nrx1β*Sw contains a seven-residue insertion from the Swedish mutant of APP (sequence EVNLDAE), whereas Nrx1β*Wt contains the corresponding insertion from wild-type APP (sequence EVKMDAE). Insertions were placed into neurexin 1β just N-terminal to the TMR. In the neurexin 1β/APP hybrid protein, the nearly complete extracellular sequence of neurexin 1β (residues 1-375) is fused to APP such that only a short sequence of the extracellular linker from APP followed by the TMR and AICD from APP are included (residues 494-695 of APP695). B, comparison of the effect of BACE 1 and DAPT on CTFs produced in HEK293 control cells (lanes 1 and 2) or transfected cells expressing APP (lanes 3-6) or the neurexin 1β/APP hybrid (lanes 7-10). Cells transfected and treated as indicated (see also legend to Fig. 4) were examined by immunoblotting with antibodies to the C terminus of APP after standard gel electrophoresis (top panel) or Tricine gel electrophoresis (bottom panel). C, same as in B, except that the effect of BACE 1 on the cleavage of neurexin 1β and neurexin 1β* was examined. Note that under the conditions of the experiment, BACE 1 induces a large decrease in the steady-state levels of full-length neurexin 1β* but not of normal neurexin 1β, suggesting that neurexin 1β* is cleaved quantitatively. In B and C, numbers on the left indicate positions of molecular weight markers, and the BACE 1-dependent CTFs are identified by asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—These experiments were performed using standard procedures with either regular SDS or Tricine gels (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar, 42Schaegger H. von Jagow G.

The Gal4-Tip60 assay is a more stringent test for the transcriptional function of APP than the use of APP-Gal4 fusion proteins, because in the Gal4-Tip60 assay APP is not modified. To determine whether APLP1 and -2, which were shown previously as Gal4-fusion proteins to transactivate transcription in an Fe65-dependent manner (27Scheinfeld M.H. Ghersi E. Laky K. Fowlkes B.J.

We then measured Gal4-dependent transactivation using a co-transfected reporter plasmid and corrected all transactivation data for β-galactosidase activity produced by a co-transfected control expression vector to account for differences in transfection efficiency (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Transactivation of Gal4-Tip60-dependent transcription by Fe65 and APP, APLP1, or APLP2.

https://openalex.org/W1999703591,"Wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) is a severe IgE-mediated allergic reaction provoked by the combination of wheat-ingestion with intensive physical exercise over the next few hours. Among wheat proteins, ω-5 gliadin, which is one of the components of fast ω-gliadin, has been reported as a major allergen in the anaphylaxis. In this study, we detected IgE-binding epitopes within the primary sequence of ω-5 gliadin using arrays of overlapping peptides synthesized on derivatized cellulose membranes. Sera from four patients with WDEIA having specific IgE to the fast ω-gliadin were used to probe the membrane. Seven epitopes, QQIPQQQ, QQLPQQQ, QQFPQQQ, QQSPEQQ, QQSPQQQ, QQYPQQQ, and PYPP, were detected within the primary sequence of ω-5 gliadin. By using sera of 15 patients, 4 of them, QQIPQQQ, QQFPQQQ, QQSPEQQ, and QQSPQQQ, were found to be dominant epitopes. Mutational analysis of the QQIPQQQ and QQFPQQQ indicated that amino acids at positions Gln1, Pro4, Gln5, Gln6, and Gln7 were critical for IgE binding. These results will provide a useful tool for developing safer wheat products in addition to diagnostic and immunotherapy techniques for WDEIA.

Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a distinct form of food allergy induced by physical exercise (1Kidd J.M. Cohen S.H. Sosman A.J. Fink J.N. J. Allergy Clin.

Med. 1986; 4: 195-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) are responsible for the development of food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. However, of all of the various kinds of food, wheat is reported to be the allergen with the highest frequency in Japan (7Dohi M. Suko M. Sugiyama H. Yamashita N. Tadokoro K. Juji F. Okudaira H. Sano Y. Ito K. Miyamoto T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 34-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Symptoms are typically generalized urticaria and severe allergic reactions such as shock or hypotension. Because of this serious reaction, it is important to determine the causative food to avoid the allergic reaction. A challenge test consisting of ingestion of the assumed food followed by intense physical exercise is the only reliable method to determine the causative food and to diagnose the disease. However, the challenge test is not always safe because in some cases the test induces an anaphylactic shock. In addition, the most reliable treatment for this disease is to avoid taking the causative food or, alternatively, to take a rest after meals. However, in the case of wheat allergy, elimination causes a decline in the quality of life for the patients. Thus, an in vitro diagnostic method as well as hypoallergenic wheat is necessary for patients with wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). 1The abbreviations used are: WDEIA, wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis; LMW, low molecular weight; HMW, high molecular weight; TBST, 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20, pH 7.4; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; RAST, radioallergosorbent test. 1The abbreviations used are: WDEIA, wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis; LMW, low molecular weight; HMW, high molecular weight; TBST, 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20, pH 7.4; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; RAST, radioallergosorbent test.

In this study, we analyzed the linear IgE-binding epitopes of ω-5 gliadin by using synthetic peptides. Subjects—Sera were collected from 15 patients with WDEIA who had recurrent episodes of anaphylaxis and a positive-provocation test to exercise after wheat ingestion, 15 healthy subjects without episodes of food allergy and 6 patients with atopic dermatitis without episodes of WDEIA. The sera were stored at –80 °C until use. Specific IgE antibodies for gluten in the sera were determined by the radioallergosorbent test system (CAP-RAST, Amersham Biosciences) (29Sigurs N. Hattevig G. Kjellman B. Kjellman N.I. Nilsson L. Bjorksten B. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 94: 757-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Dot-blotting—Wheat α-gliadin, β-gliadin, γ-gliadin, fast ω-gliadin, slow ω-gliadin, high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin, and LMW glutenin were prepared as described previously (16Sandiford C.P. Tatham A.S. Fido R. Welch J.A. Jones M.G. Tee R.D. Shewry P.R. Newman Taylor A.J. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1997; 27: 1120-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30Tatham A.S. Shewry P.R. J.

Specific IgE antibodies in the sera for α-gliadin, β-gliadin, γ-gliadin, fast ω-gliadin, slow ω-gliadin, HMW glutenin, and LMW glutenin were detected using a method described previously with a slight modification (20Morita E.

Sci. 2003; 33: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 2 μg of each gliadin, glutenin, and gluten (NAKARAI TESQUE, Kyoto, Japan) were spotted on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore) and blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST. The membrane was washed three times with TBST for 10 min and then incubated with 10% of the patient's serum overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-human IgE horseradish peroxidase-conjugate (BIOSOURCE) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times with TBST for 10 min, and the IgE antibodies reacting to the wheat proteins were visualized using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting light was detected on autoradiography film (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham Biosciences). After scanning the film, the spot intensities were measured using the Gel-Pro Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Inc). Peptide Synthesis and IgE-binding Assay—Four DNA sequences of ω-5 gliadin fragments (GenBank™ accession numbers BE590673, BQ608902, BQ805830, and BQ245835) were selected from the wheat-expressed sequence tags data base. These sequences were aligned, and the assumed amino acid sequence of ω-5 gliadin was constructed (Fig. 1). Based on the assumed amino acid sequence of the ω-5 gliadin, the individual peptides were synthesized on a membrane using a SPOTs kit (Sigma), which contains a derivatized cellulose membrane (SPOTs membrane). Fmoc amino acids, by coupling Fmoc amino acids according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing with methanol, the SPOTs membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer (Sigma). The membrane was washed with TBST for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10% patient's serum. The bound IgE antibodies were detected as described above with goat anti-human IgE horseradish peroxidase conjugate by using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents. The SPOTs membrane was used repeatedly after the following procedure. The membrane was washed in order with water, N,N-dimethylformamide (WAKO Chemical, Osaka, Japan), Regeneration buffer A (8 m urea, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate), and Regeneration buffer B (10% (v/v) acetic acid, 50% (v/v) ethanol), rinsed with methanol twice for 10 min at room temperature, and dried. Dot-blotting for Purified Gliadins and Glutenins—Specific IgE reacting with the purified gliadins and glutenins in the sera of 15 patients with WDEIA and 21 control subjects were determined by dot-blotting. Table I shows the serum IgE levels, the CAP-RAST value for gluten, and the result of the dot-blotting analysis. In the data of CAP-RAST for gluten, sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of WDEIA were 80 (12/15) and 90% (19/21), respectively, when the cutoff value for a positive result was set at 0.35 units of allergen-specific IgE per ml. In the data of dot-blotting for gluten, when a cutoff value was set at 100 based on the data of control subjects, sensitivity and specificity were 60 (9/15) and 85% (18/21), respectively, both of which were worse than those of CAP-RAST for gluten. Additionally, the values of spot intensity for gluten were also not always parallel to that of CAP-RAST. This may be attributed to the unstable technique of dot-blotting.Table IResults of dot blot analysisTotal IgEGluten RASTSpot intensityαβγFωSωHMWLMWGlutenIU/mlUa/mlWDEIA patients 1146<0.3511013326847 22281.3299536053125111238 321.90.510012169922 417795.3463961767715861541724 544.51.55500696339161290 61761.22200911137846166 71842.3510471243655 8169<0.350001818341428 91361.33104230823611119 103973.83438233226681147 11aPatient with atopic dermatitis.14,7233.3346011706469817612271831331 1243414.06111345524719158 13150<0.35331126717114438 141041.790001535043839 151711.543114140203736Non-WDEIA controls 1657<0.352006130234 17110<0.3551362009382 18100<0.351832241033 19500<0.3581551912298 2031<0.35000210153 211600<0.351710163972327142 227.2<0.35012115017184 2326<0.35235112472972 249.8<0.3518127781741794 25290<0.354177232285133 2641<0.3571491448396853 27310<0.3500072417116 28310<0.35310343610823 2947<0.35000837883 3021<0.35154458218915818961 31aPatient with atopic dermatitis.16,1001.64102033816177113 32aPatient with atopic dermatitis.10,9900.8102316576100126 33aPatient with atopic dermatitis.656<0.3504210213021124 34aPatient with atopic dermatitis.1900<0.35976461236292104 35aPatient with atopic dermatitis.580<0.351301047132541 36aPatient with atopic dermatitis.370<0.3523352911638a Patient with atopic dermatitis. Open table in a new tab Among the individual data of spot intensity for purified wheat proteins, the strongest reaction was observed with the fast ω-gliadin in 12 of 15 patients with WDEIA (patients 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 15), confirming the data reported by Palosuo et al. (26Palosuo K. Alenius H. Varjonen E. Koivuluhta M. Mikkola J. Keskinen H. Kalkkinen N. Reunala T. J. Allergy Clin.

The remaining three patients (patients 4, 11, and 13) had specific IgE reacting predominantly to HMW glutenin. In contrast, the strongest reaction was observed with slow ω-gliadin in 10 of 21 control subjects and LMW glutenin was the second (6 of 21 patients). In 4 of 21 control subjects, the strongest reaction was also observed with fast ω-gliadin as in the patients with WDEIA; however, the values of spot intensities were relatively low compared with those of patients with WDEIA. Multiple IgE-binding Epitopes in the ω-5 Gliadin—Because no cDNA and genomic DNA sequence of ω-5-type gliadins has been reported, we collected four DNA fragment sequences of ω-5 type gliadins from the wheat-expressed sequence tags data base based on the N-terminal and internal protein sequences (23DuPont F.M. Vensel W.H. Chan R. Kasarda D.D. Cereal Chem. 2000; 77: 607-614Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Seilmeier W. Valdez I. Mendez E. Wieser H. Eur. Food Res. Technol. 2001; 212: 355-363Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We then aligned these sequences and constructed an assumed amino acid sequence of ω-5 gliadin (Fig. 1). The molecular mass of the assumed ω-5 gliadin was calculated at 48-kDa, suggesting that it was almost full-length because the determination of molecular mass by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight revealed a range of 44–55 kDa for the ω-5-type gliadins (24Seilmeier W. Valdez I. Mendez E. Wieser H. Eur. Food Res. Technol. 2001; 212: 355-363Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 66 overlapping peptides were synthesized by the SPOTs method to determine which regions of the assumed ω-5 gliadin were recognized by the serum IgE of the patients with WDEIA. Each peptide was 13 amino acids long and offset by six amino acids. Individual sera from four patients (patients 1, 2, 3, and 5) whose serum had specific IgE to fast ω-gliadin predominantly were selected and used to map the IgE-binding region in the assumed amino acid sequence of ω-5 gliadin. Fig. 2 summarizes the IgE-binding peptides of each of the four patients. Many IgE-binding peptides were detected; however, most of these positive sequences were overlapped among the tested patients. From the results of the alignment of the IgE-bound peptide sequences, we expected that common epitope sequences are QQIPQQQ (peptides 10, 26, and 43), QQFPQQQ (peptides 5, 8, 21, 32, 36, 37, 39, 40, 45, 46, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 58, and 60), and QQLPQQQ (peptides 13, 18, 23, 24, 28, 34, 41, and 50). Peptides 38, 57, and 64 also reacted to the sera commonly in four patients, respectively. The sera of patient 3 reacted with two other peptides (peptides 61 and 62), indicating proper epitopes to this patient. Determination of the Epitope Sequence and Critical Amino Acids—For determination of the exact amino acid sequence of IgE-binding regions, synthetic peptides comprising 10 amino acids (offset by one amino acid) were further synthesized with respect to the IgE-bound peptides (peptides 26, 28, 38, 47, 57, 61, 62, and 64, respectively) derived from the results of Fig. 2. These peptides then were probed with the sera of randomly selected patients with WDEIA (patients 1, 2, 3, and 5). The immunoblotting result of peptide 26 with the serum of patient 1 was shown in Fig. 3. The boxed area indicates the core epitope sequence. The IgE-binding epitopes on ω-5 gliadin obtained from all four patients identified in the same manner were summarized in Table II. All of the sera reacted to QQIPQQQ, QQLPQQQ, QQFPQQQ, QQSPEQQ, QQSPQQQ, and QQYPQQQ with the exception of patient 5 whose serum failed to react to QQLPQQQ. Additionally, the serum of patient 3 had specific IgE to PYPP.Table IIIgE-binding epitope sequences for patients with WDEIAPatients1235QQIPQQQQQIPQQQQQIPQQQQQIPQQQQQLPQQQQQLPQQQQQLPQQQQQFPQQQQQFPQQQQQFPQQQQQFPQQQQQSPEQQQQSPEQQQQSPEQQQQSPEQQQQSPQQQQQSPQQQQQSPQQQQQSPQQQQQYPQQQQQYPQQQQQYPQQQQQYPQQQPYPP Open table in a new tab The critical amino acids for IgE-binding in two epitopes, QQIPQQQ and QQFPQQQ, were determined by synthesizing epitope peptides with single amino acid mutation at each position followed by probing with individual sera from four patients (patient 1, 2, 3, and 5). The data of the immunoblot strip in patient 1 were representatively shown in Fig. 4. No binding of the serum IgE was observed when the alanine was substituted at the amino acid positions Gln1, Pro4, Gln5, Gln6, and Gln7, respectively, indicating that these amino acids are critical for IgE binding in both epitopes. The remaining sera of the three patients were analyzed in the same manner, and the critical amino acids for IgE-binding were found to be the same as in patient 1 (data not shown). Immunodominance of the ω-5 Gliadin Epitopes—To determine whether any of the seven epitopes of ω-5 gliadin found in this study were immunodominant, each peptide was synthesized and probed with sera of 15 patients. The results are summarized in Fig. 5. The QQIPQQQ and QQFPQQQ peptides were recognized by 13 of 15 WDEIA patients (87%). The QQSPEQQ and QQSPQQQ peptides were recognized by 12 of 15 patients (80%), and the QQLPQQQ and QQYPQQQ epitopes were recognized by 9 of 15 patients and 8 of 15 patients (60 and 53%), respectively. These data indicate that the QQIPQQQ, QQFPQQQ, QQSPQQQ, and QQSPEQQ epitopes are immunodominant and that the IgE antibodies of the patients probably cross-react to these epitopes. The PYPP epitope was unique for patient 3. Patients 11 and 13 had no IgE antibody bound to these tested epitopes, although their sera had IgE bound to fast ω-gliadin (Table I). The water/salt-insoluble wheat proteins, termed gluten, have been considered to be causative allergens for WDEIA. Gluten is composed of two classes of proteins, the 70% ethanol-soluble gliadins (α-, β-, γ-, and ω-gliadins) and the 70% ethanol-insoluble glutenins (HMW and LMW glutenins). Among these proteins, fast ω-gliadin, especially ω-5 gliadin, is considered to be a major allergen for WDEIA (20Morita E. Matsuo H. Mihara S. Morimoto K. Savage A.W.J. Tatham A.S. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2003; 33: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Palosuo K. Alenius H. Varjonen E. Koivuluhta M. Mikkola J. Keskinen H. Kalkkinen N. Reunala T. J.

In this study, we determined IgE binding against a panel of purified gluten proteins by using sera obtained from 15 patients defined as having WDEIA by a challenge test and found that ∼80% of the patients reacted to fast ω-gliadin most strongly, confirming that the fast ω-gliadin is a predominant allergen for WDEIA (Table I). We then analyzed the epitope sequences by means of peptide array of assumed ω-5 gliadin with the sera of four. The epitope sequences of ω-5 gliadin were found to be QQXPQQQ (X = I, F, S, L, or Y), QQSPEQQ, and PYPP (Table II), four of which, QQXPQQQ (X = I, F, or S) and QQSPEQQ, were immunodominant. These epitopes appear frequently in the amino acid sequence of ω-5 gliadin as shown in Fig. 2. This is compatible with the data reported by DuPont et al. (23DuPont F.M. Vensel W.H. Chan R. Kasarda D.D. Cereal Chem. 2000; 77: 607-614Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in which repeats of QQXP, QQQXP, or QQQQXP (X = F, I, and L in order of predominance) are characteristic for the ω-5-type gliadins. We further determined that the critical amino acids in the QQIPQQQ and QQFPQQQ epitopes were positions Gln1, Pro4, Gln5, Gln6, and Gln7, suggesting the epitope sequence QXXPQQQ. In addition, it was speculated that the glutamine residue in the epitope sequence could be replaced by glutamic acid without loss of allergenic ability because both QQSPQQQ and QQSPEQQ epitopes were recognized equally. These data suggest that there are many IgE-binding sites in the ω-5 gliadin. This may account for the serious allergic reactions such as shock, which is characteristic of WDEIA, despite a low proportion of ω-5-type gliadins in gluten (24Seilmeier W. Valdez I. Mendez E. Wieser H. Eur. Food Res. Technol. 2001; 212: 355-363Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Wieser H. Eur. Food Res. Technol. 2000; 211: 262-268Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 2 of the 15 patients with WDEIA (patients 11 and 13) had no specific IgE bound to these epitopes (Fig. 5), although their sera had IgE bound to fast ω-gliadin. These results suggest that the two patients recognize other epitopes in the ω-5 gliadin or that there was nonspecific binding. Interestingly, the sera of these patients in addition to patient 4 reacted to HMW glutenin dominantly among purified water/salt-insoluble wheat proteins (Table I). Taking into consider the relatively low reaction to HMW glutenin in control subjects, these results might suggest that there is another minor subgroup in WDEIA, which reacts to other epitopes in HMW glutenin as a cause of the disease. This study also showed that the sera of all 15 patients with WDEIA reacted to slow ω-gliadin, LMW, and HMW glutenin apart from the strong reactivity to fast ω-gliadin (Table I). Previously, we reported (20Morita E. Matsuo H. Mihara S. Morimoto K. Savage A.W.J. Tatham A.S. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2003; 33: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that fast ω-gliadin cross-reacts to γ-gliadin and slow ω-gliadin, suggesting high sequence homology in these proteins. Palouso et al. (32Palosuo K. Alenius H. Varjonen E. Kalkkinen N. Reunala T. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) also revealed that γ-70 and γ-35 secalins in rye and γ-3 hordein in barley cross-react with ω-5 gliadin (32Palosuo K. Alenius H. Varjonen E. Kalkkinen N. Reunala T. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This is also supported by amino acid sequences of the several gliadins thus far reported. The amino acid sequence of slow ω-gliadin is homologous to the C-hordein of barley and ω-secalins of rye and has PFPQ1–2PQQ repeat motif in repetitive domain (33Hsia C.C. Anderson O.D. Theor. Appl. Genet. 2001; 103: 37-44Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The sequence of γ-gliadin also has PFPQI1–2(PQQ)1–2 motif that is similar to slow ω-gliadin in the repeat domain (34Anderson O.D. Hsia C.C. Torres V. Theor. Appl. Genet. 2001; 103: 323-330Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and there is a QPYPQQQ sequence in slow ω-gliadin and QSFPQQQ and QPFPQQQ sequences in γ-gliadin. Because these sequences are very similar to the epitopes of ω-5 gliadin and include critical amino acids for IgE binding, it is likely that specific IgE to ω-5 gliadin cross-reacts with γ-gliadin and slow ω-gliadin. In addition, the sera of some patients had specific IgE to α-gliadin, which had been reported as a major allergen for WDEIA by Palosuo et al. (26Palosuo K. Alenius H. Varjonen E. Koivuluhta M. Mikkola J. Keskinen H. Kalkkinen N. Reunala T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 103: 912-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-gliadin has QQLPQEQ, QQQPQEQ, and QPYPQQQ sequences (35Anderson O.D. Greene F.C. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1997; 95: 59-65Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar); therefore, this may cross-react with ω-5 gliadin as well as γ-gliadin and slow ω-gliadin. Moreover, the IgE-binding epitope of ω-5 gliadin QQLPQQQ was seen in the VolckA3 and LMW21 and QQFPQQQ was seen in the VolckB3, respectively, all of which belong to the LMW glutenins (36Cassidy B.G. Dvorak J. Anderson O.D. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1998; 96: 743-750Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting that ω-5 gliadin also cross-reacted with LMW glutenin. These results might account partly for the diversity of the reactivity in the dot-blot analysis with the sera of the patients. These IgE-binding epitopes are different from QQQPP previously identified by Tanabe et al. (18Tanabe S. Arai S. Yanagihara Y. Mita H. Takahashi K. Watanabe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) as the major allergen for wheat allergy. In this study, we synthesized the peptide SQQQPPF and probed with the sera of the WDEIA patients; however, only a weak IgE-bound signal to this peptide was observed in 10 of 15 patients (67%) (data not shown). The result indicates that the IgE-binding epitope sequences, QQXPQQQ (X = I, F, S, L, or Y), QQSPEQQ, and PYPP, are distinct and responsible for WDEIA. These motifs do not exist in the proteins, which are major allergens for bakers' asthma, such as α-amylase inhibitors peroxidase and serpin, supporting the idea that these epitopes are characteristic for WDEIA. The CAP-RAST system is now widely used for the diagnosis of allergy, whereas as found in this study, some patients with definite WDEIA were negative in CAP-RAST for gluten (Table I), suggesting unreliable sensitivity of the test for the diagnosis of WDEIA. In addition, a number of the patients with atopic dermatitis reacted positively to CAP-RAST for gluten, although the patients did not have an anaphylactic reaction to gluten such as control subjects 31 and 32 in Table I. These findings suggest that the measurement of specific IgE for gluten is not always satisfactory for the screening as well as diagnosis of WDEIA. It is conceivable that the simultaneous measurement of specific IgE antibodies to both fast-ω gliadin and the epitope peptides was more sensitive and specific to diagnose WDEIA than that to gluten. In fact, to diagnose WDEIA, the clinical efficacy of the measurement of specific IgE to ω-5 gliadin has already been reported (26Palosuo K. Alenius H. Varjonen E. Koivuluhta M. Mikkola J. Keskinen H.

Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a life-threatening disease, but the only reliable therapy is strict elimination of allergen from dietary foods. However, it is not easy to eliminate wheat from foodstuff for a long time. Mutated allergen protein immunotherapy or peptide immunotherapy for food allergy was successful in animal models such as peanut anaphylaxis by means of the allergens or peptides lacking the ability to bind to IgE but retaining the ability to activate T-cells (37Nowak-Wegrzyn A. Pediatrics. 2003; 111: 1672-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the major IgE-binding epitopes on ω-5 gliadin in this study may provide a useful tool for developing hypoallergenic foods as well as a new diagnostic technique and immunotherapy for patients with WDEIA."

However, the mechanism(s) of 4-HNE-induced endothelial barrier function is not well defined. Here we provide evidence for the first time on the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in 4-HNE-mediated actin stress fiber formation and barrier function in lung endothelial cells. Treatment of bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as a model oxidant, resulted in accumulation of 4-HNE as evidenced by the formation of 4-HNE-Michael protein adducts. Exposure of cells to 4-HNE, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, decreased endothelial cell permeability measured as transendothelial electrical resistance. The 4-HNE-induced permeability changes were not because of cytotoxicity or endothelial cell apoptosis, which occurred after prolonged treatment and at higher concentrations of 4-HNE. 4-HNE-induced changes in transendothelial electrical resistance were calcium independent, as 4-HNE did not alter intracellular free calcium levels as compared with H2O2 or diperoxovanadate. Stimulation of quiescent cells with 4-HNE (1-100 μm) resulted in phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPKs, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling.

Living systems constantly encounter free radicals, which are generated by either enzymatic or nonenzymatic mechanisms leading to oxidative stress. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of cellular membrane lipids are in particular vulnerable to free radical attack and undergo peroxidation, ultimately leading to the loss of both structural and function integrity of the cell. Membrane lipid peroxidation has been implicated in numerous pathological states such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and several vascular disorders (1Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 11: 81-128Crossref Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Peroxidation of membrane lipids results in the generation of several highly reactive aldehydes, which react with proteins and nucleic acids and alter their functions. Among the aldehydes, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) 1The abbreviations used are: 4-HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; BLMVECs, bovine lung microvascular endothelial cells; DPV, diperoxovanadate; ECs, endothelial cells; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEM, minimum essential media; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TER, transendothelial electrical resistance; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoyl)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+. has been identified as a potent cytotoxic agent that accumulates to concentrations of 10 μm to 5 mm both in vivo and in vitro (1Esterbauer H.

Therefore the present study was designed to examine the role of 4-HNE in lung endothelial permeability changes. It was hypothesized that 4-HNE mediates the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, cytoskeletal remodeling, and regulates endothelial barrier function. The present study shows for the first time that 4-HNE-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK signaling pathways partly regulates actin rearrangement and changes in transendothelial cell electrical resistance (TER) in lung microvascular endothelial cells.

Cell Culture—Bovine lung microvascular ECs (BLMVECs) cultured in MEM were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and grown to contact-inhibited monolayer with typical cobblestone morphology. Cells from each flask were detached with 0.05% trypsin and resuspended in fresh medium and cultured on gold electrodes for electrical resistance determinations, or on glass coverslips for calcium and immunocytochemistry studies, or on 100-mm dishes for Western blotting. Measurement of Transendothelial Electrical Resistance—TER was measured in a electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system, Applied Biophysics, Inc. (Troy, NY), with minor modifications. Briefly, endothelial cells were cultured on gold electrodes (8 electrodes per plate) until reaching ∼95% confluence. One hour before TER measurements, the cells were rinsed with MEM and incubated in serum-free media. Electrodes were placed into an electrical cell-substrate impedance incubator for 1 h to stabilize basal electrical resistance and pretreated with MAPK inhibitors as indicated. The total electrical resistance measured dynamically across the endothelial monolayer was determined by the combined resistance between the basal surface of the cell and the electrode, reflecting alterations in cell-cell adhesion and/or cell-matrix adhesion (21Giaever I.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in 1 ml of the above media in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.03% pluronic acid as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. Cells were loaded with Fura-2 AM for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air, rinsed twice, and inserted diagonally in the 1.0-cm acrylic cuvettes (Sarstedt, Newton, NC) filled with 3 ml of incubation media at 37 °C. Fura-2 fluorescence was measured with an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM/Aminco, Urbana, IL) at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission wavelength of 510 nm. Intracellular free calcium, [Ca2+]i, in nanomolar was calculated from the 340/380 ratio using software and calibration curves. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—BLMVECs were grown on 100-mm culture dishes to ∼95% confluence. Before the experiment, cells were starved for 12-18 h by culturing in MEM containing only 2% of fetal bovine serum. Subsequent incubations were carried out in serum-free media. After treatment, the reaction was stopped by rinsing the dishes with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm orthovanadate. ECs were lysed with 0.5-1 ml of nondenaturing cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and proteases inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), scraped, sonicated on ice with a probe sonicator (15 s ×2), and centrifuged at 5000 × g in a microcentrifuge (4 °C for 5 min). Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Pierce protein assay kit. The supernatants, adjusted to 0.5-1 mg of protein/ml, were dissociated by boiling in 6× SDS sample buffer for 5 min, and samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Protein bands were transferred overnight (25 V, 4 °C) onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes, probed with primary and secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol, and immunodetected by using enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were scanned (UMAX Power Look II) and quantified by automated digitizing system UN-SCAN-IT GEL (Silk Scientific Corp.). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—BLMVECs grown on coverslips to ∼95% confluence were treated with 4-HNE or MAPK inhibitors as indicated in the figures, rinsed twice with PBS, and treated with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Then cells were rinsed three times with PBS and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.25% Triton X-100 prepared in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 20 (TBST). After washing, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in TBST blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. 4-HNE-protein adduct formation was measured after treatment of cells with primary 4-HNE-Michaels adducts antibody (1:100 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h). Cells were thoroughly rinsed with TBST (3× 5 min) followed by staining with Alexa fluor 488 (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h) as secondary antibody. Actin stress fibers were determined by staining of cells on coverslips with Alexa fluor phalloidin 568. Cells were examined by Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-S immunofluorescence microscopy with a Hamamatsu digital camera (Japan) using a 60× oil immersion objective and MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Assessment of Cell Viability and Apoptosis of ECs—Attached and floating BLMVECs, after 4-HNE treatment, were harvested and analyzed for cell viability, necrosis, and apoptosis. Cells were stained with trypan blue, and counted for trypan blue-excluded (viable) and trypan blue-stained cells (necrotic). Apoptosis was determined with annexin V Alexa fluor 488/propidium iodide using the Vybrant apoptosis kit (Molecular Probes). After staining with Alexa fluor 488 annexin V and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's protocol, apoptotic cells showed green fluorescence, dead cells showed red and green fluorescence, and live cells showed little or no fluorescence as measured by immunofluorescence microscopy (lens ×40). Additionally, programmed cell death was investigated by measurements of caspase-3 activity and cleavage of PARP. Briefly, BLMVECs were treated with 4-HNE, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Caspase-3 activity in total cell lysates was determined by a fluorometric EnzChek caspase-3 assay kit (Molecular Probes) using 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-derived substrate Z-DEVD-AMC by spectrofluorimeter using 342/441 nm excitation/emission wavelengths, respectively. 4-HNE-induced processing of caspase-3 was also characterized by cleavage of PARP and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-PARP antibody. Statistics—Analysis of variance with Student-Newman-Keel's test was used to compare clearance rates of two or more different treatment groups. The level of significance was taken to be p < 0.05 unless otherwise stated. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Oxidant Stress Increases 4-HNE Formation—As a first step in examining the role of 4-HNE in endothelial cell function, we examined 4-HNE formation under oxidative stress. BLMVECs were incubated with varying concentrations of H2O2 (10 μm to 1 mm) for 1 h, and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-4-HNE-Michael adduct antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, H2O2, in a dose-dependent manner, induced production of 4-HNE as measured by 4-HNE-adduct formation with proteins of 40-203 kDa. In control cells, immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B) indicated the presence of 4-HNE-protein adducts predominantly in the perinuclear region as observed in earlier studies (9Parola M. Robino G. Marra F. Pinzani M. Bellomo G. Leonarduzzi G. Chiarugi P. Camandola S. Poli G. Waeg G. Gentilini P. Dianzani M.U. J. Clin.

Trauma. 1998; 44: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) of 4-HNE-induced lung injury is not well understood. To assess the effect of 4-HNE on EC barrier function, BLMVECs were challenged with varying concentrations of 4-HNE (1-100 μm), and EC permeability changes were measured as TER generated across the monolayer. As shown in Fig. 2, 4-HNE in a time- and dose-dependent fashion decreased TER that reflects the increase in EC permeability (21Giaever I. Keese C.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 22Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 88: 7896-7900Crossref Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The decrease in TER peaked at 2 h of 4-HNE (25 μm) treatment, and further increases in 4-HNE concentrations (50 and 100 μm) had no additional effect on TER (control, 1036 ± 72 ohms; 25 μm 4-HNE, 662 ± 87 ohms; 50 μm 4-HNE, 637 ± 83 ohms; 100 μm 4-HNE, 668 ± 64 ohms). These data indicate that 4-HNE modulates endothelial cell permeability in vitro. Effect of 4-HNE on Cell Viability and Apoptosis—Earlier studies have shown that exposure of mammalian cells to 4-HNE induces cell death, apoptosis, and necrosis (7Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Sharma A.

The ability of 4-HNE to induce cell death and apoptosis in BLMVECs was investigated by assessment of plasma membrane integrity with trypan blue and apoptosis with annexin V immunofluorescence microscopy, caspase-3 activity, and cleavage of PARP. Treatment of BLMVECs with 4-HNE (25-100 μm) for 2 h had no significant effect on cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 3A); however, exposure to 100 μm 4-HNE for 4 h resulted in ∼15% inclusion of trypan blue (Fig. 3A). Complimentary assays including annexin V immunofluorescence microscopy, caspase-3 activity, and PARP cleavage were carried out to measure 4-HNE-induced apoptosis in BLMVECs. At lower concentrations of 4-HNE (25-50 μm), there was no significant induction of apoptosis up to 4 h of treatment; however, 4-HNE at 100 μm induced an increase in the number of annexin V and propidium iodide-positive cells (∼4-8-fold compared with control cells) at 4 h of exposure to 4-HNE (Fig. 3B). To further establish the effect of higher concentrations of 4-HNE in inducing apoptosis, caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage were measured. BLMVECs were exposed to varying concentrations of 4-HNE (1-100 μm) for 4 h and caspase-3 activity was measured using 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-derived Z-DEVD substrate. As shown in Fig. 3C, 4-HNE treatment resulted in a 7-9-fold increase in caspase-3 activity at 50 and 100 μm concentrations, respectively. However, at lower doses of 4-HNE (1-25 μm) there was no significant change in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3C) confirming the induction of apoptosis at higher, but not at lower doses of 4-HNE. Furthermore, PARP cleavage, as assessed by appearance of ∼89-kDa protein, was detected by 4 h after 4-HNE (50 and 100 μm) treatment of BLMVECs (Fig. 3D). No degradation of the ∼116-kDa PARP to the ∼89-kDa protein fragment was seen by 2 h after 4-HNE (25-100 μm) treatment or by 4 h after 25 μm 4-HNE (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that in BLMVECs, doses of 4-HNE from 50 μm induced appreciable cell death and apoptosis. Based on these data, all the experiments related to 4-HNE-mediated barrier dysfunction and cytoskeletal remodeling were carried out with 25 μm 4-HNE. Effect of 4-HNE on Changes in Intracellular Calcium—Based on earlier experiments that demonstrated the intracellular calcium dependence of ROS-induced EC permeability changes (26Dudek S.M.

In Fura-2-loaded BLMVECs, 4-HNE (25 μm) did not elevate [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with higher concentrations of 4-HNE (50-100 μm, data not shown).

These results indicate that 4-HNE did not modulate intracellular calcium levels in BLMVECs, but did induce ECs barrier dysfunction in a calcium-independent fashion.Fig. 5Effect of 4-HNE and ROS on transendothelial electrical resistance. A, BLMVECs grown on gold microelectrodes to ∼95% confluence were challenged with 4-HNE (25 μm), DPV (5 μm), or H2O2 (100 μm) and followed by measurement of TER as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown is a representative tracing from four independent experiments.

Commun. 2001; 282: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we examined the formation of 4-HNE-mediated protein adducts in ECs. Treatment of BLMVECs with 4-HNE, in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, increased protein adduct formation as determined by Western blotting with anti-4-HNE-Michael adduct antibody (Fig. 6A). Modification of EC proteins of 40-45, 60-80, and 100-130 kDa by 4-HNE was detected with 5 μm 4-HNE, which was dramatically increased at higher concentrations. Interestingly, the formation of 4-HNE adduct was observed as early as 15 min after treatment and peaked at 45 min of 4-HNE treatment (Fig. 6B). These results show that 4-HNE induces the formation of protein adduct in ECs. 4-HNE Activates ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK—To investigate the role of MAPKs in 4-HNE-induced barrier dysfunction, BLMVECs were treated with different 4-HNE concentrations or with 4-HNE (25 μm) for varying times, and cell lysates were analyzed for enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK by Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7, 4-HNE stimulated ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK as evidenced by enhanced phosphorylation of threonine/tyrosine residues. The activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK by 4-HNE was dose-dependent with increased phosphorylation detected at concentrations as low as 25 μm, and reached a plateau at 50 μm (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 8, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 peaked at 15 min and decreased thereafter; however, activation of JNK and p38 MAPK increased from 15 to 60 min after 4-HNE treatment. These data dem"

We have recently shown that LPS-stimulated neutrophils express monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), an AP-1-dependent gene, suggesting that LPS activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in neutrophils. Previously, we have shown the activation of p38 MAPK, but not JNK, in suspended neutrophils stimulated with LPS but have recently shown activation of JNK by TNF-α in an adherent neutrophil system. We show here that exposure to LPS activates JNK in non-suspended neutrophils and that LPS-induced MCP-1 expression, but not tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-8 (IL-8), is dependent on JNK activation. In addition, LPS stimulation of non-suspended neutrophils activates Syk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of Syk with piceatannol or PI3K with wortmannin inhibited LPS-induced JNK activation and decreased MCP-1 expression after exposure to LPS, suggesting that both Syk and PI3K reside in a signaling pathway leading to LPS-induced JNK activation in neutrophils. This Syk- and PI3K-dependent pathway leading to JNK activation after LPS exposure in non-suspended neutrophils is specific for JNK, because inhibition of neither Syk nor PI3K decreased p38 activation after LPS stimulation. Furthermore we show that PI3K inhibition decreased LPS-induced Syk activation suggesting that PI3K resides upstream of Syk in this pathway. Finally, we show that Syk associates with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) upon LPS stimulation further implicating Syk in the LPS-induced signaling pathway in neutrophils. Overall our data suggests that LPS induces JNK activation only in non-suspended neutrophils, which proceeds through Syk- and PI3K-dependent pathways, and that JNK activation is important for LPS-induced MCP-1 expression but not for TNF-α or IL-8 expression.

An improved understanding by which neutrophils respond to LPS, and more specifically the signaling pathways utilized in induction of an inflammatory response, may facilitate novel therapies in the treatment of LPS-induced inflammatory diseases. A variety of signaling pathways have been elucidated in the response to LPS. The best described of which is the pathway leading to NFκB activation through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Binding of LPS, in the context of LPS-binding protein and CD14, leads to the association of MyD88 with TLR4, the subsequent recruitment and activation of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase to the TLR4-MyD88 complex, and the association of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase with TNF receptor activating factor 6 (9Kirschning C.J.

Although the NFκB pathway is of undoubted importance, the role of MAPK pathways in the response to LPS is less certain. The MAPK family consists of three members: p42/44 ERK, which is activated by chemoattractants and growth factors, and p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), which are stress- and cytokine-activated (12Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). MAPKs are involved in perpetuation of the inflammatory response and are activated through well described signaling cascades (13Deacon K. Blank J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16604-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whether similar upstream components as described above, or alternatively some other combination of intermediates, lead to LPS-induced activation of MAPKs remains a matter of some dispute. Activation of the MAPKs occur after LPS stimulation in MyD88 knockout mice, although with delayed kinetics compared with wild type mice, suggesting that MyD88 is involved, but not essential, in LPS-induced MAPK activation and that other MyD88-independent pathways exist (14Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Recently an adaptor molecule homologous to MyD88, Mal/Tirap, has been shown to be involved in the activation of the MAPKs by TLR4 (15Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A.

Whether PI3K and/or the small G-proteins might be involved in TLR4-dependent activation of the MAPKs after LPS stimulation, and what the functional consequences of such activation, is unknown.

In addition, JNK activation has been shown to occur in macrophages upon LPS stimulation (46Sanghera J.S. Weinstein S.L. Aluwalia M. Girn J. Pelech S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar, 47Hambleton J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 48Procyk K.J. Rippo M.R. Testi R.

Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have reported that LPS stimulation of suspended neutrophils results in the activation of p38 MAPK, but not ERK or JNK. The absence of JNK activation in our previous studies may relate to the use of suspended neutrophils, which might not replicate events that occur in a complex microenvironment, because we have recently shown the activation of JNK in adherent neutrophils upon TNF-α stimulation (37Avdi N.J.

Several pathways leading to JNK activation have been described, which, although stimulus-dependent, display common features. Pathways have been described that depend on the small G-proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 (30Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and recently we have identified Syk as an upstream activator of JNK in adherent neutrophils after TNF-α stimulation (37Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK after LPS stimulation in macrophages requires PI3K (46Sanghera J.S. Weinstein S.L. Aluwalia M. Girn J. Pelech S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar), although upstream components in the JNK pathway in neutrophils are unknown. We queried whether activation of Syk and PI3K may also occur in LPS-stimulated neutrophils, and if so whether Syk and PI3K participate in LPS-induced JNK activation. We show here that LPS stimulation activates JNK in non-suspended neutrophils and that this activation occurs through Syk-dependent and both PI3K-dependent and -independent pathways. Additionally, we show that LPS stimulates PI3K and Syk activation, that PI3K is involved in the activation of Syk, and that Syk associates with TLR4 upon LPS stimulation. This pathway leading to the activation of JNK in non-suspended neutrophils appears independent of that which leads to p38 activation after LPS stimulation. Finally, we show that inhibition of JNK leads to a relatively specific decrease in LPS-induced MCP-1 expression in neutrophils. These studies provide new insight into mechanisms by which neutrophils respond to LPS. Materials—All reagents and plasticware used in these experiments were endotoxin-free. Leupeptin, Triton X-100, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), EDTA, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), aprotinin, wortmannin, Brij 97, protein A-Sepharose, and RedTaq polymerase were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar). The substrates c-Jun1–79 and ATF-21–110 were generated as previously described (49Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar). Human Neutrophil Isolation—Human neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors as described previously (49Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar, 52Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The isolation method utilized is associated with >98% cell viability by trypan blue exclusion and contains <10% contaminating monocytes (49Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils were resuspended in Krebs-Ringers phosphate buffer with 0.2% dextrose at pH 7.2 (complete KRPD) with the addition of protease inhibitors (leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), PMSF (10 μg/ml)), and 1% heat-inactivated platelet poor plasma (HIPPP) or in RPMI 1640 culture media (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 1% HEPES and 1% HIPPP where indicated. Immunoprecipitation—Isolated human neutrophils (20 × 106/ml were used throughout) were resuspended and placed into microcentrifuge tubes in complete KRPD with 1% HIPPP and protease inhibitors and kept at 37 °C for 60 min under non-suspended conditions undisturbed. The cells were then stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for various lengths of time. In separate experiments examining the association of TLR4 with Syk, human neutrophils were incubated in complete KRPD supplemented with DFP (1 mm) for 10 min followed by washing twice in KRPD prior to resuspension in complete KRPD and stimulation with LPS. After stimulation, the cells were recollected by centrifugation and lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer: JNK lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm sodium fluoride) for JNK, phosphotyrosine, and TLR4 immunoprecipitations; Syk lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Brij 97, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for Syk and Lyn immunoprecipitations; RIPA (50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 21 μg/ml aprotinin) for p38 immunoprecipitations; or PI3K lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for PI3K immunoprecipitations. After cell lysis, the tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the lysates were pre-cleared with 15 μl of Protein-A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 15 min. To the lysates were then added either 1 μg of anti-JNK-1 antibody or anti-p38 antibody; or 2 μg of either anti-Syk (C20), anti-Lyn, anti-TLR4 (HTA125), or anti-PI3K antibody along with 20 μl of Protein-A-Sepharose, followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. In phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations, 10 μl of phosphotyrosine (G410)-agarose conjugate was added directly to the lysates and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. For TLR4 and Syk co-immunoprecipitation studies, TLR4 immunoprecipitates were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was performed for Syk or TLR4, respectively, followed by stripping of the blot and reimmunoblotting for TLR4, utilizing the H-80, C-18, and HTA-125 TLR4 antibodies (all Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Syk (N19). For phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations, proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for Hck. JNK Kinase Assay—After immunoprecipitation with anti-JNK-1, the beads were washed once in JNK lysis buffer and twice in JNK kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Na3VO4). To each sample was then added 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 500 ng of c-Jun1–79 in 40 μl of the JNK kinase buffer and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 15 μl 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 8 min. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and radioactive bands were identified by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Syk and Lyn Kinase Assays—After immunoprecipitation the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in wash buffer A (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Brij 97, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and twice in wash buffer B (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The beads and kinase mix (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm MnCl2, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were incubated separately at 30 °C for 5 min. After incubation, 40 μl of the kinase mix was added to the beads, which were then incubated at 30 °C for 1 min. Proteins were then separated with radioactive bands identified and analyzed as described above for the JNK kinase assay. p38 Kinase Assay—The beads were collected by centrifugation after immunoprecipitation with anti-p38 and were washed once in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer and twice in PAN (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0), and 21 μg/ml aprotinin). To the beads were added 40 μl of kinase mix (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 500 ng of recombinant ATF-21–110), which were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. As per the methods for the JNK kinase assay, proteins were separated with radioactive bands identified and analyzed. PI3K Activity Assay—After immunoprecipitation the samples were centrifuged and the beads were washed once in PI3K lysis buffer and three times in PAN. After washing, the beads were resuspended in PAN with PI3K activity measured as described by Kazlauskas and Cooper (53Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the beads and kinase mix (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μm ATP with 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Avanti Polar Lipids; Alabaster, AL)) were incubated separately for 10 min at room temperature. The beads were mixed with 10 μl of the kinase mix for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl, and the phospholipids were extracted with 200 μl of CH3Cl/CH3OH (1:1). The organic phase was washed with 80 μl of HCl/CH3OH (1:1), and the solution was lyophilized to dryness. Phospholipids were resuspended in 10 μl of CH3Cl/CH3OH (1:1), spotted onto silica gel 60 plate (20 × 20 cm, VWR Scientific) that had been pre-soaked with 2% sodium-potassium tartrate, and were resolved by ascending thin-layer chromatography in a buffer containing CH3Cl/CH3OH/4 m NH4OH (9:7:2). The radiolabeled lipids were detected by autoradiography and quantified with a PhosphorImager. Inhibitor Studies—After resuspension in KRPD or RPMI 1640 as described above, neutrophils were incubated with or without piceatannol (10 or 30 μm), wortmannin (50 nm), or SP600125 (2–20 μm) as indicated at 37 °C for the indicated times prior to LPS stimulation. Me2SO (0.1%) was used as a diluent control for each experiment. RT-PCR—Isolated human neutrophils (20 × 106) were resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 1% HEPES and 1% HIPPP and incubated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or were left non-stimulated. After incubation the cells were recollected by centrifugation with supernatants collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C for later protein analysis. RNA extraction was performed by adding 500 μl of TRIzol to the cell pellet and then by following the manufacture's protocol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed on 2 μg of the isolated RNA. The cycle conditions for PCR were: 96 °C for 2 min followed by 24–32 cycles of: 94 °C for 30 s; 52–55 °C for 30 s depending on primers; 72 °C for 1 min; and a final elongation step of 72 °C for 7 min. PCR primers utilized were MCP-1: 5′-TCTGTGCCTGCTGCTCATAGC-3′, 5′-GGGTAGAACTGTGGTTCAAGAGG-3′; TNF-α: 5′-AGCCCATGTTGTAGCAAACC-3′, 5′-TTTGGGAAGGTTGGATGTTC-3′; IL-8: 5′-TCTGTGTGAAGGTGCAGTT-3"
https://openalex.org/W2063435821,"The self-association of proteins to form amyloid fibrils has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases. We recently reported that the myeloid scavenger receptor CD36 initiates a signaling cascade upon binding to fibrillar β-amyloid that stimulates recruitment of microglia in the brain and production of inflammatory mediators. This receptor plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, prompting us to evaluate whether fibrillar proteins were present in atherosclerotic lesions that could initiate signaling via CD36. We show that apolipoprotein C-II, a component of very low and high density lipoproteins, readily forms amyloid fibrils that initiate macrophage inflammatory responses including reactive oxygen production and tumor necrosis factor α expression. Using macrophages derived from wild type and Cd36-/- mice to distinguish CD36-specific events, we show that fibrillar apolipoprotein C-II activates a signaling cascade downstream of this receptor that includes Lyn and p44/42 MAPKs. Interruption of this signaling pathway through targeted deletion of Cd36 or blocking of p44/42 MAPK activation inhibits macrophage tumor necrosis factor α gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that apolipoprotein C-II in human atheroma co-localizes to regions positive for markers of amyloid and macrophage accumulation. Together, these data characterize a CD36-dependent signaling cascade initiated by fibrillar amyloid species that may promote atherogenesis.

Together, these data characterize a CD36-dependent signaling cascade initiated by fibrillar amyloid species that may promote atherogenesis. CD36 is a multifunctional cell surface receptor expressed on macrophages, platelets, skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and microvascular endothelium (1Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In myeloid cells, CD36 is believed to participate in the innate immune response through pattern recognition of foreign or modified-host ligands. As a result, this receptor has been reported to bind a diverse set of ligands including oxidized low density lipoprotein, thrombospondin-1, fatty acids, Plasmodium falciparum peptides, apoptotic cells, and most recently, β-amyloid (1Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of CD36 remains unclear, it has convincingly been shown to play a role in the genesis of atherosclerosis. In hyperlipidemic Apoe-/- mice, targeted deletion of Cd36 resulted in a 75% reduction in atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic tree and a 45% reduction in lesion size in the aortic arch (2Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Smith J.D. Hajjar D.P. Hazen S.L. Hoff H.F. Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The current hypotheses suggest that lipoproteins oxidized in the artery wall stimulate an influx of monocytes, which clear these toxic lipids via scavenger receptors, including CD36. These events are believed to precipitate the accumulation of lipid-engorged macrophage foam cells, the earliest histologic evidence of atherosclerosis. Studies using low density lipoprotein oxidized by several in vitro methods have shown that uptake of these ligands is severely impaired in human and mouse macrophages deficient in CD36 (3Kunjathoor V.V.

However, despite intensive investigation, the lipids or proteins that trigger the influx of inflammatory cells into the artery wall remain poorly characterized and trials of antioxidant therapies have failed to show a positive impact on atherosclerosis (7Clarke R.

There is growing evidence that CD36 is linked to a signal transduction pathway that can initiate myeloid inflammatory responses that would be predicted to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We have shown that through binding of the fibrillar amyloid peptide, β-amyloid, CD36 initiates a pro-inflammatory signaling cascade that regulates microglial recruitment, activation, and secretion of inflammatory mediators (9Moore K.J.

In Alzheimer’s disease, the abnormal deposition of β-amyloid in the brain and vasculature incites chronic inflammation that contributes to neurotoxicity and cell death. The engagement of β-amyloid by CD36 results in the production of cytokines and chemokines implicated in this response including interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SAP, serum amyloid P; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; LXR, liver X receptor. monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 α and β and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (9Moore K.J.

Interestingly, these inflammatory mediators have also been identified in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions (12Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). Despite extensive efforts, we have been unable to demonstrate macrophage CD36-specific signaling in response to in vitro oxidized low density lipoprotein. Thus, we hypothesized that atheroma may contain fibrillar amyloid proteins that could initiate pro-inflammatory CD36 signaling in macrophages accumulating in the artery wall. One such candidate protein is apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II), a component of very low and high density lipoproteins and a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase (13Havel R.J. Fielding C.J. Olivecrona T.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein C-II is a 79 amino acid protein that readily forms amyloid fibrils under lipid-free conditions, adopting a cross-β-sheet structure that reacts with the amyloid stains thioflavin T and Congo Red (15Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The ability of apolipoproteins to adopt this conformation is not limited to apoC-II but has also been reported for various full-length and mutant derivatives of apoA-I, apoA-II, apoA-IV, and apoE (16Westermark P.

Recently, the nuclear receptors LXRα and LXRβ, which are activated by oxysterols in cholesterol-loaded macrophage foam cells, were shown to induce expression of the apoE, apoC-I, apoC-IV, and apoC-II gene cluster. Up-regulated expression of this gene cluster in macrophage foam cells would be expected to result in the secretion of these apolipoproteins in the artery wall in a lipid-poor state amenable to amyloid fibril formation (23Lin C.Y.

We demonstrate that apoC-II amyloid fibrils, but not freshly prepared monomeric apoC-II, binds to CD36 and initiates a signaling cascade similar to that induced by β-amyloid. This CD36-specific signaling pathway involves the sequential activation of the Src kinase Lyn and the p44/42 MAPK. Wild type macrophages exposed to fibrillar apoC-II exhibit markers of macrophage activation including the production of reactive oxygen and TNFα gene expression, whereas macrophages lacking CD36 failed to respond. In human coronary arteries, apoC-II was detected in regions that stained positive for amyloid and macrophage markers. These results provide insight into the potential mechanism by which CD36 interaction with fibrillar amyloid proteins may promote inflammation in atherosclerosis. ApoC-II Preparation—ApoC-II was expressed and purified as described previously and stored as a stock solution at 30 mg/ml in 5 m GuHCl (15Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Wang C.S. Downs D. Dashti A. Jackson K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The protein was refolded by rapid dilution (1:100) from the stock solution into PBS, pH 7.4. For fibril formation, 0.3 mg/ml apoC-II was incubated at 20 °C for 72 h prior to use as described previously. Fibril formation was confirmed by thioflavin S (Sigma) fluorescent staining as described previously (9Moore K.J. El Khoury J. Medeiros L.A. Terada K. Geula C. Luster A.D. Freeman M.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Fluorescein-labeled apoC-II was generated by incubating fluorescein-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) with a previously characterized derivative of apoC-II tagged with a C-terminal cysteine residue (4 °C overnight) (26Pham C.L. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14313-14322Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The labeled samples were purified on a Sephadex G-25 column preequilibrated with 5 m GuHCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and fractions containing labeled protein were pooled and concentrated using Centricon YM-3 centrifugal filters (Amicon, Billerica, MA). The degree of labeling of apoC-II was determined to be 19% by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 83,000 m-1cm-1. Fibril formation of fluorescein-labeled apoC-II was induced as described above. Mice—The Cd36-/- (Cd36tm1Mgh) mice were generated in our laboratory as described previously and were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice for 7 generations (9Moore K.J. El Khoury J. Medeiros L.A. Terada K.

Age-matched Cd36+/+ mice generated from crosses of Cd36+/- mice were used as controls. Lyn-/- (Lyntm1Sor/J) and wild type littermate control mice were generated from intercrosses of Lyn+/- mice (The Jackson Laboratory). All of the mice were maintained in a pathogen-free facility with free access to rodent chow and water. Cell Culture—Elicited peritoneal macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 6-8-week-old mice with 3% thioglycollate as we described previously (9Moore K.J.

Cells were washed in PBS, cultured for 2 h in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and washed again to remove non-adherent cells. Adherent cells prepared in this manner were routinely >95% CD11b+ and F4/80+ as determined by flow-cytometric analysis. For signaling experiments, cells were incubated in DMEM with reduced fetal bovine serum (1%) overnight prior to use. The Bowes human melanoma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and was maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). A stable Bowes cell line expressing human CD36 was generated by co-transfecting the mammalian expression vector for human CD36, CDM8-CD36, and pcDNA-neomycin using calcium phosphate and selecting G418 sulfate-resistant cells as we described previously (27Coraci I.S. Husemann J. Berman J.W. Hulette C. Dufour J.H. Campanella G.K. Luster A.D. Silverstein S.C. El-Khoury J.B. Am. J.

A mock-transfected Bowes cell line was generated by cotransfection of the empty CDM8 vector and pcDNA-neomycin. Expression of CD36 on transfected cells was detected by flow-cytometric analysis. Cells were incubated with an anti-human CD36 antibody (FA6-152, 10 μg/ml) for 30 min, washed three times in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Western Analysis—Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and 40-60 μg of protein was run on 10% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody as we described previously (28Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D.S. Mortensen R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies included mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42, and rabbit anti-p44/42 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Blots were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with species appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) for 1 h. Blots were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and exposed to ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and signal was recorded using Kodak BioMax MR film or the Alpha Innotech Fluorchem 8800 image analysis system. Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production—Reactive oxygen production was measured by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay as we described previously (9Moore K.J. El Khoury J.

Cells (105) were incubated on 6-mm2 multispot slides in DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 1 h and stimulated with 10 μm fibrillar apoC-II or 40 μm fibrillar β-amyloid for 10 min at 37 °C. 50 μl of 1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium was added, and cells were incubated for an additional hour at 37 °C. ROS production correlates with the formation of formazan, a dark blue-colored insoluble precipitate, the intensity of which was quantified by microscope video capture (5 measurements/sample) and Image-Quant analysis software. Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol B reagent, and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as we described previously (28Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D.S. Mortensen R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 0.3 μm TNFα or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers and 3 μl of cDNA, SYBR Green, and HotStar-Taq polymerase. PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler under the following conditions: 15 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate, and the amount of TNFα and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in each sample was calculated from a standard curve of known template. Immunohistochemical Staining—Human left anterior descending coronary artery segments were obtained from hearts excised at the time of cardiac transplantation and then fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin as described previously (29O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Atherosclerotic plaques were identified by morphological criteria (30Gordon D. Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4600-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Morphology was determined from 6-μm sections stained with Movat’s pentachrome stains. Macrophages were identified using monoclonal antibody HAM-56 (titer: 1:10, DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) (31Gown A.M. Tsukada T. Ross R. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 125: 191-207PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antisera were used to identify apoC-II (titer: 1:500, Calbiochem), serum amyloid P (SAP) component (titer: 1:100, Calbiochem), or CD36 (titer: 1:100, Calbiochem). Single label immunohistochemistry was performed using techniques described previously (29O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) with the exception that, following paraffin removal and rehydration through graded alcohols, sections intended for SAP immunostaining were pretreated with Nova Red (DakoCytomation) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Nova Red (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), which yields a red reaction product, was used as the peroxidase substrate, and cell nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. The fibrillar conformation of apoC-II incubated under lipid-free conditions at physiological pH and salt concentrations was confirmed by visualization of fluorescence with the amyloid diagnostic dye thioflavin S as we described previously (Fig. 1) (9Moore K.J.

Minton A.P. Howlett G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7824-7830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Purified apoC-II diluted in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated for 72 h demonstrates thioflavin S fluorescence (Fig. 1a) that is not detected in freshly diluted samples (native apoC-II, Fig. 1b). In this fibrillar conformation, apoC-II initiates p44/42 MAPK signaling in macrophages (Fig. 1c). Peritoneal macrophages treated with 10 μm fibrillar apoC-II demonstrate a rapid phosphorylation of p44/42 that peaked at 5-10 min post-stimulation. In contrast, no phospho-p44/42 protein was detectable in macrophages treated with freshly prepared monomeric apoC-II despite the presence of equivalent amounts of total cellular p44/42 in all cells (lower panel). These data indicate that apoC-II that has adopted a fibrillar amyloid conformation induces inflammatory signaling in macrophages. Fibrillar ApoC-II Binds to CD36-expressing Bowes Melanoma Cells—We have recently shown that the macrophage scavenger receptor CD36 recognizes another amyloid protein, β-amyloid, and initiates a cellular signaling cascade involving p44/42 MAPK. To test whether fibrillar apoC-II is a ligand for CD36, we assessed binding to human Bowes melanoma cells stably expressing CD36 (CD36-Bowes) using fluorescein-labeled apoC-II. Freshly prepared monomeric apoC-II-fluorescein does not bind to CD36-Bowes cells as evidenced by the lack of cell surface fluorescence (Fig. 2a, right panel). By contrast, apoC-II-fluorescein allowed to form amyloid fibrils readily bound to the surface of CD36-expressing Bowes cells (Fig. 2, a, middle panel, and b, CD36 expression). In the absence of CD36, mock-transfected Bowes cells were unable to bind fibrillar apoC-II-fluorescein, indicating that binding is specifically mediated by this receptor (Fig. 2a, left panel). CD36 Mediates Macrophage Inflammatory Responses to Fibrillar ApoC-II—Macrophage production of reactive oxygen species in response to inflammatory stimuli, including amyloid peptides, is a well characterized marker of macrophage activation. We tested whether fibrillar apoC-II stimulated ROS production in peritoneal macrophages derived from wild type and Cd36-/- mice. In wild type macrophages, fibrillar apoC-II induced the generation of ROS (Fig. 3a). This was reduced by 75% in similarly treated Cd36-/- macrophages, indicating that the macrophage oxidative burst induced by fibrillar apoC-II requires CD36. Treatment with monomeric apoC-II did not stimulate ROS production in either macrophage population (data not shown). As we reported previously, fibrillar β-amyloid also induced a CD36-dependent increase in cellular ROS (Fig. 3a). No difference was detected in the ROS response of wild type and Cd36-/- macrophages to another inflammatory stimulus, zymosan (data not shown). These data indicate that the binding of CD36 by unrelated amyloid proteins activates the macrophage respiratory burst. To test whether fibrillar apoC-II induces expression of proinflammatory cytokines, we evaluated TNFα gene expression in wild type and Cd36-/- macrophages. Stimulation of wild type macrophages with 10 μm fibrillar apoC-II induced a 6-fold increase in TNFα mRNA as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 3b). Similar treatment of macrophages lacking CD36 resulted in a small decrease in TNFα mRNA as compared with unstimulated macrophages. Freshly prepared monomeric apoC-II did not alter expression of TNFα in either macrophage population (data not shown). These data identify the production of TNFα as a macrophage response to fibrillar apoC-II and demonstrate that this is mediated by CD36. Fibrillar ApoC-II Activates a CD36 Signaling Cascade Involving Phosphotyrosine, Lyn, and p44/42 MAPKs—Tyrosine kinase signaling is rapidly activated in macrophages by inflammatory stimuli, and thus, tyrosine phosphorylation has been used as a marker of signal transduction. Using macrophages derived from wild type and Cd36-/- mice, we investigated whether fibrillar apoC-II engagement of CD36 initiated phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues. Fibrillar apoC-II induced the accumulation of five tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in wild type macrophages that were not present or were greatly reduced in similarly treated Cd36-/- macrophages. Western blotting with an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine demonstrates the differential phosphorylation of these five proteins (approximate sizes: 42, 57, 75, 90, and 120 kDa) within 5-10 min post-stimulation (Fig. 4A). The smallest of these proteins is concordant in size with the p44/42 MAPK, which we found was activated by fibrillar but not monomeric apoC-II. Western blotting with an antibody to phospho-p44/42 revealed that activation of p44/42 MAPK by fibrillar apoC-II required the expression of CD36 (Fig. 4B). In Cd36-/- macrophages, the accumulation of phospho-p44/42 was no longer detectable 5 min post-stimulation and was greatly reduced at 10 min as compared with wild type macrophages. To eliminate the possibility that the signaling events observed could be the result of contamination of reagents with lipopolysaccharide, fibrillar apoC-II signaling was also assessed in macrophages lacking the lipopolysaccharide receptor, CD14, or lacking both CD14 and CD36. Phosphorylation of p44/42 in response to fibrillar apoC-II continued to be detected in Cd14-/- macrophages but was lost in Cd14-/-/Cd36-/- macrophages, confirming that CD36 is required for the initiation of fibrillar apoC-II signaling (Fig. 4B). The Src family of tyrosine kinases can associate with CD36 and has been linked to the activation of MAPK. Pretreatment of macrophages with a broad inhibitor of Src kinases, PP1, abrogated p44/42 activation by fibrillar apoC-II. In the presence of this inhibitor, the accumulation of phospho-p44/42 was no longer detectable at 5 and 10 min post-stimulation and was greatly reduced at 20 min (Fig. 4C). Targeted deletion of the most abundantly expressed Src kinase family gene in macrophages, Lyn, blocked p44/42 phosphorylation in response to fibrillar apoC-II (Fig. 4D). This indicates that Lyn kinase plays an essential role in the CD36-mediated activation of p44/42 MAPK. Together, these data outline a signaling cascade initiated by fibrillar apoC-II in macrophages that involves the sequential activation of CD36, Lyn kinase, and p44/42 MAPK. To determine whether the described signal transduction pathway regulates fibrillar apoC-II-induced TNFα expression in macrophages, we treated cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059, which blocks activation of p44/42 MAPK (Fig. 5). As expected, untreated macrophages or macrophages stimulated with monomeric apoC-II expressed little TNFα mRNA. Treatment of macrophages with fibrillar apoC-II for 12 h induced the expression of ∼130 pg of TNFα mRNA. Pretreatment of macrophages with PD98059 reduced this increase in TNFα mRNA by ∼60%. These data indicate that p44/42 MAPK signaling is responsible in part for fibrillar apoC-II activation of TNFα gene expression. Co-localization of ApoC-II and Macrophages in Human Atherosclerotic Lesions—To investigate the physiological relevance of fibrillar apoC-II/CD36 signaling, human coronary atherosclerotic lesions were stained using antibodies specific for apoC-II, macrophages, and SAP, a universal constituent of amyloid deposits (33Pepys M.B. Rademacher T.W. Amatayakul-Chantler S. Williams P. Noble G.E. Hutchinson W.L. Hawkins P.N. Nelson S.R. Gallimore J.R. Herbert J. Hutton T. Dwek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5602-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As reported previously in murine aortic lesions, apoC-II was detected on a subset of intimal macrophages (Fig. 6, arrowheads). All of the macrophages in this region expressed CD36 as detected by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). In addition, in the region adjacent to this large collection of macrophages, more widespread extracellular apoC-II staining was detected. Furthermore, this extracellular apoC-II co-localized with SAP, a marker of amyloid fibrils (Fig. 6, arrows). Together, these data are consistent with the hypotheses that apoC-II not only is localized in atherosclerotic lesions in regions of macrophage accumulation but also that apoC-II may form amyloid fibrils. Monocytes and their macrophage counterparts play a critical role in the innate immune response through recognition of foreign or modified host proteins/lipids. This surveillance function is mediated in part by scavenger receptors, a family of pattern recognition receptors known to bind a diverse set of ligands including modified lipoproteins, proteins modified by advanced glycation endproducts, Gram-negative bacteria, apoptotic cells, and Plasmodium parasitized erythrocytes (34Gordon S. Cell. 2002; 111: 927-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the class B scavenger receptor, CD36, binds β-amyloid and engages a signaling cascade in peripheral and brain macrophages that initiates inflammatory responses characteristic of those found in Alzheimer’s disease (9Moore K.J.

Amyloid fibrils of widely varying primary sequence can be recognized by a common antibody, suggesting a three-dimensional structure that exposes a shared epitope (35O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that apoC-II, an unrelated plasma protein, readily forms amyloid fibrils that engage a similar CD36 signaling cascade involving Lyn and p44/42 MAPKs. Activation of this CD36 signaling pathway was shown to induce macrophage inflammatory responses including reactive oxygen production and TNFα. These data suggest that CD36 recognizes unrelated fibrillar amyloid proteins and engages a common signaling cascade that triggers the macrophage response to these toxic molecules. CD36 has an established role in atherosclerosis (1Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In the absence of this receptor, atherosclerotic lesion size in the Apoe-/- hyperlipidemic mouse is greatly reduced (2Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Smith J.D. Hajjar D.P. Hazen S.L. Hoff H.F. Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar); however, whether this is attributable to its cholesterol uptake function or its ability to induce inflammatory signaling is not known. The current paradigm suggests a role for CD36 in binding oxidized lipoproteins in the artery wall. Despite a substantial literature suggesting that oxidation products of these endogenous lipids activate the chronic inflammatory state in atherosclerosis, trials of antioxidant therapies in humans have failed to show a protective effect for cardiovascular disease. Our recent finding that β-amyloid activates a robust signaling cascade via CD36 led us to investigate whether proteins present in the artery wall that could form amyloid would engage this CD36 pathway. Apolipoproteins, normally associated with lipoprotein particles, can form amyloid fibrils that have been detected in vivo. We identified a CD36 signaling cascade activated by amyloid fibrils of apoC-II, an apolipoprotein whose expression is regulated by oxysterols in macrophage foam cells. Immunohistochemical staining of human atheroma showed accumulation of apoC-II in regions positive for macrophage and amyloid markers. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that non-lipid ligands may initiate complicity of CD36 in atherogenesis by activating inflammatory signal transduction and suggest that the protein component of lipoproteins may contribute to atherosclerosis in a way that has been overlooked previously. We employed human apoC-II in our studies because of the extensive characterization of its ability to form amyloid fibrils in vitro. In the absence of lipid, apoC-II forms twisted ribbon-like fibrils with all of the hallmarks of amyloid including binding to Congo Red and thioflavin T, increased β-structure as measured by circular dichroism, and β-sheet formation as seen by x-ray diffraction (15Hatters D.M.

However, the ability of apoC-II to adopt an amyloid structure is not unique to this apolipoprotein and has also been reported for derivatives of apoA-I, apoA-II, apoA-IV, and apoE (16Westermark P.

Amyloid fibrils of apoA-I have been detected in plaques of both Alzheimer’s and atherosclerosis, and amyloid fibrils of a C-terminal apoE fragment is postulated to play a role in β-amyloid deposition and senile plaque formation (17Mucchiano G.I.

The formation of amyloid fibrils by apolipoproteins may be promoted by macromolecular crowding (30Gordon D. Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4600-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), dissociation of exchangeable apolipoproteins from lipoproteins (37Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4914-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or displacement of apolipoproteins from the surface of lipoproteins by acute phase proteins such as serum amyloid A (32Hatters D.M.

Furthermore, hypercholesterolemia has been suggested to upregulate macrophage expression of apolipoproteins in the artery wall through LXR-induced transcription of the apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster (24Mak P.A. Laffitte B.A. Desrumaux C. Joseph S.B. Curtiss L.K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31900-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of LXR by oxysterols in macrophage foam cells may result in increased levels of lipid-free apolipoproteins in the subendothelial space that would be amenable to amyloid conformation. Consistent with our finding in human atheroma, the authors of this study identified apoC-II in murine aortic lesions that co-localized with macrophages (24Mak P.A. Laffitte B.A. Desrumaux C.

Currently, the immunologic reagents to distinguish fibrillar forms of apoC-II from monomeric forms do not exist. Classically, amyloid fibrils have been identified by the red-green birefringence of Congo Red under cross-polarized light. However this approach, although suitable for extensive deposits, is less suitable for the small deposits proposed by the present work. We demonstrate that apoC-II co-localizes in human atheroma with a marker for amyloid, SAP, and can be detected in proximity to macrophages where it would be expected to engage macrophage CD36 signal transduction. We also observed macrophage-associated apoC-II staining distinct from SAP-associated amyloid deposits. This probably represents new synthesized apoC-II that may be induced in macrophage foam cells. Studies evaluating the presence of amyloid in atherosclerotic plaque have reported the detection of amyloid fibrils in 16-59% of aortic lesions (17Mucchiano G.I. Haggqvist B. Sletten K. Westermark P. J. Pathol. 2001; 193: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Mucchiano G.I. Jonasson L. Haggqvist B. Einarsson E. Westermark P. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2001; 115: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to apolipoproteins, other proteins capable of forming amyloid have been detected in human atheroma that could engage CD36 signaling including β-amyloid and α1-antitrypsin (39De Meyer G.R. De Cleen D.M. Cooper S. Knaapen M.W. Jans D.M. Martinet W. Herman A.G. Bult H. Kockx M.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Tedgui A. Mallat Z. Circ.

Commun. 2000; 4: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of advanced human atherosclerotic plaques revealed the presence of β-amyloid peptide in activated perivascular macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase. In addition, a C-terminal cleavage product of the serine proteinase inhibitor α1-antitrypsin reported to form amyloid fibrils has been shown to induce monocyte inflammatory responses that can be blocked with CD36 antibodies in vitro (42Janciauskiene S. Moraga F. Lindgren S. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 158: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It seems likely that this α1-antitrypsin peptide engages the CD36 signaling cascade that we have described. Taken together, these data suggest that through recognition of amyloid proteins present in atherosclerotic lesions, CD36 may promote inflammation, re-enforcing the atherosclerotic effects of cholesterol."

However, when scanning the topological state of DNA, topo I may get trapped in the vicinity of DNA lesions and cause secondary DNA damage by an abortive mechanism (3Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This involves the formation of a DNA single strand break, covalent attachment of the enzyme to the 3′-phosphate terminus (cleavage complex), and inhibition of the DNA ligase activity of topo I (“stalled topo I”). Stalled topo I is a threat to genomic stability and cell life, since enzyme-bound nicked DNA can be converted into irreversible single or double strand breaks. In fact, the efficacy of camptothecins, a prominent class of anticancer drugs (also known as topo I poisons) is due to the stabilization of topo I cleavage complexes (4Li T.-K Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, a specific repair enzyme, tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) has evolved to counteract the secondary DNA damage of stalled topo I by removing the enzyme from the 3′-terminus. Nevertheless, a DNA single strand break is generated that needs to be repaired by the base excision repair machinery (5Yang S.-W. Burgin Jr., A.B. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A.

Mock automodification was carried out in the presence of 2 mm 3-aminobenzamide (AB). The products were purified by ultrafiltration on Microcon YM-30 membrane. Automodified or mock-modified enzymes were used freshly for DNA binding/cleavage assays or stored at –80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol. Free poly(ADP-ribose) was prepared as described previously (15Malanga M. Bachmann S. Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Althaus F.R. Anal.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Topo I Reactions—Purified human topoisomerase I (0.5 pmol) was incubated with 32P-5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide substrates (20,000–40,000 dpm; 20 fmol) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, including 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin either at 37 °C for 10 min or at 30 °C for 15 min (suicide substrate). Reactions were carried out in 20 μl (final volume) and stopped by adding 0.5 volumes of 3× Laemmli loading buffer. Covalent complexes of topoisomerase I with cleaved oligonucleotides were separated from the uncleaved substrates by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Camptothecin (CPT) was used at 20 μm concentration. Autoradiographic bands were quantified by scanning densitometry (Amersham Biosciences); for a representative set of samples, the densitometric quantification of enzyme-bound and free DNA was paralleled by liquid scintillation counting of excised radioactive bands. The fraction of the oligonucleotide substrate in the cleavage complex ranged between 2–5% and 10–25%, in the absence or presence of CPT, respectively. Poly(ADP-ribose), either PARP-bound or as free polymer, was present in the reaction mixtures at the amounts indicated in the legends to Figs. 1, 2, 3 (pmol quantities refer to the ADP-ribose unit); reactions were started by the addition of the radioalabeled oligonucleotide substrates. For reversal experiments, topo I-DNA complexes were allowed to form over 10-min incubation in the conditions described above, then either poly(ADP-ribose) or 0.35 m NaCl (12Pourquier P. Ueng L.M.

After SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, the remaining cleavage complexes were quantified by scanning densitometry. For reversal kinetics, the complex formed before any addition was set at 100% and percentage data were plotted on a semilogarithmic scale against time. The religation constant (kr) was calculated by fitting these data to the equation Ct = C0e–krt (where Ct = percent remaining cleavage complex at the end of the incubation time, t; C0 = percent cleavage complex at t0 = 100). kr values were converted to half-life (t½) values according to the equation t½ = ln 2/kr (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Binding of topo I to dsDNA was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift (19Shuman S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 65-74PubMed Google Scholar). Topo I (45 ng) was incubated with 20 fmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotide, in the conditions described above. At the end of the incubation time, half the reaction mixtures (10 μl) were withdrawn, mixed with 0.25 volumes of loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15% Ficoll, 0.05% bromphenol blue), and electrophoresed on native 6% polyacrylamide gel. The remaining half of the reactions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to evaluate the potential contribution of covalent complexes to the mobility shift. In the conditions used to visualize the noncovalent topo I-DNA complex, the cleavage conjugate was undetectable. Poly(ADP-ribose) Binding Assay—The noncovalent binding of poly(ADP-ribose) to topo I (and other proteins) was determined as described previously (20Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1762-1764Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Purified proteins were either dot blotted or transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane after electrophoretic separation on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Bound poly(ADP-ribose) was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scintillation counting of excised radioactive dots. Western blotted proteins were gold stained using the Protogold staining kit (British BioCell International), as recommended by the manufacturer. Poly(ADP-ribose) Regulates the Formation of Topo I Cleavage Complexes—The data in Fig. 1A show that PARP-1 and PARP-2 block the formation of topo I covalent complex with DNA only in the poly ADP-ribosylated form, while the unmodified enzymes, incubated under identical conditions with the inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (AB), were completely ineffective. Moreover, PARP-1 and 2 were still effective, when topo I complex formation was strongly enhanced in the presence of CPT (Fig. 1A, bottom) but again only after the enzymes had been automodified with ADP-ribose polymers. These data suggested that the ADP-ribose polymers attached to PARP-1 or PARP-2 could be responsible for the inhibitory effects on topo I complex formation. Direct evidence for this is shown in Fig. 1B. Free ADP-ribose polymers detached from PARP-1 or PARP-2 expressed the full inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), while a 4-fold excess (w:w) of a 39-nucleotide single-stranded DNA did not influence the reaction (Fig. 1C, right panel). Degradation of polymers to monomeric ADP-ribose, using poly(ADP-ribose)glycohydrolase (PARG), completely abolished the inhibitory principle (Fig. 1C, left panel). Poly(ADP-ribose) could prevent the initial DNA binding of topo I, which then would preclude subsequent formation of covalent complexes. Fig. 2A shows that DNA binding, as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, was not affected by ADP-ribose polymers at quantities up to 20 pmol that completely blocked covalent complex formation (Fig. 1). Also, ADP-ribose polymers did not accelerate dissociation of topo I already bound to DNA after a 10 min preincubation (Fig. 2A, lane 5). On the other hand, 0.35 m NaCl was sufficient to prevent formation of topo I-DNA noncovalent complexes as well as to dissociate them (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 6). It should be mentioned that in these types of analyses (see also Fig. 2D) the shifted topo I-DNA complexes always migrated as two discrete bands. The high purity of the topo I preparations (see “Materials and Methods”) and the fact that both bands were reduced when incubation was carried on in the presence of anti-topo I antibodies, but not in the presence of nonspecific immunoglobulins (data not shown), argue against DNA binding by protein contaminants. It seems also unlikely that the two complexes result from DNA binding of differently sized topo I fragments. In fact, in Western blot analyses, a single component of the expected molecular weight was detected by polyclonal anti-topo I antibodies (Fig. 2A, right panel); in addition, topo I, either labeled by covalent binding to radiolabeled oligonucleotides (Figs. 1, 2, 3) or by noncovalent interaction with [32P]poly(ADP-ribose) (Fig. 4), migrated as a single band in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Thus, generation of different conformers of topo I-DNA complexes as well as binding of one or two topo I molecules/oligonucleotide molecule might underlie the peculiar electrophoretic behavior under native conditions. On the other hand, topo I dimers have been shown to form both in vitro (21Soe K. Dianov G. Nasheuer H.-P. Bohr V.A. Grosse F. Stevnsner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3195-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and in vivo (22Mao Y. Okada S. Chang L.-S. Muller M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4538-4543PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribose) Affects Both the Forward and Reverse DNA Transesterification Reaction of Topo I, but with Opposite Effects—The reduced yield of cleavage complexes in the presence of poly(ADP-ribose) could be explained by either inhibition of DNA cleavage (forward transesterification reaction) or by a shift in the cleavage/religation equilibrium in favor of religation (reverse transesterification reaction). To examine whether poly(ADP-ribose) could affect DNA cleavage, the oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 2B was used as a suicide substrate for topo I: in fact the enzyme becomes trapped in the covalent complex (suicide complex), since the cleavage reaction generates a free trinucleotide with the 5′-OH end that is lost by diffusion and hence religation becomes impossible (12Pourquier P. Ueng L.M. Fertala J. Wang D. Park H.J. Essigmann J.M. Bjornsti M.A. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8516-8523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The results of Fig. 2B demonstrate that poly(ADP-ribose) is a potent inhibitor of DNA cleavage by topo I: as little as 1 pmol of polymeric ADP-ribose was sufficient for complete inhibition (Fig. 2B). Conversely, poly(ADP-ribose) had no effect on preformed suicide complexes (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 6). Again, inhibition of DNA cleavage was also achieved with poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 and PARP-2 (Fig. 2, C and D) but not with the unmodified enzymes (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). Incidentally, noncovalent topo I binding to the suicide substrate was equally unaffected by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 and PARP-2 (Fig. 2D), as has been observed with the reversible cleavage substrate (Fig. 2A). Next we determined whether poly(ADP-ribose) could reverse preformed covalent topo I-DNA conjugates by stimulating the religation activity of topo I. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3A, complex formation was allowed to proceed for 10 and 20 min in the absence or presence of camptothecin. Under these conditions, a steady state level of cleavage complexes was reached within 10 min. Following addition of ADP-ribose polymers, the topo I-DNA complexes disappeared (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Strikingly, this was also observed with the complexes stabilized in the presence of camptothecin (Fig. 3A, lane 6), indicating that poly(ADP-ribose) is able to overcome the poisoning effect of the drug. Removal of cleavage complexes was achieved with poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 (Fig. 3B) or PARP-2 (not shown) but not with the unmodified enzymes (Fig. 3B, lane 6), emphasizing that polymers are essential for this effect. It should be noted that due to the strong inhibition exerted by poly(ADP-ribose) on the DNA cleavage reaction (Fig. 2, B–D), the disappearance of cleavage complexes in these reversal experiments was essentially dependent on the rate of religation. Uncoupling of cleavage and religation reactions can also be achieved by increasing salt concentration. In fact 0.35 m NaCl blocks cleavage, probably by interfering with de novo binding of the enzyme to DNA (Refs. 12Pourquier P. Ueng L.M. Fertala J. Wang D. Park H.J. Essigmann J.M.

The effect of CPT is also reversed under such conditions (17Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7200-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A comparison of the religation kinetics in the presence of either poly(ADP-ribose) or 0.35 m NaCl indicated that DNA strand break resealing by topo I is indeed accelerated by poly(ADP-ribose) (Fig. 3, C and D): the half-life of cleavage complexes was more than 2-fold shorter in the presence of poly(ADP-ribose). Taken together, these results suggest that the low yield of cleavage complexes (Fig. 1) and the efficient reversal of such complexes (Fig. 3) may arise from two opposing actions of poly(ADP-ribose): inhibition of DNA cleavage (Fig. 2) and stimulation of the topo I religation activity (Fig. 3). Poly(ADP-ribose) Binds Noncovalently to Topo I—With their long polymeric arms, members of the PARP family can reach out to bind specific proteins (23Realini C. Althaus F.R. J. Biol.

Several DNA damage checkpoint proteins are targeted in this manner and the mechanism involves one or several poly(ADP-ribose)-binding sequence motifs in the target protein (27Pleschke J.M.

The motif, a 20–25-amino acid sequence with regularly spaced hydrophobic residues, interspersed with basic residues and flanking arginines and lysines, was found to occur at three conserved sites in the topo I sequence (Fig. 4A). These sites are located in structurally and functionally distinct protein domains (28Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar): two sequences, comprising amino acids 261–280 and 532–550, are in the core DNA-binding domain but at opposite sites of the clamp formed by the enzyme around DNA; a third polymer-binding site (sequence 669–688) is in the linker domain. The latter connects the DNA-binding and C-terminal domains and has a regulatory role on the overall reaction as it slows down the religation step and thereby facilitates DNA relaxation (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J.

Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1762-1764Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) directly confirmed that topo I belongs to the family of poly(ADP-ribose)-binding proteins (Fig. 4, B and C). In the dot blot assay (Fig. 4B), about 1 pmol of polymeric ADP-ribose/pmol of protein bound to topo I and histone H1 (positive control) immobilized on nitrocellulose. Poly(ADP-ribose) binding also occurred after electrophoretic separation and Western blotting of these proteins (Fig. 4C). Mapping the poly(ADP-ribose)-binding sites into the published crystal structure of human topo I (28Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) provided a plausible explanation for the differential effects of ADP-ribose polymers on specific domain functions. First, the polymer-binding regions have no primary role in the DNA binding of topo I, which may explain why poly(ADP-ribose), while interacting with the free enzyme (Fig. 4, B and C), does not affect topo I-DNA noncovalent complexes (Fig. 2, A and D). On the other hand, the sequence comprising amino acids 532–550 is located into core subdomain III that largely contributes to the formation of the catalytic site: binding of poly(ADP-ribose) at this site may underlie the strong inhibition of the DNA cleavage reaction. The cap region of topo I (residues 175–433), which includes the poly(ADP-ribose)-binding sequence 261–280, is also essential for DNA cleavage (30Yang Z. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30815-30823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). How poly(ADP-ribose) counteracts CPT action and accelerates DNA religation is less obvious and requires further considerations. The x-ray crystal structures of human topo I in covalent complex with DNA in the absence and presence of a CPT analogue, topotecan, have revealed the mode of binding of the drug and clarified important mechanistic aspects of topo I poisoning (31Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin Jr., A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 99: 15387-15392Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Topotecan binds to the DNA-enzyme complex by intercalating into DNA at the site of cleavage and displacing the nucleophilic 5′-OH end of the cleaved strand: thus, religation is prevented. The comparison of the structure of the ternary (enzyme-DNA-drug) and binary (enzyme-DNA) complexes also showed that the most dramatic changes involved the linker domain, which could be visualized in the electron density map only after drug binding. Interestingly, deletion of the linker domain, either total (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or partial (32Ireton G.C. Stewart L. Parker L.H. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25820-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), or even a single amino acid substitution (33Fiorani P. Bruselles A. Falconi M. Chillemi G. Desideri A. Benedetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43268-43275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) make the enzyme insensitive to CPT. Altogether, these observations point to an involvement of this domain in the stabilization of the ternary complex. It should be noted that the linker-associated poly(ADP-ribose)-binding site (amino acids 669–688) is likely to be the most (if not the only) accessible one to the polymer when topo I is engaged in the cleavage complex. Thus, we speculate that targeting of the linker domain by poly(ADP-ribose) may have a dual effect: (i) it may induce conformational changes that destabilize the CPT binding pocket and reposition the broken DNA strand so that ligation can occur (neutralization of CPT poisoning; Fig. 3); (ii) it may alleviate the restrains imposed by the linker domain on DNA religation (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), which would explain the reduced half-life of cleavage complexes (Fig. 3, C and D). In conclusion, both PARP-1 and PARP-2 are able to disjoin covalent DNA complexes and induce the reversal of DNA breaks that are formed when topo I gets stalled in the vicinity of DNA lesions. DNA breaks are also the activating signal for PARP-1 and PARP-2 (7Schreiber V. Amé J.C. Dolle P. Schultz I. Rinaldi B. Fraulob V. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol.

Thus, an important aspect of PARP-1 and PARP-2 function in preserving genomic stability of cells is to deploy polymers to sites of stalled topo I. By contrast to the topo I removal mechanism catalyzed by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (5Yang S.-W. Burgin Jr., A.B. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2003; 112: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), this PARP-based rescue mechanism has an immediate impact on the genomic stability of cells, as it is activated within seconds and does not leave an unfilled DNA gap. Our data also bear on the design of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancers. As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, poly(ADP-ribose) may counteract the effects of the cancer therapeutic drug camptothecin and contribute to drug resistance. Thus, the efficacy of camptothecin-mimetic drugs can be enhanced by combination with PARP inhibitors. The in vivo relevance supporting this concept has already been demonstrated: cancer cells with compromised PARP-1 function are hypersensitive to camptothecin (34Chatterjee S. Cheng M.F. Trivedi D. Petzold S.J. Berger N.A. Cancer Commun. 1989; 1: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the cytotoxicity of topo I-targeted drugs is enhanced by PARP inhibitors (35Bowman K.J.

Finally, the differential effects of poly(ADP-ribose) on particular domain functions of topo I, i.e. the DNA cleavage and ligation reactions, can be exploited by site-specific targeting, and this opens new perspectives for the design of novel topo I-based anticancer drugs."

We determined the effects of two glitazones, ciglitazone and the therapeutic rosiglitazone, on the survival of serum-deprived primary rat astrocytes and glioma cell lines C6 and U251, which were assessed by the methylthiazolyl tetrazolium assay and lactate dehydrogenase release. Rosiglitazone (5–20 μm) decreased survival of glioma cells without affecting primary astrocytes, whereas ciglitazone at 20 μm was toxic for both cell types. Ciglitazone at 10 μm was cytoprotective for primary astrocytes but toxic to glioma cells. Cell death induced by ciglitazone, but not rosiglitazone, presented apoptotic features (Hoechst staining and externalization of phosphatidylserine). Two mechanisms to explain cytotoxicity were investigated: activation of PPARγ and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PPARγ does not seem to be the main mechanism involved, because the order of efficacy for cytotoxicity, ciglitazone > rosiglitazone, was inverse of their reported affinities for activating PPARγ.

Black P.M. Brown E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the effects of rosiglitazone on astrocyte viability have not been tested yet. The main goal of this study was to compare the effects of rosiglitazone and ciglitazone on the survival of astrocytes and astroglioma cells and to identify the mechanisms behind their toxicity. Our results indicate that rosiglitazone is less cytotoxic than ciglitazone, and that glioma cells in culture are more sensitive than primary astrocytes. Although the most established mechanism of action of glitazones is activation of PPARγ, we found that the major mechanism mediating glitazone-induced glial cell death is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because glitazones cause mitochondrial depolarization in our system, mitochondria are the most likely source of these ROS. Finally, the toxicity of glitazones on glioma cells and the relative resistance of astrocytes suggest that glitazones may hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of astrogliomas, which are among the most common brain tumors. Chemicals—Rosiglitazone was a generous gift of GlaxoSmithKline. 15d-PG J2, ciglitazone, and WY14643 were purchased from Tocris (Ballwin, MO). GW9662 was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), and annexin V conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) was obtained from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum and glutamine were obtained from Invitrogen. Rabbit PPARγ primary antibody, and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The PPARγ reporter construct J3.Tk.pGL3 was kindly provided by Dr. B. Staels (Pasteur Institute, Lille, France). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture—Primary rat cortical astrocytes were cultured according to a modification of the method of McCarthy and deVellis (24McCarthy K.D. deVellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebral hemispheres were aseptically removed from new-born (2–4 days) animals, and cortices were incubated in trypsin-EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. Tissue was then mechanically dissociated and resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were grown in 150-cm2 culture flasks for 13–14 days. Astrocytes were purified from other glial cells by shaking the flasks overnight before subculturing. The astroglioma cell lines C6 (rat) and U251 (human) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium-F12, supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. Experimental Design—In all experiments, cells were plated 24 h before treatments, and serum was removed from cell media at the time of drug additions. For the methyl-thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays cells were plated into 96-well culture plates. Six replicate wells were used for each treatment. Cell density was 104 cells/well for glioma cell lines and 1.5 × 104 cells/well for primary astrocytes. Both assays were performed 48 h after treatment. For Western blot analysis, cells were plated in 100-mm diameter dishes and used when cell density was close to confluence. Cells used for transfection or cytometric analysis of either ROS production or apoptosis were plated in 24-well culture plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well for both glioma and primary astrocyte cultures. For glutathione (GSH) determination, cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 105 cells/well. For the controls, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was added at the same concentration as in the corresponding drug treatment. MTT Assay—MTT is a yellow-colored tetrazolium salt that is reduced to a purple formazan (25Altman F.P. Histochem. J. 1976; 8: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The MTT assay assesses cell viability by measuring mitochondrial function (26Twentyman P.R. Luscombe M. Br. J. Cancer. 1987; 56: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). 100 μl/well of a 0.5 mg/ml stock MTT solution in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium was added to cells. The purple formazan crystals were allowed to develop for 45 min at 37 °C. Finally, the MTT-containing medium was removed, and 100 μlof Me2SO was added to each well. Absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad M-550) at 570 nm with a reference filter at 655 nm. LDH Assay—LDH is a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon cell lysis. LDH released to cell culture media by dead cells, as well as LDH contained in living cells, were measured using the CytoTox 96 Kit (Promega). This assay is based upon the LDH-catalyzed oxidation of lactate to pyruvate in the presence of NAD, which is reduced to NADH. The formation of NADH is coupled with the reduction of a tetrazolium salt, measured photometrically at 490 nm on a 96-well plate reader (Bio-Rad M-550). Hoechst 33342 Staining—The nuclear morphology of cells was studied by using the cell-permeable DNA dye Hoechst 33342. Cells with homogeneously stained nuclei were considered to be viable, whereas the presence of chromatin condensation and/or fragmentation was indicative of apoptosis. Hoechst 33342 staining as well as interference-contrast images were obtained by using a fluorescence photomicroscope (Leica DMRXA), with excitation centered at 360 nm, a 400-nm beam splitter, and emission longer than 425 nm. Flow Cytometry Analysis of Apoptotic Cells—C6 glioma cells and primary astrocytes were harvested and stained simultaneously with annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 and propidium iodide (PI), according to the vendor instructions (Molecular Probes). Early apoptotic cells were distinguished from other cells with a BD-LSR flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). During apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, where it can be detected by annexin V conjugates. Cells that were positive for annexin V and negative for PI were considered to be early apoptotic. Annexin V-negative/PI-negative cells were considered living cells, and cells positive for both annexin V and PI were designated dead cells (necrotic plus late apoptotic cells). Western Blotting—Cell lysates were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (20 μg/lane), electrophoresed, and subsequently transferred to nylon membranes (Pall Corporation, Ann Harbor, MI). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). Incubation of membranes with a rabbit primary antibody specific for PPARγ and an anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was done following manufacturer instructions. An enhanced chemiluminescence system was used for visualization. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—The reporter construct for PPARγ J3.Tk.pGL3 was transfected into C6 glioma cells. This construct contains an apoAII gene promoter PPAR response element cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter in the pGL3 luciferase expression vector. Transient transfections were performed in triplicate on 35-mm dishes using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). All cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase to normalize the variations in cell number and transfection efficiency. Rosiglitazone, ciglitazone, or vehicle were added 16 h after transfection. Cells were lysed 24 h after treatments, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase assays (Promega) were performed according to the vendor instructions. Intracellular ROS Production—Cells were incubated with the cell-permeant dye H2DCF-DA, that intracellularly de-esterifies to dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2DCF). ROS oxidize H2DCF to the brightly fluorescent compound 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), which was monitored by flow cytometry following a previously described method (28Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells treated with glitazones or vehicle (Me2SO) were incubated with 5 μm H2DCF-DA for 15 min at 37 °C, detached from the plate with trypsin/EDTA, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in ice-cold PBS, and used immediately for flow cytometry. Triplicate samples were run in each experiment, and at least 5000 cells per sample were analyzed. Mean fluorescence was calculated by using the program CellQuest. GSH Determination—Levels of reduced GSH were determined using monochlorobimane. GSH is specifically conjugated with monochlorobimane to form a fluorescent bimane-GSH adduct in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases (29Shrieve D.C. Bump E.A. Rice G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14107-14114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the bimane-GSH adduct increases during the initial 10 to 12 min of this reaction with first order kinetics before leveling off (30Young P.R. White A.L.C. Dzido G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fluorescence levels at 15 min were used as an indication of intracellular GSH content, as it has been described previously (29Shrieve D.C. Bump E.A. Rice G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14107-14114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS (37 °C) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of PBS containing 80 mm monochlorobimane. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped in 500 ml of 0.2% Triton X-100, centrifuged, and 300 μl of the extracts were used for GSH determination. Fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm in a fluorometer (LS50B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—C6 cells were grown in 22-mm round glass coverslips and 24–36 h after seeding cells were washed two times with Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing 5 mm glucose and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were loaded with 0.1 μm of TMRE for 20 min at room temperature and protected from direct light. After that, coverslips were transferred to a microscopy chamber (Attofluor, Molecular Probes, The Netherlands) and maintained in the presence of 0.1 μm TMRE. Cell fluorescence was imaged with an epifluorescence inverted microscope (DMIRE-2, Leica Microsystems, Germany) equipped with an oil immersion 40× objective (numerical aperture 1.25). Fluorescence was excited at 545 nm using a monochromator (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan), and emitted light was collected by a charge-coupled device camera (Orca-ER, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). The interference filter used for emission was 635 ± 27 nm, and the dichroic mirror was 570DRL (Omega Optical). Regions of interest (over the nuclei and perinuclear cytoplasm) were selected manually, and pixel intensities were spatially averaged after background subtraction. A binning of two was used to improve signal/noise and minimize photobleaching of TMRE and photodamage to the cells. All images and data were acquired and analyzed by using the Aquacosmos software (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as percentage of control treated with the appropriate vehicle (Me2SO). Values represent mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of 3–6 replicate wells. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Student’s t test when multiple comparisons were made. Effects of Glitazones on the Viability of Astroglial Cells—Cell viability was assessed by the MTT reduction method 48 h after glitazone treatment of serum-deprived rat primary astrocytes, rat glioma C6 cells, and human glioma U251 cells. Serum withdrawal progressively reduces the viability of cells, allowing the study of both the cytotoxic and cytoprotective actions of glitazones. Our results showed that ciglitazone and rosiglitazone affect astroglial cell viability in a dose-dependent and cell-specific manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, ciglitazone caused death of glioma cells at doses (5–15 μm) that did not decrease astrocyte survival. However, at 20 μm, ciglitazone was toxic to both glioma cells and primary astrocytes. Rosiglitazone had no effect on primary astrocyte viability but was toxic for both glioma cell lines, with the highest effect at the dose of 20 μm.In any case, rosiglitazone was much less cytotoxic than ciglitazone. Ciglitazone is, therefore, a potent inhibitor of astroglial survival, whereas rosiglitazone is a weaker inhibitor and affects only glioma cells. An interesting observation was that not all concentrations of ciglitazone had a toxic effect on primary astrocytes. At 10 μm ciglitazone, MTT values were higher than in vehicle-treated controls. This increase in MTT reduction was not due to a stimulation of astrocyte proliferation, because ciglitazone decreased thymidine incorporation in these cells. 2J. M. Pérez-Ortiz and P. Tranque, unpublished results. This cytoprotective effect of ciglitazone on primary astrocytes was never observed with rosiglitazone. We determined the cell viability of C6 cells and astrocytes treated with other PPAR ligands (see Fig. 1, C and D): the PPARγ agonist 15d-PG J2 and the PPARα agonist WY14643. The ligand 15d-PG J2 was able to induce cell death in a dose-dependent manner in all glial cell types tested, being more toxic for primary astrocytes than for C6 glioma cells. In contrast, cell viability was unaffected by WY14643 at all doses and cell types studied (up to 100 μm). Cell protection was never observed after treatment with 15d-PG J2 or WY14643. These results indicate that PPARγ ligands other than glitazones, but not PPARα ligands, can cause astroglial cell death in our experimental system. However, the decrease in cell survival induced by ciglitazone was more severe than that caused by either 15d-PG J2 or rosiglitazone, and the cell type selectivity of ciglitazone was different from that of 15d-PG J2, which suggested that different mechanisms were at work. MTT reduction depends not only on cell death, but also on variations of cell number which may occur in cycling populations and on the function of mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Therefore, we measured LDH released from glial cells to the medium as another marker of cell viability, though less affected by proliferative and metabolic changes. Although ciglitazone at concentrations of 15 and 20 μm increased LDH leakage in C6 cells more than 70%, primary astrocytes were affected only with 20 μm ciglitazone. Rosiglitazone at 10 and 20 μm increased LDH release in C6 cells more modestly than ciglitazone (less than 30% increase) and had no effect on primary astrocytes at any of the doses studied. Thus, the results of the LDH assays (Fig. 2) confirm the MTT data (Fig. 1), suggesting that ciglitazone strongly decreases glioma cell viability, that rosiglitazone is a weaker inhibitor, and that astrocytes are less sensitive to glitazone toxicity than glioma cells. Induction of Apoptotic Cell Death by Glitazones—Cell death caused by glitazones was monitored by Hoechst 33342 staining (Fig. 3). Glioma cells and primary astrocytes treated for 48 h with 20 μm ciglitazone exhibited apoptosis features consisting of chromatin margination and condensation in cell nuclei. However, we were unable to detect glioma cells or primary astrocytes showing condensed nuclear material or other signs of increased apoptosis after rosiglitazone treatment (20 μm). Both glitazones decreased cell density in C6 glioma cells, as observed in interference contrast images. In addition, ciglitazone decreased cell density in primary astrocytes and induced cell shrinkage in both astrocytes and C6 glioma cells. To further characterize apoptosis, we performed an annexin V/PI assay by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A), which allows quantitative and statistical analysis of live, apoptotic, and dead cell populations (Fig. 4B). Ciglitazone at 20 μm induced apoptosis in both C6 glioma and primary astrocyte cells. After 24 h of ciglitazone exposure, the percentage of early apoptotic and dead glioma cells was, respectively, 150 and 660% higher than controls. When the treatment with ciglitazone was extended to 48 h, we observed a reduction in the number of early apoptotic cells and a further increase in the number of dead cells (results not shown), which can be explained by a progression of cells to a later apoptotic stage with time. Primary astrocytes were also sensitive to 20 μm ciglitazone, although their response was delayed compared with glioma cells. After 48-hour treatment, there was an 85% increase in early apoptotic cells and a 180% increase in dead astrocytes. Rosiglitazone (20 μm) caused an increase in the number of dead glioma cells close to 900% within 24 h. However, glioma cells did not show any statistically significant increase in the number of early apoptotic cells 24 or 48 h after rosiglitazone addition (results only shown for 24-hour treatments). In conclusion, rosiglitazone is able to cause death of glioma cells but, unlike ciglitazone, we did not find any evidence of apoptosis. Also, in agreement with the Hoechst staining data (Fig. 3), rosiglitazone did not significantly change the percentage of apoptotic or dead cells in primary astrocytes. Dependence of Astroglial Cell Death Caused by Glitazones on PPARγ —To explore whether PPARγ mediates the actions of glitazones on astroglial cell viability described above, we first evaluated PPARγ expression by the astroglial cells used in our experiments. Constitutive expression of PPARγ in primary astrocytes and glioma cell lines C6 and U251 was examined by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). Our results confirm the presence of PPARγ in all cell types studied. PPARγ appeared as a single band of 50 kDa, and its identity was confirmed by comparison with PPARγ induced in primary macrophage cultures stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and interferon γ (data not shown). These results are in agreement with previous reports, which have detected PPARγ in astroglial cells by PCR (23Chattopadhyay N. Singh D.P. Heese O. Godbole M.M. Sinohara T. Black P.M. Brown E.M. J.

Moreover, PPARγ expressed in glioma C6 cells was transcriptionally functional, as demonstrated by ligand-dependent induction of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter containing a PPARγ-response element (Fig. 5B). The fact that ciglitazone strongly decreases glioma cell viability, whereas rosiglitazone is a weaker inhibitor, is in sharp contrast with the"

We present data indicating that rapid collapse of endothelial tubular networks in vitro occurs in a dose-dependent manner after administration of microtubule-depolymerizing reagents but not after actin depolymerization. Pretreatment of endothelial cell networks with C3 exoenzyme or recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative RhoA resulted in complete blockade of tube collapse, indicating a role for RhoA in these events. Microtubule depolymerization also resulted in activation of RhoA, whereas increased expression of constitutively active RhoA induced cell rounding and apoptosis of endothelial cells. Furthermore, following treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent vinblastine, rapid capillary tube network collapse occurred followed by endothelial cell apoptosis. Vinblastine, but not control agents, induced cleavage of procaspase-3, procaspase-9, and procaspase-8, along with the known caspase targets p21-activated kinase-2 and gelsolin, indicating that tube collapse caused a defined apoptotic response. Using a model of vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo, vinblastine treatment also resulted in collapse and apoptosis of angiogenic blood vessels. Apoptotic endothelial cells stained strongly for cleaved caspase-3, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining revealed fragmented nuclei in vinblastine-treated but not control angiogenic areas. Together, these findings indicate that microtubule-depolymerizing agents directly induce endothelial network collapse in vitro and in vivo leading to endothelial cell apoptosis in a manner dependent on the small GTPase, RhoA. In addition, these findings reveal a novel function for microtubule disrupting chemotherapeutic agents, namely their ability to rapidly collapse newly formed angiogenic vessels, which may contribute to their effectiveness in limiting angiogenesis and tumor growth.

The development of an angiogenic blood supply from the existing vasculature is critical for solid tumor progression (1Folkman J. D'Amore P.A.

Blood vessel formation both in vivo and in vitro is intricately regulated by a number of factors including extracellular matrix, growth factors, membrane-bound proteinases, and integrins (3Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar, 4Davis G.E. Mavila A. Bayless K. Anat. Rec. 2002; 268: 252-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Signal generation by these molecules is critically integrated with intracellular cues that lead to cytoskeletal rearrangements that orchestrate the various steps in angiogenesis including endothelial cell (EC) 1The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PAK-2, p21-activated kinase-2; Bcl-2, B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CAM, chorioallantoic membrane; vWF, von Willebrand factor; Vbl, vinblastine; CCB, cytochalasin B; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone. 1The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PAK-2, p21-activated kinase-2; Bcl-2, B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CAM, chorioallantoic membrane; vWF, von Willebrand factor; Vbl, vinblastine; CCB, cytochalasin B; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone. proliferation, branching, sprouting, and lumen formation (4Davis G.E. Mavila A. Bayless K. Anat. Rec. 2002; 268: 252-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons play a key role in the formation and maintenance of EC shape changes as well as cell proliferation. Therefore, the cytoskeleton is a critical component regulating the complex series of signaling events that dictate EC shape changes (e.g. morphogenesis) occurring during angiogenesis. We have a particular interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms through which ECs not only assemble into tubes but also maintain those structures. We have identified previously that Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases are required for ECs to initiate lumen formation and undergo morphogenesis when placed in three dimensions (5Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting new question is to determine how members of the Rho GTPase family function in maintaining the shape of EC tubular structures. Endothelial cells undergoing morphogenesis form lumens and branched structures, assembling into tubes, when placed in either three-dimensional collagen or fibrin matrices (5Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J.

Here, established EC networks are treated with microtubule- and actin-disrupting agents to determine which cytoskeletal components are necessary to maintain tubular structures. Microtubule perturbation is an effective chemotherapeutic strategy in cancer therapy. Generally, microtubule-depolymerizing agents are thought to interfere with the cell cycle, which limits tumor and EC proliferation. Recent studies (11O'Connor D.S. Wall N.R. Porter A.C.G. Altieri D.C. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) have indicated a direct relationship between the state of microtubules and the process of apoptosis through anti-apoptotic proteins such as survivin. Furthermore, past studies indicate the ability of the pro-apoptotic protein, p53, to bind microtubules and be released from them following microtubule depolymerization (12Maxwell S.A. Ames S.K. Sawai E.T. Decker G.L. Cook R.G. Butel J.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 115-127PubMed Google Scholar). Vinblastine is a vinca alkaloid that is utilized as an effective chemotherapeutic agent (13Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 152-276Google Scholar). It acts as a reversible microtubule-collapsing agent, and in combination with other therapies, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor antagonism, has proven to be an effective tumor and angiogenesis regression agent in animal models (14Kerbel R.S.

We show here that vinblastine and other microtubule-depolymerizing agents rapidly collapse both endothelial cell tubular networks in vitro and angiogenic blood vessels in vivo. Furthermore, these agents induced EC apoptosis that followed the tube collapse in both in vitro and in vivo models of angiogenic vessel development that is dependent on the small GTPase RhoA. Reagents—Microtubule-disrupting agents vinblastine sulfate, nocodazole, colchicine, and cytochalasin B were purchased from Calbiochem and Sigma. Rat tail collagen type I was isolated using the method described previously (18Bornstein M.B. Lab. Investig. 1958; 7: 134-137PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue culture reagents unless otherwise specified were obtained from Invitrogen. SDS-PAGE reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. Unless otherwise specified, all other reagents were from Sigma. Antibodies for Western blot analysis were directed against caspase-3 (monoclonal, BD Pharmingen), cleaved caspase-3 (polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), caspase-8 (monoclonal, BD Pharmingen), caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technology), actin (monoclonal, Oncogene Research), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (monoclonal, Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ), PAK-2 (polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), and gelsolin (monoclonal, Sigma). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and grown as described from passages 2 to 6 (19Davis G.E. Camarillo C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells were removed with trypsin-EDTA, neutralized with fetal bovine serum, and centrifuged. Cells were washed once in M199 to remove serum before being resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Three-dimensional Collagen Assays—Collagen gels (25 μl) were prepared as described (6Davis G.E. Camarillo C. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 3.75 mg/ml. Endothelial cell final concentration was 1 × 106 cells/ml. Gels were placed into 4.5-mm culture wells (Corning Costar), allowed to polymerize, and equilibrated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Serum-free culture media (100 μl/well) contained M199 with reduced serum II supplement (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 40 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and VEGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 50 ng/ml phorbol ester. Cultures were allowed to develop for 24–48 h before cytoskeletal disrupting agents were introduced. Structures were allowed to collapse from 1–19 h before being fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Following fixation, cultures were stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 30% methanol and destained with water. Gels were photographed using an upright Nikon microscope mounted with an Olympus camera and Kodachrome 64T color slide film. Digital images were captured from slides using a Polaroid Sprint-Scan 4000 and PolaColor Insight Software (Polaroid, Cambridge, MA). Live cultures were photographed using phase contrast microscopy using a Nikon Labophot microscope equipped with a Nikon FX-35A camera. Alternatively, protein extracts were made by placing gels in heated sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol at various times following addition of cytoskeletal disrupting reagents. Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Assay—Fertilized eggs were obtained from the Texas A&M University Poultry Science Center (College Station, TX). Eggs were humidified, rotating continuously for 3 days before initiating shell-less culture. Eggs were wiped with betadine and cracked into sterile weigh boats (VWR) containing appropriate dilutions of antibiotic, fungizone, and gentamycin (Invitrogen). Embryos were covered and placed in a humidified incubator (37 °C). One week later, angiogenesis was induced. Human dermal fibroblast monolayers were grown in 75-cm2 flasks and infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 165 isoform. Production and propagation of all adenoviruses used here were accomplished as described previously in detail (5Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a system provided by Vogelstein and co-workers (20He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). After 24 h of infection, fibroblasts producing VEGF165 were resuspended in three-dimensional collagen gels (3.75 mg/ml). Gels (50 μl) were equilibrated and placed directly on the CAM and anchored with pre-wetted sterile nitrocellulose membrane. Angiogenesis was allowed to develop for 3 days (to day 13) before microtubule-collapsing agents were administered. Vinblastine (10 mm) and vehicle control were diluted to 100, 10, and 1 μm doses, and 10 μl of these solutions were added to collagen gels and surrounding angiogenic vessels. Vessels were given two doses of vinblastine or methanol control (at 0 and 3 h), and angiogenic vessels were allowed to collapse for 7 h. The collagen gel and surrounding tissue were fixed in formalin, dissected, and embedded in paraffin for sectioning at the Texas A&M University Tissue Embedding Facility. Immunoperoxidase Staining and TUNEL Assays—Tissues were probed for von Willebrand factor (vWF) expression, cleaved caspase-3, and green fluorescent protein (GFP). The adenoviral system (20He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) used is designed so that adenovirally infected fibroblasts co-express GFP along with secretion of VEGF165. Formalin-fixed paraffin sections were cut 5 μm thick and deparaffinized in xylene. Sections were rehydrated through a series of graded ethanol washes before being placed in water. Antigens were unmasked using fresh 0.1% trypsin in 10 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were rinsed and incubated in 3% H2O2 for 15 min in the dark. After a wash in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were blocked with RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS for 30 min at room temperature. Polyclonal antisera raised to caspase-3 (BD Pharmingen), vWF (DAKO Laboratories) (21Ribatti D. Nico B. Vacca A. Roncali L. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and polyclonal anti-enhanced GFP antisera (5Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) purified using protein A-Sepharose were incubated overnight at 4 °C in humidified chambers. Antibody detection was accomplished using the Rabbit IgG Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the product insert. TUNEL staining was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Peroxidase was detected using AEC chromogen (DAKO) for 2–10 min. Reactions were stopped with water, and sections were counterstained using a 1:100 dilution of 0.5% toluidine blue and 1% sodium borate in water. Caspase-3 Inhibition and Detection—ZVAD-fmk (caspase inhibitor I) and Z-DEVD-fmk (caspase-3 inhibitor II) (Calbiochem) were suspended in Me2SO at 10 mm. ECs were suspended in collagen matrices and allowed to undergo morphogenesis. At 36 h of culture, 50 μm dose of ZVAD was added. At 48 h of culture, an additional 50 μm dose of ZVAD was added prior to collapse of luminal structures by 10 μm vinblastine. Extracts were collected and analyzed for caspase-3 expression and activation by Western blot analysis. Polyclonal antisera to cleaved caspase-3 fragments (Cell Signaling Technologies) and monoclonal antibodies recognizing pro-caspase-3 (BD Biosciences) were used at 1:1000 dilutions overnight in 4% milk. DEVD hydrolysis assays (Chemicon) were conducted by seeding confluent monolayers (60-mm dishes) overnight for 16 h. Cells were rinsed once in 5 ml of M199 and vinblastine, or vehicle control was added at 10 μm dose in M199 with reduced serum II supplement (1:250) for 3 h. Cells were harvested (250 μl) of assay buffer, incubated on ice for 10 min, and spun for 5 min at 4 °C. Assays were carried out at 37 °C according to manufacturer's instructions and read at A405. Microtubule Disruption Rapidly Induces Collapse of Capillary Tube Structures in Three-dimensional Collagen Matrices— Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms through which the structure of EC tubular networks are maintained. Initial experiments revealed that an intact microtubular cytoskeleton is necessary for endothelial cells undergoing morphogenesis in three dimensions to maintain their structure (Fig. 1). During the process of morphogenesis, endothelial cells suspended individually in three-dimensional collagen or fibrin matrices assemble into tubes to form lumens and branched structures that closely resemble capillary tubular networks (5Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Davis G.E. Camarillo C. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 7Salazar R.M.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2755-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether an intact microtubule or actin cytoskeleton is required to maintain these tubular structures, ECs were allowed to assemble into networks before treatment with various agents. The addition of the microtubule-disrupting agent vinblastine induced rapid collapse (occurring within 1 h), whereas the disruption of actin microfilaments with cytochalasin B had minor effects. Pretreatment with C3 exoenzyme, an inhibitor of the small GTPase Rho, interfered with the ability of vinblastine to collapse luminal structures, indicating Rho is required for this process. Similar to vinblastine, colchicine and nocodazole induced complete collapse of EC luminal structures that was also blocked by pretreatment with C3 exoenzyme (not shown). The microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol likewise induced collapse of EC luminal structures at 48 h, although not as complete as the collapse seen with microtubule-depolymerizing agents (not shown). No effects were observed with buffer controls. ECs forming tubular networks in three-dimensional collagen gels at 48 h were treated with varying doses of vinblastine, colchicine, and cytochalasin B (Fig. 2). Quantitation of collapse is shown where the addition of cytochalasin B up to 10 μm results in collapse of only 50% of luminal structures. In contrast, doses of vinblastine are ∼100 times more potent, and the addition of vinblastine collapsed 90% of luminal structures. Although the effects of colchicine are similar, the collapse response is not as complete compared with vinblastine. In other experiments, we determined the reversibility of the cytoskeletal disrupting agents. Drugs were removed after1hof collapse, and cultures were washed every 30 min for 3 h before new culture media were added. Interestingly, although the effects of cytochalasin B and nocodazole were reversible, as branched and luminal structures began to reform, cultures treated with vinblastine or colchicine were unable to recover over the next 24 h (data not shown). Vinblastine-induced Collapse of EC Structures Specifically Involves the Small GTPase RhoA—We further investigated the involvement of specific members of the Rho GTPase family using recombinant adenoviruses to deliver dominant negative forms of RhoA (N19RhoA), Rac1 (N17Rac1), and Cdc42 (N17Cdc42). ECs expressing these mutants were placed in three dimensions and allowed to undergo morphogenesis and form tube-like structures with lumens for 24 h prior to the addition of microtubule-depolymerizing agents (Fig. 3A). The addition of vinblastine, colchicine, and nocodazole completely induced collapse of tubular structures in ECs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), N17Rac1, and N17Cdc42. However, ECs expressing N19RhoA were completely resistant to the collapsing effect of microtubule depolymerization. These data are consistent with the blockade observed following pretreatment with C3 exoenzyme and indicate Rho activation, but not Rac or Cdc42, is required for EC luminal structures to collapse following microtubule disruption with nocodazole or colchicine. Photographs of these effects are shown in Fig. 3B. Adenovirally infected ECs expressing either GFP or N19RhoA were allowed to undergo morphogenesis before the addition of nocodazole. Whereas nocodazole induced complete collapse in GFP-expressing cells, the collapse was blocked in cells expressing the dominant negative form of RhoA (N19RhoA) (Fig. 3B). An additional experiment tested whether other Rho isoforms participated in the microtubule-dependent tube collapse response. ECs expressing dominant negative RhoC were able to block vinblastine-induced luminal collapse, whereas expression of RhoB did not (data not shown). These data indicate that activated RhoA (and possibly RhoC) is required for microtubule depolymerization-induced collapse of EC tubes. Vinblastine-induced Collapse of EC Structures Is Followed by Apoptosis—Time course experiments were performed to characterize the collapse response and determine whether structural collapse initiated EC apoptosis. EC cultures were allowed to develop for 48 h in three-dimensional collagen matrices before the addition of vinblastine, colchicine, nocodazole, or cytochalasin B. Capillary tube structures were allowed to collapse for 4, 8, or 24 h. Western blot analyses of endothelial extracts probed for pro-caspase-3 and gelsolin revealed that both proteins were cleaved following microtubule disruption (Fig. 4A). Pro-caspase-3 levels are diminished at 8 h in the presence of vinblastine. At 24 h, pro-caspase-3 levels are decreased in cultures treated with 10 μm vinblastine, 1 μm vinblastine, 10 μm nocodazole, or 10 μm colchicine. Gelsolin is known to be cleaved during apoptosis (22Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 23Kamada S. Kusano H. Fujita H. Ohtsu M. Koya R.C. Kuzumaki N. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A visible fragment of gelsolin (indicated by arrowheads) is seen in the presence of vinblastine as early as 4 h. Also evident at 24 h is a decrease in the intact 85-kDa form of gelsolin with vinblastine, colchicine, and nocodazole treatment. To investigate the temporal series of events between collapse and initiation of apoptosis, EC networks were allowed to form for 48 h before the addition of vinblastine (Fig. 4B). Nearly complete collapse occurred rapidly, within 1.5 h. Caspase-3 cleavage, indicative of apoptosis, lagged considerably and did not become evident until between 3 and 6 h after vinblastine addition. Pretreatment of networks with ZVAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor prior to the addition of vinblastine, exhibited no ability to block vinblastine-induced luminal collapse. This time course indicated that caspase activation occurred subsequent to collapse of luminal structures and was only detectable hours after luminal collapse. Additional experiments revealed cleavage of procaspase-8 and pro-caspase-9 using extracts that were taken 0.5, 2, 8, and 19 h after the addition of vinblastine or control buffer (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that pro-caspase-8 cleavage occurred, as did pro-caspase-9 cleavage, where a smaller fragment of caspase-9 (arrowhead) is detected along with cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 4C). Also, PAK-2 cleavage was observed. PAK-2 has been reported previously to be a target of activated caspases (24Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In addition, using a DEVD hydrolysis assay, a 4-fold increase was observed following microtubule depolymerization by vinblastine (Fig. 4D). These data were confirmed by Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase-3 (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that microtubule depolymerization rapidly collapsed EC luminal networks, leading to subsequent pro-caspase activation and apoptosis. Microtubule-depolymerizing agents induced almost complete collapse of EC tubular structures, whereas CCB, an actindisrupting agent showed minimal effects on EC tube structures. Comparative molecular analysis of gelsolin, procaspase-3, and cleaved caspase-3 following treatment with vinblastine versus cytochalasin B are shown in Fig. 5, A and B, respectively. Cultures were fixed and extracts were made 8 h after collapse was initiated and probed for gelsolin, procaspase-3, and cleaved caspase-3 at the doses indicated. After 8 h of vinblastine treatment (Fig. 5A), 10 μm doses resulted in gelsolin cleavage, with a decrease in the full-length form of gelsolin (85 kDa) that coincides with the appearance of a 50-kDa fragment of gelsolin not seen in cytochalasin B experiments (Fig. 5B). Similarly, vinblastine elicited cleavage of procaspase-3, where levels were reduced compared with control, even at very low doses of vinblastine. In agreement with this, cleaved caspase-3 was also detected at low doses of vinblastine. The caspase-3 cleavage, indicative of apoptosis, correlated well with luminal collapse (see Fig. 2). In contrast, only the highest dose of cytochalasin B elicited collapse of luminal structures (Fig. 2) and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data confirm that microtubule depolymerization precedes EC luminal collapse and initiates apoptosis. Vinblastine-induced Initiation of Apoptosis and Collapse of EC Structures Involves Activation of Rho—To demonstrate whether vinblastine treatment initiated Rho activation, EC monolayers were extracted at 0, 1, 3, 20, and 30 min after treatment with vinblastine (Fig. 6A). Lysates were incubated with GST-rhotekin-Sepharose and assayed for GTP-bound Rho. Data from two separate experiments showed a clear increase in Rho-GTP levels after 1 min of vinblastine treatment that was sustained and increased further at 30 min, indicating vinblastine treatment resulted in activation of Rho. These data agree with previous reports where microtubule collapse with nocodazole resulted in Rho activation in fibroblasts (25Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 26Flusberg D.A. Numaguchi Y. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3087-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine whether RhoA activation may initiate apoptosis, mutant forms of RhoA were expressed in ECs using recombinant adenoviruses. ECs expressing N19RhoA, V14RhoA, and GFP control were placed in three-dimensional collagen matrices and allowed to undergo morphogenesis where extracts were made at 0, 6, and 24 h (Fig. 6B). Western blot analysis of caspase-3 levels revealed that in the GFP control group, procaspase-3 levels remained stable during EC lumen formation. In contrast, expression of V14RhoA resulted in cleavage of pro-caspase-3 (not shown) with a decrease in expression levels. Expression of N19RhoA slightly increased levels of procaspase-3, suggesting that RhoA might regulate turnover of caspase-3. Consistent with these observations, morphogenesis and lumen formation occurred in ECs expressing N19RhoA and GFP, whereas cells expressing V14RhoA appeared apoptotic, consistent with what we have reported previously (5Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the V14RhoA construct. These data were confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using propidiu"

To examine the role of SOCS3 in neutrophils and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) signaling in vivo, we compared neutrophils from two types of conditional knockout mice, LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice and Tie2-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice, in which the Socs3 gene had been deleted in mature neutrophils and hematopoietic stem cells, respectively. The size of the G-CSF-dependent colonies from Tie2-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mouse bone marrow was much larger than that of colonies from control wild-type mice, while the size of interleukin-3-dependent colonies was similar. Moreover, LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice had more neutrophils than SOCS3fl/fl mice, suggesting that SOCS3 is a negative regulator of G-CSF signaling in neutrophils. Consistent with this notion, G-CSF-induced STAT3 as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was much stronger and prolonged in SOCS3-deficient mature neutrophils than in wild-type neutrophils. The preventive effect of G-CSF on apoptosis was more prominent in SOCS3-deficient mature neutrophils than in control neutrophils.

Signaling from cytokine receptors is initiated by receptor oligomerization that is induced by cytokine binding, which brings associated Janus kinases (JAKs) 1The abbreviations used are: JAK, Janus kinase; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SH, Src homology; CIS, cytokine-inducible SH2 protein; SSI, STAT-induced STAT inhibitors; IL, interleukin; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; fMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TR-OZ, Texas Red-conjugated opsonizing zymosan; RT, reverse transcriptase. into close apposition and allows their cross-phosphorylation and activation. The active JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptors, which leads to the recruitment and activation of various signal-transduction proteins, including the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors (1Yasukawa H.

Both SOCS1 and SOCS3 have an N-terminal kinase inhibitory region and inhibit JAK tyrosine kinase activity.

Rescued SOCS3-deficient mice show perinatal lethality with cardiac hypertrophy, which suggests that SOCS3 is essential for negative regulation of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor signaling. The generation of conditional knock-out (KO) mice using the Cre-loxP system revealed that SOCS3 is also essential for the suppression of IL-6/gp130 signaling in macrophages. This is consistent with the high-affinity binding of SOCS3 to the Tyr-759 region of gp130 (6Yasukawa H. Ohishi M. Mori H. Murakami M. Chinen T. Aki D. Hanada T. Takeda K. Akira S. Hoshijima M.

The G-CSF is the major regulator of differentiation and activation in the granulocyte lineage. The G-CSF induces activation of the JAK-STAT (9Hörtner M. Nielsch U. Lorenz M. Mayr J.A. Johnston P.C.

Overexpression studies have suggested that SOCS3 interacts with the G-CSF receptor and inhibits G-CSF-induced STAT3 activation (9Hörtner M. Nielsch U. Lorenz M. Mayr J.A. Johnston P.C. Haan H. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Hermans M.H. van de Geijn G.J. Antonissen C. Gits J. van Leeuwen D. Ward A.C. Touw I.P. Blood. 2003; 101: 2584-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of these studies has not been shown using SOCS3-deficient animals. In this study, we first demonstrate that SOCS3 is an important negative regulator of G-CSF signaling in neutrophils and regulates the survival as well as growth of neutrophils. Animals—Conditional targeting of SOCS3 using the loxP system and crossing with LysM-Cre mice have been described (21Takeda K. Clausen B.E. Kaisho T. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Forster I. Akira S.

Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). To delete the Socs3 gene in hematopoietic stem cells, Tie2-Cre mice (23Kisanuki Y.Y. Hammer R.E. Miyazaki J. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Yanagisawa M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 230: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) were crossed with SOCS3fl/fl mice because Tie2 is expressed in hemangioblasts. Age-matched SOCS3fl/fl and LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl or Tie2-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice were used for analysis. Hematology—A peripheral blood smear was stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa. Differential cell counts were scored visually on coded samples or using a K-4500 automated counter. Preparation of Neutrophils from Peripheral Blood and the Peritoneal Cavity—To mobilize neutrophils into peripheral blood, we injected G-CSF (a gift from the Kirin Pharmaceutical Co., 8 μg/body/day) subcutaneously for 7 consecutive days. Whole peripheral blood was collected 4 h after the last injection from the orbital venus plexus, and erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis. To obtain peritoneal neutrophils, 2 ml of 4% thioglycollate was injected intraperitoneally. After 4 h, peritoneal exudate cells were harvested by phosphate-buffered saline lavage. Granulocytes were enumerated, followed by staining with May-Grünwald-Giemsa. The percentage of neutrophils in white blood cells from the peritoneal cavity was about 80% in both SOCS3fl/fl mice and LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice. The chemotaxis assay for neutrophils was performed as described previously (24Schröder J.M. Mrowietz U. Morita E. Christphers E. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mier J.W.

Schröder J.M. Flad H.D. Brandt E. Blood. 1997; 90: 4588-4597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the lower well (24-well plate) contained 800 μl of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) including 1 × 10-8m fMLP and 10% FBS, and the upper chemotaxicell (Kurabo) contained 400 μl of neutrophil (3 × 106 cells/ml) suspension. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, cells that passed through the membrane were counted. The phagocytic activity of peritoneal neutrophils was assayed by incubating 5 × 104 cells of peritoneal neutrophils with 5 × 106 of Texas Red-conjugated opsonizing zymosan (TR-OZ; Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Phagocytic activity was assessed by flow cytometry (27Rodríguez M.E. van der Pol W.L. van de Winkel J.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 252: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Superoxide anion (O2·¯) production was measured using superoxide dismutase-inhabitable reduction of the cytochrome c assay (28Bellavite P. Dri P. Della B.V. Serra M.C. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 13: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Cavallaro A. Ainis T. Bottari C. Fimiani V. Physiol. Res. 2003; 52: 555-562PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed using peritoneal and peripheral neutrophils as described previously (5Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were incubated in IMDM without G-CSF for 6 h and then stimulated with 50 ng/ml G-CSF. Approximately 5 × 105 cells/sample were used for Western blotting using the following antibodies: anti-STAT3 (sc-482; Santa Cruz), anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (number 9131; Cell Signaling), anti-G-CSF receptor (sc-9173; Santa Cruz), SOCS3 (IBL), ERK2 (number 330018; Cell Signaling), and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (number 9101; Cell Signaling). Real-time RT-PCR—RT-PCR was carried out using the one-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was monitored using the ABI PRISM 7700 (PE Applied Biosystems), and the results were analyzed with the accompanying software. SYBR Green PCR Master Mix was used for the detection of SOCS3 and Bcl-XL. Colony Assay—BM cells (4 × 105) were incubated in a medium (MethoCult M3234, Stem Cell Technology) containing 0.9% methylcellulose in IMDM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 10-4m 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mml-glutamine, 15% FBS, 10 μg/ml bovine pancreatic insulin, 200 μg/ml human transferrin, and each of following recombinant cytokines: 10 ng/ml of murine IL-3 or 10 or 100 ng/ml of G-CSF. Colonies were counted and photographed after 7-10 days of incubation. SOCS3 Negatively Regulates G-CSF-dependent Colony Formation—To examine the role of SOCS3 in neutrophils and G-CSF signaling, we first examined the G-CSF-dependent colony formation of BM cells from Tie2-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice. The Tie2-Cre transgenic mouse line has been shown to facilitate gene targeting in endothelial and hematopoietic cells. High efficiency of recombination was found in all endothelial cells and in the majority of hematopoietic cells but not in other tissues (30Constien R. Forde A. Liliensiek B. Grone H.J. Nawroth P. Hammerling G. Arnold B. Genesis. 2001; 30: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, efficient Socs3 gene deletion was observed in BM cells from Tie2-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice but not in SOCS3fl/fl mice. Granulocyte precursor frequencies were assessed by colony formation assays. BM cells were cultured with G-CSF as the only supportive cytokine to enumerate granulocyte precursors. In this medium, the number of colonies from SOCS3-deficient BM cells was slightly higher than that from wild-type BM cells (control: 229 ± 14 versus KO: 350 ± 20; p = 0.02). We found that the size of G-CSF-dependent colonies from Tie2-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice was much larger than that from control mice, while the size of IL-3-dependent colonies was not different (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that SOCS3 negatively regulates G-CSF-dependent granulopoiesis. Increased Neutrophil Numbers in LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl Mice—We then examined the role of SOCS3 in mature neutrophils using LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice. To confirm the deletion of the Socs3 gene, we extracted genomic DNA from peritoneal neutrophils and analyzed them using PCR. Neutrophils from LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice showed a 250-bp band corresponding to the Cre-mediated deletion of the Socs3 gene, while no deletion band was observed in the DNA from SOCS3fl/fl mice (Fig. 2A, lower panel). A small amount of the undeleted Socs3 gene band (380 bp) was also observed in the DNA of peritoneal neutrophils from LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice, probably because of contamination of lymphocytes (Fig. 2A, upper panel). We investigated the cytological analysis of peripheral blood cells derived from SOCS3fl/fl and LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice (Table I). White blood cells differential counts were done by May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining, and the numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils were calculated. The number of neutrophils in LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice was twice as large as that in SOCS3fl/fl mice, with a statistical significance of p < 0.001.Table IComplete blood countSOCS3fl/flLysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/flRed blood cells (×106/μl)10.71 ± 0.7110.76 ± 0.96Hemoglobin (g/dl)16.67 ± 1.2816.85 ± 1.47Hematocrit (%)54.48 ± 4.3254.95 ± 4.82White blood cells (×103/μl)6.18 ± 2.858.05 ± 8.25Neutrophils (/μl)951 ± 355ap < 0.001.1941 ± 237ap < 0.001.Lymphocytes (/μl)4748 ± 23293983 ± 2358Monocytes (/μl)423 ± 366409 ± 363Eosinophils (/μl)54 ± 7531 ± 40Basophils (/μl)NDNDPlatelets (×104/μl)93.65 ± 20.9593.22 ± 21.66a p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab Next, we compared the effect of SOCS3 deletion on neutrophil functions. Myeloperoxidase staining of peripheral blood smears as well as the production of superoxide in peritoneal neutrophils was not significantly different between SOCS3fl/fl mice and LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice (Fig. 2B). The chemotactic activity of neutrophils for fMLP was almost identical between wild-type and SOCS3-deficient cells (Fig. 2C). The phagocytic activity of neutrophils for opsonizing zymosan (OZ) was assayed using flow cytometry (Fig. 2D). Texas Red-labeled OZ was incubated with peritoneal neutrophils at 37 °C. After 30 min, about 85% of Gr-1-positive neutrophils from both wild-type and SOCS3-deficient mice phagocytosed OZ. These data indicate that SOCS3-deficient neutrophils increased in number but possessed normal functions. Stronger STAT3 and ERK Activation in Neutrophils Lacking SOCS3—We then investigated G-CSF-dependent signaling by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Peritoneal neutrophils were induced by intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate. G-CSF-induced STAT3 activation was much stronger and prolonged in SOCS3-deficient peritoneal neutrophils than in wild-type neutrophils (Fig. 3A). Similar hyperactivation of STAT3 was observed in peripheral neutrophils mobilized by G-CSF in LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of STAT3 was higher in SOCS3-deficient peripheral neutrophils than in control neutrophils. The basal levels of STAT3 and ERK activation were higher in SOCS3-deficient peritoneal neutrophils (Fig. 3A, time = 0 min). ERK activation was very weak in wild-type neutrophils, while strong ERK activation was observed in SOCS3-deficient neutrophils before G-CSF stimulation. Such hyperactivation of STAT3 and ERK before G-CSF-stimulation in thioglycollate-induced peritoneal neutrophils is probably due to the slower down-regulation of G-CSF signaling in SOCS3-deficient neutrophils than in wild-type neutrophils during cytokine-free preincubation. In contrast, STAT3 activation was not observed before stimulation in either control or SOCS3-deficient peripheral neutrophils (Fig. 3B, time = 0 min). The discrepancy of the basal levels of STAT3 phosphorylation observed in Fig. 3, A and B, is probably due to differences in the naure of neutrophils induced by thioglycollate and G-CSF, such as the maturation stage and the levels of G-CSF receptor or signaling molecules. To evaluate the stronger G-CSF signaling in SOCS3-deficient neutrophils, we examined the effect of G-CSF on the prevention of apoptosis of neutrophils. Viable cells were counted by the trypan blue exclusion test (Fig. 4A). Both wild-type and SOCS3-deficient neutrophils died rapidly within 24 h in the absence of G-CSF. G-CSF slowed down the apoptosis of neutrophils. The effect of G-CSF on the prevention of apoptosis was much greater in SOCS3-deficient neutrophils than in wild-type neutrophils. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that SOCS3-deficient neutrophils are more resistant against apoptosis than wild-type neutrophils (Fig. 4B). The prevention of apoptosis was correlated to the G-CSF-dependent induction of Bcl-XL, as shown in Fig. 4C. The Bcl-XL mRNA levels were increased more strongly in SOCS3-deficient neutrophils than in wild-type neutrophils. These data suggest that the increase in the number of peripheral neutrophils in LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice could be due to the longer half-life of neutrophils. Other researchers as well as our group have observed that G-CSF induced SOCS3 mRNA in wild-type neutrophils (31Cassatella M.A. Gasperini S. Bovolenta C. Calzetti F. Vollebregt M. Scapini P. Marchi M. Suzuki R. Suzuki A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1999; 94: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, STAT3 was shown to be dispensable for granulocyte proliferation, differentiation, and function but required for homeostasis (10Lee C.K. Raz R. Gimeno R. Gertner R. Wistinghausen B. Takeshita K. DePinho R.A. Levy D.E. Immunity. 2002; 17: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Socs3 is proposed to be a candidate gene that negatively regulates G-CSF signaling downstream of STAT3. Our data strongly support this hypothesis. However, a major signaling pathway for granulopoiesis elicited by G-CSF has not been clarified. Our study strongly suggests that ERK is a plausible candidate for such G-CSF-mediated signaling responsible for anti-apoptosis and proliferation. This is consistent with a recent report indicating that Tyr-764 of the G-CSF receptor is the most important element for G-CSF-induced proliferation, which was reverted by inhibition of ERK activity (20Hermans M.H. van de Geijn G.J. Antonissen C. Gits J. van Leeuwen D. Ward A.C. Touw I.P. Blood. 2003; 101: 2584-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic factor, could be a downstream target of such G-CSF-mediated signaling. The enhanced production of neutrophils in the absence of SOCS3 is reminiscent of the phenotype derived from the G-CSF receptor mutant found in human severe congenital neutropenia (32Hermans M.H. Ward A.C. Antonissen C. Karis A. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 32-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33McLemore M.L. Poursine-Laurent J. Link D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The hypergranulopoiesis of mutant mice bearing this receptor correlated with the prolonged activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 in response to G-CSF treatment (34Hermans M.H. Antonissen C. Ward A.C. Mayen A.E. Ploemacher R.E. Touw I.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These mutated receptors lacked the SOCS3 binding site, Tyr-729. Interestingly, in the absence of SOCS3, prolonged activation of STAT3 and ERK was also observed after G-CSF stimulation. Therefore, the loss of the Socs3 gene in stem cells may contribute to congenital or sporadic neutrophilia. Under certain stressful situations, such as response to pathogen infection, rapid expansion of neutrophil populations can be achieved through a process known as emergency granulopoiesis, which is accompanied by high levels of G-CSF (35Ward A.C. Hermans M.H. Smith L. van Aesch Y.M. Schelen A.M. Antonissen C. Touw I.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 113-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Basu S. Hodgson G. Zhang H.H. Katz M. Quilici C. Dunn A.R.

Blood. 1994; 84: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the basal levels of neutrophil contents were higher in LysM-Cre:SOCS3fl/fl mice than in wild-type mice, no significant difference was observed after administration of a high dose of G-CSF (data not shown). This suggests that SOCS3-deficient mature neutrophils are more sensitive to homeostatic low levels of G-CSF but that the SOCS3 may not suppress G-CSF signaling efficiently in emergency granulopoiesis with a high dose of G-CSF. This is consistent with the fact that STAT3 activation by the G-CSF receptor can be achieved through both receptor tyrosine-dependent and -independent mechanisms, depending on the G-CSF concentration (35Ward A.C. Hermans M.H. Smith L. van Aesch Y.M. Schelen A.M. Antonissen C. Touw I.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 113-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2050911321,"Proper kinetochore function is essential for the accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. Kinetochores provide the attachment sites for spindle microtubules and are required for the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (chromosome congression). Components of the conserved NDC80 complex are required for chromosome congression, and their disruption results in mitotic arrest accompanied by multiple spindle aberrations. To better understand the function of the NDC80 complex, we have identified two novel subunits of the human NDC80 complex, termed human SPC25 (hSPC25) and human SPC24 (hSPC24), using an immunoaffinity approach. hSPC25 interacted with HEC1 (human homolog of yeast Ndc80) throughout the cell cycle and localized to kinetochores during mitosis. RNA interference-mediated depletion of hSPC25 in HeLa cells caused aberrant mitosis, followed by cell death, a phenotype similar to that of cells depleted of HEC1. Loss of hSPC25 also caused multiple spindle aberrations, including elongated, multipolar, and fractured spindles. In the absence of hSPC25, MAD1 and HEC1 failed to localize to kinetochores during mitosis, whereas the kinetochore localization of BUB1 and BUBR1 was largely unaffected. Interestingly, the kinetochore localization of MAD1 in cells with a compromised NDC80 function was restored upon microtubule depolymerization. Thus, hSPC25 is an essential kinetochore component that plays a significant role in proper execution of mitotic events.

The genetic stability of an organism depends on accurate segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis (1Nasmyth K. Peters J.M. Uhlmann F.

Macromolecular structures termed kinetochores that assemble on the centromeric regions of chromosomes are essential for various aspects of this process (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Kinetochores form attachment sites for spindle microtubules, recruit microtubule motors and other non-motor proteins that regulate spindle dynamics, and are indispensable for the subsequent alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar).Kinetochores also play important roles in the spindle checkpoint (3Cleveland D.W.

Premature separation of sister chromatids prior to their proper attachment to the mitotic spindle results in chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy, contributing to tumorigenesis or birth defects (4Jallepalli P.V.

To avoid these dire consequences, cells employ a surveillance mechanism called the spindle checkpoint to monitor the status of microtubule attachment and tension at the kinetochores of sister chromatids (6Nicklas R.B.

The spindle checkpoint ensures that chromosome segregation ensues only after all the chromosomes have congressed to the metaphase plate.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Many checkpoint proteins exhibit dynamic kinetochore localization in mitosis (14Howell B.J. Hoffman D.B. Fang G. Murray A.W. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 15Kallio M.J. Beardmore V.A. Weinstein J. Gorbsky G.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For example, MAD2 localizes only to unattached kinetochores, and the kinetochore-bound pool of MAD2 exchanges rapidly (t1/2 = 24-28 s) with the cytoplasmic pools (14Howell B.J. Hoffman D.B. Fang G. Murray A.W. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). MAD2 recruitment to kinetochores depends upon another checkpoint protein, called MAD1, which is constitutively bound to MAD2 and shows the same kinetochore localization pattern as MAD2 (16Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 17Chen R.H. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Murray A.W. J.

An attractive model for spindle checkpoint signaling is that MAD2 is recruited to kinetochores by MAD1 (11Yu H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19Luo X. Tang Z. Rizo J. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 59-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Through a poorly understood mechanism, possibly mediated by other checkpoint proteins, MAD2 dissociates from MAD1 and acquires a conformation that is compatible with its incorporation into the mitotic checkpoint complex (11Yu H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19Luo X. Tang Z. Rizo J. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 59-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanisms by which the spindle checkpoint proteins are recruited to kinetochores during mitosis. Detailed immunofluorescence analysis revealed that these proteins are recruited to the kinetochores with slightly different timing (20Jablonski S.A. Chan G.K. Cooke C.A. Earnshaw W.C. Yen T.J. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1998; 107: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, their kinetochore localization patterns vary in response to different spindle-damaging agents (21Skoufias D.A. Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Wilson L. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4492-4497Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Taylor S.S. Hussein D. Wang Y. Elderkin S. Morrow C.J. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17200-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This suggests that the spindle checkpoint proteins might be recruited to the kinetochores through different mechanisms and via interactions with specific kinetochore proteins. Identification of the kinetochore protein interface to which MAD1-MAD2 associates might provide insights into the mechanism of the generation of the mitotic checkpoint complex.Genetic and biochemical studies in different organisms have led to the identification of a large number of kinetochore proteins, many of which are conserved during evolution (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). A physical association map for the kinetochore proteins is beginning to emerge through biochemical purification of kinetochore subcomplexes and through analysis of the interdependencies of various proteins for kinetochore localization (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 24Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J. Yates III, J.R. Chan C.S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Despite the vast divergence of the centromeric sequences among organisms and the limited sequence similarities among kinetochore proteins of different species, the basic architecture of kinetochores appears to be conserved (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Kinetochore proteins can be divided into three groups: the inner kinetochore proteins that associate with the centromeric DNA, the outer kinetochore proteins that interact with the microtubules, and the central kinetochore proteins that lie in between (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The inner kinetochore is formed in part by a histone H3 variant, CENP-A/Cse4, and a coiled-coil protein, CENP-C/Mif2 (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The central kinetochore consists of at least three subcomplexes in yeast: the Ndc80 complex, the Mtw1 complex, and the Ctf19 complex (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 26Pinsky B.A. Tatsutani S.Y. Collins K.A. Biggins S. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The central kinetochore proteins are responsible for the recruitment of the outer kinetochore proteins that, among other functions, regulate microtubule dynamics (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). These include microtubule motors, such as dynein and CENP-E, and non-motor proteins, such as CLIP-170 and the Dam1 complex (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 27Cheeseman I.M. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Nearly all of the spindle checkpoint proteins localize to the outer kinetochore (3Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Many central kinetochore proteins, including components of the Ndc80, Mis12/Mtw1, and Ctf19 complexes, remain to be identified in mammals. Identification of these components will shed light on the structure, assembly, and function of mammalian kinetochores.The yeast Ndc80 complex consists of four coiled-coil proteins: Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc25, and Spc24 (28Wigge P.A. Kilmartin J.V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Homologs of Ndc80 and Nuf2 have been identified in various organisms and shown to perform important functions in processes including kinetochore assembly, microtubule attachment, chromosome congression, and the spindle checkpoint (29Martin-Lluesma S. Stucke V.M. Nigg E.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2267-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 30DeLuca J.G. Moree B. Hickey J.M. Kilmartin J.V. Salmon E.D. J.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3347-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This suggests that the Ndc80 complex is an evolutionarily conserved kinetochore component. Several observations support a role of the Ndc80 complex in the spindle checkpoint. In budding yeast, temperature-sensitive SPC25 and SPC24 mutants are checkpoint-deficient (31McCleland M.L. Gardner R.D. Kallio M.J. Daum J.R. Gorbsky G.J. Burke D.J. Stukenberg P.T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Simultaneous disruption of both NDC80 and NUF2 genes also abrogates the spindle checkpoint (31McCleland M.L. Gardner R.D. Kallio M.J. Daum J.R. Gorbsky G.J. Burke D.J. Stukenberg P.T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recently, human MAD1 has been shown to interact with HEC1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen (29Martin-Lluesma S. Stucke V.M. Nigg E.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2267-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). MAD1 and MAD2 fail to localize to kinetochores in mitotic HeLa cells depleted of HEC1 by RNA interference (RNAi), suggesting that HEC1 is required for the kinetochore recruitment of MAD1 and MAD2 (29Martin-Lluesma S. Stucke V.M. Nigg E.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2267-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, direct binding between HEC1 and MAD1 cannot be detected in vitro.Given the importance of the NDC80 complex in both chromosome congression and the spindle checkpoint, we sought to characterize the composition and function of the human NDC80 complex. In particular, despite their likely existence, the mammalian functional homologs of yeast Spc25 and Spc24 have not been identified due to the lack of clear sequence homologs in the data bases. We have now purified the human NDC80 complex using an immunoaffinity approach and identified the SPC25 and SPC24 components of the human NDC80 complex. Human SPC25 (hSPC25) interacted with HEC1 in vitro and in vivo. It localized to the kinetochores during mitosis. RNAi-mediated depletion of hSPC25 in HeLa cells caused a plethora of mitotic defects and the loss of kinetochore localization of MAD1 and HEC1 in the absence of spindle-damaging agents. Therefore, despite the lack of significant sequence similarity, hSPC25 is a functional homolog of yeast Spc25 and a component of the conserved NDC80 complex. Interestingly, the NDC80 complex was not required for the kinetochore localization of MAD1 in nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells. This suggests that the NDC80 complex is not absolutely required for the recruitment of MAD1 to kinetochores upon checkpoint activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant HEC1 Proteins and Antibody Production—The coding region of HEC1 was amplified from a human fetal thymus cDNA library (Clontech) using PCR. Two cDNA fragments of HEC1 containing either nucleotides 1-663 (HEC1N) or nucleotides 1285-1929 (HEC1C) of the HEC1 coding region were cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector. The resulting plasmids were transformed into Rosetta DE3 bacteria cells. Expression of the GST-HEC1N and GST-HEC1C fusion proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (250 μm final concentration) to the bacterial culture at A600 = 0.6. The cells were allowed to grow for another 3 h at room temperature. Soluble GST-HEC1 fusion proteins were isolated on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with 10 mm glutathione (Sigma), and exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The two GST-HEC1 fusion proteins were mixed and injected into rabbits for antibody production (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Crude antibody sera were first precleared with GST-coupled Affi-Gel beads (Bio-Rad) to remove anti-GST antibody and subsequently affinity-purified using either GST-HEC1N or GST-HEC1C fusion protein-coupled Affi-Gel beads. For immunoblotting, affinity-purified anti-HEC1 antibodies were used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. For immunoprecipitation, affinity-purified anti-HEC1 antibodies were coupled to Affi-Prep-protein A beads (Bio-Rad) at a concentration of 1 mg of antibody/ml of protein A beads.Immunopurification of the Human NDC80 Complex—HeLa Tet-On cells (Clontech) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin. At 80% confluency, the cells were treated with nocodazole at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml for 18 h. For each immunoprecipitation experiment, 20 plates (150 mm) of nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells were used. The cell pellet was resuspended in 12 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm okadaic acid, 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml chymostatin). The suspension was kept on ice for 20 min, followed by brief sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at top speed in a microcentrifuge for 1.5 h. The supernatant was filtered with 0.4-μm filters and precleared using 200 μl of anti-GST antibody-coupled protein A beads. The NDC80 complex was immunoprecipitated by incubating the lysate with 200 μl of either anti-HEC1N or anti-HEC1C antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. The antibody beads were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer plus 400 mm KCl and once with the lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then eluted with 1 ml of 100 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.5) and concentrated using Microcon centrifugation filter devices (Millipore Corp.). The concentrated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by silver staining. The protein bands were excised and subjected to trypsin digestion, followed by mass spectrometry analysis.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant hSPC25 and Antibody Production—The coding region of hSPC25 was amplified from a human fetal thymus cDNA library (Clontech) by PCR and cloned into the pCS2-Myc and pCS2-HA vectors. The clones were sequenced to verify the identity of hSPC25. A cDNA fragment of hSPC25 containing nucleotides 1-450 of the hSPC25 coding region (hSPC25N) was cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector. The GST-hSPC25N protein was expressed and purified essentially as described above for the purification of GST-HEC1 fusion proteins, except that expression of GST-hSPC25N was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (250 μm final concentration) to the bacterial culture at A600 = 0.9. The purified GST-hSPC25N fusion protein was injected into rabbits for antibody production (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Crude antibody sera were first precleared with GST-coupled Affi-Gel beads to remove anti-GST antibody and subsequently affinity-purified using GST-hSPC25N-coupled Affi-Gel beads.Tissue Culture and Transfection—HeLa Tet-On cells were grown to 40-50% confluency and transfected with the pCS2-Myc or pCS2-HA plasmid containing the HEC1 or hSPC25 coding region using Effectene reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h, harvested by trypsinization, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments.For RNAi experiments, the siRNA oligonucleotides specific for human HEC1, hSPC25, and human MAD2 were chemically synthesized. They contained sequences corresponding to nucleotides 344-366 and 1517-1539 of the coding region of human HEC1, nucleotides 161-183 of the coding region of hSPC25, and nucleotides 143-165 of the coding region of MAD2, respectively. The annealing of the siRNAs and subsequent transfection of the RNA duplexes into HeLa cells were performed exactly as described (33Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8078) Google Scholar). In the case of hSPC25, at 48 h after the first round of RNAi transfection, cells were replated to 30% confluency. At 12 h after replating, the cells were transfected again with either hSPC25 siRNA oligonucleotides alone or with both hSPC25 and MAD2 siRNA duplexes. The time points mentioned in this study for these RNAi experiments refer to the time after the second round of RNAi transfection. Cells transfected with OligofectAMINE alone were used as controls. To determine the cell cycle status, the transfected cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide (PI), and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS). The phenotypes of these cells were also analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence.Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Protein Binding Assays—Lysates of HeLa Tet-On cells transfected with HEC1 and hSPC25 plasmids were prepared and immunoprecipitated as described for the immunopurification of the NDC80 complex. Myc-HEC1 or Myc-hSPC25 was immunoprecipitated from lysates with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Roche Applied Science) coupled to protein A beads. After washing, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. For analysis of the interactions between endogenous HEC1 and hSPC25 proteins, the anti-HEC1 immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-hSPC25 antibody at a 1 μg/ml final concentration. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) were used as a secondary antibody, and the immunoblots were developed using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocols.Plasmids encoding Myc-HEC1, human NUF2 (hNUF2), and hSPC25 were cotranslated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The lysate was immunoprecipitated using either anti-Myc or anti-GST (as a negative control) antibody. The beads were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography.Immunofluorescence—For the immunostaining of endogenous HEC1, hSPC25, MAD1, BUB1, and BUBR1, HeLa cells were grown to 40% confluency and transfected with different plasmids or siRNA duplexes on chambered cover slides. Cells were washed with PBS and extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 4 mm MgSO4) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PHEM buffer for 20 min at 37 °C, washed three times with 0.2%Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated with blocking solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin in PHEM buffer for 1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin in PHEM buffer for 1 h, washed three times with PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100, and further incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at 1:500 dilution. DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were washed three times with PBS, mounted, and viewed with a ×63 objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope. Images were acquired with a CCD camera using the Intelligent Imaging software and further processed with Adobe Photoshop. The staining protocol for cyclin A1, cyclin B1, securin, and Myc-hSPC25 was essentially the same as described above, except that cells were not detergent-extracted prior to fixation. The immunostaining of tubulin and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) in the hSPC25/HEC1 RNAi cells was performed as described above, except that the cells were fixed with methanol at -20 °C. The antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody at 1 μg/ml, CREST serum at 1:1000 dilution (ImmunoVision), rabbit anti-cyclin A1 antibody at 1 μg/ml (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-cyclin B1 antibody at 1 μg/ml (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-securin antibody at 1 μg/ml (a gift from Hui Zou), mouse monoclonal anti-PARP1 antibody at 1:1000 dilution (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-MAD1 antibody at 4 μg/ml, rabbit anti-HEC1 antibody at 2 μg/ml, rabbit anti-BUB1 antibody at 1 μg/ml, rabbit anti-BUBR1 antibody at 1 μg/ml, and mouse anti-tubulin antibody at 1:1000 dilution. Annexin V staining was performed on HEC1 RNAi cells that were released from thymidine arrest for 16 h using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V apoptosis detection kit (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, cells were washed twice with annexin V binding buffer and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and PI for 15 min. Apoptotic cells were scored by positive annexin V staining and negative PI staining.Cold- or Calcium-sensitive Microtubule Staining—For cold-sensitive microtubule staining, at 48 h after hSPC25 siRNA treatment, cells were incubated with ice-cold medium for 10 min, followed by extraction with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer for 5 min. For calcium treatment, samples were permeabilized with 100 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 6.9). Cells were subsequently fixed with methanol and immunostained with anti-tubulin antibody and CREST as described above.Cell Synchronization Experiments—At 24 h after transfection of HeLa cells with HEC1 siRNA oligonucleotides, the mitotic cells were removed by mitotic shake off, and thymidine (2 mm final concentration) was added to the remaining cells. Another 18 h later, the mitotic and dead cells were again washed off, and the remaining cells were released into fresh medium. Samples were taken at 2-h intervals for 16 h and stained with annexin V or anti-PARP1 antibody to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells. To determine the timing of the appearance of spindle defects, samples were taken at 1-h intervals starting at 9 h after the release from thymidine arrest. These cells were fixed and stained with anti-tubulin antibody and DAPI. The effect of microtubule depolymerization on MAD1 staining and apoptosis in HEC1 RNAi cells was examined by adding nocodazole to these cells at 7 h after thymidine release. Immunostaining was performed at 7 h after nocodazole addition.RESULTSIdentification of hSPC25 by Immunopurification of the NDC80 Complex—To characterize the human NDC80 complex, we raised antibodies against human HEC1. Upon immunoblotting, the affinity-purified anti-HEC1 antibody detected a 70-kDa band in HeLa cell lysates that"
https://openalex.org/W2018678300,"Dopaminergic neurotransmission is fine-tuned by the rate of removal of dopamine (DA) from the extracellular space via the Na+/Cl--dependent DA transporter (DAT). DAT is a target of psychostimulants such as amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine. Previously, we reported that AMPH redistributes the human DAT away from the cell surface. This process was associated with a reduction in transport capacity. This loss of transport capacity may result either from a modification of the function of DAT that is independent of its cell surface redistribution and/or from a reduction in the number of active transporters at the plasma membrane that results from DAT trafficking. To discriminate between these possibilities, we stably transfected HEK-293 cells with a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged human DAT (hDAT cells). In hDAT cells, acute exposure to AMPH induced a time-dependent loss of hDAT activity. By coupling confocal imaging with patch-clamp whole-cell recordings, we have demonstrated for the first time that the loss of AMPH-induced hDAT activity temporally parallels the accumulation of intracellular hDAT. In addition, presteady-state current analysis revealed a cocaine-sensitive, voltage-dependent capacitance current that correlated with the level of transporter membrane expression and in turn served to monitor the AMPH-induced trafficking of hDAT. We found that the decrease in hDAT cell surface expression induced by AMPH was not paralleled by changes in the ability of the single transporter to carry charges. Quasi-stationary noise analysis of the AMPH-induced hDAT currents revealed that the unitary transporter current remained unaltered during the loss of hDAT membrane expression. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the AMPH-induced reduction of hDAT transport capacity results from the removal of active hDAT from the plasma membrane.

Although these results suggest that trafficking of the transporter modulates the transport capacity of the system, DAT could be modified and functionally inactivated by AMPH prior to trafficking from the plasma membrane. Therefore, the extent to which hDAT trafficking determines the AMPH-induced down-regulation of hDAT activity is unknown. The present work combines confocal imaging, whole cell steady-state and transient current recordings, as well as noise analysis, to simultaneously monitor DAT cell surface expression and activity. Our data suggest that upon AMPH application hDAT redistributes from the plasma membrane as an active carrier. Cell Culture—A fluorescently tagged hDAT was constructed by fusing the C terminus of the coding region of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) to the N terminus of the human synthetic DAT cDNA, thereby creating the fusion construct YFP-hDAT. This construct was subcloned into a bicistronic expression vector (26Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20 (106, 108-110): 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) modified to express the synthetic hDAT from a cytomegalovirus promoter and the hygromycin resistance gene from an internal ribosomal entry site (pciHyg), as described previously (11Saunders C.

EM4 cells, an HEK 293 cell line stably transfected with macrophage scavenger receptor (27Robbins A.K. Horlick R.A. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (R. Horlick, Pharmacopeia, Cranberry, NJ), were transfected with the YFP-DAT using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and a stably transfected pool (hDAT cells) was selected in 250 μg/ml hygromycin as described previously (11Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. Electrophysiology and Confocal Microscopy—Parental or stably transfected cells were plated at a density of 105 per 35-mm culture dish. Before electrical recordings, attached cells were washed twice with the bath solution containing the following (in mm): 130 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1.5 CaCl2, 0.5 MgSO4, 1.3 KH2PO4, and 34 dextrose adjusted to pH 7.35. In experiments investigating the Na+ dependence of the hDAT transient charge movement, Na+ was iso-osmotically replaced with choline. The hDAT cells were sequentially perfused with bath solutions containing the following Na+ concentrations (in mm): 3, 24, 53, 94, 122, and 130. The recording pipette was filled with a solution containing the following (in mm); 120 KCl, 2.0 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 1.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 30 dextrose adjusted to pH 7.35. Free Ca+2 was calculated to be 0.1 mm. A programmable puller (model P-2000, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) was used to fabricate quartz-recording pipettes with a resistance of 5 mΩ. Whole cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B with a low pass Bessel filter set at 5,000 Hz. Current-voltage relationships were generated by stepping the membrane voltage from a holding potential of -20 mV to voltages between -160 and 100 mV in 20-mV increments for 1 s. A waveform generator (Challenger VM-2C) was used to vary the membrane potential. Data were stored on a VCR and analyzed with a Nicolet Integra Model 20 oscilloscope and a DELL computer using programs written by W. N. Goolsby (Emory University, Atlanta, available on request). Application of dextro-AMPH to hDAT cells generated an hDAT current, which after several minutes of stability began to decrease. Because of cell-to-cell variability, we defined “time zero” as the onset of the decreasing phase of the AMPH-induced current. We subsequently defined the initial hDAT current trace (time zero) as the AMPH-induced current recorded immediately before the onset of the decreasing phase of the hDAT-mediated current. The final current was defined as the last current trace recorded before adding cocaine. The AMPH-induced, hDAT-mediated steady-state current and transient charge movement was obtained by subtracting the current trace recorded in the presence of AMPH plus cocaine from the current trace recorded in the presence of AMPH. The hDAT transient charge (Q) movement in response to a voltage step, was obtained by integrating either the “on” or the “off” of the relaxation component of the AMPH-induced current (Fig. 2A). Time-dependent changes in Q were used to evaluate hDAT cell surface expression as described previously (29Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A.

The charge-voltage relationships were fit to the Boltzmann function, Q = (Qdep - Qhyp)/[1 + exp(-(V - V½)qzδ/kT)] + Qhyp; where Qmax = Qdep - Qhyp (Qdep and Qhyp are the charge movements at the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits), V is the membrane voltage, V½ is the potential at which half of the charge has moved, q is the elementary charge, zδ is the product of the valence of the moving charge and the fraction of the membrane field through which it moves, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. For simplicity, the slope factor of the fitting was kT/qzδ. Charge-voltage relationships from each experiment were fit, and the results were reported as mean ± S.E. Unless otherwise noted, the steady-state current (I) at a particular voltage was calculated as the average current during the final 100 ms of the voltage step. The time course for the AMPH-induced decrease in hDAT steady-state current (Fig. 5A) was fit with the Boltzmann equation, I = (A1 - A2)/(1 + exp(t - t50)/α) + A2), where A1 is the initial current, A2 is the final current, t50 is the time at which half of A1 remains, and α is the slope of the fit. For all the experiments, the t50 time was reported as mean ± S.E. To synchronize the acquisition of hDAT-mediated currents with the confocal imaging of the cellular distribution of hDAT, we simultaneously triggered the voltage steps and the confocal imaging software (EZ 2000, Coord Automatisering, The Netherlands) with the Challenger VM-2C. Cells were visualized with a Nikon eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Images were acquired using 488-nm excitation with a 510-nm long pass filter. The image acquired during the initial hDAT current trace (time zero as described above) was defined as the initial confocal image. To minimize the fluorophore bleaching and cytotoxic effects of confocal microscopy, images were acquired every 1.5 min prior to the start of the hDAT current decreasing phase and every 30 s during the decreasing phase. Because membrane proteins such as GLUT4 can be localized to the plasma membrane without being exposed to the extracellular space (37Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we quantified intracellular instead of plasma membrane fluorescence as a measure of AMPH-induced hDAT membrane redistribution. Therefore, by excluding plasma membrane fluorescence, we may underestimate the amount of intracellular DAT. The quantitation of intracellular fluorescence was performed by normalizing for fluorophore bleaching and cytosolic volume changes (38Lippincott-Schwartz J. Presley J.F. Zaal K.J. Hirschberg K. Miller C.D. Ellenberg J. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 261-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Piston D.W. Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 31-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, available online) was utilized for this analysis. Normalized data were analyzed with Prism 3.02 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) and reported as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. The reported correlation coefficient (r) was obtained by linear regression analysis. Uptake of [3H]DA—[3H]DA uptake was performed as previously described (11Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 13Carvelli L. Moron J.A.

Neurochem. 2002; 81: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). hDAT cells were seeded into 24-well plates ∼24 h prior to the experiment (150,000 cells per well). After 5 h of serum starvation, the cells were treated in quadruplicate wells with AMPH in uptake buffer, containing (in mm); 120 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 Trizma base, 2.2 CaCl2, and 10 dextrose with 100 μm ascorbic acid at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. The plates were removed from the incubator, and the cells were washed (three washes of 5 min each) with 4 °C uptake buffer to remove the AMPH from each well and inhibit protein trafficking. The plates were then placed into an 18 °C incubator in uptake buffer containing 100 μm pargyline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Then 50 nm [3H]DA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) together with 15 μm DA was added to reach a final volume of 250 μl. Cells were incubated for 2 min and then the solution was aspirated to terminate uptake. After three quick washes with ice-cold uptake buffer, the cells were lysed with 300 μl of 1% SDS. Radioactivity was measured in a Beckman scintillation counter with UniverSol mixture. Specific uptake was defined as total uptake minus nonspecific uptake in the presence of 10 μm mazindol. Data were analyzed with Prism 3.02 software and reported as mean ± S.E. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface biotinylation experiments were performed as previously described (40Apparsundaram S. Schroeter S. Giovanetti E. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 744-751PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. hDAT cells were seeded into 6-well plates (106 cells/well) ∼48 h prior to the experiment. After 1 h of serum starvation, the cells were washed twice with 37 °C uptake buffer and treated with AMPH in uptake buffer at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-Ca-Mg) and treated with Sulfo-NHS-S-S-Biotin (1.5 mg/ml in PBS-Ca-Mg, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) on ice for 1 h. The reaction was quenched by washing twice with 4 °C PBS-Ca-Mg containing 100 mm glycine (PBS-Ca-Mg-glycine) followed by an incubation with PBS-Ca-Mg-glycine for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice with 4 °C PBS-Ca-Mg before lysis with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1% Triton X-100: supplemented with protease inhibitors 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin) for 30 min on ice with constant shaking. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were isolated and biotinylated proteins were separated by incubation with ImmunoPure Immobilized Streptavidin beads (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) for 1 h at room temperature with constant mixing. Beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and biotinylated proteins were eluted with Laemmli loading buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Total cell lysates and biotinylated proteins (cell surface) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (7.5%) and transferred into polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated for 1.5 h in blocking buffer (5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) and immunoblotted with a rat monoclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of the human dopamine transporter (1:2000 in blocking buffer, Chemicon Inc., Temecula, CA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (1:5000 in blocking buffer, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) with ELC-Plus on Hypersensitive ECL film (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL). Band densities were calculated using Scion-Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and normalized to the appropriate total extract to control for protein loading. Data were analyzed with Prism 3.02 software and reported as mean ± S.E. The human EM4 cell line provides an appropriate parental background for studying hDAT function because of the absence of [3H]DA uptake and the lack of either DA- or AMPH-induced whole cell currents (11Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To investigate the extent to which transporter trafficking regulates transport capacity, we created a pool of cells stably expressing fluorescently tagged hDAT. Using confocal imaging, cells with easily visualized plasma membrane fluorescence were selected for analysis (Fig. 1A, inset). Addition of the N-terminal YFP tag to DAT did not significantly alter [3H]DA uptake (data not shown) and did not perturb the ability of the transporter to produce substrate-induced currents (Fig. 1A) (11Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fig. 1A shows current traces recorded from an hDAT cell before substrate application (CTR), after bath application of 10 μm AMPH (AMPH), and after the addition of 10 μm cocaine with AMPH still present (COC). The AMPH-induced hDAT-mediated current was calculated as the current recorded upon bath application of AMPH minus the current recorded after the addition of cocaine, with AMPH still present. Cells without detectable fluorescence did not produce any measurable hDAT-mediated whole cell current upon AMPH application (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows the current-voltage relationship for the AMPH-induced current. The membrane voltage of the cell was held at -20 mV and stepped every 4 s, in 20-mV increments, to voltages between -160 mV and +100 mV. Data were normalized to the current measured at -160 mV (-60.2 ± 16.9 pA, n = 8). The AMPH-induced current reversed at potentials more positive than -35.7 ± 4.0 mV (Fig. 1B). Cocaine application induced a minor decrease of the control current due to its ability to block the DAT-mediated leak conductance (Fig. 1A). This substrate-independent current, which has been described previously for DAT (41Khoshbouei H. Wang H. Lechleiter J.D. Javitch J.A. Galli A. J. Biol.

We report here that the phosphothreonine-binding Forkhead-associated domain of NIPP1 interacts with the cell cycle-regulated protein Ser/Thr kinase MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase). The NIPP1-MELK interaction was critically dependent on the phosphorylaton of Thr-478 of MELK and was increased in lysates from mitotically arrested cells. Recombinant MELK was a potent inhibitor of an early step of spliceosome assembly in nuclear extracts. This splicing defect was also seen with a kinase-dead mutant but was absent after mutation (T478A) of the NIPP1 binding site of MELK, indicating a mediatory role for NIPP1. Our data suggest that MELK has a role in the cell cycle-regulated control of pre-mRNA splicing. NIPP1 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that is required for spliceosome assembly.

More recently, we have demonstrated that NIPP1 is also implicated in transcription as well as in pre-mRNA splicing by mechanisms that do not involve PP1 (8Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30677-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In transient transfection experiments, NIPP1 acted as a transcriptional repressor, which may be accounted for by the binding of the central and C-terminal domains of NIPP1 to the Polycomb protein, EED (embryonic ectoderm development) (9Jin Q. Van Eynde A. Beullens M. Roy N. Thiel G. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30677-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The latter promotes transcriptional repression by the recruitment of a histone methyltransferase and histone deacetylases. NIPP1 also appears to be required for the assembly of spliceosomes, the protein-RNA complexes that catalyze pre-mRNA splicing (8Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The spliceosomal function of NIPP1 requires its C-terminal domain as well as its N-terminal Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, an established phosphothreonine-binding module. The FHA domain of NIPP1 mediates targeting to both the spliceosomes and the nuclear storage sites for splicing factors, known as “speckles” (8Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J.

The targeting function of the FHA domain of NIPP1 is likely explained by its ability to bind to phosphorylated forms of the essential splicing factors CDC5L (11Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P.

Here we show that the protein kinase MELK, which is structurally related to the AMP-activated protein kinases, also interacts in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with the FHA domain of NIPP1 and that this interaction is increased during mitosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recombinant MELK blocks spliceosome assembly by a mechanism that involves NIPP1. Our data suggest a novel link between pre-mRNA processing and cell cycle progression. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—NIPP1-(1–142), cloned into the pEG202 vector in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain, was used as bait for the screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library (11Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this library, the cDNAs are subcloned behind a galactose-inducible promoter in the pJG4–5 vector in-frame with the B42 activation domain. Interacting proteins were identified by growth of the yeast strain EGY188 in a –leucine/+ galactose medium. The use of a plasmid-borne LacZ reporter gene (pSH18–34) with upstream LexA operators enabled a second, independent screening involving the expression of β-galactosidase in the presence of galactose. For the mapping of the NIPP1-MELK interaction site, MELK-(1–651), MELK-(1–291/590–651), and 10 different Thr to Ala mutants of MELK-(326–651) were subcloned in the pJG4–5 plasmid. MELK-(1–651), kindly provided as clone KIAA0175 by Dr. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan), was subcloned by PCR with primers CTGGAATTCATGAAAGATTATGATGAACTTCTCA and TCTGCTCGAGTTATACCTTGCAGCTAGATAGGAT into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pJG4–5. MELK-(1–291/590–651) was obtained by cutting pJG4–5-MELK-(1–651) with Bsp1407I and religation. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The interaction between NIPP1-(1–142) and the MELK variants was quantified by measuring β-galactosidase activity in a liquid culture assay using 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (Clontech yeast protocols handbook). Antibodies—Bacterially expressed polyhistidine-tagged MELK was used to raise antibodies in rabbits. The MELK antibodies were affinity-purified on His-MELK linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-GST antibodies (sc-459), Anti-His antibodies (sc-803), and Anti-LexA antibodies (Sc-7544) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Swine anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Dako. Anti-FLAG antibodies were obtained from Stratagene. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (12CA5) were delivered by Roche Diagnostics. Preparation of Recombinant MELK (Mutants)—Wild-type MELK and MELK-(326–651) were cloned into the pET16b vector in-frame with a polyhistidine tag. The His-tagged proteins were purified by chromatography on Ni2+-pentadentate-chelator-Sepharose (Affiland). For the expression of FLAG-tagged MELK (mutants) in COS-1 cells the cDNAs of human MELK-wild-type, MELK-T478A, MELK-D150A, and MELK-1–266 were cloned as BamHI fragments into the pSG5-Flag vector. The first three cDNAs were also cloned as XhoI-EcoRI fragments into the baculovirus transfer vector pBleubac4.5. Recombinant viruses expressing MELK variants were generated using the Bac-N-Blue™ transfection kit (Invitrogen). For the production of recombinant MELK proteins, BT1-TN-5B1–4 (High Five™) Trichoplusia ni cells were grown as monolayer cultures at 27 °C in Express Five serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The cells were infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and harvested after 48 h by low-speed centrifugation. As most of MELK and its mutants were expressed in insoluble inclusion bodies, we followed the procedure described by Berndt and Cohen (13Berndt N. Cohen P T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to dissolve and renature the insoluble species. Cell Cultures—COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of both penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were blocked in mitosis by the addition of colcemid (0.14 μg/ml) 20–24 h before lysis. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 5 μm leupeptin. After sonication, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10 min at 16,000 × g), and the supernatants were used for GST pull-down assays. GST Pull-down Assays—For the expression of NIPP1 as a GST fusion in mammalian cells, the cDNA of wild-type NIPP1 was cloned into the EcoRV-NotI sites of the pGMEX-T1 vector. Glutathione-agarose beads were pre-blocked with Tris-buffered saline plus bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, the beads were incubated with COS-1 cell lysates (Fig. 6) for 2 h at 10 °C. Subsequently, the beads were sedimented (30 s at 1000 × g) and washed twice with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and twice with Tris-buffered saline, and finally the associated proteins were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. GST pull-down experiments with recombinant proteins and HeLa cell nuclear extracts were performed as described previously (11Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I.

Pre-mRNA Splicing in Nuclear Extracts—A capped β-globin pre-mRNA fragment, comprising exon 1 through the BamHI site in exon 2, was synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]GTP. This primary transcript was used as a substrate for splicing in HeLa cell nuclear extracts (8Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Spliceosomal complexes were separated by native gel electrophoresis as described previously (8Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol.

MELK Is a Novel Interactor of NIPP1—A yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell library with the N-terminal third of NIPP1 (residues 1–142) as bait yielded, in addition to clones encoding CDC5L (11Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31834-31841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), 16 prey clones that all encoded the C-terminal half of the poorly characterized protein kinase MELK (for maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase) (14Heyer B.S. Kochanowski H. Solter D. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Compared with this MELK fragment, the full-length protein was a much better interactor with NIPP1 in two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1B). However, a deletion mutant of MELK, lacking the TP-rich domain, did not interact with NIPP1-(1–142). The MELK-NIPP1 interaction was lost by mutation (S68A/R69A/V70A/H71A) of the phosphate-binding loop of the FHA domain of NIPP1 (Fig. 1B), indicating that MELK interacted with the FHA domain of NIPP1 via a phosphorylated residue(s). Fig. 1C shows that all bait and prey proteins were well expressed, further validating the two-hybrid data. We have previously demonstrated that CDC5L (11Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and SAP155 (12Boudrez A. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31834-31841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) bind to the FHA domain of NIPP1 via threonine-phosphorylated TP dipeptide motifs. The fragment of MELK that binds to NIPP1 also contains numerous TP motifs (Fig. 1A). To examine whether one or several of these TP motifs are involved in the interaction with NIPP1 we performed two-hybrid assays after mutation (Thr to Ala) of each of the 10 TP motifs in the NIPP1-interaction domain of MELK (Fig. 2). All mutants were expressed well (Fig. 2B). However, four mutants showed a significantly reduced interaction with NIPP1 in the two-hybrid assays. The T478A mutant in particular was severely impaired in binding NIPP1. These data implicate some TP motifs of MELK, in particular the TP motif comprising Thr-478 and Pro-479, in the interaction with NIPP1. Interaction of Purified Components—To further explore whether MELK and NIPP1 interact directly and in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, we expressed the NIPP1-interacting C-terminal domain of MELK (residues 326–651) as a His-tagged protein in bacteria. Purified recombinant MELK-(326–651) did not sediment with GST-tagged NIPP1-(1–142) (Fig. 3). However, we noted that a preincubation of MELK-(326–651) with a HeLa cell nuclear extract in the presence of Mg-ATP enabled its interaction with GST-NIPP1-(1–142). Importantly, a co-sedimentation with GST-NIPP1-(1–142) was not seen after a preincubation of the T478A mutant with nuclear extracts under phosphorylation conditions (Fig. 3). The above data showed that MELK interacts directly with the FHA domain of NIPP1 and that this interaction is largely mediated by phosphorylated Thr-478. In further agreement with this interpretation, we found that the synthetic phosphopeptide MELK-(470–487)-phospho-Thr-478 could be used as a competitor to disrupt the interaction between GST-NIPP1-(1–142) and its FHA ligand, CDC5L, in nuclear extracts (Fig. 3B). By contrast, the nonphosphorylated MELK peptide did not have this effect. MELK Is an Inhibitor of Spliceosome Assembly—To explore the role of the NIPP1-MELK interaction, we prepared purified bacterially expressed NIPP1 and baculovirus-expressed MELK. In addition to wild-type MELK we generated a NIPP1-binding mutant (MELK-T478A) as well as a kinase-dead mutant (MELK-D150A). The latter is mutated in the essential”DFG“triplet in kinase subdomain VII, which is required for the binding of Mg-ATP (15Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar). All three proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells as insoluble inclusion bodies and were inactive. However, the inclusion bodies could be dissolved in 6 m guanidinium chloride, and MELK could be renatured by extensive and rapid dilution with a buffer containing Mn2+, as described previously for the catalytic subunit of PP1 (13Berndt N. Cohen P T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The renatured wild-type MELK was capable of phosphorylating exogenous substrates such as myelin basic protein (Fig. 4) as well as histones H1, 2A, and 3 (not shown). In addition, autophosphorylation of MELK was detected (Fig. 4). As expected, the D150A mutant was inactive, but surprisingly, at equal protein concentrations the T478A mutant was much more active than the wild-type protein. Recombinant NIPP1 did not affect the ability of baculovirus-expressed MELK to autophosphorylate or to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (not shown). Because NIPP1 is an established pre-mRNA splicing factor, we subsequently examined whether the interactor MELK also has a role in pre-mRNA splicing. Fig. 5A shows that the addition of 1 μm wild-type MELK completely blocked the splicing of a fragment of β-globin pre-mRNA by HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Interestingly, the kinase-dead mutant of MELK had the same effect, indicating that the splicing inhibition was independent of phosphorylation by MELK. On the other hand, no splicing inhibition was seen with the NIPP1-binding mutant, indicating a mediatory role for NIPP1. No splicing intermediates were detected in the presence of MELK or MELK-D150A, suggesting that MELK interfered with spliceosome assembly rather than with splicing catalysis per se. In further agreement with this conclusion we found that MELK did not affect pre-mRNA splicing when added after spliceosome assembly, i.e. after a preincubation of the splicing extracts for 20 min (not shown). Spliceosome assembly occurs stepwise (Complex E → Complex A → Complex B → Complex C) and involves the recruitment of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and splicing factors as well as intraspliceosomal rearrangements (16Reed R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis revealed that MELK (Fig. 5B) and MELK-D150A (not shown) blocked an early step of spliceosome assembly, i.e. a step before the assembly of the A-complex. This implies that MELK inhibits either the assembly of the E-complex or the transition from the E-complex to the A-complex. The MELK-NIPP1 Interaction Is Increased during Mitosis— The previous data suggested that the MELK-NIPP1 interaction results in an inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing. One of the cellular processes associated with a complete block of pre-mRNA splicing is mitosis. Because MELK appears to be maximally phosphorylated during mitosis (17Blot J. Chartrain I. Roghi C. Philippe M. Tassan J.-P. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Davezac N. Baldin V. Blot J. Ducommon B. Tassan J.-P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7630-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and only interacts with NIPP1 when phosphorylated (this study), we reasoned that the MELK-NIPP1 interaction might be increased during mitosis. To explore this hypothesis, we co-expressed GST-tagged NIPP1 and FLAG-tagged MELK in COS-1 cells. The amount of MELK that co-precipitated with GST-NIPP1 from the cell lysates was indeed dramatically increased when the cells were blocked in mitosis by the addition of either colcemid (Fig. 6A) or nocodazole (not shown) at 20–24 h before cell lysis; this increase could not be explained by different expression levels of the GST-NIPP1 or FLAG-MELK fusions (Fig. 6, B and C). The same results were obtained with the kinase-dead mutant MELK-D150A, showing that MELK kinase activity is not required for the phosphorylation of MELK on a site(s) that mediates its interaction with NIPP1. Importantly, MELK-T478A was a weak interactor of NIPP1 in cell lysates from both asynchronized and mitotically arrested cells, in accordance with our two-hybrid (Fig. 1) and GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 3). MELK-(1–266), which lacks the NIPP1 interaction site but contains the kinase catalytic domain (Fig. 1A), did not bind to NIPP1 in either condition. The above results demonstrated that NIPP1 and MELK interact with each other in vivo and that their interaction is considerably increased during mitosis, when pre-mRNA splicing is abolished. The MELK-NIPP1 Interaction—We have shown here that MELK is an interactor of the FHA domain of NIPP1 and that this interaction involves the binding of a threonine-phosphorylated TP motif to the phosphate binding loop of the FHA domain. The TP motif of MELK that appears to be most critical for the interaction with NIPP1 in yeast (Fig. 2), in COS-1 cells (Fig. 6), and in vitro with recombinant proteins (Fig. 3) comprises Thr-478 and Pro-479. However, as we have previously already demonstrated for SAP155 (12Boudrez A. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31834-31841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is possible that other TP motifs of MELK, when phosphorylated, can also mediate binding to NIPP1. It will therefore be important to identify the protein kinase(s) that phosphorylates the TP motifs of MELK and to examine whether the activation of this kinase(s) results in an increased interaction with NIPP1. Interestingly, all three established ligands of the FHA domain of NIPP1, i.e. CDC5L (19Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), SAP155 (12Boudrez A. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31834-31841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and MELK (17Blot J. Chartrain I. Roghi C. Philippe M. Tassan J.-P. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Davezac N. Baldin V. Blot J. Ducommon B. Tassan J.-P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7630-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), are hyperphosphorylated during mitosis, and at least in the case of SAP155 (12Boudrez A. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31834-31841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and MELK (this work), this phosphorylation includes threonine residues that bind directly to the FHA domain of NIPP1. Thus, one or more mitotic kinases promote the interaction between the splicing factor NIPP1 and its FHA ligands, providing a novel link between cell cycle progression and pre-mRNA processing. Additional evidence for such a link comes from observations that the overexpression of the splicing factor CDC5L shortens the G2 phase (20Bernstein H.S. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4666-4671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the overexpression of MELK is associated with an accumulation of cells in G2/M (18Davezac N. Baldin V. Blot J. Ducommon B. Tassan J.-P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7630-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to delineate the contribution of NIPP1 to these effects of CDC5L and MELK. Our preliminary data suggest that the overexpression of MELK-T478A also causes a G2/M block (not illustrated), indicating that this effect of MELK does not depend on the recruitment of NIPP1. Along the same lines, it will be important to investigate whether the increased SAP155-NIPP1 and MELK-NIPP1 interactions contribute to the splicing arrest during mitosis or rather are implicated in the re-initiation of splicing in the early G1 phase. It should be pointed out that other splicing factors have also been implicated in connecting RNA splicing with cell cycle progression (21Blencowe B.J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R149-R151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, it has recently been demonstrated that the SR protein SRp38 is required for splicing repression during mitosis (22Shin C. Manley J.L. Cell. 2003; 111: 407-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The mitotic kinase that phosphorylates MELK on Thr-478 is unlikely to be MELK itself, since a kinase-dead mutant still showed an increased interaction with NIPP1 during mitosis (Fig. 6). We also found that recombinant MELK is not an in vitro substrate for cyclin-B/Cdk1 (not shown), indicating that Thr-478 is phosphorylated by a distinct mitotic kinase. It should also be pointed out that the increased phosphorylation of MELK on Thr-478 during mitosis is not necessarily the result of an increased MEL kinase kinase activity but could also be accounted for by a reduced MELK phosphatase activity. NIPP1 and Pre-mRNA Splicing—The inhibition of spliceosome assembly by MELK does not require a functional catalytic site but depends on Thr-478 (Fig. 5), which is essential for the binding of NIPP1. One possible explanation for this inhibition of spliceosome assembly is that MELK competes with other splicing factors for binding to the FHA domain and thereby prevents the recruitment of NIPP1 to the spliceosomes. We have previously demonstrated that the C-terminal third of NIPP1 is required for a late step (B → C transition) of spliceosome assembly and that the formation of the B-complex proceeds normally in the presence of NIPP1-(1–142) (8Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our observation that wild-type MELK, but not the NIPP1-binding mutant, blocks an early step of spliceosome assembly (Fig. 5) could therefore suggest that NIPP1-(1–142) is needed for an early step of spliceosome assembly. Inhibition of spliceosome assembly by MELK in splicing extracts did not require a functional catalytic domain. However, this does not rule out the possibility that MELK also affects pre-mRNA processing in vivo by protein phosphorylation. For example, we have noted that CDC5L and SAP155, as well as NIPP1, are in vitro substrates for phosphorylation by MELK, which could contribute to the regulation of splicing by MELK. The interaction of the FHA domain of NIPP1 with its ligands is correlated with both splicing catalysis and splicing arrest. On the one hand, a functional FHA domain is required for spliceosome assembly (8Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and ligands of the FHA domain, such as MELK, competitively block spliceosome assembly (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the FHA domain of NIPP1 is also required for the targeting of NIPP1 to the nuclear storage sites of splicing factors (10Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3761-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NIPP1 shows an increased interaction with SAP155 (12Boudrez A. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31834-31841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and MELK (Fig. 6) during mitosis, when splicing is arrested. One explanation for these paradoxical findings is that the binding of NIPP1 to some FHA ligands is associated with splicing arrest, whereas the association with other ligands promotes spliceosome assembly. Alternatively, the FHA-mediated targeting of NIPP1 to the nuclear speckles during interphase and to the mitotic storage sites of splicing factors serves as a “priming” mechanism that enables a rapid resumption of pre-mRNA splicing by the recruitment of pre-assembled complexes of splicing factors during spliceosome assembly. Nevertheless, the tight regulation of the interaction between NIPP1 and its ligands by reversible phosphorylation and the fact that NIPP1 is associated with both a protein kinase (MELK) and a protein phosphatase (PP1) suggest a key “integrator” function for NIPP1 in signal transduction to splicing. Regulation of MELK—Based on the structural conservation of its catalytic domain (23Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 398: 1912-1943Crossref Scopus (6312) Google Scholar), MELK belongs to the family of CAMK-like protein kinases that also includes protein kinases MARK (24Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), PASK (25Rutter J. Michnoff C.H. Harper S.M. Gardner K.H. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as well as the AMP-activated protein kinases (26Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). It is currently not known how the activity of MELK is controlled but this is likely to be complex. MELK is capable of autophosphorylation (Fig. 4), but it is not yet clear whether this also affects its activity. Thr-167 of MELK corresponds to a phosphorylatable Thr within the activation loop of related protein kinases (26Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 27Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, activation of the AMP-activated kinase requires phosphorylation of this Thr in the activation loop by the tumor suppressor LKB1 (27Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also seems likely that the large C-terminal domain of MELK, which includes the TP-rich NIPP1-binding domain, has a regulatory function. Our preliminary data indicate that this domain is inhibitory because the T478A mutant is more active than wild-type MELK (Fig. 3) and because the recombinant C-terminal half of MELK is a strong inhibitor of the kinase activity of MELK. 2V. Vulsteke, M. Beullens, A. Boudrez, S. Keppens, A. Van Eynde, W. Stalmans, and M. Bollen, unpublished data. A further exploration of the mechanisms that control the activity of MELK will be essential to elucidate the signaling pathways that impinge on MELK and its interactor NIPP1.

Monoclonal anti-ETF-3 antibody that abolishes the embryotrophic activity of ETF-3 recognized a 115-kDa protein from the conditioned medium of immortalized human oviductal cells. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the protein was complement C3. Western blot analysis using an antibody against C3 confirmed the cross-reactivities between anti-C3 antibody with ETF-3 and anti-ETF-3 antibody with C3 and its derivatives, C3b and iC3b. Both derivatives, but not C3, were embryotrophic. iC3b was most efficient in enhancing the development of blastocysts with larger size and higher hatching rate, consistent with the previous reported embryotrophic activity of ETF-3. Embryos treated with iC3b contained iC3b immunoreactivity. The oviductal epithelium produced C3 as evidenced by the presence of C3 immunoreactivity and mRNA in the human oviduct and cultured oviductal cells. Cyclical changes in the expression of C3 immunoreactivity and mRNA were also found in the mouse oviduct with the highest expression at the estrus stage. Molecules involving in the conversion of C3b to iC3b and binding of iC3b were present in the human oviduct (factor I) and mouse preimplantation embryo (Crry and CR3), respectively. In conclusion, the present data showed that the oviduct produced C3/C3b, which was converted to iC3b to stimulate embryo development.

In conclusion, the present data showed that the oviduct produced C3/C3b, which was converted to iC3b to stimulate embryo development. Research is ongoing to optimize the embryo culture condition in human in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer programs. A large proportion of time when embryos are cultured in vitro is when they should be developing in the oviduct in vivo. Oviductal microenvironment is generally accepted to provide the best support to early embryo development. Oviductal cell coculture, the culture of embryo with oviductal cells, has been shown to improve the success rate in prospective randomized control clinical trials (1Yeung W.S.B. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Reprod. Med. Rev. 2002; 10: 21-44Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments show that human oviductal cell coculture enhances the ability of the embryo at blastocyst stage to escape from its outer shell, zona pellucida, in a process known as hatching. Coculture also reduces the fragmentation rate of human embryos (2Bongso A. Soon-Chye N. Sathananthan H. Lian N.P. Rauff M. Ratnam S. Hum. Reprod. 1989; 4: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3Yeung W.S. Ho P.C. Lau E.Y. Chan S.T. Hum. Reprod. 1992; 7: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and increases the blastulation rate and total cell count per blastocyst of mouse embryos (4Liu L.P. Chan S.T. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 2781-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite the success of coculture, it is not commonly used in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer programs because of the complexity in its implementation as a service. Therefore, sequential culture, the use of different media for culturing embryos at different stages of development, is currently the method of choice for improving the outcome of the human in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer program (5Gardner D.K. Schoolcraft W.B. Wagley L. Schlenker T. Stevens J. Hesla J. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 3434-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). However, the culture condition in sequential culture systems is still suboptimal as the development of human embryos in these systems can be further improved by supplementation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (6Sjoblom C. Wikland M. Robertson S.A. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 14: 3069-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), a cytokine with peak expression during the preimplantation period in the human fallopian tube (7Zhao Y. Chegini N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our unpublished data 1J. S. Xu and W. S. B. Yeung, unpublished results. 1J. S. Xu and W. S. B. Yeung, unpublished results. also show that mouse blastocysts after human oviductal cell coculture in G1.2/G2.2, the most commonly used sequential culture system, have better trophectoderm development and therefore hatch more often than those cultured in sequential medium alone. Thus, the beneficial effect of coculture and sequential culture on embryo development can be merged if the embryotrophic factors from the cocultured cells are known and are supplemented to the sequential culture system. Human oviductal cells improve the development of mouse embryos in vitro by the production of factors like cytokines and other factors with unknown identities (1Yeung W.S.B. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Reprod. Med. Rev. 2002; 10: 21-44Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have purified three embryotrophic fractions termed ETF-1, ETF-2, and ETF-3 from human oviductal cell conditioned medium by various liquid chromatographies (4Liu L.P. Chan S.T. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 2781-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Liu L.P. Chan S.T. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whereas ETF-1 and ETF-2 preferentially stimulate the development of inner cell mass, ETF-3 enhances the development of trophectoderm, which leads to an increase in the blastocyst size, hatching, and attachment of the hatched blastocyst (9Xu J.S. Cheung T.M. Chan S.T. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ETF-3 is most abundant among the three ETFs (8Liu L.P. Chan S.T. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) 2The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcription. mass spectrometry (MS) (10He Q.Y. Chiu J.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 868-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and Western blot to identify ETF-3 as a mixture containing complement protein 3 (C3) and its derivative, C3b. We demonstrate that the oviductal epithelium produces the complement protein in a cyclical manner. In the classical immune cascade, C3 is cleaved to C3b and C3a when being activated. C3b is further cleaved to iC3b during inactivation by factor I in the presence of cofactors, such as membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46). In mice, the rodent-restricted transmembrane C3 convertase inhibitor, Crry, served the function of MCP and DAF (11Molina H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the presence of these molecules in the oviduct/embryo, suggesting that C3b is converted to iC3b, which is the biologically active embryotrophic molecule of ETF-3. Production of Anti-ETF-3 Antibody—Purified ETF-3 isolated from oviductal cell conditioned medium was used to generate anti-ETF-3 monoclonal antibodies. Screening was performed by enzyme immunoassay 10–12 days after fusion (12Luk J.M. Nnalue N.A. Lindberg A.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 129: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Positive hybridomas were cloned and used to produce antibodies in serum-free medium. Anti-ETF-3 monoclonal antibody clone-14 (ETF3-C14) was purified by affinity chromatography using HiTrap Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated by the Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, CA). The immunoreactivity of the antibody was confirmed by Western blot analysis of three different batches of ETF-3. Protein G Purification of ETF-3—The conditioned medium derived from the immortalized oviductal cells, OE-E6/E7 (13Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Wang Y.L. Tsao S.W. Yeung W.S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), was passed through a concanavalin A affinity column using a fast performance liquid chromatographic system (Amersham Biosciences). Two hundred micrograms of ETF3-C14 was incubated overnight with the dialyzed concanavalin A eluate. The mixture was then passed through a 5-ml HiTrap Protein G column (Amersham Biosciences). The bound immunocomplex was eluted, and the purity was confirmed by Western blot analysis using ETF3-C14 (1:100) and anti-mouse IgG antiserum conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000). The signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (14He Q.Y. Lau G.K. Zhou Y. Yuen S.T. Lin M.C. Kung H.F. Chiu J.F. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of ETF3-C14 affinity-purified ETF-3 was loaded onto a 13-cm IPG strip (pH 3–10). The first dimension was run on an Ettan IPGphor isoelectric Focusing System (Amersham Biosciences), followed by the second dimension SDS electrophoresis in the Hoefer SE 600 system. The gel was then silver-stained. MALDI-TOF Peptide Mass Fingerprint Analysis—The 115-kDa protein band from one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Coomassie Blue-stained) was used for mass spectrometry analysis. In-gel digestion was performed as reported elsewhere (14He Q.Y. Lau G.K. Zhou Y. Yuen S.T. Lin M.C. Kung H.F. Chiu J.F. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the digest was analyzed in a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The mass spectrum was obtained in the delayed extraction mode using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a 175-ns delay. Trypsin autolytic fragment peaks of 906.5049, 1153.5741, and 2163.0570 were used for internal calibration. Data base searching was performed with ProteinProspector MS-Fit (available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu) (14He Q.Y. Lau G.K. Zhou Y. Yuen S.T. Lin M.C. Kung H.F. Chiu J.F. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis Using Anti-C3 and ETF3-C14 Antibody—To confirm that ETF-3 secreted from OE-E6/E7 cells was C3 and that the ETF3-C14 recognized C3, C3b, and iC3b from human serum (Calbiochem), the concanavalin A-eluted fraction (partially purified) and ETF-3 derived from OE-E6/E7 were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using goat anti-human C3 antibody (1: 20,000; Calbiochem) or ETF3-C14 (1:100). The protein bands in the blot were observed with Coomassie Blue staining. Embryotrophic Activity of C3 Derivatives—Embryo culture was performed as described (15Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Kwok K.L. Luk J.M. Lee W.M. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The zygotes were cultured in CZB medium (16Chatot C.L. Ziomek C.A. Bavister B.D. Lewis J.L. Torres I. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1989; 86: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) alone or CZB supplemented with 10 μg/ml of C3, C3b, and iC3b for the first 48 h. They were then transferred to CZB containing 5 mm glucose and appropriate supplementation of C3 or its derivatives. The percentages of embryos reaching fully expanded blastocyst and hatching blastocyst were recorded at ∼120 and 144 h post-human chorionic gonadotropin, respectively. The image of each expanded blastocyst was captured with a phase-contrast inverted microscope. The area of the expanded blastocyst in the images was determined using the MetaMorph imaging system (version 3.51; Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) and compared among different experimental groups. Immunohistochemical Staining—Human oviductal tissue was obtained from patients admitted for hysterectomy due to uterine fibromyoma. The Ethics Committee of the University approved the study protocol. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human oviduct tissue sections were immunostained with the anti-C3 antibody (1:2000; Calbiochem) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody (1:100; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The section was counterstained with propidium iodide. The negative control sections were incubated in parallel with omission of the first antibody or with ETF-3 or iC3b preabsorbed anti-C3 antibody. The sections were observed with a confocal microscope (MRC-600; BioRad). The expression of C3 protein in OE-E6/E7 cells was also studied with the cells cultured in chamber slide (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL). The expression of factor I protein in the human oviduct section was studied with the same protocol using goat anti-factor I (1:2000; Calbiochem) with or without factor I preabsorption. Immunostaining of mouse blastocyst cultured with or without iC3b treatment were preformed as described (15Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Kwok K.L. Luk J.M. Lee W.M. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using anti-C3 antibody (1:2000) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody (1:100). The stained blastocysts were examined under a confocal microscope. RT-PCR for Human C3 and Factor I Expression—Total RNAs from two primary oviductal cell samples (OE89 and OE109), OE-E6/E7 cells at passages 14, and 25, human oviductal epithelium tissue, SKOV-3, CHO-K1 cell lines, and human liver tissue were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quantity and quality of total RNA samples were analyzed by UV spectrophotometry. One hundred nanograms of total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR using the Access RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol using specific primers for human C3 (5′-GGTCAAGCAGGACTCCTTGT-3′ and 5′-CCCTTGTTCATGATGAGGTAG-3) and human factor I (5′-GTCTTCTGCCAGCCATGGCAGAGA-3′ and 5′-GTAATGCAGTCCACCTCACCATT-3′). C3 Protein and mRNA Expression in Mouse Oviducts in Estrous Cycle—The estrous cycle of sexually mature (6–8-week-old) MF1 female mice was determined by vaginal smear. The protein expression of C3 in their oviducts at different estrus stages was studied by immunohistochemical staining described above using polyclonal antibody against the β-chain of C3 (sc-14612; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The antibody was omitted in the negative control. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed as described (15Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Kwok K.L. Luk J.M. Lee W.M. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to determine the relative changes of C3 mRNA in mouse oviducts in the estrus cycle using mouse C3-specific primers (5′-AGAAGACTGCCTGACCTTCA-3′ and 5′-TTTTCTCCCCAGAGGTCAGA-3′). The relative amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′) was used for normalization of the mRNA loading. The relative amount of amplified products was quantified by Labwork Image Acquisition and Analysis Software (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA). A minimum of four replicates of semiquantitative RT-PCR were performed. Messenger RNA Expression of Complement-binding Proteins in Mouse Embryos—In vivo developed mouse embryos at different stages of development were flushed from oviducts or uteri. mRNA of the embryos was isolated using the Dynabeads mRNA Direct kit (Dynal AS) as described (15Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Kwok K.L. Luk J.M. Lee W.M. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two-step RT-PCR was used to determine the Crry, complement receptor 3 (CD11b and CD18), and DAF mRNA transcripts in these embryos. The primers used were Crry (5′-CATCACAGCTTCCTTCTGCCA-3′, 5′-ATCGTTGCTGGTACAGTATA-3′), CD11b (5′-CAGATCAACAATGTGACCGTATGG-3′, 5′-CATCATGTCCTTGTACTGCCGC-3′), CD18 (5′-CATATGTGACGAAGGCTACCA-3′, 5′-TCTAGACTGTCCTCCACATG-3′), and DAF (5′-CAATGGGAATAATGCGAGGGGA-3′, 5′-TATTGTATCCATTCTTCTTG-3′). Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). The data obtained from at least three replicates were combined and analyzed by the χ2 test for the development of embryos and t test for the comparison of the significance of the areas of late blastocysts at day 5 on mouse embryo development. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls method were used to compare mRNA expression determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Differences of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Identification of ETF-3—In order to purify ETF-3 to homogeneity for identification, monoclonal antibodies against ETF-3 were raised. The antiserum of the mouse from which ETF3-C14 was raised nullified the activity of ETF-3 on blastulation and hatching of mouse embryos (15Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Kwok K.L. Luk J.M. Lee W.M. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The antiserum also bound to the epithelial cells of the human oviduct and to the blastomeres of ETF-3-treated mouse embryos (15Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Kwok K.L. Luk J.M. Lee W.M. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ETF3-C14 abolished the embryotrophic effect of ETF-3 (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis showed the presence of an additional 115-kDa protein (PG-115; Fig. 2, lane A) in ETF3-C14 affinity-purified ETF-3 immunocomplex when compared with ETF3-C14 alone (Fig. 2, lane B). In two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the protein appeared as dots with the same size but with slightly different pI ranging from 6 to 7 (data not shown), consistent with our previous conclusion that ETF-3 was glycoprotein in nature (8Liu L.P. Chan S.T. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A data base search showed that the peptide mass fingerprint from MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of PG-115 was complement C3 precursor (Table I).Table IIdentification of Protein G-purified 115-kDa protein by MALDI-TOF MS Protein sequence of human complement component 3 precursor as retrieved from ProteinProspector MS-Fit search result with sequence coverage 9% and MOWSE score 23010 (available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu) (accession no.

ETF3-C14 reacted with the 115-kDa α-chain of C3 (α-115), the 106-kDa α′-chain of C3b (α′-106), and the 40-kDa α-chain of iC3b (α-40), indicating that the binding epitope of the antibody was in the α-40 fragment of C3. Anti-C3 polyclonal antibody detected the presence of C3 fragments in purified and partially purified ETF-3 (concanavalin A-bound fraction of OE-E6/E7 conditioned medium) with sizes of 115, 106, 75, and 40 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Mass spectrometry analysis of the 115, 106, and 75-kDa bands confirmed their identities as C3 precursor (data not shown). ETF3-C14 recognized the 115-, 106-, and 40-kDa bands of purified and partially purified ETF-3. Embryotrophic Activity of C3 and Its Fragments—The development of mouse embryos with or without C3 derivatives treatment is shown in Table II. The rate of embryo development was based on the number of two-cell embryos after 24 h of culture. The embryos incubated with iC3b for 4 days had significantly more expanded blastocysts and a higher hatching rate (p < 0.05) when compared with those cultured in medium alone and media supplemented with other C3 fragments. The size of the expanded blastocysts in the iC3b group as determined by the area of the expanded blastocysts was also significantly larger than the other groups (p < 0.05). Both C3b and iC3b stimulated hatching of the treated embryos. iC3b immunoreactivity was found in the trophectoderm of iC3b treated mouse blastocysts but not in medium alone-cultured blastocysts (Fig. 4).Table IIEffects of C3 and its fragments on mouse embryo development in vitro Values with the same symbol within the same column are significantly different (p < 0.05).No. of two-cell embryosExpanded blastocystHatching blastocystAmountArea ± S.E.No. %μm2No. %CZB230128 (56)*9265 ± 170*51 (22)*,#C312969 (53)#8961 ± 208#35 (27)§C3b14085 (61)9514 ± 223§49 (35)*iC3b13188 (67)*,#11,171 ± 245*,#,§58 (44)#,§ Open table in a new tab Protein and mRNA Expression of Oviduct and Oviductal Cells—C3 immunoreactivity was localized to the epithelial lining of human oviduct (Fig. 5A, a). After preabsorption of the anti-C3 antibody with ETF-3 or iC3b, no signal was found in the sections (b and c). Immortalized human oviductal cells, OE-E6/E7, possessed C3 immunoreactivity, which was absent when anti-C3 antibody preabsorbed with ETF-3 was used (Fig. 5A, d and e, respectively). Factor I was localized to the epithelial lining of the human oviduct, and no signal was obtained when anti-factor I antibody was preabsorbed with factor I (Fig. 5A, f and g, respectively). The mRNA expression of human C3 (972 bp) and human factor I (722 bp) were detected in two primary oviductal cell samples, OE-E6/E7 cells at passages 14 and 25, oviductal epithelium tissue from two patients, SKOV-3 cells, and human liver tissue (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–7 and 9). No such mRNA expression was found in the CHO-K1 cells (lane 8). Positive staining of C3 was found in the epithelial lining of the mouse oviduct at different stages (Fig. 6A). The C3 immunoreactivity was stronger at estrus and metestrus than at other stages. This change in immunoreactivity was positively correlated with the mRNA expression levels (Fig. 6B), highest at estrus and lowest at diestrus. A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in the mRNA expression level was found between these two stages. Crry, CR3, and DAF Expression in Mouse Preimplantation Embryo—The expression of mouse Crry, CD11b (αM), and CD18 (β2) of CR3 and DAF mRNA was determined in the mouse embryos at different developmental stages (Fig. 7). Crry (520 bp) and DAF (563 bp) transcripts were constitutively expressed throughout the preimplantation development. Mouse embryos expressed αM (498 bp) and β2 (282 bp) mRNA of CR3. The expression of αM was absent at the three- to four-cell and morula stages, whereas that of β2 was present from the two-cell stage onwards. All of the transcripts were present in mouse liver (positive control). We describe here the identification of ETF-3 as complement C3 and that its derivatives are embryotrophic. Our previous data showed that ETF-3 enhanced the development of trophectoderm and the hatching of the treated embryos (9Xu J.S. Cheung T.M. Chan S.T. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The beneficial effect of ETF-3 on mouse embryo development is also seen when it is supplemented to a G1.2/G2.2 sequential embryo culture system.2 The ETF3-C14 antibody abolishes the embryotrophic effect of ETF-3 and recognizes a 115-kDa protein in ETF-3 identified by mass spectrometry to be complement C3. This is verified by the cross-reactivities between anti-C3 antibody with ETF-3 and ETF3-C14 with C3 and its derivatives. A previous study has reported the presence of C3 immuno-reactivity in human oviduct (17Tauber P.F. Wettich W. Nohlen M. Zaneveld L.J. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1985; 151: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cellular location of the protein has not been studied. The present study localized C3 immunoreactivity to the cytoplasm of the epithelial lining of human oviduct (Fig. 5). The lack of staining on oviduct sections using anti-C3 antibody preabsorbed with ETF-3 and iC3b confirms that the immunoreactivity is due to at least a C3-like molecule, if not C3. The presence of C3 mRNA in the oviduct indicates that the protein is synthesized de novo. The conclusion is supported by the expression of C3 mRNA and protein in immortalized human oviductal cells, consistent with our previous finding on the localization of ETF-3 immunoreactivity in OE-E6/E7 cells (15Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Kwok K.L. Luk J.M. Lee W.M. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, our preliminary data showing the presence of C3 immunoreactivity in hydrosalpinx fluid lends further support to the secretion of C3 by the human oviduct. 3Y. L. Lee and W. S. B. Yeung, unpublished observations. C3 immunoreactivity is also present in the luminal epithelium of the mouse oviduct. Complement C3b was synthesized and secreted by the luminal epithelium at the apical border of the porcine oviducts (18Buhi W.C. Alvarez I.M. Kouba A.J. Cells Tissues Organs. 2000; 166: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Buhi W.C. Alvarez I.M. Theriogenology. 2003; 60: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). C3-like molecule in the oviduct of an amphibian, B. arenarum (20Llanos R.J. Whitacre C.M. Miceli D.C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2000; 127: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), has also been reported. The presence of C3 or its derivatives in widely different species suggests that the molecule may have important physiological function in the oviduct. Our previous report demonstrated that ETF-3 had a temporal effect on trophectoderm development with maximal efficiency between the three- to four-cell and blastocyst stages, leading to a higher hatching rate (9Xu J.S. Cheung T.M. Chan S.T. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Preimplantation embryos up to the morula stage are developed within the oviduct (21Hogan B. Lacy E. Costantini F. Beddington R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 19-114Google Scholar). The cyclical changes of C3 expression in mouse oviduct with higher immunoreactivity at estrus and metestrus and mRNA expression at estrus in comparison with that at diestrus are in line with the embryotrophic activity of ETF-3 in the oviduct. The expression of C3b in the oviductal ampulla of pig is under hormonal regulation (22Buhi W.C. Ashworth C.J. Bazer F.W. Alvarez I.M. J. Exp. Zool. 1992; 262: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Its concentration in the luminal fluid of pig is high at estrus and during the early embryo cleavage stage of pregnancy (19Buhi W.C. Alvarez I.M. Theriogenology. 2003; 60: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). C3 immunoreactivity is detected in human oviduct at the luteal phase in this study, and its expression at other phases of the menstrual cycle is being investigated in this laboratory. These are in line with the detection of C3 immunoreactivity in the endometrium of humans (23Tao X.J. Sayegh R.A. Isaacson K.B. Fertil. Steril. 1997; 68: 460-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), mice (24Li S.H. Huang H.L. Chen Y.H. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and rats (25Puy L.A. Kuivanen P.C. DeSombre E.R. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 99: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and the higher biosynthetic activity of C3 in human endometrium at the luteal phase than that at the proliferative phase (26Hasty L.A. Lambris J.D. Lessey B.A. Pruksananonda K. Lyttle C.R. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1994; 170: 168-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the observed embryotrophic activity of ETF-3 is physiologically relevant. We propose that the oviduct of human and mouse secretes C3 and"

To date there are ten different TLRs in humans, and ligands for most of the TLRs have been identified (1Akira S. Hemmi H. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 85: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Some TLRs function as homo- or heterodimers. For example, TLR2 activity is enhanced by heterodimerization with TLR1 or TLR6 while TLR4 may form homodimers (2Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Shroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar, 3Hajjar A.M. O'Mahony D.S. Ozinsky A.

Recent studies also show that dectin-1 plays a synergistic role with TLR2 in macrophage and dendritic cell activation by β-glucan-containing particles (6Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Canvera S.J. Akira S. Underhill D.M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 7Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willment J.A. Marshall A.S.J. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Important functional interactions of TLRs with non-TLR molecules are well known, for example, TLR4 with MD-2 and CD14. More of these interactions probably remain to be discovered. TLR activation leads to a cascade of intracellular signal propagation events ultimately leading to production of various cytokines. This signal propagation involves recruitment of cellular adaptor molecules for TLRs such as MyD88, TIRAP/MAL, and TRIF/TICAM-1 as well as kinases including IRAKs and MAPKs (reviewed in Refs. 8Akira S. Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and 9Dunne A. O'Neill L.A.J. Science's STKE.http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtransDate: 2003Google Scholar). TLRs are known to bind the intracellular adaptor molecules via the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains, which are present in both TLRs and adaptors, by homotypic protein-protein interactions. Some of these interactions may also be mediated by JNK-interacting protein 3 (10Matsuguchi T. Masuda A. Sugimoto K. Nagai Y. Yoshikai Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4455-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the TIR domains of human TLR1 and TLR2 was elucidated (11Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Lpsd allele, in which the proline at 712 in TLR4 is substituted with histidine (12Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar), does not clearly disturb the TIR domain structure but was hypothesized to abrogate receptor function by interrupting interactions with signaling adaptor molecules (11Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have been particularly interested to understand mechanisms of TLR receptor oligomerization because we hypothesize that these interactions are crucial to initiation of intracellular signaling. Previously we showed that TLR2 oligomerization with TLRs 1 or 6 was ligand-independent and that ligand binding altered subunit interaction, thereby leading to transmembrane signal propagation (5Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Endotoxin Res. 2003; 9: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Others have come to similar conclusions (2Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Shroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar, 3Hajjar A.M. O'Mahony D.S. Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Klebanoff S.J. Wilson C.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Ozinsky et al. (2Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Shroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar) concluded that TLR2 and TLR6 dimerization was controlled by their extracellular domains. In this work, we utilize a novel approach to the mechanism of TLR receptor oligomerization and conclude that intracellular domains are important for receptor oligomerization as well. The protein-protein interactions between TLRs and their adaptor molecules have generally been tested by in vitro immunoprecipitation analysis, whereas the protein complementation assay (PCA) is a novel, recently developed method to detect protein-protein interactions in vivo (13Michnick S.W. Remy I. Campbell-Valois F.-X. Vallee-Belisle A. Pelletier J.N. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 208-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the PCAs, which is based on the use of TEM-1 β-lactamase from Escherichia coli, has been successfully used for studying the rapamycin-inducible protein interaction between FK506-binding protein 12 and FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein as well as constitutive protein-protein interactions (14Wehrman T. Kleaveland B. Her J.-H. Balint R.F. Blau H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3469-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Galarneau A. Primeau M. Trudeau L.-E. Michnick S.W. Nat. Biotech. 2002; 20: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The strategy of this TEM-1 β-lactamase-utilizing PCA is to mediate the complementation of two partial β-lactamase fragments by two proteins conjugated respectively with the enzyme fragments. The complementation is then detected by an intracellular reporter substrate (CCF-2) whose fluorescence properties change after hydrolysis by the β-lactamase (14Wehrman T. Kleaveland B. Her J.-H. Balint R.F. Blau H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3469-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Galarneau A. Primeau M. Trudeau L.-E. Michnick S.W. Nat. Biotech. 2002; 20: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a successful use of the β-lactamase PCA with TLRs, showing type I transmembrane protein interactions by this method for the first time. Using this assay, we detected in vivo TLR interactions mediated by the cytoplasmic domains of TLRs. Reagents and Antibodies—Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli serotype O111:B4 was purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA) and re-purified as previously described (16Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 17Lee H.-K. Lee J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4012-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) used in this study was previously described (17Lee H.-K. Lee J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4012-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Mühlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Süssmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and anti-HA.11 antibody was obtained from Covance-Berkeley Antibody Company (Richmond, CA). Anti-human TLR9 monoclonal antibody (clone 26C593) was obtained from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—According to previous studies (14Wehrman T. Kleaveland B. Her J.-H. Balint R.F. Blau H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3469-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Galarneau A. Primeau M. Trudeau L.-E. Michnick S.W. Nat. Biotech. 2002; 20: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), two β-lactamase gene fragments, Bla(a) and Bla(b), were amplified by PCR using the vector pQE32 as a template. The primers used were the forward primers (5′-GAA GAA GGA TCC GGA GGA GGA GGA AGT GGA GGA GGA GGA AGT GGA GGA GGA GGA AGT CAC CCT GAA ACG CTG GTG AAA GTA A-3′ for Bla(a) and 5′-GTC GAC GGA TCC GGT GGT GGT GGT AGT GGT GGT GGT GGT AGT GGT GGT GGT GGT AGT CTA CTT ACT CTA GCT TCT CGG CAA CAA-3′ for Bla(b)) and the reverse primers (5′-GAA TTC GAT ATC TCA GCC AGT TAA TAG TTT GCG CAA CGT TGT-3′ for Bla(a) and 5′-GAA TTC GAT ATC TTA CCA ATG CTT AAT CAG TGA GGC ACC TAT-3′ for Bla(b)). The Bla(a) fragment consists of amino acids 26–196 and Bla(b), 198–290. Each fragment was tagged with a BamHI site followed by a flexible linker, (Gly4Ser)3, on the 5′-end and an EcoRV site on the 3′-end. Human TLR2 or TLR4 cDNA without a stop codon was cloned into the vector pFLAG-CMV1 (Sigma-Aldrich) linearized with KpnI/BamHI (TLR4) or NotI/BamHI (TLR2). The Bla(a) or Bla(b) gene fragment was then subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV1-TLR plasmids linearized with BamHI/SmaI. This led to the formation of the TLR-linker-Bla(a) or -Bla(b) constructs. Similarly, MyD88 and the death domain (amino acids 19–110) of MyD88 were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pRK5(HA)2 vector (a gift from Dr. E. Li, The Scripps Research Institute) followed by subcloning with the Bla(a) or Bla(b) gene fragment. The chimeric constructs, T2N-T4C and T4N-T2C, were made by a combination of PCR amplification and conjugation, and cloned into the pFLAG-CMV1 vector. T2N-T4C consists of the extracellular domain of TLR2 (amino acids 19–589) and the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 (amino acids 632–839) whereas T4N-T2C consists of the extracellular domain of TLR4 (amino acids 24–631) and the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain of TLR2 (amino acids 590–784). The deletion mutant, T4C, which consists of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 (amino acids 632–839), was made by PCR amplification and cloned into the pFLAG-CMV1 vector. The TLR-PH mutants, in which the proline residue at position 714 of hTLR4, corresponding to the proline at 712 in the mouse TLR4 or 618 in hTLR2, was substituted by histidine, were made using a QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pFLAG-CMV1-hTLR1 and pEF6-hTLR9 plasmids were gifts from Dr. T. H. Chuang (The Scripps Research Institute). Additionally, the TLR constructs with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag were made by substituting the FLAG tag with the HA tag using PCR amplification. All of the PCR clones were fully sequenced to confirm that no PCR errors occurred. MD-1 Cloning—The human MD-1 gene was amplified using the first strand cDNA as template obtained by reverse transcription (Invitrogen) of total RNAs from human RPMI 8866 cells. The primers used are the forward primer (5′-GAG AAG AGG ATC CAC ATG AAG GGT TTC ACA GCC ACT CTC TT-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-TCT AGA CTC GAG GGA GCA CAT GAT AGT AGC ATT GGC ACA-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the vector pCDNA3.1-Myc/His (Invitrogen) at BamHI and XhoI sites. The PCR clone was fully sequenced to confirm that no PCR errors occurred. Cell Culture, Transfection, and β-Lactamase Complementation Assay with CCF2/AM—HeLa or HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies) with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (5 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/10% fetal calf serum. On the following day, cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg/ml DNA using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with a modified physiological saline buffer (10 mm HEPES, 6 mm sucrose, 10 mm glucose, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% probenecid, pH 7.35) (15Galarneau A. Primeau M. Trudeau L.-E. Michnick S.W. Nat. Biotech. 2002; 20: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and loaded with 1 μm CCF2/AM (PanVera LLC, Madison, WI) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with physiological saline buffer and observed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 100TV with a Diagnostics Instruments SPOT cooled CCD camera) using a filter set from Omega Optical XF12–2: 405 nm excitation, 420 dichroic mirror, 435 nm long-pass emission. Flow Cytometry—The transiently transfected cells were washed and loaded with 1 μm CCF2/AM for 1 h as described above. After 1 h, the cells were detached and washed twice with physiological saline. The cells were resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline and used for flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was conducted with FACSVantage S.E. (BD Biosciences) equipped with excitation at 408 nm and emission at 519/30 nm (CCF2, green fluorescence) or 450/40 nm (cleaved CCF2, blue fluorescence). NF-κB Reporter Assay—NF-κB reporter assay was performed as previously described (17Lee H.-K. Lee J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4012-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 or HeLa cells (1.5 × 105) were plated in 12-well plates with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/10% fetal calf serum. On the following day, cells were transiently transfected with 0.02 μg/ml TLR construct vector or empty vector along with 0.05 μg/ml pNF-κB-Luc vector (for HEK293) or pIL8-promoter-Luc vector (for HeLa) and pSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). For cells transfected with TLR4 constructs, MD-2 and CD14 expression plasmids were cotransfected. After 24 h, cells were stimulated for 6 h with the ligands as noted in the figures, and then cell extracts were prepared. The luciferase activity was measured using a Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was measured using O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. Luciferase activity reported in the figures is normalized for transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase activity. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HEK293 cells (5 × 105) were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg/ml DNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Applied Science). The supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies for2hat4 °C. Protein A-agarose beads were then added to the mixtures and further incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were washed five times with lysis buffer, separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed by probing the membrane with either anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies according to standard protocols. Construction Strategy and Validation of β-Lactamase PCA using TLR4 and MyD88 —To construct β-lactamase fragment-conjugated chimeric TLR and MyD88, two separate β-lactamase fragments named Bla(a) and Bla(b), divided at amino acid 197, were constructed according to previous studies (14Wehrman T. Kleaveland B. Her J.-H. Balint R.F. Blau H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3469-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Galarneau A. Primeau M. Trudeau L.-E. Michnick S.W. Nat. Biotech. 2002; 20: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Each construct was fused to its heterologous partner by a flexible (Gly4Ser)3 linker so that after protein-protein interaction, the two enzyme fragments could re-associate (Fig. 1A). The in vivo β-lactamase enzyme complementation in this study was induced by TLR-TLR dimerization or TLR-MyD88 interaction; the mechanism of the enzyme activity and substrate hydrolysis is illustrated in Fig. 1B. To test the β-lactamase PCA utilizing TLR interaction partners, we first studied the known interaction between TLR4 and MyD88 as well as the formation of MyD88 homodimers (19Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.-L. Marco F.D. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The TLR4-MyD88 interaction occurs via the TIR domain while the MyD88 homodimerization may involve both TIR as well as death domains (DD) (19Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.-L. Marco F.D. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 20Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). When MyD88-Bla(b) and MyD88-Bla(a) or DD[MyD88]-Bla(a) were transiently cotransfected in HEK293 cells, the constructs interacted productively as shown by the appearance of blue fluorescent cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, TLR4-Bla(b) interacted productively with MyD88-Bla(a) but not with DD[MyD88]-Bla(a) (Fig. 2A). The β-lactamase activity was quantified by FACS analysis (Fig. 2B) and the proportion of β-lactamase-positive cells compared (Fig. 2C). These interactions were further tested by in vitro immunoprecipitation. As expected, TLR4 was co-immunoprecipitated only with wild-type MyD88 but not with DD[MyD88] while MyD88 was co-immunoprecipitated with both full-length MyD88 and DD[MyD88] (Fig. 2D). Expression and Function of TLR4- and TLR2-β-Lactamase Fusion Constructs—The β-lactamase fusion constructs were made with TLR4 and TLR2 as well as the cytoplasmic proline-histidine (PH) mutants of TLR4 and TLR2. Each construct was expressed in HEK293 cells, and the proteins expressed were immunoprecipitated. The expression level of each construct was similar (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the receptor function of each β-lactamase-fused TLR receptor construct was maintained although they exhibited lower activity than that of intact TLR receptors (Fig. 3, B and C). As expected from the Lpsd phenotype (12Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar), all the β-lactamase-fused TLR-PH mutant constructs were non-functional (Fig. 3, B and C). In Vivo Detection of TLR4-TLR4 and TLR4-TLR2 Dimerization by β-Lactamase PCA—When TLR4-Bla(a) and TLR4-Bla(b) were transiently cotransfected in HEK293 cells, the overexpressed TLR4 spontaneously formed homodimers and resulted in β-lactamase complementation as analyzed by FACS (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, when TLR4 constructs were cotransfected with TLR2 construct, TLR4 also formed heterodimers with TLR2 (Fig. 4A). The ratio of β-lactamase-positive cells analyzed by FACS was compared (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, the dimerization of PH mutants was significantly affected by the point mutation. The homodimerization of the TLR4PH-TLR4PH pair was almost completely abolished while the homodimerization of either pair of wild-type TLR4 and TLR4PH mutant was partially diminished. Similarly, the heterodimerization between TLR4PH and TLR2PH was also significantly diminished while the heterodimerization of either pair of TLR2-TLR4PH or TLR2PH-TLR4 was partially diminished (Fig. 4). The co-immunoprecipitation was further performed to test the in vitro TLR-TLR interactions using the cotransfected HEK293 cells with wild-type or mutant constructs of TLR2 and TLR4 (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, only the mutant pairs of TLR4PH-TLR4PH or TLR4PH-TLR2PH were not co-immunoprecipitated each other (Fig. 5A, middle) while the expression level of all the proteins was similar (Fig. 5A, top and bottom). Furthermore, in a comparative co-immunoprecipitation of TLR4 versus TLR2 or TLR9, TLR4 was co-immunoprecipitated only with TLR2 but not with TLR9, implying that TLR4 specifically interacts with TLR2 (Fig. 5B). Because the Pro → His mutation is in the intracellular domains and blocks dimerization, these results imply an important role for the intracellular domain in TLR4 association with itself or TLR2.Fig. 5Co-immunoprecipitation of various TLR-Bla fusion constructs. HEK293 cells were transiently cotransfected with different combination of the TLR-Bla fusion constructs (A) or TLR plasmids (B) as noted. After 48 h, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-FLAG, anti-HA or anti-TLR9 antibody. The arrowheads indicate the proteins of interest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cytoplasmic Domain-dependent TLR4 Constitutive Activity— The overexpression of TLR4 highly activates HEK293 cells and this ligand-independent constitutive activation leads to NF-κB induction. Since the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 seems to be important in its spontaneous homodimerization, we hypothesized that the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 is responsible for its constitutive activity in HEK293 cells. Thus, we made chimeric constructs using TLR4 and TLR2 (Fig. 6A). Each construct was efficiently expressed at a similar level (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, only the TLR4 cytoplasmic domain-containing constructs, T2N-T4C and T4C, exhibited constitutive activity as did wild-type TLR4. In contrast, wild-type TLR2 and the construct T4N-T2C did not show constitutive activity (Fig. 6C). The cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 was co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type TLR4 (Fig. 7A). In the in vivo β-lactamase complementation assay, the TLR4 cytoplasmic domain formed dimers with the cytoplasmic domain itself as well as with wild-type TLR4 (Fig. 7B). Not surprisingly, the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 interacted with wild-type MyD88 but not with the death domain of MyD88 (Fig. 7B). These results correspond with the results observed in the in vivo homodimerization of TLR4 (Fig. 4) and indicate that the cytoplasmic domain-mediated spontaneous dimerization of TLR4 is responsible for the ligand-independent TLR4 constitutive activation.Fig. 7Co-immunoprecipitation and in vivo interaction of the TLR4 cytoplasmic domain (T4C) and wild-type TLR4. A, co-immunoprecipitation of T4C and wild-type TLR4. HEK293 cells were transiently cotransfected with wild-type TLR4 (0.5 μg/ml) and T4C construct (0.5 μg/ml) as noted. After 48 h, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody. B, β-lactamase reconstitution in HEK293 (B) or HeLa (C) cells. HEK293 or HeLa cells were transiently transfected with various chimeric construct pairs (0.5 μg/ml, respectively) as noted. After 24 h, cells were loaded with CCF2/AM. The percent population of β-lactamase-positive cells was compared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) β-Lactamase Reconstitution in HeLa cells—To ensure that the associations shown in Fig. 7B were generalizable to other cellular systems and to ensure that these events were not dependent on HEK293 cell activation in response to TLR4 transfection as in Fig. 6, we repeated the PCA experiments of Fig. 7B in HeLa cells. In these cells, transfected TLR4 is quiescent. As shown in Fig. 7C, the same pattern of association events seen in HEK293 cells was observed in HeLa cells. Constitutive TLR4 Dimerization Enhanced by MD-2—MD-2 physically binds to the extracellular portion of TLR4 (21Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and this interaction is also shown in Fig. 8E in which MD-2 only interacts with intact TLR4 but not with the ECD-deleted mutant (T4C) or TLR1 (Fig. 8E). Together with CD14, MD-2 is required for LPS-mediated cell signaling via TLR4. Since the LPS-mediated TLR4 activation occurred only in the presence of MD-2, we wondered if the ligand-independent TLR4 constitutive activation could be enhanced by MD-2. In addition to MD-2, CD14, or MD-1 was cotransfected with TLR4. MD-2 significantly enhanced TLR4 activation whereas CD14 and MD-1 did not help the activation (Fig. 8A). Because MD-2 interacted with the TLR4 extracellular portion (Ref. 21Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and Fig. 8E), we questioned if MD-2 could also enhance the constitutive activities of the chimeric constructs, T2N-T4C and T4C, which are free of the extracellular domain of TLR4. Not surprisingly, MD-2 did not enhance either T2N-T4C or T4C activity (Fig. 8B). The addition of LPS further increased TLR4 activation in the presence of MD-2 and CD14 (Fig. 8C). The MD-2-enhanced TLR4 dimerization was further tested using in vivo β-lactamase complementation. Note that the amounts of TLR4-Bla constructs used in Fig. 8D was 10-fold less than that used in Figs. 2, A and B and 4A. In this experiment, the in vivo TLR4 dimerization was significantly enhanced by MD-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8D). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that TLR4 dimerization occurs via its cytoplasmic domain and the dimerization is enhanced by binding of MD-2 to the extracellular domain of TLR4. These data definitively show the utility of the β-lactamase PCA for studies of TLR and TLR-adaptor molecule interactions. They also show that interactions between TLRs may be mediated by intracellular domains. The latter finding suggests that published work ascribing TLR heterodimer formation to extracellular domain interactions (2Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Shroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar) is not a fully general finding. The β-lactamase PCA is a newly developed method. Its utility has been tested for intracellular proteins such as apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bad as well as homodimerization of Smad3, producing successful in vivo protein-protein interactions (15Galarneau A. Primeau M. Trudeau L.-E. Michnick S.W. Nat. Biotech. 2002; 20: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In our study, the utility of the β-lactamase PCA was focused on the interactions between type 1 transmembrane proteins and cellular proteins as well as dimerization of transmembrane proteins, which was not previously shown by this PCA. This first was validated by testing interactions of MyD88 with TLR. Burns et al. (19Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.-L. Marco F.D. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) first showed homodimerization of MyD88 and the involvement of the MyD88 death domain (in addition to the TIR domain) in this dimerization. Our data in Fig. 2 again show MyD88 dimerization through the death domain by immunoprecipitation as shown by Burns et al. and confirm it newly by the use of the β-lactamase PCA. The PCA also demonstrates the well known association of TLR4 with MyD88 and that this is not mediated by the MyD88 death domain. To our knowledge, self-association of TLR4, without the mediation of CD4 or integrin interacting domains (2Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Shroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar, 4Zhang H. Tay P.N. Cao W. Li W. Lu J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), has not previously been shown. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates the self-association of TLR4 (Fig. 5) and the β-lactamase PCA also demonstrates it (Fig. 4). To our surprise, the PCA also demonstrated an association between TLR4 and TLR2 (Fig. 4), verified by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5). While autoactivation of TLR4 transfected HEK293 cells suggests that TLR4 might self associate, this self-association is not dependent on autoactivation, since it is seen also in quiescent HeLa cells (Fig. 7). The association of TLR4 with TLR2 is unprecedented since there are no ligands known which require the co-presence of TLR4 and TLR2 for cellular activation. The hypothesis of Ozinsky et al. (2Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Shroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar) that novel specificities can be formed by heterologous dimerization of TLRs suggests that some novel ligand may yet be found for such a TLR pair. While TLR4 self-association and TLR4-TLR2 association could be due to extracellular domain interactions as suggested for TLR2-TLR6 (2Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Shroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar), blocking these associations by the Pro → His mutation of the Lpsd allele clearly points to an important role for intracellular domain interactions. While the PCA data show only that the mutation blocks the associative reactions of the lactamase fragments, the immunoprecipitation data clearly show that the Pro → His mutation actually does block the TLR interactions. The correlation between loss of activity (Fig. 3, B and C) and loss of association (Figs. 4 and 5) caused by the Pro → His mutation suggests that dimerization is required for signaling. Because the data indicate an important role for the intracellular domains in subunit dimerization, we further studied intracellular domain function by activity (Fig. 6), co-immunoprecipitation, and PCA activation (Fig. 7). Fig. 6 shows that the characteristic autoactivation effects of transfection of HEK293 cells with TLR4 as opposed to TLR2 are carried by the intracellular domains of these two TLRs. Fig. 7 shows that the intracellular domain of TLR4 binds to intact TLR4 and that it will carry a lactamase fragment into a productive interaction with the complementary lactamase fragment linked to either TLR4 or MyD88, as long as the MyD88 is intact. Enhanced self-association of TLR4 by coexpression of MD-2, but not of CD14 or MD-1, was shown by both enhanced autoactivation as well as enhanced β-lactamase reconstitution. These data suggest that the presence of MD-2 can enhance the intracellular domain initiated self-association of TLR4 monomers, and, at least in part, confirm the data of da Silva Correia and Ulevitch (22da Silva Correia J. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1845-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We have previously used an alternative PCA based on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to show that TLR2 ligands induce a conformational change in TLR2 heterodimers associated with signal transduction (5Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Endotoxin Res. 2003; 9: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In those experiments, activation of the PCA required ligand although TLR2 was associated with TLR6 or TLR1 in the absence of ligand (5Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Endotoxin Res. 2003; 9: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present instance, with the β-lactamase PCA, complementation occurs independently of ligand although the enzyme complementation induced by TLR4 homodimerization was significantly enhanced by MD-2. Why the two PCA should report different events is not yet clear but may reflect functional differences between TLR2 and TLR4. We are currently testing modifications of the β-lactamase PCA to determine if subtle, and some not so subtle, changes in the linker will make the β-lactamase PCA-sensitive to the presence of TLR ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2014239122,"Previous studies have identified the DUB family of cytokine-regulated murine deubiquitinating enzymes, which play a role in the control of cell proliferation and survival. Through data base analyses and cloning, we have identified a human cDNA (DUB-3) that shows significant homology to the known murine DUB family members. Northern blotting has shown expression of this gene in a number of tissues including brain, liver, and muscle, with two transcripts being apparent (1.6 and 1.7 kb). In addition, expression was observed in cell lines including those derived from a number of hematopoietic tumors such as the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line RAJI. We have also demonstrated that DUB-3, which was shown to be an active deubiquitinating enzyme, is induced in response to interleukin-4 and interleukin-6 stimulation. Finally, we have demonstrated that constitutive expression of DUB-3 blocks proliferation and can initiate apoptosis in both IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. These findings suggest that human DUB-3, like the murine DUB family members, is transiently induced in response to cytokines and can, when constitutively expressed, block growth factor-dependent proliferation.

It has become apparent that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway plays an important role in the regulation of many cellular processes such as the cell cycle (1DeSalle L.M. Pagano M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 179-189Google Scholar), transcription (2Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Google Scholar), apoptosis (3Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Google Scholar), and receptor internalization and vesicle trafficking (4Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Google Scholar, 5Donaldson K.M. Yin H. Gekakis N. Supek F. Joazeiro C.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 258-262Google Scholar). This has led to attention being focused upon the proteins that modulate this pathway. These include a group of enzyme complexes, referred to as E3-ligases, as well as the E2-conjugating enzymes with which they interact to transfer ubiquitin to its targets (6Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar). Another large group of proteins involved in this process are the deubiquitinating enzymes, a family of ubiquitin-specific proteases that cleave ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and are thought to act at several points in the ubiquitin pathway, including polyubiquitin precursor processing, the removal of ubiquitin from substrates to rescue them from degradation, and the removal of residual ubiquitin to aid proteasomal degradation (7D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Google Scholar). These enzymes are classified into two main sub-families, the ubiquitin processing proteases (UBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: UBP, ubiquitin processing protease; UCH, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases; HTLV-1, human T-cell lymphotropic virus I; ATL, adult T-cell leukemia; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PI, propidium iodide; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. and the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), which are both cysteine proteases whose active sites contain a cysteine, histidine, and aspartate residue (8Baek K.-H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 1-7Google Scholar). The UBPs vary greatly in size and structural complexity, but all UBPs contain six conserved homology domains (DHI–DHVI). The UCHs are a family of small, closely related proteins which lack these six domains (7D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Google Scholar). In addition to these two main sub-families, the JAMM family of metalloproteases (9Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Google Scholar), as well as the OTU family of isopeptidases (10Evans P.C. Smith T.S. Lai M.-J. Williams M.G. Burke D.F. Heyninck K. Kreike M.M. Beyaert R. Blundell T.L. Kilshaw P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23180-23186Google Scholar), have recently been identified as deubiquitinating enzymes. Although the substrates of most deubiquitinating enzymes are unknown, it is clear that they play important roles in the regulation of many cellular processes. For example, FAF (fat facets) can regulate Drosophila eye development (11Huang Y. Baker R.T. Fischer-Vize J.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1828-1831Google Scholar), FAM (fat facets in mice) (USP9) is vital for embryonic development in mice (12Pantaleon M. Kanai-Azuma M. Mattick J.S. Kaibuchi K. Kaye P.L. Wood S.A. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 151-160Google Scholar), UBP3 (13Moazed D. Johnson D. Cell. 1996; 86: 667-677Google Scholar) and D-ubp-64E (14Henchoz S. De Rubertis F. Pauli D. Spierer P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5717-5725Google Scholar) play a role in transcriptional silencing, and other UBPs have been shown to interact with important cell signaling proteins, such as p53 (15Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Google Scholar), Rb (16DeSalle L.M. Latres E. Lin D. Graner E. Montagnoli A. Baker R.T. Pagano M. Loda M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5538-5542Google Scholar, 17Blanchette P. Gilchrist C.A. Baker R.T. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5533-5537Google Scholar), β-catenin (18Taya S. Yamamoto T. Kanai-Azuma M. Wood S.A. Kaibuchi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 757-767Google Scholar), BRCA1 (19Jensen D.E. Proctor M. Marquis S.T. Gardner H.P. Ha S.I. Chodosh L.A. Ishov A.M. Tommerup N. Vissing H. Sekido Y. Minna J. Borodovsky A. Schultz D.C. Wilkinson K.D. Maul G.G. Barlev N. Berger S.L. Prendergast G.C. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1097-1112Google Scholar), and VHL (20Li Z.B. Na X. Wang D.K. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4656-4662Google Scholar). Deubiquitinating enzymes have also been implicated in cell transformation. In particular, a truncated isoform of the mammalian UBP, tre-2, which has no deubiquitinating activity, has been shown to transform 3T3 fibroblasts (21Nakamura T. Hillova J. Mariage-Samson R. Onno M. Huebner K. Cannizzaro L.A. Boghosian-Sell L. Croce C.M. Hill M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 733-741Google Scholar). Also, over-expression of unp (USP4), another mammalian UBP, induces transformation of NIH3T3 cells injected into athymic mice (22Gupta K. Chevrette M. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1729-1731Google Scholar) and elevated levels of its human orthologue, unph, have been found in small cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung (23Gray D.A. Inazawa J. Gupta K. Wong A. Ueda R. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2179-2183Google Scholar). The DUB family of UBPs were identified in mice as hematopoietic-specific deubiquitinating enzymes that are rapidly induced upon cytokine stimulation. DUB-1 is induced by IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF and is expressed in a number of hematopoietic cell types (24Zhu Y. Os Pless M. Inhorn R. Mathey-Prevot B. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4808-4819Google Scholar), whereas DUB-2 seems to be regulated specifically by IL-2, with its expression restricted to T cells (25Zhu Y. Lambert K. Corless C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. D'Andrea A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 51-57Google Scholar). DUB-2A has recently been added to this family and is also primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells (26Baek K.-H. Mondoux M.A. Jaster R. Fire-Levin E. D'Andrea A. Blood. 2001; 98: 636-642Google Scholar). All three of these genes are thought to form part of a head to tail repeat of DUB genes on mouse chromosome 7 that have resulted from a tandem duplication event (25Zhu Y. Lambert K. Corless C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. D'Andrea A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 51-57Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the DUBs may play a role in the regulation of cell growth and survival. Both DUB-1 and DUB-2 are cytokine-inducible immediate early genes (24Zhu Y. Os Pless M. Inhorn R. Mathey-Prevot B. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4808-4819Google Scholar, 25Zhu Y. Lambert K. Corless C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. D'Andrea A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 51-57Google Scholar), and high level expression of DUB-1 results in cell-cycle arrest prior to S-phase (27Zhu Y. Carroll M. Papa F.R. HochStrasser M. D'Andrea A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3275-3279Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown recently that DUB-2 expression can markedly inhibit apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal (28Migone T. Humbert M. Rascle A. Sanden D. D'Andrea A. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1935-1941Google Scholar). Our previous work on DUB-2 originated in a study of the IL-2 pathway in cells transformed with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent for adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) (29Mulloy J.C. Migone T.S. Ross T.M. Ton N. Green P.L. Leonard W.J. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4408-4412Google Scholar) and is often associated with constitutive activation of the IL-2 signaling pathway (30Watanabe T. Int. J. Hematol. 1997; 66: 257-278Google Scholar, 31Kawano F. Tsukamoto A. Satoh M. Sanada I. Shido T. Suzushima H. Asou N. Takatsuki K. Leukemia. 1992; 6: 66-67Google Scholar). Despite the active IL-2 signaling pathway, growth inhibitory gene products such as CIS and SOCS3 were not expressed. However, an antibody raised against murine DUB-2 cross-reacted with a band constitutively expressed in these HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines (28Migone T. Humbert M. Rascle A. Sanden D. D'Andrea A. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1935-1941Google Scholar). When expressed in Ba/F3 cells, DUB-2 was shown to markedly inhibit apoptosis induced by the withdrawal of cytokine (28Migone T. Humbert M. Rascle A. Sanden D. D'Andrea A. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1935-1941Google Scholar), as well as to prolong STAT5 phosphorylation. This result indicated that DUB-2 expression could influence cell survival, possibly by modulating STAT5 activation. Interestingly, constitutive STAT activation plays an important role in many hematological malignancies, including HTLV-1-dependent T-cell leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, and myeloma, as well as a range of solid tumors. STAT activation is also required for the action of a range of oncogenes, including src, ret, and lck (32Bromberg J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Google Scholar, 33Ward A.C. Touw I. Yoshimura A. Blood. 2001; 95: 19-29Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a human member of the DUB family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB-3) and show its expression at the mRNA level in a range of tissues and cell lines. In addition, we demonstrate that DUB-3, an active deubiquitinating enzyme, is induced at both the mRNA and protein levels in response to IL-4 and IL-6 stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that DUB-3 constitutive expression blocks proliferation and leads to an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, suggesting that its expression can influence both cell proliferation and survival. Database Analysis—Basic sequence manipulations were performed with the Lasergene (DNAStar) suite of programs. More advanced analyses were conducted through the web-based portal NIX at the UK HGMP Resource Centre. 2Available on the Internet at www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Registered/Webapp/nix/. NIX provides an interface to multiple databases for simultaneous BLAST searching, including TREMBL, SwissProt, EMBL, EST and HTG, and displays the collective outputs as a simplified hyper-linked graphical representation. cDNA Cloning—RNA samples were extracted from 5 × 106 RAJI cells using Stat-60 reagent (Tel-Test Inc, Friendswood, TX). RT-PCR was carried out by using the OneStep RT-PCR system (Qiagen) and the primer sets D1, 5′-CAGTGAATTCGTGGGAATGGAGGACGACTCACTCTAC-3′, and D2, 5′-AGTCATCGATCTGGCACACAAGCATAGCCCTC-3′. RT-PCR products were cloned by using the Perfectly Blunt cloning kit pT7 Blue-3 (Novagen, Madison, WI) and sequenced by using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 kit, the ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Cheshire, UK) and the primers D3, 5′-CTCATGTTCACTGTGGATGC-3′; D4, 5′-GATGATCTACCTGCTTGTGG-3′; D5, 5′-CGGACATTACTTCTCTTATG-3′; D6, 5′-GGACAGAAGTGATGCTAGAG-3′; D7, 5′-TTGCCAACTACATGCTGTCC-3′; and D8, 5′-CTGGGTGGAGTTGTCACAAC-3′. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using an RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen) and quantitated by spectrophotometry. 20 μg of total RNA from each sample were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel. Gels were washed three times with water and then denatured for 30 min in 50 mm NaOH, 10 mm NaCl, rinsed with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 30 min, and placed in 10× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate) for 30 min. Gels were transferred overnight onto nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). After transfer, membranes were rinsed with 2× SSC and cross-linked in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were prehybridized in 5 ml of Rapid-hyb (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and then hybridized with cDNAs labeled by random priming using the Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). After hybridization, membranes were subject to a final wash in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65 °C before exposure to film. Plasmids—DUB-3 cDNAs were tagged with the FLAG epitope at their C termini by standard PCR-based methods. Each cDNA was amplified by PCR using a 5′ oligonucleotide containing an EcoRI site and an ATG codon, as well as a 3′ oligonucleotide containing a ClaI site. The EcoRI/ClaI PCR fragment was sub-cloned between the EcoRI and ClaI sites of a modified pME18S vector in-frame with the FLAG epitope. To produce the catalytically inactive DUB-3C/S mutant, the cysteine residue at position 89 was changed to a serine by using the QuikChange in vitro mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pUHD 10–3 plasmids expressing DUB-3 were constructed by sub-cloning the DUB-3-FLAG cDNA. The pMX-ires-EGFP plasmids expressing DUB-3 and DUB-3C/S were constructed by sub-cloning the DUB-3-FLAG and DUB-3C/S-FLAG cDNAs. Cell Culture and Transfections—The IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line Ba/F3 and Ba/F3b/tTA (28Migone T. Humbert M. Rascle A. Sanden D. D'Andrea A. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1935-1941Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium/10% FBS containing 10 ng/ml IL-3. RAJI and K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium/10% FBS. PlatinumE (PlatE, derived from 293T fibroblast, kind gift from Dr. T. Kitamura, University of Tokyo, Japan) and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% FBS. Transfectants of Ba/F3b/tTA cells were generated by electroporating 107 cells with linearized pUHD10–3 plasmid containing DUB-3 using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad; 300 V, 960 mF) and selected by using 1.2 μg/ml hygromycin. Tetracycline (4 μg/ml) was also added and replaced every 48 h. To induce expression of DUB-3/DUB-3C/S, cells were grown in the absence of tetracycline for 24–48 h. Transfectants of PlatE cells were generated by using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, East Sussex, UK), as specified by the manufacturer, and either empty vector or pMX-ires-EGFP that expresses the DUB-3-FLAG or DUB-3C/S-FLAG fusion proteins. Antibody Production—A DUB-3 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Fusion Antibodies (Belfast, UK). Immunizations were performed by using an affinity-purified recombinant His6-tagged fusion protein containing residues 378–530 of the DUB-3 protein. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—To produce whole-cell lysates, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.875% Brij 97, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by using a rabbit polyclonal DUB-3 antibody (fusion antibodies) or the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were then washed 5 times in lysis buffer. Cellular lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by using SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and immunoblotted as appropriate by using antibodies against either DUB-3 or FLAG. The blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Deubiquitinating Assay—The deubiquitination assay, based on the cleavage of ubiquitin-β-galactosidase fusion proteins, has been described previously (34Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Google Scholar). A 1590-bp fragment corresponding to the DUB-3 open reading frame (amino acids 1 to 530) and an equivalent open reading frame containing a catalytically inactive mutant form, DUB-3C/S (C89S), were generated by PCR and inserted in-frame into the pGEX vector in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase epitope. Ub-Met-β-galactosidase was expressed from a pACYC184-based plasmid. Plasmids were co-transformed into MC1061 Escherichia coli. Plasmid-bearing E. coli MC1061 cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-β-galactosidase antiserum (Cappel, NC). Growth Factor Stimulation—RAJI (IL-4), U937, and HL60 (IL-6) cells were washed and incubated for 4 h in serum-free medium. The cells, remaining in serum-free medium, were then treated with 100 units/ml IL-4 or IL-6 for the specified times before either lysates were taken for immunoprecipitation with the DUB-3 antibody or RNA samples were extracted using the Stat-60 reagent (Tel-Test Inc) for RT-PCR. RT-PCR was carried out by using the OneStep RT-PCR system (Qiagen) with the primer sets D1, 5′-CAGTGAATTCGTGGGAATGGAGGACGACTCACTCTAC-3′, D2, 5′-AGTCATCGATCTGGCACACAAGCATAGCCCTC-3′, GAPDH F, 5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGG-3′, and GAPGH R, 5′-TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGT-3′. Retroviral Infection—The bicistronic vector pMX-ires-EGFP was transfected into the packaging cell line PlatE. 24 h after transfection, the medium was removed and used to resuspend Ba/F3 cells at 2.5 × 105 cells per ml (50 units/ml IL-3, 10 μg/ml polybrene; Sigma). Cells were centrifuged in six-well plates for 270 min at 2000 rpm at room temperature before the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 medium/5% FBS (50 units/ml IL-3). After 24 h, cells were washed and re-suspended in serum-free medium before sorting. Cells were sorted for the presence of GFP using EPICS, ALTRA, and EXPO software (Beckman Coulter, Buckinghamshire, UK). Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay—Cells cultured for 12 h in medium lacking both IL-3 and serum were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per ml and grown in RPMI 1640 medium/10% FBS containing 10 ng/ml IL-3 in the presence or absence of 4 μg/ml tetracycline. After the time periods identified, the numbers of viable cells were determined by standard trypan blue exclusion assay using a 0.4% trypan blue stain solution (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Cell counts were carried out in duplicate. Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining—To assess the cell cycle profile of the selected Ba/F3 clones, they were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended in a hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 0.1% sodium citrate, and 50 mg/ml PI (Sigma), and subjected to flow cytometry analysis using Coulter XL (Beckman Coulter). Identification of Human DUB Genes—As no human members of the DUB family of deubiquitinating enzymes were known, extensive analysis of the available human EST and genomic databases was carried out by using the sequences of murine DUB-1 and DUB-2 to identify potential human family members. This procedure revealed multiple homologous genomic sequences from human chromosomes 4 and 8 (see supplementary material Fig. 1), one of which was the chromosome 4 tandem repeat RS447 that has previously been reported to contain USP17, a putative deubiquitinating enzyme (35Gondo Y. Okada T. Matsuyama N. Saitoh Y. Yanagisawa Y. Ikeda J. Genomics. 1998; 54: 39-49Google Scholar). Using these sequences as a basis, primers were designed to allow the cloning and sequencing of full-length RT-PCR products from the RAJI cell line to identify sequences expressed at the mRNA level. Several different cDNAs were observed (results not shown), the most frequently detected of which we have designated DUB-3 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the protein sequences of the members of the DUB family of deubiquitinating enzymes, including murine DUB-1, DUB-2 and DUB-2A, as well as DUB-3 as a representative human member. This alignment demonstrates that DUB-3 shows 44% identity overall to the murine members of the DUB protein family, and 56% identity to the catalytic core of these enzymes, which includes the previously identified conserved domains of the UBPs (DH I–VI) as well as the cysteine, aspartate, and histidine residues conserved at their active site (7D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Google Scholar, 8Baek K.-H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 1-7Google Scholar). In addition, a 19-amino acid repeated sequence is highlighted (Fig. 1, broken underline) that is present three times in DUB-2/2A, twice in DUB-1, but only once in the human DUBs. The significance of this is unclear. Tissue Distribution—To demonstrate that DUB-3 was expressed at the mRNA level, Northern blot hybridization of poly(A+) RNAs from multiple tissues was carried out by using the full-length DUB-3 cDNA as a probe (Fig. 2A). Two transcripts were observed, one of ∼1.6 kb in a number of tissues including heart, skeletal muscle, colon, kidney, and liver, with a second transcript of ∼1.7 kb present in both brain and liver. In addition, we carried out Northern blot hybridization of RNAs from a number of cell lines including those derived from a range of hematopoietic tumors such as promyelocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, and Burkitt's lymphoma, as well as a range of solid tumors (Fig. 2B). All but one of the cell lines examined showed high level expression of the 1.6-kb transcript. These observations contrasted with those in the multiple tissue Northern blot where normal peripheral blood leukocytes and spleen (Fig. 2A) showed negligible levels of expression. Deubiquitinating Assay—Having cloned DUB-3, it was important to demonstrate that it was an active enzyme, and as a result, an in vitro deubiquitination assay was performed. DUB-3 was co-expressed in E. coli cells with a ubiquitin-Met-β-galactosidase fusion protein. Activity was assessed by the cleavage of ubiquitin from the ubiquitin-Met-β-galactosidase fusion protein and visualized by immunoblotting using an anti-β-galactosidase polyclonal antibody. The results demonstrated that DUB-3 displayed deubiquitinating activity at least equivalent to that of DUB-1, and that this activity was ablated by mutating the cysteine residue (C89S) conserved within the active site which has previously been shown in other deubiquitinating enzymes to be essential for catalytic activity (Fig. 3; Ref. 6Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar). Regulation of DUB Protein Expression—To facilitate studies of the endogenous protein, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was developed against the carboxyl-terminus of DUB-3 by using a purified recombinant fusion protein containing amino acid residues 378–530, a region outside the recognized catalytic core (DHI–DHVI) (Fig. 1). The antibody was tested by using Ba/F3 cells expressing a DUB-3-FLAG-tagged fusion protein from a TET-Off expression construct. The findings demonstrated that the antibody could immunoprecipitate and immunoblot the DUB-3 protein (Fig. 4A). These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitations and blotting using the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (data not shown). Having demonstrated that the DUB-3 antibody recognized over-expressed DUB-3 protein, it was important to examine next whether it could recognize endogenously expressed protein. Previously, we had shown that the cell line RAJI expressed high levels of DUB-3 mRNA (Fig. 2 and results not shown). Therefore, this cell line was chosen to test for the presence of endogenous protein. Lysates from RAJI cells were immunoprecipitated by using the DUB-3 antibody and examined by Western blotting. Constitutive expression of DUB-3 protein was detected in the RAJI cell line (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that these cells expressed DUB-3 at both the mRNA and protein levels. K562 cells which did not express DUB-3 mRNA (Fig. 2B) also did not show protein expression (Fig. 4A). DUB-1 and DUB-2 were originally identified as immediate early genes rapidly induced upon cytokine stimulation. In particular, DUB-1 has been shown to be induced by IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF (24Zhu Y. Os Pless M. Inhorn R. Mathey-Prevot B. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4808-4819Google Scholar), whereas DUB-2 was induced in response to IL-2 (25Zhu Y. Lambert K. Corless C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. D'Andrea A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 51-57Google Scholar). To determine whether or not DUB-3 behaved in a similar manner, a study was carried out to assess its inducibility in response to IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor stimulation. DUB-3 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced by placing cells in serum-free medium for 4 h prior to growth factor stimulation (Fig. 4, B and C). After stimulation, the mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR using primers capable of amplifying DUB-3 and, at the protein level, by immunoprecipitation and blotting using the previously characterized DUB-3 antibody. Expression of DUB-3 was induced at the mRNA level in response to both IL-4 and IL-6 (100 units/ml) (Fig. 4B). In addition, we also demonstrated induction of DUB-3 expression at the protein level in response to IL-4 (100 units/ml) (Fig. 4C). Up-regulation of DUB-3 mRNA was observed in samples taken as little as 5 min after IL-4 treatment and maintained in both IL-4 and IL-6 for at least 30 min with the levels falling back to baseline before 90 min. In addition, to determine whether particular transcripts were responsible for this induction, the RT-PCR products obtained during these experiments were cloned, and 10 colonies were selected for sequencing. In addition to DUB-3, several different transcripts were represented, suggesting that this induction was not due to the up-regulation of a particular transcript, but to the simultaneous up-regulation of multiple DUB transcripts (data not shown). Accordingly, induction of DUB-3 protein production followed that of the mRNA, with up-regulation of the protein levels being observed after 30 min and levels not returning to baseline until after 90 min. These results suggested that, like the murine DUBs, human DUB-3 is a cytokine-inducible immediate early gene transiently expressed upon cytokine stimulation. Expression Studies—Having identified DUB-3 as a cytokine-inducible transiently expressed protein, we next explored the functional importance of its expression. To examine this, Ba/F3 cell lines which expressed DUB-3 from a TET-Off expression system were used (Fig. 4A). To assess the effects of DUB-3 expression on proliferation, cells cultured in medium lacking IL-3 and serum for 12 h were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per ml and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium/10% FBS containing 10 ng/ml IL-3 in the presence and absence of tetracycline. Samples were taken every 12 h, and the numbers of viable cells were determined by using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The DUB-3-expressing clones examined showed a substantial reduction in their rate of proliferation when DUB-3 was expressed (Fig. 5A). The results shown were reproduced by using two separate DUB-3-expressing clones and are representative of five experiments. In addition, it was noted that 24–48 h after the removal of tetracycline, ∼10% of the cells observed were non-viable (results not shown). This result indicated that DUB-3 expression induced cell death in addition to slowing proliferation. It has been observed previously that expression of DUB-1 can result in cell cycle arrest prior to S-phase (27Zhu Y. Carroll M. Papa F.R. HochStrasser M. D'Andrea A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3275-3279Google Scholar). This finding raised the possibility that DUB-3 expression might act as a cell cycle block. To examine this possibility in more detail, cells cultured in the presence and absence of tetracycline were stained with PI to determine their cell cycle profile (Fig. 5B). Cells expressing DUB-3 showed a 50% reduction in the numbers of cells in S-phase and G2/M, suggesting cells expressing DUB-3 may not be able to exit G1. Moreover, when tetracycline was removed, ∼10% of cells were observed in the sub-G1 region, indicating"

However, plant PCD shows important differences from the process of apoptosis of animal cells at the morphological and biochemical levels (13Buckner B. Janick-Buckner D. Johal G.S.

Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar) are not formed during plant PCD because of the presence of the cell wall. At the biochemical level, despite the description of caspase-like activity in cells undergoing hypersensitive response (16del Pozo O. Lam E. Curr.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), seems to play an important role in PCD in different plant systems such as the formation of tracheary elements (20Obara K.

Cereal grains have become one of the model systems for the study of plant PCD. At initial stages of grain development, maternal tissues such as the nucellus (24Norstog K. Bot.

Planta. 2001; 231: 352-360Google Scholar). During endosperm development, the cells differentiate into two tissues: the aleurone layer, formed by cells that remain alive in the mature grain, and the starchy endosperm, formed by cells specialized in the accumulation of reserve compounds, which undergo PCD during grain maturation (28Young T.E.

In response to the hormone, aleurone cells synthesize and secrete hydrolytic enzymes for the mobilization of the storage compounds of the starchy endosperm (32Bethke P.C. Schurink R. Jones R.L. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 1337-13356Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Skadsen R.W. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 104: 486-502Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), thus producing nutrients to support the initial growth of the seedling. Gibberellins not only promote the metabolic activation of the dormant aleurone cells but also accelerate their PCD (34Fath A. Bethke P.C. Lonsdale J. Meza-Romero R. Jones R.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In a previous report we have shown the existence of a spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression and starchy endosperm acidification in germinating wheat grains (35Domínguez F. Cejudo F.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was deduced from this study that the external pH exerts a great influence on GA3 perception and response by the aleurone cells. In our attempt to establish how different gibberellin-regulated processes are coordinated in cereal grains, we have analyzed the spatio-temporal pattern of PCD in aleurone cells of wheat grains following germination and its hormonal control. In addition, electron transmission microscopy was used to analyze the morphology of aleurone cells during PCD. Our results show a rapid vacuolation and degradative activity in the cytoplasm, whereas the nucleus remained almost intact. Aleurone PCD was characterized by DNA fragmentation, which was activated by GA3. Using in-gel analysis of nucleolytic activity, we identified a Ca2+/Mg2+-activated endonuclease induced by GA3, which is localized in the nucleus of aleurone cells showing internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA. Plant Material—The experiments described here used the wheat (Triticum aestivum) cv. Chinese Spring and maize (Zea mays) cv. Aristis as source of wild-type grains. The Tom Thumb dwarf (Rht-B1c/Rht-D1a) of April Bearded wheat, kindly provided by Dr. J. E. Flintham (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK) was used as the source of GA-insensitive mutant (36Flintham D.F. Gale M.D. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1983; 66: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The maize dek1 mutant, kindly provided by Dr. C. Vicient (Institute of Molecular Biology, Barcelona, Spain) and Dr. P. Becraft (Iowa State University) was used as the source of grains lacking aleurone cells. Grains or de-embryonated half grains were sterilized in 2% (v/v) NaOCl for 20 min, washed twice with sterile water, washed once with 0.01 n HCl, and then washed thoroughly with sterile distilled water. Sterile wheat grains were allowed to germinate at room temperature on sterile filter paper soaked with water for periods of up to 10 days or on humid vermiculite for periods of up to 15 days in the case of maize. Hormone treatments were carried out on sterile de-embryonated half grains, which were incubated on filter paper soaked with 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0. All of the buffers were supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2. When required, incubation medium was supplemented with 5 μm GA3. Hormone treatments were carried out in the darkness at 25 °C. GA3 was from Sigma. For GA synthesis inhibition experiments wild-type grains were imbibed in the presence of 0.5 mm paclobutrazol. Isolation of DNA and Electrophoresis—Aleurone layers, dissected from grains that were imbibed up to 10–15 days or from de-embryonated half grains incubated as indicated above, were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground with a mortar and pestle. DNA was extracted with extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS). After extraction with phenol:chlorofom:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), DNA was precipitated with two volumes of absolute ethanol, resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) buffer, again ethanol-precipitated, and finally resuspended in 0.25 ml of TE buffer. Contaminating RNA was removed by incubation for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of RNase A (final concentration, 60 ng μl-1). DNA was then ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in TE buffer, resolved on 2% (w/v) agarose gels, and stained with ethidium bromide. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—The nuclei were isolated from aleurone layers dissected from de-embryonated half grains, which were incubated in the presence or absence of GA3 for up to 5 days. Aleurone layers were ground with a mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen and then resuspended in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100). The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 100 × g for 1 min and filtered through a nylon mesh (pore size, 60 μm) (Millipore). Cellular fractionation was performed by carefully placing the clarified homogenate on an equal volume of 30% (v/v) Percoll prepared in the same buffer and centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min. The upper phase was conserved as the cytoplasmic fraction, the Percoll phase was discarded, and the nuclei-enriched pellet was harvested, washed in homogenization buffer, and resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 40 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% plant protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 0.4 m NH4SO4). After extraction on ice for 30 min and centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant constituted the nuclear extract. In-gel Nuclease Activity Assay—In-gel nuclease activity assay was performed according to the method described by Young and Gallie (29Young T.E. Gallie D.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (100 μg of protein) obtained as described above were subjected to SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.3 mg ml-1 salmon sperm DNA at 4 °C and 20 mA/plate. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice for 15 min in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then twice for 15 min in distilled water. The gels were then incubated overnight in 100 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated. To discriminate between real and apparent nucleolytic activity associated with some proteins, the gels were incubated in 1% (w/v) SDS for 2 h at room temperature and then washed in water for 10 min as described by Alnemri and Litwack (37Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4104-4111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the gels were stained with 1 μgml-1 ethidium bromide for 10 min. Nuclease activity was photographed on a UV light box. Western Blot Analysis—The extracts were subjected to SDS/PAGE (10% acrylamide). After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma) at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 1 h using the electrophoretic transfer kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) powdered milk, and PEPC was immunochemically labeled by overnight incubation of the membranes at 4 °C in 20 ml of Tris-buffered saline and affinity-purified polyclonal Sorghum C4 PEPC IgG (27 μg of protein). Subsequent detection was performed by a peroxidase assay (affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate from Sigma). TUNEL Assay—Grains harvested at different days after imbibition were longitudinally sectioned after removing shoots and roots, fixed in FAE (50% (v/v) ethanol, 5% (v/v) acetic acid, 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde), and embedded in Paraplast Plus (Sigma). In situ detection of DNA fragmentation was carried out with a modification of the TUNEL method (38Tilly J.L. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Cell Physiol. 1993; 154: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 39Surhm C.D. Sprent J. Nature. 1994; 372: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The sections were obtained from the above described Paraplast Plus embedded material. Paraplast Plus was removed by treatment with xylol, and the sections were then hydrated with a decreasing ethanol series, treated with proteinase K (20 μg ml-1) in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 130 mm NaCl), and rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Endogenous peroxidase activity was then quenched by incubation in 1% (v/v) H2O2 in methanol for 30 min and rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. For labeling, the sections were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Controls were performed in which TdT was omitted. Electron Microscopy—For morphology analysis, small fragments of wheat grains harvested at 1 or 5 days after imbibition were fixed in 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde prepared in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 3 h at 4 °C and post-fixed in 1% (w/v) OsO4 for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were dehydrated in an acetone series and embedded in Epon (epoxy embedding medium). Toluidine blue-stained semi-thin sections used as controls were viewed in a Leitz (Aristoplan) light microscope. Thin sections (60–80 nm thick) were cut on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Philips CM-10 transmission electron microscope. DNA Fragmentation in Aleurone Cells of Wheat and Maize Grains Following Germination—Fig. 1A shows the evolution of DNA isolated from aleurone cells of wheat grains following germination. One may observe the appearance of DNA laddering, which was first observed in grains after 4 days of imbibition and increased progressively up to 7 days. The spatio-temporal pattern of aleurone PCD in wheat grains following germination was established with the TUNEL assay, which labels 3′-OH DNA ends, thus allowing in situ detection of DNA fragmentation. Sections of wheat grains after 1 day of imbibition, when no DNA fragmentation was observed (Fig. 1A), showed no TUNEL-stained cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, in grains after 7 days of imbibition most cells proximal to the embryo showed an intense TUNEL staining (Fig. 1C), whereas staining of cells of the distal part of the grain was less intense (Fig. 1D). Therefore, it can be concluded that the process of PCD is initiated in aleurone cells proximal to the embryo and progressively extended to the distal part of the grain. That is, as the time after imbibition increases, more cells undergo PCD, in agreement with the progressive increase of DNA fragmentation shown in Fig. 1A. This spatio-temporal pattern of PCD resembles previously reported GA-regulated processes in wheat aleurone cells (35Domínguez F. Cejudo F.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); we therefore tested the effect of exogenous GA3 on aleurone PCD. GA3 treatment of de-embryonated half grains promoted an intense TUNEL staining of most aleurone cells (Fig. 1E); in contrast, half grains incubated in the absence of GA3 showed only background staining (Fig. 1F). No signal was observed in control sections incubated in the absence of TdT (Fig. 1G). To test whether aleurone PCD is general in cereal grains, we analyzed this process in maize grains following germination. Fig. 2A shows DNA laddering of maize aleurone DNA; however, this process was delayed as compared with wheat grains because laddering was detected only after 12 days of imbibition. The TUNEL assay showed background labeling of aleurone nuclei in maize grains after 6 days of imbibition (Fig. 2B), whereas labeling was intense in grains after 12 days of imbibition (Fig. 2C), therefore confirming the delay of aleurone PCD in maize shown by the DNA laddering (Fig. 2A). The TUNEL assay was also performed on maize dek1 mutant, which lacks the aleurone layer and is unable to germinate (40Becraft P.W. Asuncion-Crabb Y. Development. 2000; 127: 4039-4048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, no signal was observed in dek1 grains (Fig. 2D). After 12 days of imbibition, no labeling was detected in the control sections of wild-type grains, which were incubated in the absence of TdT (Fig. 2E). Ultrastructural Analysis of Aleurone PCD—Most studies on aleurone PCD have been carried out on protoplasts. It is clear from these studies that aleurone death is preceded by a high vacuolation and the loss of the plasma membrane integrity (41Bethke P.C. Lonsdale J.E. Fath A. Jones R.L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, no studies have been reported on the morphological changes that occur during aleurone PCD in situ. Taking advantage of the gradient of PCD in aleurone layers of wheat grains following germination (Fig. 1), we have studied the ultrastructural changes associated with the progression of cell death by transmission electron microscopy analysis. Live aleurone cells from grains after 1 day of imbibition contained regularly shaped nuclei with intact nuclear envelope (Fig. 3A, arrow). The cytoplasm showed a highly ordered structure, composed of abundant oleosomes surrounding protein storage vacuoles (Fig. 3B). In grains after 5 days of imbibition, aleurone cells undergoing PCD lost this ordered structure and showed high vacuolation (Fig. 3C), and the plasma membrane appeared partially separated from the cell wall, as observed in a magnified image (Fig. 3D, arrow). The presence of electron-dense bodies and the rest of the membranes in the vacuoles is indicative of a high hydrolytic activity (Fig. 3, C, E, and F). As cytoplasm vacuolation increased, the nucleus presented an irregular shape showing invaginations (Fig. 3, E and F). A detailed image of a nuclear envelope showed regions with the outer membrane interrupted (Fig. 3G, arrow) and with small discontinuities (Fig. 3H, arrow). The nuclear contents did not appear as degraded as the surrounding cytoplasm (Fig. 3, E and F), a result confirmed by the analysis of proteins extracted from nuclei of cells undergoing PCD, which did not show clear symptoms of degradation (results not shown). Aleurone cells close to the embryo, which have completed the process of PCD in grains after 5 days of imbibition, showed a fully degraded cytoplasm, whereas the nucleus appeared formed by the rest of electron-dense heterochromatin, and the nuclear envelope was degraded (Fig. 3I). It is remarkable that despite the high degradation, the cells did not collapse and retained, at least in part, the cell wall (Fig. 3I). A GA3-induced Nuclease Is Localized in the Nucleus of Aleurone Cells Undergoing PCD—As shown above, a hallmark of wheat aleurone PCD is the fragmentation of nuclear DNA. To further characterize this process we searched for nucleases in the nucleus of cells undergoing PCD. To establish the precise kinetics of the appearance of DNA laddering, de-embryonated half grains were treated with GA3. As expected, GA3 promoted DNA fragmentation, which was observed after 4 days of treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). These cells were fractionated into nuclei and cytoplasm, and protein extracts from both fractions were subjected to in-gel nuclease activity analysis, which showed a similar pattern of nucleolytic activity in cytoplasmic fractions of treated and untreated aleurone cells, although activity was higher in GA3-treated cells (Fig. 4, C and D). No nucleolytic activity was detected in nuclear extracts from untreated half grains (Fig. 4C). However, a band showing endonuclease activity was detected in nuclear extracts from GA3-treated half grains (Fig. 4D), which was detected after 3 days of treatment, therefore prior to the appearance of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4B). To rule out any possible contamination of nuclear extracts with cytoplasmic nucleases, we analyzed the presence of PEPC, a well characterized cytoplasmic enzyme, which we have previously shown to be present in wheat aleurone cells (42González M.C. Osuna L. Echevarría C. Vidal J. Cejudo F.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic extracts showed the presence of a band corresponding to the PEPC monomer in extracts from untreated cells (Fig. 4E). Although the amount of PEPC remained almost unaltered in these cells, it progressively disappeared from treated cells (Fig. 4F), probably reflecting the high hydrolytic activity in these cells, as shown by electron microscopy analysis (Fig. 3). No signal was detected in nuclear extracts, hence showing that such extracts were free of cytoplasmic contamination. To further test whether the nuclear-localized nuclease was induced by GA, we analyzed aleurone PCD and the presence of this nuclease in wheat grains that were imbibed in the presence of paclobutrazol, a GA synthesis inhibitor (43Rademacher W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 501-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Paclobutrazol treatment resulted in delayed germination and exerted a severe inhibition of seedling growth (results not shown). No fragmentation of DNA was observed in paclobutrazol-treated grains in contrast with the characteristic laddering observed in control grains imbibed for the same time in the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 5A). In agreement with this result, no TUNEL staining was detected in paclobutrazol-treated grains (Fig. 5B, PCB), whereas the untreated grains showed intense labeling of the aleurone cells (Fig. 5B, WT). Similarly, no DNA fragmentation even after 10 days of imbibition (Fig. 5A) nor TUNEL stain (Fig. 5B, Rht) was observed in the dwarf mutant Rht-B1c/Rht-D1a, which is affected in the response to GA (36Flintham D.F. Gale M.D. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1983; 66: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The in-gel nuclease activity analysis of nuclear extracts from these samples identified increasing nucleolytic activity in the nucleus of wild-type grains (Fig. 5C) previous to the detection of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5, A and B). No nucleolytic activity was detected in paclobutrazol-treated grains or in the GA-insensitive mutant (Fig. 5C) in agreement with the absence of DNA fragmentation in these samples (Fig. 5, A and B). These results lend further support to our proposal that the nucleolytic activity detected in the nucleus of aleurone cells undergoing PCD is regulated by gibberellins. To characterize the DNase activity localized in the nucleus of aleurone cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from cells that had been treated with GA3 for 4 days. The in-gel activity assay showed a clear activation of this nucleolytic activity by Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 6). These cations could be substituted by Mn2+, which exerted a higher activating effect. In contrast, Zn2+ exerted a strong inhibitory effect even in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. The assay in the presence of EDTA resulted in the complete inhibition of the nuclear DNase activity, which was restored by the addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 6). These results show that the GA3-induced DNase localized in the nucleus of aleurone cells undergoing PCD is a Ca2+/Mg2+-type nuclease. The response of wheat aleurone cells to gibberellins may be subdivided in two stages. In the short term, a few hours after treatment, GA3 promotes the expression of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes and the acidification of the external medium (35Domínguez F. Cejudo F.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the long term, 3–4 days after treatment, aleurone cells undergo a process of autolysis or PCD (44Kuo A. Cappelluti S. Cervantes-Cervantes M. Rodriguez M. Bush D.S. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this study we have used a combination of biochemical and ultrastructural approaches to analyze the hormonal regulation of PCD in wheat aleurone cells. A characteristic feature of cells undergoing PCD is the formation of DNA laddering as a consequence of the internucleosomal fragmentation of nuclear DNA. The analysis of nuclear DNA from GA3-treated barley aleurone protoplasts detected DNA laddering (45Kalinski A. Chandra G.R. Muthukrishnan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11393-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wang M. Oppedijk B.J. Caspers M.P.M. Lamers G.E.M. Boot M.J. Geerlings D.N. Bakhuizen B. Meijer A.H. van Duijn B. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1293-1301Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 47Wang M. Oppedijk B.J. Lu X. van Duijn B. Schilperoort R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 1125-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but more recently Fath et al. (48Fath A. Bethke P.C. Jones R.L. Plant J. 1999; 20: 305-315Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) concluded that it was due to the enzymes used for protoplast preparation. In view of these controversial results, we have studied aleurone PCD in intact germinating wheat grains rather than isolated protoplasts, and all of the DNA extractions were carried out in the presence of 50 mm EDTA and in the absence of MgCl2, conditions that, according to Fath et al. (48Fath A. Bethke P.C. Jones R.L. Plant J. 1999; 20: 305-315Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and our own results (Fig. 6), markedly reduced nuclease activity. The possibility that the DNA laddering reported here is due to endogenous nucleases not related to PCD could be ruled out because no DNA laddering was observed in untreated de-embryonated half grains (Fig. 4A), despite the significant nucleolytic activity detected in cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 4C). Based on the analysis of DNA laddering and the TUNEL assay, we conclude that internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA is associated with wheat aleurone PCD, this process being activated by GA3. However, whereas gene expression and acidification were detected shortly after hormone treatment (35Domínguez F. Cejudo F.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), DNA laddering was delayed 3–4 days after treatment (Fig. 4). These results suggest that GA3 is not only involved in the activation of these processes but also in its temporal coordination. Most studies on aleurone PCD have been carried out with barley and wheat grains. Here we show evidence that maize aleurone cells of germinated grains also undergo PCD; therefore, it is most likely that this is a general process in cereal grains. However, the temporal pattern of PCD in maize is delayed as compared with wheat, probably reflecting differences in the germination strategy of both types of grain. In this regard it is worth mentioning the larger scutellum of the maize grain, which seems to play an important role supporting the initial stages of the seedling growth. The ultrastructural analysis of aleurone PCD (Fig. 3) revealed an intense degradation of the cytoplasm by a progressive increase of vacuoles, which become lytic compartments (21Bethke P.C Hillmer S. Jones R.L. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Swanson S.J. Bethke P.C. Jones R.L. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 41Bethke P.C. Lonsdale J.E. Fath A. Jones R.L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The rapid disappearance of PEPC, a cytoplasmic enzyme, from extracts of GA3-treated half grains (Fig. 4F) probably reflects the intense hydrolytic activity occurring in the cytoplasm of aleurone cells undergoing PCD. Most likely, some of the GA3-induced proteases identified in aleurone cells are actually involved in this process. This seems to be the case with a cathepsin B-like protease (49Cejudo F.J. Murphy G. Chinoy C. Baulcombe D.C. Plant J. 1992; 2: 937-948PubMed Google Scholar) and a carboxypeptidase III (50Baulcombe D.C. Barker R.F. Jarvis M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13726-13735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), expressed at high level in aleurone cells, but also associated with PCD in the nucellus (51Domínguez F. Cejudo F.J. Plant J. 1998; 15: 569-574Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or during the differentiation of tracheid elements (52Domínguez F. González M.C. Cejudo F.J. Planta. 2002; 215: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the cytoplasm of aleurone cells undergoing PCD showed symptoms of intense degradation, the nucleus appeared with an irregular morphology (Fig. 3) but with its protein content almost intact (results not shown). Therefore, extensive degradation of the nuclear contents seems to occur only as a final process of aleurone PCD. We established the hypothesis that DNA fragmentation in aleurone cells undergoing PCD might be due to nuclear-localized nucleases. The in-gel analysis of nuclease activity of nuclear extracts from GA3-treated half grains revealed the presence of a nuclease activity in the nucleus, which was absent in nuclei from untreated cells (Fig. 4, C and D). The absence of this nuclease in wheat grains in which gibberellin synthesis was inhibited, as well as in a GA-insensitive mutant, clearly demonstrates that its expression is regulated by gibberellins and requires a functional signal transduction pathway in response to the hormone. In any of the conditions under analysis in this study, this nuclease was detected prior to the detection of DNA laddering (Figs. 4 and 5), therefore showing a good correlation between nucleolytic activity and nuclear DNA fragmentation, which suggests its involvement in aleurone PCD. In animal cells undergoing apoptosis, internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA is carried out by DNases translocated to the nucleus (53Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 401: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 54Counis M.F. Torriglia A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In plants, however, although nuclear degradation of DNA has been observed in several systems including senescence (55Orzáez D. Granell A. Plant J. 1997; 11: 137-144Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar), cereal grain development and germination (27Domínguez F. Moreno J. Cejudo F.J. Planta. 2001; 231: 352-360Google Scholar, 29Young T.E. Gallie D.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 48Fath A. Bethke P.C. Jones R.L. Plant J. 1999; 20: 305-315Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and hypersensitive response (56Mittler R. Shulaev V. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the information on nuclear-localized nucleases is very scarce. The only demonstration of a nuclease involved in nuclear DNA degradation during PCD in Zinnia tracheary elements was reported recently (57Ito J. Fukuda H. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3201-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here we describe a GA3-induced nuclease localized in the nucleus of cells undergoing PCD, which is activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+, is inhibited by Zn2+, and showed optimum activity at neutral pH (Fig. 6). Based on these results we propose that this nuclease belongs to group 2 of plant nucleases as defined by Sugiyama et al. (58Sugiyama M. Ito J. Aoyagi S. Fukuda H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and shows similarities with the nucleases involved in DNA fragmentation of apoptosis in animal cells (59Peitsch M.C. Polzar B. Stephan H. Crompton T. MacDonald H.R. Mannherz H.G. Tschopp J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Because the nuclear-localized nuclease showed lower molecular mass than cytoplasmic nucleases (Figs. 4 and 6), it is possible that GA3 triggers the processing and translocation of this enzyme to the nucleus. If this is the case, the mechanism might resemble the mechanism described during apoptosis in animal cells, which requires the activation, in this case mediated by a caspase, of the DNase involved in nuclear DNA degradation (60Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, aleurone cells that have not been treated with GA3 do not complete PCD, hence suggesting the lack of a signal to proceed and complete the process of cell death. A possibility raised by our results is that a sufficient amount of the Ca2+/Mg2+-activated nuclease must reach the nucleus, as would occur in wild-type wheat grains following germination and in GA3-treated cells, for the process of PCD to be completed.

LRP-1 also functions as a catabolic receptor for fibronectin, limiting fibronectin accumulation in association with cells. The goal of the present study was to determine whether LRP-1 regulates cell surface levels of the β1 integrin subunit. We hypothesized that LRP-1 may down-regulate cell surface β1 by promoting its internalization; however, unexpectedly, LRP-1 expression was associated with a substantial increase in cell surface β1 integrin in two separate cell lines, murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and CHO cells. The total amount of β1 integrin was unchanged because LRP-1-deficient cells retained increased amounts of β1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Expression of human LRP-1 in LRP-1-deficient MEFs reversed the shift in subcellular β1 integrin distribution. Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that the precursor form of newly synthesized β1 integrin (p105) is converted into mature β1 (p125) more slowly in LRP-1-deficient cells. Although low levels of cell surface β1 integrin, in LRP-1-deficient MEFs, were associated with decreased adhesion to fibronectin, the subcellular distribution of β1 integrin was most profoundly dependent on LRP-1 only after the cell cultures became confluent. A mutagen-treated CHO cell line, in which LRP-1 is expressed but retained in the secretory pathway, also demonstrated nearly complete ER retention of β1 integrin. These studies support a model in which LRP-1 either directly or indirectly promotes maturation of β1 integrin precursor and thereby increases the level of β1 integrin at the cell surface.

The β1 integrin subunit associates with multiple α-subunits to form transmembrane adhesion receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9007) Google Scholar). Once present at the cell surface, mature integrins anchor the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton and promote cell signaling (2Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat.

Integrin and growth factor-initiated cell signaling responses are integrated by the cell to regulate gene expression, cell migration, cell growth, apoptosis, and development (2Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H.

Understanding mechanisms that regulate the concentration of integrins in the plasma membrane is an important problem. The β1 integrin subunit is synthesized as an 87-kDa polypeptide that undergoes glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LRP-1, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1; RAP, receptor-associated protein; uPAR, urokinase receptor; APP, amyloid precursor protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Endo-H, endoglycosidase H; PNGase F; peptide-N-glycosidase F; EGFr, epidermal growth factor receptor; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LRP-1, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1; RAP, receptor-associated protein; uPAR, urokinase receptor; APP, amyloid precursor protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Endo-H, endoglycosidase H; PNGase F; peptide-N-glycosidase F; EGFr, epidermal growth factor receptor; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. and in the Golgi apparatus (6Akiyama S.K.

Mature β1 has a mass of ∼125 kDa (p125). In some cells, p105 is the primary form of β1 integrin identified; however, p105 is not found at the cell surface and cannot function in cell adhesion or cell signaling (6Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J.

Biochem. 1991; 199: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Many factors control maturation of β1 and its transfer to the cell surface, including the availability of α-subunits, growth factors such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and the state of activation of Ras (9Ignotz R.A.

The membrane-bound protein chaperone, calnexin, associates with β1 in the ER, promoting integrin assembly but inhibiting integrin transfer to the cell surface (12Lenter M. Vestweber D. J. Biol.

Other protein chaperones, including calreticulin and receptor-associated protein (RAP), may associate with β1-containing integrins or integrin-based adhesion complexes; however, a role for these proteins in integrin maturation has not been defined (14Coppolino M.

Talin, which is best known for its role in focal adhesion assembly, and HEMCAM/gicerin, an immunoglobulin superfamily protein, also may regulate β1 maturation (16Martel V. Vignoud L. Dupe S.

LRP-1 is a receptor for over 40 soluble ligands, which undergoes rapid and constitutive endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits, delivering most bound ligands to lysosomes for degradation (18Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. Argraves W.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 2002; 13: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In some cells, LRP-1 may also localize in caveolae/lipid rafts, where it functions in cell signaling (19Boucher P. Liu P. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Anderson R.G. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15507-15513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). In addition to soluble ligands, LRP-1 mediates the endocytosis of other plasma membrane proteins, including the urokinase receptor (uPAR), tissue factor, and amyloid precursor protein (APP), and thereby down-regulates the plasma membrane levels of these proteins (21Conese M.

Regulation of the concentration and activity of membrane proteins represents an indirect mechanism by which LRP-1 may control cell signaling. For example, by down-regulating cell surface uPAR in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), LRP-1 suppresses activation of the small GTPase, Rac1, and inhibits cell migration (22Weaver A.M. McCabe M.

Mars W.M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that LRP-1 binds fibronectin and mediates its endocytosis, limiting fibronectin accumulation in association with cell surfaces (27Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). LRP-1 also is an endocytic receptor for thrombospondin-1 (28Godyna S. Liau G. Popa H Stefansson S. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By modifying the composition of the extracellular matrix, LRP-1 may regulate processes such as cell adhesion and migration. In this study, we sought to determine whether LRP-1 regulates cell surface integrin expression. We hypothesized that LRP-1 may down-regulate basal levels of integrin subunits, at the cell surface, by facilitating integrin endocytosis. In support of this hypothesis, Czekay et al. (29Czekay R.-P. Aergeerts K. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) recently reported that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promotes αv integrin endocytosis by forming an integrin-containing multiprotein complex that is recognized and internalized by LRP-1. In this report, we demonstrate the unanticipated finding that LRP-1 expression is associated with a substantial increase in cell surface β1 integrin. The effects of LRP-1 are observed principally in confluent cell cultures and reflect the ability of LRP-1 to directly or indirectly promote maturation of newly synthesized β1 integrin in the secretory pathway. Regulation of β1 integrin maturation represents a novel mechanism by which LRP-1 may influence interactions of the cell with its microenvironment. Reagents and Proteins—Purified fibronectin, vitronectin and α5β1 integrin were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Type I collagen was obtained from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RAP was expressed in bacteria and purified as previously described (27Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

As a control, GST without fused RAP, was also expressed and purified from bacteria transformed with the empty vector, pGEX-2T. Endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany) and Sigma, respectively. Polyclonal antibody PAB1952, which recognizes the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin, was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). β1 integrin-specific polyclonal antibody 363 was kindly provided by Dr. Douglas DeSimone (University of Virginia). Polyclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and polyclonal anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK/MAPK) antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). TGF-β1,2,3-neutralizing antibody 1D11 was from R&D Systems. The activity of this antibody was confirmed in endothelial cell growth assays, as previously described by our laboratory (30Arandjelovic S. Freed T.A. Gonias S.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6121-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Streptavidin-Sepharose, peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Protein A-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. Trans35S-label, for metabolic labeling, was from ICN Biochemicals (Irvine, CA). The membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, was from Pierce. Cell culture media was from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc. Cell Culture—MEFs that are genetically deficient in LRP-1 (interchangeably called MEF-2 or PEA 13 cells), LRP-1(+/–) MEFs (PEA10), and wild-type MEFs (MEF-1 cells) were obtained from the ATCC. PEA10 and MEF-2 cells were cloned from the same culture of MEFs, heterozygous for LRP-1 gene disruption, after selection with Pseudomonas exotoxin A (31Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEF-1 cells were isolated from the same mouse strain. All MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). B41 cells are MEF-2 cells that were transfected for stable expression of full-length human LRP-1 (27Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO K1) cells, LRP-1-deficient CHO 13–5-1 cells, and CHO 14–2-1 cells, in which LRP-1 is expressed but retained intracellularly without transfer to the cell surface (32FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium, supplemented with 5% FBS optimized for CHO cells (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. In some experiments, MEFs were cultured in serum-free medium in the presence of GST-RAP (200 nm) or an equivalent concentration of GST (negative control) for 3 days. The medium and GST-RAP were replaced daily. To test the effects of different plating substrata, MEFs were cultured in 6-well plates that were pre-coated with 20% FBS, 5 μg/ml purified vitronectin, 10 μg/ml fibronectin, 25 μg/ml type I collagen or 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine for 2 h at 37 °C. After precoating and before adding cells, the wells were blocked with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. To block the function of α5β1, MEFs were pre-treated with 10 μg/ml monoclonal antibody BMA5 (Chemicon). Preparation of Cell Extracts, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting— Cells were extracted in 1% Triton X-100, 0.125% Tween-20, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml E64, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. To detect β1 integrin glycoforms, equal amounts of cellular protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions in 7.5% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with primary antibody PAB1952 for 12 h, followed by peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Secondary antibody was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance-ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Biotinylation and Recovery of Cell Surface Integrin Subunits—Monolayer cultures of MEFs and CHO cells were washed three times with ice-cold 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS) to remove contaminating FBS and other soluble proteins and then treated with the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.1 mg/ml), for 15 min at 22 °C, as described previously (27Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Biotinylation reactions were terminated by adding 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm glycine, pH 7.5 for 15 min at 22 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were counted and lysed in extraction buffer. Biotinylated cell surface proteins were precipitated with Streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The affinity precipitates were recovered by centrifugation, washed, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis to detect β1 integrin. Endoglycosidase Digestion—For PNGase F treatment, MEF extracts were diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 with protease inhibitors, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% SDS. The samples were then boiled for 2 min. After neutralization with Triton X-100 (0.5%), the samples were incubated with PNGase F (0.025–2.5 units/ml) at 37 °C for 12 h. A second dose of enzyme was added for an additional 12 h. For Endo-H treatment, MEF extracts were diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.02% SDS and protease inhibitors. Samples were treated with Endo-H (30 milliunits/ml) at 37 °C for 12 h and then with a second dose of Endo-H for an additional 12 h. Enzymatic reactions were terminated by protein precipitation with ice-cold acetone. Pellets were air-dried. The samples were then neutralized and resuspended in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Metabolic-labeling of β1 Integrin—MEFs were seeded in 60-mm dishes in serum-containing medium, and allowed to grow until 100% confluent. Depletion of intracellular methionine was achieved by culturing in l-methionine/l-cysteine-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 5% FBS for 1 h. The FBS was predialyzed to remove associated l-cysteine and l-methionine. The cells were then labeled with 0.15 mCi/ml of TRAN35S-Label (which includes radioactive l-methionine and l-cysteine) for 1 h in the same medium. After labeling, the cells were harvested immediately (time 0) or chased for the indicated times in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and excess of non-radioactive l-methionine/l-cysteine (2 mm). Cell extracts were prepared by boiling for 10 min in 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (TBS), 5 mm EDTA. The extracts were diluted 1:10 in TBS with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), subjected to centrifugation, and precleared protein-A Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). β1 integrin subunit was recovered by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibody 363. The precipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6% gels. The gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to intensifying screens. Radiolabeled β1 integrin subunit was detected using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Cell Adhesion—Costar 96-well plates were coated with various concentration of fibronectin in PBS overnight at 4 °C, rinsed, and then blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA (Sigma) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. CHO K1, CHO 14-2-1, PEA10 and MEF-2 cells were harvested in calcium/magnesium-free PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA. The cells were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min and re-suspended at a density of 106 cells/ml in Puck’s saline medium A, supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and, when indicated, 1 mm MnCl2. Cells were allowed to adhere for different periods of time at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, rinsed with PBS, and stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 2% ethanol for 30 min. Excess stain was washed away. Cell associated stain was then released in 1% SDS (50 μl per well). The absorbance at 595 nm was measured. Each value represents the mean of 18 separate replicates, divided among three different experiments. To evaluate cell spreading, cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min and then photographed using an Axiovert microscope with a Contax camera. LRP-1-deficient MEFs Demonstrate Decreased p125/Cell Surface β1 Integrin—β1 integrin was compared by immunoblot analysis in LRP-1-deficient MEF-2 cells and in two LRP-1-positive cell lines (MEF-1 and PEA10). PEA10 cells were cloned from cultures of LRP-1(+/–) embryonic fibroblasts that had been subjected to selection with Pseudomonas exotoxin A, as were MEF-2 cells (31Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEF-1 cells are LRP-1(+/+). As shown in Fig. 1A, the LRP-1-positive MEF-1 and PEA10 cells showed similar amounts of p125 and p105. In both cases, p125 accounted for more than 50% of the total β1 integrin. By contrast, LRP-1-deficient MEF-2 cells demonstrated decreased p125 and increased p105. In seven separate experiments, the amount of p125, as a fraction of the total amount of glycosylated β1 (p125/p105+p125), was 2.3 ± 0.3 fold higher in MEF-1 cells than in MEF-2 cells (p < 0.01). B41 cells are MEF-2 cells that were transfected for stable expression of full-length human LRP-1. Expression of human LRP-1 in MEF-2 cells increased the fraction of p125 β1 integrin (Fig. 1B). In four separate experiments, p125/p125+p105 was increased by 2.5 ± 0.3-fold in the B41 cells compared with MEF-2 cells (p < 0.05). To confirm the identity of p105 as an intracellular β1 precursor in the ER, we treated MEF extracts with Endo-H. This enzyme dissociates N-linked mannose-rich glycans, which become Endo-H-resistant after modification by glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus. As anticipated, Endo-H totally eliminated p105, replacing this band with a new band that migrated near unglycosylated β1 core protein. p125 was not modified by Endo-H, confirming that this species is the mature form of the integrin subunit. Because LRP-1-deficient MEF-2 cells have decreased amounts of p125, we hypothesized that these cells have decreased amounts of cell surface β1 integrin. To test this hypothesis, we biotinylated cell surface proteins in MEFs, using the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. Biotinylated proteins were affinity-precipitated with streptavidin-Sepharose and probed for β1 integrin. As shown in Fig. 1C (representative of four separate experiments), the LRP-1-positive cells (MEF-1 and B41) had increased amounts of biotinylated β1 compared with MEF-2 cells. As anticipated, biotinylated p105 was never recovered in the affinity precipitates, confirming that p105 is not found on cell surfaces in MEFs. We considered a number of previously described mechanisms whereby LRP-1 may indirectly control maturation of p105. TGF-β establishes an autocrine pathway in some cell cultures (33Lysiak J.L. Hussaini I.M. Glass W.F. Allietta M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 21919-21927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and has been shown to promote β1-chain maturation (10Heino J. Ignotz R.A. Hemler M.E. Crouse C. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 360-368Google Scholar, 11Bellis S.L. Newman E. Friedman E.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LRP-1 may function as a TGF-β receptor (34Huang S.S. Ling T.-Y. Tseng W.-F. Huang Y.-H. Tang F.-M. Leal S.M. Huang J.S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2068-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To test whether alterations in endogenously produced TGF-β activity are responsible for differences in β1 integrin maturation in LRP-1-positive and -negative MEFs, we treated PEA10 and MEF-2 cells with TGF-β-neutralizing antibody (20 μg/ml) or with an equivalent concentration of preimmune mouse IgG for 12 h in serum-free medium. Fig. 1D shows that TGF-β-neutralizing antibody had no effect on β1 distribution between p125 and p105 forms. In separate experiments, plating LRP-1-positive and -negative cells on different substrata, including vitronectin, fibronectin, type I collagen, and poly-l-lysine (negative control) had no effect on the distribution of β1 integrin into the p125 and p105 bands (results not shown). Furthermore, α5β1 function-blocking antibody (10 μg/ml for 48 h) failed to alter p105 and p125 in LRP-1-positive and -negative MEFs. However, culture confluency did affect the distribution of β1 integrin into p125 and p105, and this result was only observed in LRP-1-positive cells. We applied two strategies to test the effects of culture confluency on β1 integrin maturation. In one set of experiments, cells were plated at different densities and cultured for 24 h. By visual inspection, cells plated at 105/well remained sub-confluent. Cells plated at 106/well or 2 × 106/well were confluent; however, as anticipated, the cells plated at 2 × 106/well became confluent sooner. In a second set of experiments, cells were plated at the equivalent density (2 × 106/well) and analyzed after culturing for increasing periods of time. In both experiments, the fraction of β1 integrin migrating as mature p125 increased under conditions that favored development of cell culture confluency only in LRP-1-expressing cells (Fig. 2). The results presented thus far suggest a model in which LRP-1 regulates the relative abundance of β1 integrin glycoforms in MEFs. To confirm that the total amount of β1 integrin is not altered, we treated extracts of MEF-1, MEF-2, and B41 cells with PNGase F, which hydrolyzes aspartyl-glycosamine bonds, releasing nearly all N-linked glycans. As shown in Fig. 3A, PNGase F modified both p125 and p105, converting both species into a common product that migrated near the mobility of core protein. The amount of product observed with each of the three cell lines was essentially identical, supporting the conclusion that LRP-1 does not regulate the total amount of β1 integrin in the cell. In control experiments, we also determined that the total amount of EGFr (Fig. 3B) and ERK/MAPK (Fig. 3C) were equivalent in the MEF protein extracts. Thus, the LRP-1-dependent changes in p125 and p105 β1 integrin are specific. LRP-1 Expression Regulates p125/Cell Surface β1 Integrin in CHO Cells—As a second model system to assess the effects of LRP-1 on the subcellular distribution of β1 integrin, we compared LRP-1-positive CHO K1 cells and LRP-1-deficient CHO 13-5-1 cells. We also studied CHO 14-2-1 cells, which have a mutation in either LRP-1 or an unidentified gene product that is necessary for LRP-1 transport in the secretory pathway so that, in this cell line, LRP-1 does not transfer to the cell surface. The CHO 13-5-1 and 14-2-1 cells were cloned from CHO K1 cells treated with the mutagen, ethyl methane sulfate, and selected based on resistance to Pseudomonas exotoxin A (32FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A (left panel), the LRP-1-deficient CHO 13-5-1 cells demonstrated decreased p125 and increased p105, compared with CHO K1 cells. Thus, the effects of LRP-1 expression on β1 distribution into p105 and p125 were similar in CHO cells and MEFs. In the CHO 14-2-1 cells, p125 was almost entirely absent. To confirm these results, cell surface β1 integrin was compared in the three CHO cell lines using our surface protein biotinylation method (Fig. 4A, right panel). Once again, only p125 was detected in streptavidin-affinity precipitates, as anticipated. The amoun"
https://openalex.org/W2094872633,"The major cellular inhibitors of the small GTPases of the Ras superfamily are the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate the intrinsic GTP hydrolyzing activity of GTPases, thereby inactivating them. The catalytic activity of several GAPs is reportedly inhibited or stimulated by various phospholipids and fatty acids in vitro, indicating a likely physiological role for lipids in regulating small GTPases. We find that the p190 RhoGAP, a potent GAP for the Rho and Rac GTPases, is similarly sensitive to phospholipids. Interestingly, however, several of the tested phospholipids were found to effectively inhibit the RhoGAP activity of p190 but stimulate its RacGAP activity. Thus, phospholipids have the ability to switch the GTPase substrate preference of a GAP, thereby providing a novel regulatory mechanism for the small GTPases."

Here we have generated osteoblast cell lines expressing c-fos under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter to investigate the role of c-Fos in osteoblast cell cycle control in vitro. Three stable subclones, AT9.2, AT9.3, and AT9.7, derived from MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts, expressed high levels of exogenous c-fos mRNA and protein in the absence of tetracycline. Functional contribution of ectopic c-Fos to AP-1 complexes was confirmed by electromobility shift assays and transactivation of AP-1 reporter constructs. Induction of exogenous c-Fos in quiescent AT9.2 cells caused accelerated S-phase entry following serum stimulation, resulting in enhanced growth rate. Ectopic c-Fos resulted in increased expression of cyclins A and E protein levels, and premature activation of cyclin A-, cyclin E-, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2-associated kinase activities, although cyclin D levels and CDK4 activity were not affected significantly in these cell lines. The enhanced CDK2 kinase activity was associated with a rapid, concomitant dissociation of p27 from CDK2-containing complexes. Deregulated cyclin A expression and CDK2 activity was also observed in primary mouse osteoblasts overexpressing c-Fos, but not in fibroblasts, and c-Fos transgenic tumorderived osteosarcoma cells constitutively expressed high levels of cyclin A protein. These data suggest that overexpression of c-Fos in osteoblasts results in accelerated S phase entry as a result of deregulated cyclin A/E-CDK2 activity. This represents a novel role for c-Fos in osteoblast growth control and may provide c-Fos-overexpressing osteoblasts with a growth advantage during tumorigenesis.

This represents a novel role for c-Fos in osteoblast growth control and may provide c-Fos-overexpressing osteoblasts with a growth advantage during tumorigenesis. Hyperproliferative and neoplastic disorders of bone are characterized by increased production of bone and are generally caused by changes in the differentiation and/or function of bone-forming osteoblasts. The most common primary malignancy of the skeleton is osteosarcoma, and this provides one of the best examples of uncontrolled proliferation and deregulated growth control in osteoblasts. Although our understanding of the mechanisms of cellular growth control has increased rapidly in recent years, our knowledge of the genes that modulate osteoblast proliferation in the context of bone disease is still lacking. In this regard, we have previously shown that the c-fos proto-oncogene is important in bone biology, because its endogenous function is essential for normal bone development but its deregulated expression leads to bone disease (1Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 436-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The c-Fos oncoprotein is a member of the AP-1 transcription factor, which consists of protein dimers of the Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2), Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), and ATF families (3Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Fos proteins can only form heterodimers with members of the Jun family, whereas Jun proteins can additionally homo- and heterodimerize with Jun, ATF, and CREB proteins (3Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). AP-1 lies at the nexus of many signaling pathways and transduces extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, and environmental stress, modulating a variety of biological processes, including cell growth, death, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation (2Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 3Shaulian E. Karin M.

The activity of the AP-1 complex can be regulated at many levels, including changes in the expression levels of constituent proteins, dimerization partners, phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors, resulting in regulation of AP-1 target genes (5Angel P. Szabowski A. Schorpp-Kistner M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 6Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar). Perturbations in AP-1 function by gain- and loss-of-function approaches can alter tissue homeostasis (2Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and in the case of c-Fos, this is particularly evident in bone and cartilage. Mice lacking c-Fos develop osteopetrosis due to a block in the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, demonstrating an essential role for c-Fos in the development of the osteoclast lineage and bone remodeling (7Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). In contrast, ubiquitous overexpression of c-Fos in transgenic mice results in the formation of osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas due to transformation of osteoblastic and chondroblastic cells, respectively (8Wang Z.Q.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the c-Fos-related proteins, Fra-1 and ΔFosB, in transgenic mice caused enhanced bone formation and osteosclerosis, without any associated malignancy (10Jochum W. David J.P.

Mukhopadhyay K. Ford K. Nestler E.J. Baron R. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). High levels of c-Fos have also been observed in many primary and metastatic human osteosarcomas (12Pompetti F. Rizzo P. Simon R.M. Freidlin B. Mew D.J. Pass H.I. Picci P. Levine A.S. Carbone M. J.

Moreover, osteosarcomas often contain mutations in, or have altered levels of p53, pRb, cyclin D1, CDK4, MDM2, and p16 proteins (12Pompetti F. Rizzo P. Simon R.M. Freidlin B. Mew D.J. Pass H.I.

In c-Fos transgenic mice, which develop osteosarcomas, we previously demonstrated that cyclin D1 protein is not generally detectable in osteoblasts but becomes markedly elevated upon initial expression of the c-Fos transgene, prior to tumor formation (19Sunters A. McCluskey J. Grigoriadis A.E. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because oncogenes can directly regulate the expression and activity of key components of the cell cycle machinery, these data strongly suggest that changes in cell cycle gene expression may be involved in the initial stages of c-Fos-induced deregulated osteoblast growth and malignant bone disease. The control of the eukaryotic cell cycle ensures that all the steps that occur in cell division proceed in the correct temporal order. Cell cycle progression is controlled by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CKI, CDK inhibitor; Tc, tetracycline; CMV, cytomegalovirus; α-MEM, α minimal essential medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SPAP, secreted placental alkaline phosphatase. and CDK inhibitors (CKIs) (20Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). CDKs are serine/threonine kinases, which associate with specific cyclin partners and phosphorylate key substrates to facilitate cell cycle progression. The levels of cyclins oscillate throughout the cell cycle: Cyclin D family members are expressed in G1, cyclin E at G1-S, cyclin A in late G1-S, and G2-M phases, and cyclin B in S and G2 phases. Two CKI families exist that can prevent activation of the kinases and uncontrolled replication, the Cip/Kip (p21, p27, and p57) and the INK4 (p15, p16, p18, and p19) families (21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). Cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate a number of specific targets, the best characterized being the retinoblastoma family proteins, pRb, p107, and p130. Phosphorylated pRb proteins dissociate from E2F family members, allowing active E2F to regulate the expression of genes required for cell cycle progression (20Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). Cell cycle regulation in bone has not been widely studied. We have observed high endogenous levels of cyclin E in vivo in differentiated endosteal osteoblasts of mouse long bones (19Sunters A. McCluskey J. Grigoriadis A.E. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and others have shown that cyclins E and B are up-regulated during differentiation of primary rat osteoblasts in vitro (22Smith E. Frenkel B. Schlegel R. Giordano A. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5019-5024PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence also suggests that cyclin A-CDK2 complexes may also function in the regulation of clonal expansion during osteoblast differentiation in vitro (23Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Primary osteoblasts from p27 null mice form larger colonies and produce larger mineralized bone nodules in vitro, suggesting that this CKI plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation (24Drissi H. Hushka D. Aslam F. Nguyen Q. Buffone E. Koff A. van Wijnen A. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3705-3711PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, parathyroid hormone, a major regulator of bone metabolism, has been shown to inhibit osteoblast proliferation by increasing p27 levels and inhibiting CDK2 activity (25Onishi T. Hruska K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1995-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important role for AP-1 in mediating growth factor-induced cell cycle progression has been demonstrated, because cyclin D1 was shown to be an AP-1-responsive gene (3Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar, 20Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr.

However, whereas the effects of Jun family members on cell cycle have been characterized extensively (27Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 28Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the role of Fos proteins, in particular of c-Fos, is less clear. Cell cycle progression in primary embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells lacking c-Fos is unaffected (31Field S.J. Johnson R.S. Mortensen R.M. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9306-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Brusselbach S. Mohle-Steinlein U. Wang Z.Q. Schreiber M. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar). However, there appears to be a requirement for functional c-Fos activity in cell cycle entry, because loss-of-function, either by antibody microinjection or in double c-Fos/FosB knockout fibroblasts, causes a failure to induce cyclin D1 and retards cell cycle entry (33Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5015-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F. Pestell R.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5609-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, c-Fos has also been shown to inhibit the expression of cyclin D1, CDC2 and CDK4 (35Balsalobre A. Jolicoeur P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 455-465PubMed Google Scholar), whereas c-Fos overexpression in B-lymphocytes correlates with increased p27 stability and a delay in S-phase entry (36Kobayashi K. Phuchareon J. Inada K. Tomita Y. Koizumi T. Hatano M. Miyatake S. Tokuhisa T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2050-2056PubMed Google Scholar). These apparently contradictory reports may reflect cell type-specific effects of c-Fos. Our previous in vivo data would suggest that any effect of c-Fos on cell cycle control may be most physiologically relevant in osteoblastic cells, where deregulated c-Fos expression causes such dramatic neoplastic changes (9Grigoriadis A.E. Schellander K. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 19Sunters A. McCluskey J. Grigoriadis A.E. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of the role of c-Fos in osteoblast growth control, we have focused on cell cycle regulation in osteoblasts in vitro. To this end, we have constructed an inducible c-Fos expression vector and obtained stable transfectants of an immortal osteoblastic cell line. Using this as an in vitro model, we have identified key points of cell cycle control that are regulated by c-Fos in osteoblasts. Antibodies and Plasmids—Antibodies used were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) as follows: cyclin A (sc-596), cyclin D1 (sc-717), cyclin D3 (sc-182), cyclin E (sc-198), CDK2 (sc-163), CDK4 (sc-260), CDK6 (sc-177), p21 (sc-397), p27 (sc-528), c-Fos (sc-52, sc-52X), Fos-B (sc-48), Fra-1 (sc-183), pan-Fos family (sc-413X), c-Jun (sc-45), and actin (sc-1616). Purified rabbit immunoglobulins (X0907) and secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugates were obtained from Dako (Denmark) against immunoglobulins from mouse (P0447), rabbit (P0449), or goat (P0448). The plasmids used were pJMF2-c-fos and pJMF2-luc, where the murine c-fos cDNA and luciferase, respectively, are under the negative control of tetracycline (Tc), and p76/21, which constitutively expresses murine genomic c-fos (64van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). pCMV-SPAP (37Tate S.S. Urade R. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Udenfriend S. Faseb J. 1990; 4: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which contains the secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SPAP) gene under the control of a CMV promoter was used as a transfection control, and AP-1 transactivation studies were performed using pCollCAT and pmCollCAT, containing –517 to +63 nucleotides of the human collagenase promoter with a wild-type and mutated AP-1 site, respectively (kind gifts of Dr. Peter Angel, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). Cell Culture and Transfections—Murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells and primary murine osteoblasts were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM plus ribonucleosides/deoxyribonucleosides, Sigma Chemical Co. Poole, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Meldrum, Hants, UK), antibiotics (penicillin 50 units/ml, streptomycin 50 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (5 mm) (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). NIH3T3 fibroblasts as well as the osteosarcoma cell lines P1.7, P1.9, and P1.15, which were isolated from bone tumors formed in c-fos-overexpressing transgenic mice (9Grigoriadis A.E. Schellander K. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% calf serum (NIH3T3 cells) or 10% FCS (osteosarcoma cells), antibiotics and l-glutamine. Primary osteoblasts were isolated according to established protocols (38Bellows C.G. Ciaccia A. Heersche J.N. Bone. 1998; 23: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells were stably transfected with the expression vector pJMF2-c-fos using SuperFect according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Stable clones were selected in media containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and in the presence of 10 μg/ml Tc (Sigma) to inhibit transgene expression. Twenty-three G418-resistant clones were isolated, of which 10 were screened by Northern blotting as described below. Additional control clones were isolated from MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with pJMF2-luc, which expresses luciferase under Tc control. Twenty-two G418-resistant clones were isolated, and 11 were screened for Tc-regulatable luciferase activity by the “Wash and Glow” system (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transient transfections were performed using Effectene as specified by the manufacturers (Qiagen). CAT activity was measured using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science, Lewes, UK), and SPAP activity was measured as described previously (37Tate S.S. Urade R. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Udenfriend S. Faseb J. 1990; 4: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Primary mouse osteoblasts and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were transfected with the c-fos expression vector p76/21, carrying the murine genomic c-fos gene (39Thomas D.P. Sunters A. Gentry A.

For serum deprivation and re-stimulation experiments, cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/cm2, in α-MEM containing Tc (10 μg/ml) for 48 h and were made quiescent by serum deprivation for 24 h in α-MEM containing 0.5% FCS, antibiotics, l-glutamine, 3 × 10–8 m sodium selenite, 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml Tc. Cells were then incubated in α-MEM containing 0.5% FCS with or without Tc as above for 48 h, and then stimulated with α-MEM containing 20% FCS with or without Tc (10 μg/ml). Total cellular extracts were prepared between 0 and 48 h as indicated in each figure, and the 0-h time point refers to cells that are quiescent, i.e. before the addition of media containing 20% serum. For [3H]thymidine uptake measurements, quiescent MC3T3-E1, AT7.8, and AT9.2 cells were cultured in 6-well plates and serum stimulated in media containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (specific activity of 50 Ci/mol) (Amersham Biosciences International, UK) for 12 h. Cells were fixed and washed in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. DNA was solubilized in 0.3 m NaOH 1% SDS overnight, and the dpm incorporated into the DNA were determined using liquid scintillation counting. Flow Cytometry—Cells were processed for flow cytometry as previously described (40O'Connor P.M. Wassermann K. Sarang M. Magrath I. Bohr V.A. Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6550-6557PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at the times indicated, fixed in 70% EtOH, stained with propidium iodide (Sigma), and analyzed using a Moflo flow cytometer (Cytomation Bioinstruments, Freiburg, Germany) with doublet correction. The data were analyzed using the WinMDI program (University of Wisconsin). Northern Blotting—Poly(A+) mRNA was isolated, Northern-blotted, and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes as described previously (39Thomas D.P. Sunters A. Gentry A. Grigoriadis A.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized to a v-fos probe, which recognizes both the exogenous and endogenous forms of c-fos as well as fox/fau, an abundant murine housekeeping gene that cross-hybridizes to v-fos, and which was used as a loading control (39Thomas D.P. Sunters A. Gentry A. Grigoriadis A.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Extraction, Western blotting, EMSA, Immunoprecipitation, and Kinase Assays—Cellular protein was extracted for use in Western blotting, EMSA, immunoprecipitation, and kinase assays. Cells were lysed in Tween lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, pH 8.0) with sonication. Protein concentration of the soluble fraction was determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce/Perbio, Tattenhall, UK). For Western blotting, 50 μg of protein was size fractionated using SDS-PAGE (National Diagnostics, Hull, UK) and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Watford, UK). Blots were blocked for 16 h at 4 °C in 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 8.0). Primary antibody incubations were performed in 1% milk powder in TBST (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h followed by incubation for 1 h in the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. All antibody concentrations were optimized following preliminary titration experiments. Proteins were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences UK). Even protein loading of the gels was confirmed by transillumination of the Immobilon membrane according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and by Western blotting with an actin antibody. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed by incubating 5 μg of whole cell protein extract with 1 × 105 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP 5′-end-labeled AP-1 consensus nucleotide (5′-GCG TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′; Promega, Southampton, UK) in EMSA buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), pH 7.5), for 1 h. For supershift assays, 1 μg of either control rabbit immunoglobulin (Dako, Denmark), pan-Fos family reactive (sc-413X) or c-Fos-specific (sc-52X) antibody was added for a further 1 h on ice. Complexes were resolved by using PAGE, run in 0.5× TBE, dried, and autoradiographed. Immunoprecipitations were performed on 1 mg of total cell lysate. Briefly, protein was diluted to 1 ml in lysis buffer, 1 μg of antibody was added, and the samples were mixed at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were immobilized by the addition of 20 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose bead suspension (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C and washed 5 times in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Protein A beads were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, size fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. The ability of cells to phosphorylate a GST-retinoblastoma fusion protein (GST-Rb; kindly provided by Dr. G. Peters, Cancer Research UK, London) was determined as follows. Protein was diluted to 1 ml in lysis buffer (1 mg for CDK4 and 200 μg for cyclin A, cyclin E, or CDK2) and incubated with 1 μg of antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads as described above, washed 5 times in 1 ml of ice-cold Tween lysis buffer, and three times in 1 ml of ice-cold kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm ATP, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, pH 7.5). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 μg of GST-Rb and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 20 μl of kinase buffer at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the mixture was electrophoresed in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was Western-blotted as before, and the radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The Western blots were then overlaid with antibodies as a control for loading, and to determine complex formation. Generation of Stable Osteoblastic Cell Lines with Inducible c-fos Expression—To establish an in vitro inducible system for studying the effects of c-fos on cell cycle regulation, we transfected the immortalized, non-transformed mouse osteoblastlike cell line, MC3T3-E1, with the Tc-regulatable construct pJMF2-c-fos (39Thomas D.P. Sunters A. Gentry A. Grigoriadis A.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and selected stable transfectants. From 10 independent stable clones, which were screened by Northern blotting in the presence and absence of Tc, three clones, designated AT9.2, AT9.3, and AT9.7, were isolated, which expressed high levels of the exogenous 1.8-kb c-fos mRNA in the absence of Tc, but not in 10 μg/ml Tc (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, none of the clones shown here expressed the 2.2-kb endogenous c-fos transcript under routine culture conditions. Western blotting experiments demonstrated that clones AT9.2, AT9.3, and AT9.7 all expressed high levels of c-Fos protein, which was repressible by Tc, whereas the parental cell line MC3T3-E1 failed to express exogenous c-Fos in the absence of Tc (Fig. 1B). The Western blot results also confirmed that the three Tc-inducible clones expressed no, or undetectable levels of endogenous c-Fos (i.e. +Tc), as did the parental cell line MC3T3-E1 either with or without Tc. Stable clones of MC3T3-E1 were also isolated after transfection with pJMF2-luc. From 11 G418-resistant clones, 5 expressed luciferase, and 1 specific clone, AT7.8 showed high luciferase activity coupled with Tc responsiveness, which was used as a transfection control cell line (data not shown; see also Fig. 1 (C and D)). For the majority of the experiments described here, the AT9.2 clone was used. Exogenous c-Fos Protein Binds to AP-1 Consensus Oligonucleotides and Transactivates AP-1-responsive Reporter Constructs—To confirm that the exogenous c-Fos protein expressed in AT9.2 cells was present in active AP-1 complexes, EMSA and supershift assays were performed. EMSA experiments demonstrated a specific band shift corresponding to the AP-1 complex, which disappeared upon the inclusion of a specific AP-1 competitor oligonucleotide, but not with a nonspecific AP-2 oligonucleotide, demonstrating AP-1 specificity (Fig. 1C). Supershift analysis using a control antibody (rabbit Ig) showed that t"

Nitrative and oxidative stress can induce α-synuclein protein aggregation, possibly initiated by the formation of stable cross-linking dimers. To determine whether enhanced dimer formation can accelerate protein aggregation and increase cellular toxicity, we have substituted cysteine for tyrosine at positions 39, 125, 133, and 136 in human wild-type (WT) α-synuclein, and in A53T and A30P mutant α-synuclein. To reduce the likelihood of cross-linking, phenylalanine was substituted for tyrosine at the same sites. We have found that overexpression of Y39C or Y125C mutant proteins leads to increased intracellular inclusions and apoptosis in a rat dopaminergic cell line (N27 cells) and in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Expression of Y133C, Y136C, and all four Tyr-to-Phe mutations were not more cytotoxic than WT control. Exposure to oxidative stress increased Y39C and Y125C α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity. Dimers and oligomers were found in Triton X-100-soluble fractions from adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Y39C and Y125C in N27 cells. In contrast, WT β-synuclein and all four Tyr-to-Cys mutant β-synucleins did not cause protein aggregation and cell death.

Some of the remaining DA neurons contain large intracellular inclusions, known as Lewy bodies (LBs) (5Lewy F.H. Dtsch. Z. Nervenheilk. 1913; 50: 50-55Google Scholar). The etiology of PD may involve a combination of environmental toxins, such as heavy metals and pesticides, and genetic factors (6Dawson T.M. Mandir A.S. Lee M.K.

Biophysical studies have demonstrated that α-synuclein is capable of forming fibrils similar to those found in LBs (16Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol.

In fact, both A53T and A30P α-synuclein gene mutations significantly accelerate protein aggregation (17Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat.

The data indicate that α-synuclein protein aggregation is important in the pathogenesis of PD. The biochemical and biophysical factors that may initiate and propagate α-synuclein aggregation and promote its deposition into LBs are not completely understood. A growing body of evidence suggests that oxidative stress is fundamental. Widespread nitration of α-synuclein has been found in LBs in PD and other synucleinopathies (23Duda J.E. Giasson B.I. Chen Q. Gur T.L. Hurtig H.I. Stern M.B. Gollomp S.M. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J.

In vitro, exposure of human recombinant α-synuclein protein to nitrating agents leads to the formation of stable dimers and oligomers through O-O′-dityrosine cross-linking (26Souza J.M. Giasson B.I.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oxidative dimer formation is the critical rate-limiting step for protein aggregation and fibrillogenesis. WT α-synuclein has four tyrosine residues at positions 39, 125, 133, 136, and lacks cysteine. Because cysteine can be easily oxidized to form stable cross-linked disulfide dimers, we have hypothesized that cysteine substitution for tyrosine should produce a form of α-synuclein that could more easily dimerize and subsequently polymerize. We have explored whether tyrosine-to-cysteine-modified α-synuclein accelerates protein aggregation and increases cellular toxicity. We have also generated control plasmids in which tyrosine is replaced by phenylalanine. In this study, we have found that cysteine substitution in the Y39C and Y125C positions but not the Y133C and Y136C positions significantly enhanced α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity. To test whether aggregation is the property only of α-synuclein, we have created a family of β-synucleins with similar Tyr-to-Cys substitutions and find no tendency for aggregation or toxicity. Cloning and Mutagenesis—The cloning of cDNAs containing WT, A53T, and A30P human α-synuclein has been described previously (28Zhou, W., Hurlbert, M. S., Schaack, J., Prasad, K. N., and Freed, C. R. Brain Res., 866, 33–43Google Scholar, 29Zhou W. Schaack J. Zawada W.M. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2002; 926: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Human wild-type β-synuclein was cloned from an expressed sequence tag clone and verified by DNA sequencing. In this study, α- and β-synuclein coding sequences were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). We generated α-synuclein mutations (Y39, Y125, Y133, Y136) and β-synuclein mutations (Y39, Y119, Y127, Y130) with tyrosine to either cysteine or phenylalanine using a PCR-based mutagenesis method (30Picard V. Bock S.C. Methods in Molecular Biology.Vol. 67. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 81-92Google Scholar). All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For recombinant protein expression, human α-synuclein coding sequences were cloned into pRSET vector (Invitrogen). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Oxidative Stress Treatment—Rat dopaminergic N27 cells (31Clarkson E.D. La Rosa F.G. Edwards-Prasad J. Weiland D.A. Witta S.E. Freed C.R. Prasad K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were used for the transfection study. N27 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 on polyethylenimine (1 mg/ml; Sigma) coated 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2 mml-glutamine. Effectene reagent was used for transfection of N27 cells according to the supplier’s instruction (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). HEK 293 cells were cultured on 12-well plates in a medium of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2 mml-glutamine. We used the calcium phosphate method to transfect 293 cells. For oxidative stress treatment, transfected cells were exposed to 50 μm dopamine for 4 h and analyzed 24 h later. Recombinant Adenovirus and Cell Transduction—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP), WT, A53T, and A30P α-synuclein (Ad-WT-Syn, Ad-A53T-Syn, and Ad-A30P-Syn) have been described previously (28Zhou, W., Hurlbert, M. S., Schaack, J., Prasad, K. N., and Freed, C. R. Brain Res., 866, 33–43Google Scholar, 29Zhou W. Schaack J. Zawada W.M. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2002; 926: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing Y39C and Y125C human α-synuclein (Ad-Y39C-Syn and Ad-Y125C-Syn) were constructed similarly. N27 cells were cultured on 24-well plates and exposed to adenoviruses at the dose of 200 plaque-forming units/cell. Immunocytochemistry—N27 cells and HEK 293 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and processed for immunostaining as described previously (28Zhou, W., Hurlbert, M. S., Schaack, J., Prasad, K. N., and Freed, C. R. Brain Res., 866, 33–43Google Scholar, 29Zhou W. Schaack J. Zawada W.M. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2002; 926: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Antibodies used include mouse anti-α-synuclein antibody (synuclein-1, 1:400; BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibody (1:200; Chemicon); rabbit anti-phospho-serine 129 α-synuclein (1:200; a kind gift from Dr. Takeshi Iwatsubo, University of Tokyo). Cell Viability, Apoptosis, and Protein Aggregation—Three days after adenovirus transduction, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium was added to N27 cell cultures (0.4 mg/ml), and cell viability was measured as described previously (28Zhou, W., Hurlbert, M. S., Schaack, J., Prasad, K. N., and Freed, C. R. Brain Res., 866, 33–43Google Scholar). After α-synuclein immunostaining, cells were counterstained with Hoechst dye 33258 (1 mg/ml; Sigma) for 10 min. We examined α-synuclein-positive cells (i.e. transfected cells) for protein inclusions and apoptosis. Apoptotic cells were identified by a condensed, fragmented nucleus. We also used terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay (in situ apoptosis detection kit; Roche) to confirm apoptosis. To determine whether α-synuclein protein inclusion contains amyloid, thioflavin S (0.01%; Sigma) staining was used after α-synuclein immunostaining. Quantification and Statistics—For quantification, three wells were examined in each condition (about 350–400 transfected cells from each well), and independent experiments were repeated at least three times. The fraction of transfected cells with inclusions was calculated as the ratio of the number of inclusion-containing cells to the total number of transfected cells. The fraction of transfected cells that were apoptotic was calculated in a similar way. Nuclear morphology or TUNEL-positivity defined apoptotic cells. The data were compared by analysis of variance, and a post hoc Neuman test was performed. Western Blotting—N27 cells and HEK293 cells were cultured on 6-well plates and transfected as described above. Adenovirus-transduced N27 cells were also used. Three days later, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). After homogenizing with a Dounce homogenizer, cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet (P1) and supernatant (S1) were collected. The Triton X-100-insoluble pellets were further dissolved in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, centrifuged for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant (S2) was used for Western blotting. Protein concentration was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). Ten micrograms (for adenovirus experiments) or 50 μg (for transfection experiments) of total protein from S1 and S2 were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (MSI, Westboro, MA). The blot was probed with mouse anti-α-synuclein antibody (synuclein-1, 1:1000; BD Transduction Laboratories) and detected with ECL reagents (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). Recombinant Protein Purification and in Vitro Aggregation Assay— The WT and mutant human α-synuclein proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins were purified with Talon metal affinity resin beads (BD Biosciences Clontech). The protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometry. For protein aggregation assays, 100 μl of recombinant protein (0.2 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4) was incubated with 50 μm H2O2 for 4 h at room temperature. At the end of the experiment, 2 μl of protein solution was separated in 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The Western blot staining was processed as described above. The protein band density was determined by densitometry. Y39C and Y125C Mutations Increased α-Synuclein-Positive Inclusions and Apoptosis in N27 Cells and HEK 293 Cells—To examine whether tyrosine-to-cysteine/phenylalanine modifications of human α-synuclein can change protein aggregation and toxicity, we generated three sets of mutations based on human WT, A53T, and A30P α-synuclein genes. As controls, human β-synuclein and its four tyrosine-to-cysteine mutations were constructed. We expressed these constructs in both N27 cells and HEK 293 cells by transient transfection. N27 cells are from rat embryonic day 12 midbrain and immortalized with T-antigen (31Clarkson E.D. La Rosa F.G. Edwards-Prasad J. Weiland D.A. Witta S.E. Freed C.R. Prasad K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). N27 cells have a dopaminergic phenotype that includes the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and DAT (28Zhou, W., Hurlbert, M. S., Schaack, J., Prasad, K. N., and Freed, C. R. Brain Res., 866, 33–43Google Scholar, 31Clarkson E.D. La Rosa F.G. Edwards-Prasad J. Weiland D.A. Witta S.E. Freed C.R. Prasad K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In WT α-synuclein transfected N27 and 293 cells, α-synuclein protein was distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and F). In cells expressing either Y39C or Y125C mutants, α-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic inclusions were frequently observed (Fig. 1, B, C, G, and H). The sizes of inclusions varied from small granular aggregates (Fig. 1B) to large, densely stained inclusions (Fig. 1, C, G, and H). Hoechst dye staining showed nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 1, D and I), indicating that the cells with inclusion were undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1, E and J). Apoptosis in Y39C and Y125C α-synuclein transfected cells were further confirmed by TUNEL-positive staining (Fig. 1, L and M). In contrast, WT β-synuclein (Fig. 1K) and its four Tyr-to-Cys mutations (data not shown) showed no protein aggregation. We have found that α-synuclein-positive inclusions and cytoplasm were also positive for thioflavin S staining (Fig. 1, N and O), indicating the presence of α-synuclein fibrils. These α-synuclein protein inclusions were negative for ubiquitin and phopho-Ser129 α-synuclein staining (data not shown). The percentage of apoptotic cells and the percentage of cells with α-synuclein inclusions are shown in Fig. 2. In both N27 and 293 cells, we found that cells transfected with Y39C and Y125C mutants resulted in significantly more apoptotic cell death and significantly more inclusions (Fig. 2A, E, n = 12; *, p < 0.05) compared with WT, whereas Y133C and Y136C substitutions did not differ significantly from the WT control. The effect of cysteine substitution was also tested in the nontyrosine position. Cysteine substitution at A53 (A53C) had no effect on apoptosis or inclusion formation (Fig. 2, A and E, n = 12, p > 0.1). In four Tyr-to-Phe α-synuclein mutations, there were no changes in protein inclusions and apoptosis compared with WT protein (Fig. 2, A and E, n = 12, p > 0.1). In the A53T and A30P series of mutant genes, the effects of tyrosine-to-cysteine/phenylalanine substitutions were similar to those seen in the WT human α-synuclein (Fig. 2, B, C, F, and G). In both series, only Y39C and Y125C mutants caused significantly more apoptosis and α-synuclein inclusions than controls (Fig. 2, B, C, F, and G, n = 12; *, p < 0.05). No other mutations differed significantly from control (p > 0.1). In contrast, no inclusions were found in cells transfected with WT β-synuclein and four Tyr-to-Cys mutations (Fig. 2, D and H, n = 9). The apoptotic rates for all five β-synuclein genes were similar to vector-only control (Fig. 2, D and H, n = 9, p > 0.1). A positive control run simultaneously with the β-synuclein experiments, an additional series of α-synuclein experiments using WT, Y39C, and Y125C all showed significantly more apoptotic cell death and protein inclusions than β-synuclein (Fig. 2, D and H, n = 9; *, p < 0.05; #, p < 0.01). α-Synuclein Inclusion Associated with Apoptosis—We asked whether the formation of α-synuclein-positive inclusions could cause apoptotic cell death. We further analyzed transfected cells and divided them into two cell populations: with and without α-synuclein inclusions. The rate of apoptosis in the two cell populations is shown in Fig. 3. Both N27 and 293 cells with inclusions had a significant higher rate of apoptosis than cells without inclusions (Fig. 3, A and B, n = 12, p < 0.01). Furthermore, cells with Y39C and Y125C mutations had significant more inclusions and a higher apoptotic rate than cells with WT α-synuclein (Fig. 3, A and B, n = 12; *, p < 0.05). Similar data were found in the mutants based on A53T or A30P α-synuclein (n = 12; data not shown). The results indicate that the apoptosis is highly associated with α-synuclein inclusions. Oxidative Stress Promotes Y39C and Y125C Toxicity in N27 Cells—We observed higher toxicity of Y39C and Y125C α-synuclein in N27 cells than 293 cells, which could be a result of the endogenous production of DA in N27 cells (31Clarkson E.D. La Rosa F.G. Edwards-Prasad J. Weiland D.A. Witta S.E. Freed C.R. Prasad K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We tested whether additional oxidative stress would further enhance protein aggregation and cellular toxicity in N27 cells. Two days after transfection, cells were exposed to 50 μm DA. We found apoptosis was significantly enhanced in cells transfected with Y39C and Y125C α-synuclein compared with WT control (Fig. 4A, n = 9; *, p < 0.05). The DA treatment also significantly increased α-synuclein-positive inclusions in Y39C and Y125C transfected cells compared with WT (Fig. 4B, n = 9; *, p < 0.05). Unlike N27 cells, treatment with 50 μm DA had no effect on apoptosis or inclusion formation in 293 cells, possibly because these cells lack DAT (n = 9; data not shown). The results indicate that oxidative stress can potentiate the neurotoxicity of cysteine-substituted α-synuclein in dopamine neurons. Adenovirus-mediated Overexpression of Y39C and Y125C α-Synuclein Caused Apoptotic Cell Death—To overcome the low transfection efficiency in N27 cells, we generated adenoviruses expressing Y39C and Y125C α-synuclein. We had previously shown that adenovirus could achieve 90% transduction efficiency (28Zhou, W., Hurlbert, M. S., Schaack, J., Prasad, K. N., and Freed, C. R. Brain Res., 866, 33–43Google Scholar). N27 cells were transduced with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 200. In Ad-Y39C-Syn and Ad-Y125C-Syn transduced cells, we found a significant decrease in total cell viability (Fig. 5A, n = 9; *, p < 0.05; #, p < 0.01), increase in apoptosis (Fig. 5B, n = 9; #, p < 0.01), and increase in the rate of cells with inclusions (Fig. 5C, n = 9; #, p < 0.01) compared with Ad-WT-Syn, Ad-GFP, or mock control. Cells transduced with Ad-A53T-Syn and Ad-A30P-Syn also showed significantly less viability (Fig. 5A, n = 9; *, p < 0.05; #, p < 0.01), increase in apoptosis (Fig. 5B, n = 9; #, p < 0.01), and increase in the rate of inclusion (Fig. 5C, n = 9; #, p < 0.01) compared with WT and controls. The Ad-Y39C-Syn and Ad-Y125C-Syn did not cause significantly more cell death and apoptosis than Ad-A53T-Syn, but Ad-Y39C-Syn did have significantly more cell death and apoptosis than Ad-A30P-Syn (n = 9; *, p < 0.05). Oxidative Stress and Adenovirus-mediated α-Synuclein Overexpression Enhanced Dimer and Oligomer Formation in N27 Cells—To investigate whether cysteine substitution increases dimer or oligomer formation, we analyzed α-synuclein protein using Western blotting. Under basal conditions, only monomer α-synuclein was observed in both Triton X-100-soluble and insoluble fractions (data not shown). After treatment with 50 μm DA for 24 h before harvesting, α-synuclein dimers were found in Y39C and Y125C α-synuclein in Triton X-100-soluble fractions (Fig. 6A). In Triton X-100-insoluble fractions, only α-synuclein monomer was identified (Fig. 6B). Unlike N27 cells, there were no dimers or oligomers detected in 293 cells at the basal conditions or with the 50 μm DA treatment (data not shown). In N27 cells transduced with adenovirus, we found dimers and oligomers in Ad-Y39C-Syn- and Ad-Y125C-Syn-treated cells in Triton X-100-soluble fractions (Fig. 6C), as well as high molecular weight α-synuclein species in Triton X-100-insoluble fractions (Fig. 6D). In contrast, Ad-WT-Syn, Ad-A53T-Syn, and Ad-A30P-Syn did not produce dimers or oligomers. Recombinant Y39C Proteins Form More Dimer and Oligomer after Oxidative Stress in Solution—We investigated whether recombinant proteins with cysteine substitutions can form dimers and oligomers under mild oxidizing conditions in solution. Purified recombinant proteins were incubated with 50 μm H2O2 for 4 h followed by Western blot analysis. Results showed that Y39C protein formed strong bands of dimer and oligomer, whereas WT and other cysteine mutants produced only light bands of dimer and no oligomer (Fig. 7A). The ratio of dimer to monomer revealed that Y39C protein significantly increased the proportion of dimer relative to monomer after H2O2 treatment compared with WT control and other mutants (Fig. 7B, n = 3; *, p < 0.05). Unlike Y39C, Y125C protein did not lead to significant dimer formation compared with WT. This result suggests that Y39C is relatively easier to oxidize in solution than is Y125C, WT, or any other mutant form of human α-synuclein. Results indicate that cysteine mutation at the 39 position preferentially enhances dimer and oligomer formation under oxidative conditions. In cell culture, we have shown that mutant forms of human α-synuclein with tyrosine-to-cysteine substitutions can enhance α-synuclein protein aggregation and increase cell toxicity. We have seen that the position of the tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution is critical; the Y39C and Y125C enhance protein aggregation and toxicity whereas Y133C and Y136C substitutions have no effect. In addition, the substitution of tyrosine with phenylalanine had no effect on intracellular inclusions and cytotoxicity. The changes in toxicity were specific for α-synuclein; Y39C and Y125C mutations in β-synuclein did not cause protein toxicity. In this study, we found that the expression level of α-synuclein protein influenced the aggregation and toxicity of Y39C and Y125C. Using adenovirus-mediated overexpression, we found that the level of α-synuclein overexpression is five times greater than that of transient transfection (as seen in Fig. 6, compare α-synuclein seen from loading 10 μg of total protein for adenovirus versus 50 μg for transfection). Because higher concentrations of α-synuclein were produced, we were able to detect the dimers and oligomers in Triton X-100-soluble fractions even under basal conditions. In transfection experiments, because only a small number of cells (3–5%) contained α-synuclein inclusions, dimers were not seen in N27 cells or 293 cells under basal conditions. Exposure to 50 μm DA greatly enhanced α-synuclein inclusions in the N27 cells transfected with Y39C and Y125C mutant α-synuclein, and dimers were then detected. When cells were transfected with A53T and A30P α-synuclein, the mutant proteins caused no toxicity compared with WT α-synuclein. However, the enhanced gene expression produced by adenovirus led to significant toxicity of A53T and A30P mutant forms of α-synuclein. These results indicate that A53T and A30P α-synuclein require relatively high levels of protein to show toxicity. The cysteine-substituted α-synuclein we have developed offers a new insight into the importance of Y39 and Y125 in α-synuclein toxicity. The effect of cysteine substitution is specific for α-synuclein, not for β-synuclein. This difference may reflect the non-amyloidogenic nature of β-synuclein. The reason why only Y39C and Y125C, but not Y133 and Y136, have these effects on α-synuclein is not known currently. Previous study indicates nitrating and oxidizing agents can attack specific amino acids in the target proteins (32Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 15: 163-169Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is such a target protein in which nitration occurs on specific tyrosines in synucleinopathies (23Duda J.E. Giasson B.I. Chen Q. Gur T.L. Hurtig H.I. Stern M.B. Gollomp S.M. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1439-1445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 24Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Science. 2001; 290: 985-989Crossref Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to nitrating agents can produce aggregations of α-synuclein that contain nitrated tyrosine (25Paxinou E. Chen Q. Weisse M. Giasson B.I. Norris E.H. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8053-8061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if nitrating and oxidizing agents can recognize specific tyrosine sites in the α-synuclein molecule, then cysteine substitution at the same positions might also facilitate disulfide dimer formation at those sites. Because of the ease of oxidation of cysteine to a disulfide, we also reasoned that oxidation should occur at a lower oxidative stress level and that the disulfide dimers formed would be more chemically stable. Previous study has shown that the Y125 is the most important site for in vitro dityrosine cross-linking by nitration (33Takahashi T. Yamashita H. Nakamura T. Nagano Y. Nakamura S. Brain Res. 2002; 938: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, Norris et al. (34Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27230-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) found that all four tyrosines are potential targets for protein nitration as well as dityrosine cross-linking. We can only speculate on the mechanism for selective aggregation of Y39C and Y125C α-synuclein compared with other α- or β-synucleins. Inside the cell, α-synuclein could bind to membrane and other proteins, which may lead to conformational changes that increase dimer formation. It may be possible that Y39C and Y125C are more exposed to oxidative agents than Y133C and Y136C. α-Synuclein protein plays a role in oxidative stress and is in turn influenced by it. Overexpression of WT, A53T, and A30P mutant α-synuclein leads to increased reactive oxygen species, enhanced catalysis of hydrogen peroxide, and mitochondrial deficits (35Hsu L.J. Sagara Y. Arroyo A.

Med. 2001; 30: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Overexpression of WT and mutant α-synuclein can increase the susceptibility of cells to oxidative stress (28Zhou, W., Hurlbert, M. S., Schaack, J., Prasad, K. N., and Freed, C. R. Brain Res., 866, 33–43Google Scholar, 29Zhou W. Schaack J. Zawada W.M. Freed C.R. Brain Res. 2002; 926: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38Kanda S. Bishop J.F. Eglitis M.A. Yang Y.

Genet. 2000; 9: 2683-2689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In N27 cells, low levels of DA and the DAT can enhance oxidative stress because of metabolism of DA itself (31Clarkson E.D. La Rosa F.G. Edwards-Prasad J. Weiland D.A. Witta S.E. Freed C.R. Prasad K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 42Olanow C.W. Neurology. 1990; 40: S32-S39PubMed Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of Y39C and Y125C produced greater protein aggregation and apoptosis in N27 cells compared with 293 cells, perhaps because N27 cells are a rat dopaminergic cell line, whereas 293 cells neither synthesize DA nor have the DAT to bring DA into the cell. With additional oxidative stress, we found more protein aggregation and cellular toxicity in N27 cells. Biophysical studies indicate the dimer forming process is the rate-limiting step in α-synuclein aggregation (27Krishnan S. Chi E.Y. Wood S.J. Kendrick B.S. Li C. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Wypych J. Randolph T.W. Narhi L.O. Biere A.L. Citron M. Carpenter J.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Once the accumulation of dimer reaches a critical threshold, protein aggregation progresses rapidly. Eventually, dimer concentrations diminish as dimers are converted to polymers and fibrils (27Krishnan S. Chi E.Y. Wood S.J. Kendrick B.S. Li C. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Wypych J. Randolph T.W. Narhi L.O. Biere A.L. Citron M. Carpenter J.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that elevated oxidative stress can induce dimer and fibril formation, eventually leading to cellular toxicity. We have found some dissociation between dimer formation and cellular toxicity. In the recombinant protein solution chemistry experiment (Fig. 7), only Y39C showed increased dimer formation. This result suggests that Y39C and Y125C proteins may have different sensitivities to oxidative challenge. We used very mild oxidative stress (50 μm H2O2) to induce dimer formation, because this concentration is comparable with the 50 μm DA we used in tissue culture. With high oxidative stress (1.2 m H2O2), Uversky et al. (43Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have found extensive oxidation of all methionine in α-synuclein protein. In experiments with Ad-A53T-Syn and Ad-A30P-Syn, no dimers were found in Western blots, but both mutations caused toxicity and inclusions. It is possible that dimer formation was not needed for protein aggregation. Cell toxicity could be caused by conformational changes and self-assembly by the protofibril and fibril. In Y39C and Y125C mutations, the increased dimer formation could stabilize and accelerate oligomer formation, which could lead to toxic protofibril formation and fibrillogenesis. Thus, the toxicity induced by A53T and A30P mutations might have a different mechanism than the Y39C and Y125C mutations. Recently, Norris et al. (34Norris E.H. Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27230-27240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) reported that nitrative and oxidative stress can lead to different mechanisms for α-synuclein fibrillogenesis. The importance of the site of cysteine substitution to cause α-synuclein toxicity was further shown by the fact that the A53C mutant had no toxicity. The differential toxicity of Y39C and A53C may be related to their positions relative to the 11-mer repeats (XKTKEGVXXXX consensus motif), because Y39 is inside the third repeat, whereas A53 is just outside the fourth repeat (44Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 45Kessler J.C. Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These 11-mer repeats have been proposed to form an α-helix when binding to the membrane (46Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34393-34398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It is possible the Y39C mutation may disrupt the α-helix structure and render the protein more hydrophobic, which could lead to protein aggregation, whereas A53C substitution might not change α-helix structure. On the other hand, the cysteine substitution may cause α-synuclein protein conformational changes by stabilizing the formation of β-sheet structures or promote the misfolding of the protein. In our cell culture model of α-synuclein toxicity, we have found that inclusions contain α-synuclein fibril, because they are positive for thioflavine S staining. Because ubiquitin is not present in α-synuclein-positive inclusions and Ser-129 is not phosphorylated, the inclusions are likely to be composed of α-synuclein protein aggregates, without Lewy body-like structure. We have observed a high correlation between protein aggregation and apoptotic cell death. Cell death was enhanced by added oxidative stress and was probably caused by toxic protofibril formation in the protein aggregation process (47Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar), or by deficits in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (6Dawson T.M. Mandir A.S. Lee M.K. Neuron. 2002; 35: 219-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 48Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although the tyrosine-to-cysteine mutations we have generated are an artificial system not found in patients with PD, this family of mutant proteins provides a molecular model that we have shown is more sensitive to oxidative stress than the native form of α-synuclein. Because stable cysteine dimer can be formed from these proteins, these mutants may be useful for structural assessment by NMR and other chemical methods. We are currently developing and evaluating the Y39C transgenic mouse. We have shown that these novel mutants of α-synuclein produce site-specific cell toxicity as well as dimerization under oxidative stress that leads to protein aggregation and cell death. We thank C.

https://openalex.org/W2034247990,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is a major mediator of stress responses in cells. Similar to other mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), JNK activity is controlled by a cascade of protein kinases and by protein phosphatases, including dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases. Components of the JNK pathway associate with scaffold proteins that modulate their activities and cellular localization. The JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) scaffold protein specifically binds JNK, MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7), and members of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family, and regulates JNK activation in neurons. In this study we demonstrate that distinct regions within the N termini of MKK7 and the MLK family member dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) mediate their binding to JIP-1. We have also identified amino acids in JNK required for: (a) binding to JIP-1 and for JIP-1-mediated JNK activation, (b) docking to MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) and efficient phosphorylation by MKK4, and (c) docking to its substrate c-Jun and efficient c-Jun phosphorylation. None of the amino acids identified were essential for JNK docking to MKK7 or the dual-specificity phosphatase MAPK phosphatase 7 (MKP7). These findings uncover molecular determinants of JIP-1 scaffold complex assembly and demonstrate that there are overlapping, but also distinct, binding determinants within JNK that mediate interactions with scaffold proteins, activators, phosphatases, and substrates."

Here, we characterized the expression of transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) in primary erythroid cells and examined their regulation. Erythroblasts were isolated from the spleens of phenylhydrazine-treated mice, and Epo stimulation resulted in a significant and dose-dependent increase in [Ca]i. Among the classical TRPC channels, expression of three N-terminal splice variants of TRPC2 (clones 14, 17, and α) and of TRPC6 were demonstrated in these erythroblasts by both reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blotting. Confocal microscopy confirmed localization to the plasma membrane. To determine the function of individual TRPC channels in erythropoietin modulation of calcium influx, digital video imaging was used to measure calcium influx through these TRPCs in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell model. Single CHO-S cells, expressing transfected Epo-R, were identified by detection of green fluorescent protein. Cells that express transfected TRPCs were identified by detection of blue fluorescent protein. [Ca]i was monitored with Fura Red. Epo stimulation of CHO-S cells transfected with single TRPC2 isoforms (clone 14, 17, or α) and Epo-R resulted in a significant increase in [Ca]i. This was not observed in cells transfected with Epo-R and TRPC6. In addition, coexpression of TRPC6 with TRPC2 and Epo-R inhibited the increase in [Ca]i observed after Epo stimulation. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that TRPC2 associates with TRPC6, indicating that these TRPCs can form multimeric channels. These data demonstrate that specific TRPCs are expressed in primary erythroid cells and that two of these channels, TRPC2 and TRPC6, can interact to modulate calcium influx stimulated by erythropoietin.

Cells that express transfected TRPCs were identified by detection of blue fluorescent protein. [Ca]i was monitored with Fura Red. Epo stimulation of CHO-S cells transfected with single TRPC2 isoforms (clone 14, 17, or α) and Epo-R resulted in a significant increase in [Ca]i. This was not observed in cells transfected with Epo-R and TRPC6. In addition, coexpression of TRPC6 with TRPC2 and Epo-R inhibited the increase in [Ca]i observed after Epo stimulation. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that TRPC2 associates with TRPC6, indicating that these TRPCs can form multimeric channels. These data demonstrate that specific TRPCs are expressed in primary erythroid cells and that two of these channels, TRPC2 and TRPC6, can interact to modulate calcium influx stimulated by erythropoietin. Erythropoietin (Epo) 1The abbreviations used are: Epo, erythropoietin; Epo-R, Epo receptor; BFP, blue fluorescent protein; CHO-S, Chinese hamster ovary cells (suspension-adapted); TRP, transient receptor potential; TRPC, transient receptor potential channel; RT, reverse transcriptase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; CMV, cytomegalovirus. stimulation of its receptor results in an increase in intracellular calcium in primary erythroid cells, which is mediated through a voltage-independent calcium channel (1Cheung J.Y.

Understanding the regulation of calcium channel gating by erythropoietin as well as other hematopoietic growth factors is of fundamental biological importance. Regulation of intracellular calcium by erythropoietin is an important signaling mechanism controlling the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors and precursors (3Miller B.A. Scaduto Jr., R.C.

However, the signaling pathways through which erythropoietin activation of its receptor modulates calcium influx are largely unknown. A transient receptor potential (TRP) protein superfamily, related to the archetypal Drosophila TRP, has been identified. It consists of a diverse group of calcium-permeable cation channels that are expressed on nonexcitable mammalian cells (20Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 21Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE1PubMed Google Scholar, 22Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The TRP superfamily has been divided into six subfamilies: C, V, M, N, P, and ML (21Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE1PubMed Google Scholar). We studied the classical (C) or short TRPCs because they are voltage-independent calcium-permeable channels that can be agonist-regulated and because erythropoietin modulates calcium influx through one of these channels, TRPC2 (23Chu X. Cheung J.Y. Barber D.L. Birnbaumer L. Rothblum L.I. Conrad K. Abrasonis V. Chan Y.M. Stahl R. Carey D.J. Miller B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34375-34382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All mammalian TRPCs share six putative transmembrane domains similar to the core structure of many pore-forming subunits of voltage-gated channels, except they lack charged residues necessary for the voltage sensor. Individual TRPC channels can be activated both by calcium store depletion-dependent and receptor-operated mechanisms. The physical associations between TRPCs and with other proteins are complex (21Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE1PubMed Google Scholar, 24Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C.

TRPC channels are proposed to assemble as homo- or heterotetrameric ion channels, and the subunit composition influences their biophysical and regulatory properties (21Montell C. Sci.

For many cell types, including primary hematopoietic cells, information about the physiological composition, regulation, and function of the expressed TRPCs is nearly completely lacking. Here, we utilized a murine erythroblast model to study erythropoietin regulation of calcium influx in primary hematopoietic cells (31Hodges V.M. Winter P.C. Lappin T.R. Br. J Haematol. 1999; 106: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1983; 11: 649-660PubMed Google Scholar, 33Barber D.L. Beattie B.K. Mason J.M. Nguyen M.H.H.

Blood. 2002; 99: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Erythropoietin stimulates a significant and dose-dependent increase in [Ca]i in erythroid cells harvested from the spleens of phenylhydrazine-treated mice, and we show expression of three N-terminal splice variants of TRPC2 (clones 14, 17, and α) and TRPC6 in these primary cells with RT-PCR, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Using digital video imaging and transfected CHO-S cells in which the TRPC composition can be controlled, we studied the ability of erythropoietin to modulate calcium influx through N-terminal splice variants of TRPC2. Clones 17 and α lack the first 111 and 287 N-terminal amino acids of clone 14, respectively. Erythropoietin stimulated a significant increase in [Ca]i in cells transfected with all three TRPC2 isoforms but not in cells transfected with TRPC6. When coexpressed, TRPC2 and TRPC6 associated and calcium influx was inhibited, suggesting that TRPC2 and TRPC6 can form a multimeric channel with different regulatory properties than the individual TRPC. This conclusion is given further support by the observation that TRPC2 and TRPC6 coassociate in primary erythroid cells. Tissue and Cell Lines—Brain tissue was obtained from C57Bl/6 mice, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at -80 °C until use. CHO-S cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Generation of Splenic Erythroblasts in Phenylhydrazine-treated Mice—C57Bl/6 mice (8-12 weeks of age) were injected intraperitoneally on days 1 and 2 with phenylhydrazine (60 mg/kg). Mice were sacrificed on day 5 by cervical dislocation, the spleens were removed, and single cell suspensions were prepared (32Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1983; 11: 649-660PubMed Google Scholar, 33Barber D.L. Beattie B.K. Mason J.M. Nguyen M.H.H. Yoakim M. Neel B.G. D'Andrea A.D. Frank D.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To separate splenic erythroid cells into different stages of maturation, the spleen cell suspensions were washed and labeled with Ter-119 Microbeads (10 μl/1 × 107 cells; Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Ter-119- (erythroid progenitors and early precursors) and Ter-119+ cells (more mature nucleated erythroblasts and erythrocytes) were selected by magnetic sorting with the VarioMACS (Miltenyi) (35Kina T. Ikuta K. Takayama E. Wada K. Majumdar A.S. Weissman I.L. Katsura Y. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 109: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Morphological examination of Ter-119- and Ter-119+ cells was performed with Wright’s staining. Immunofluorescent labeling was performed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4, phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8a, phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD11b monoclonal antibodies (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). RT-PCR of TRPC in Murine Tissues and Cell Lines—RNA was prepared from murine brain, and Ter-119- and Ter-119+ erythroblasts. cDNA was prepared from RNA using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Primers were designed for each TRPC based on the coding sequence, and specificity for each TRPC primer set was confirmed using the NCBI data base. PCR was typically performed for 35 cycles (denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45-60 s). The sequences of the 5′ and 3′ primers used for PCR of mTRPC1 to -6 are identical to those reported previously (23Chu X. Cheung J.Y. Barber D.L. Birnbaumer L. Rothblum L.I. Conrad K. Abrasonis V.

Primers for mTRPC7 were as follows: 5′ primer, 5′-AATACGACCACAAGTTCATCGAGA-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CTGTAGAGTTCGGAAGCGATACT-3′. Primers used to distinguish each of the mTRPC2 splice variants were as follows: mTRPC2 α, 5′ primer (5′-ACCTTCCTGGTCCCAGTGCCCTATC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GCAGCTGGGCAATCTCATACAGGTC-3′); mTRPC2 β, 5′ primer (5′-GAGGCAGAGCTGGAGTTCAAGCATTC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GCAGCTGGGCAATCTCATACAGGTC-3′); mTRPC2 clones 14 and 17, 5′ primer (5′-GCCACCATGCTAATGTCCCGCACTG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-TTTGGGCTTACCACACTGGCTGGAG-3′). β-Actin primers were as follows: 5′ primer, 5′-GGACCTGACAGACTACCTCATGAA-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′. Generation of Antibodies Specific to mTRPC2 Isoforms—Three rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated to mTRPC2 and affinity-purified by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). One of these antibodies (anti-TRPC2 c14) was generated to an epitope in the first 100 amino acids unique to the N terminus of mTRPC2 clone 14 (LNQNSTDVLESDPRPWLTN; amino acids 79-98). A second antibody (anti-TRPC2 c17) was generated to an epitope unique to the N terminus of mTRPC2 clone 17 (MGTKTHPVVPW; amino acids 1-11). A third antibody (anti-TRPC2) was prepared to the middle region of mTRPC2 clone 14 (QLSRELRRLARKEPEFKPQY; amino acids 511-530) and recognized mTRPC2 clone 14, 17, and α isoforms. Specificity of the antibodies was confirmed using in vitro translation products prepared with the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI) using cDNAs for mTRPC2 clone 14 (36Vannier B.

Immunoblotting of Whole Cell Lysates and Crude Membrane Preparations—Cell pellets from Ter-119- and Ter-119+ splenic erythroblasts, brain, and CHO-S cells, nontransfected or transfected with mTRPC2 or mTRPC6, were removed from storage at -80 °C. Western blotting was performed following electrophoresis of whole cell lysates on 8% poly-acrylamide gels as previously described (39Zhang M.Y. Harhaj E.W. Bell L. Sun S.C. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with anti-TRPC2 clone 14 (1:500), anti-TRPC2 clone 17 (1:400), anti-TRPC2 (1:300), anti-TRPC6 (1:200; Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel), or anti-mEpo-R (sc697, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. Blots were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000). ECL was used for detection of signal. For crude membrane preparations, cell pellets were suspended in Buffer I (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science) and sonicated. Brain was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer on ice and centrifuged, and Buffer I was then added to the pellet. An equal volume of Buffer II (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm KCl, 20% sucrose, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) was added. The suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Crude membranes were solubilized in buffer containing 62 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol. Protein was quantified, and Western blotting was performed as described above. Immunolocalization of TRPC2 Channels in Primary Erythroid Cells—Ter-119- splenic erythroblasts (3 × 105 cells/chamber) were placed in each well of Lab-Tek Permanox Chamber Slides precoated with fibronectin. After 45 min, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in methanol at -20 °C for 10 min, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Incubation for 10 min in 20% normal goat serum preceded staining with primary antibodies (anti-TRPC2 clone 14, anti-TRPC2, anti-TRPC6, anti-Epo-R; 1:50) for 30 min at room temperature followed by secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min in the dark. Slides were stained with propidium iodide in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired with the Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope.

TRPC2 c14, c17, and TRPC6 were gifts of Dr. Lutz Birnbaumer. CHO-S cells at 50-70% confluence were transfected with these vectors or pTracer-CMV expressing Epo-R using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) or LipofectAMINE 2000 based on recommended transfection protocols (23Chu X. Cheung J.Y. Barber D.L. Birnbaumer L. Rothblum L.I. Conrad K. Abrasonis V. Chan Y.M. Stahl R. Carey D.J. Miller B.A. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation—To determine whether mTRPC2 isoforms interact with mTRPC6, CHO-S cells were transfected with mTRPC2 clone 14 or mTRPC2 α (in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO), mTRPC6 (in pCMV-Tag 2A), or combinations of these vectors. Lysates were prepared from cell pellets with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. Protein lysates were incubated with anti-V5 antibody (4 μg; Invitrogen) for 2-4 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was added for 2-4 h 4 °C with mixing, and immunoprecipitates washed three times. Sample buffer (2×) was then added to the pellet, and the samples were boiled. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-TRPC6, cell lysates were preabsorbed with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) and immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for2hat4 °C. Samples were washed three times, and peptide elution was performed by adding 40 μl of FLAG peptide (at 0.5 mg/ml; Sigma) twice. Western blotting was performed as described above, and blots were probed with anti-V5-HRP (1:1000; Invitrogen), or anti-TRPC6 (1:200) antibodies. For immunoprecipitation studies with Ter-119- erythroblasts, protein lysates were preabsorbed with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads and then incubated with anti-TRPC6 antibody (10 μg) for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were then added for 2 h at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitates were washed. Sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled.

Following isolation and separation with the VarioMACS, Ter-119- and Ter-119+ splenic erythroblasts were incubated in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol for 2-4 h without growth factor. Splenic erythroblasts were then adhered to fibronectin-coated glass coverslips and loaded for 20 min with 0.1 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes). Fura-2-loaded cells were visualized with digital video imaging, and fluorescence was quantitated using the fluorescence intensity ratio (R) of the emission (510 nm) measured following excitation at 350 nm divided by the emission following excitation at 380 nm. Base-line fluorescence intensity ratio (R) and the changes in R of individual cells after stimulation with 0-40 units/ml of recombinant erythropoietin (2000 units/ml; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) were measured. Mature erythrocytes were excluded from analysis of [Ca]i in Ter-119+ cells; most failed to adhere to coverslips or appeared significantly crenated, unlike nucleated cells, which had round cytoplasmic borders and appeared healthy. To study changes in [Ca]i in transfected cells, we were not able to use Fura-2 as the detection fluorophore, because its excitation and emission wavelengths overlap with those of green fluorescent protein. Instead, we used the fluorescent indicator Fura Red (excitation 460 and 490 nm, emission 600-nm, long pass), a dual wavelength excitation probe (41Wu Y. Clusin W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2161-H2169PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kurebayashi N. Harkins A.B. Baylor S.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1934-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We initially calibrated the constants Sf2, Sb2, and the K′D of Fura Red utilizing a KCl-NaCl-Hepes-MgCl2 buffer (100 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7). To measure Rmin, 4 mm EGTA was added to the buffer, and to measure Rmax, 4 mm CaCl2 was added to the buffer. CHO-S cells were loaded for 25 min at 37 °C with 5 μm Fura Red in the presence of Pluronic F-127 to enhance loading. CHO-S cells were then exposed to the Rmin or Rmax buffers, ionomycin (2 μm) was added, and fluorescent measurements were obtained over the next 15 min. We determined Rmin (minimum fluorescence intensity ratio R of the emission following excitation at 460 nm divided by the emission following excitation at 490 nm), Rmax (maximum R), and the constants Sf2/Sb2 so that [Ca]i could be calculated using the formula [Ca]i = K′D((R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R)) (Sf2/Sb2). Transfected CHO-S cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded at 48 h with 5 μm Fura Red for 25 min at 37 °C in the presence of Pluronic F-127. Cells were treated with 0 or 40 units/ml of Epo. [Ca]i was measured at base line and over a 20-min interval following treatment. Statistical significance of results was analyzed with one-way analysis of variance. Erythropoietin Modulation of Calcium Influx in Primary Murine Erythroblasts—Erythropoietin regulation of calcium influx in primary erythroblasts was studied here using a well described murine erythroblast model (31Hodges V.M. Winter P.C. Lappin T.R. Br. J Haematol. 1999; 106: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1983; 11: 649-660PubMed Google Scholar). C57Bl/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with phenylhydrazine on days 1 and 2, and spleens were removed on day 5. Morphological examination of cells following Wright’s staining confirmed that greater than 90% of cells were erythroid precursors, consistent with previous reports (31Hodges V.M. Winter P.C. Lappin T.R. Br. J Haematol. 1999; 106: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1983; 11: 649-660PubMed Google Scholar). To study cells at different stages of erythroid differentiation, splenic erythroblasts separated into Ter-119- and Ter-119+ populations (35Kina T. Ikuta K. Takayama E. Wada K. Majumdar A.S. Weissman I.L. Katsura Y. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 109: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) were examined by Wright’s staining. The Ter-119- population consisted predominantly of large, less mature erythroid precursors (proerythro-blasts and basophilic erythroblasts), whereas the Ter-119+ population consisted predominantly of smaller, more mature erythroid precursors and erythrocytes (35Kina T. Ikuta K. Takayama E. Wada K. Majumdar A.S. Weissman I.L. Katsura Y. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 109: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). There was some overlap in the distribution of erythroblasts at different stages of maturation between cells that sorted as Ter-119- and Ter-119+. Cells were also stained with immunofluorescent antibodies to confirm morphological examination. In contrast to normal spleens in which T cells, B cells, and macrophages represented greater than 90% of"

Protein kinase C (PKC) δ has been implicated as a tumor suppressor that is down-regulated by tumor-promoting phorbol esters in both mouse skin and cell culture models. We report here that the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate prevents DNA damage-induced up-regulation of p53 by down-regulating PKC δ. Regulation of p53 in response to stress most commonly occurs by preventing ubiquitination and degradation of the p53 protein. Surprisingly, suppression of p53 expression by inhibition of PKC δ was caused by the inhibition of p53 synthesis, not increased degradation of p53 protein. Inhibiting PKC δ blocked both basal transcription of the human p53 gene and initiation of transcription from the human p53 promoter. Therefore, the tumor-suppressing effects of PKC δ are mediated at least in part through activating p53 transcription.

Therefore, the tumor-suppressing effects of PKC δ are mediated at least in part through activating p53 transcription. The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a central role in mediating stress and DNA damage-induced growth arrest and apoptosis (1Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2002; 14: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The p53 protein regulates normal responses to DNA damage and other forms of genotoxic stress and is a key element in maintaining genomic stability (2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). In fact, the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently inactivated gene in human malignancy (3Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Presinger C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R. Cleary K. Bigner S.H. Davidson N. Baylin S. Devilee P. Glover T. Collins F.S. Weston A. Modali R. Harris C.C. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1989; 342: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). The level of p53 protein is largely undetectable in normal cells but rapidly increases in response to a variety of stress signals. The mechanism by which the p53 protein is stabilized is not completely understood, but post-translational modification plays a pivotal role (4Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Mutations in the p53 gene are frequently associated with the formation of human cancer; however, the p53 pathway can also be derailed by numerous oncogenic proteins (5Oren M. Damalas A. Gottlieb T. Michael D. Taplick J. Leal J.F. Maya R. Moas M. Seger R. Taya Y. Ben-Ze'ev A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mice engineered to have the p53 gene knocked out develop tumors at an increased rate (6Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). The critical position p53 plays in tumor suppression suggests that many agents may inhibit the p53 pathway as part of the road toward tumor promotion. However, the mechanisms of action of many chemical agents that promote tumor development have not been elucidated. With the central role of p53 in mind, it is logical to presume that agents that promote tumor formation might block the p53 pathway. The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; CPT, camptothecin; DMC, 10-decarbomyl mitomycin C; MC, mitomycin C; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PKC, protein kinase C; siRNA, small interfering RNA; LLnL, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-al; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; CPT, camptothecin; DMC, 10-decarbomyl mitomycin C; MC, mitomycin C; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PKC, protein kinase C; siRNA, small interfering RNA; LLnL, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-al; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. promotes tumor formation in a variety of mice and tissue culture models, and this has been associated with the down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) (7Hansen L.A. Monteiro-Riviere N.A. Smart R.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5740-5745PubMed Google Scholar). TPA is known to activate but then down-regulate the diacylglyceroldependent PKC isoforms (7Hansen L.A. Monteiro-Riviere N.A. Smart R.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5740-5745PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fournier A. Murray A.W. Nature. 1987; 330: 767-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the tumor-promoting activities of TPA are mediated at least in part by down-regulating PKC δ (9Lu Z. Hornia A. Jiang Y.W. Zang Q. Ohno S. Foster D.A. Mol.

Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing PKC δ in their epidermis are resistant to tumor promotion by TPA (13Reddig P.J. Dreckschmidt N.E. Ahrens H. Simsiman R. Tseng C.P. Zou J. Oberley T.D. Verma A.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5710-5718PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that PKC δ is a player in DNA damage response pathways. PKC δ is activated in the DNA damage response by both tyrosine phosphorylation and cleavage of PKC δ to a 40-kDa constitutively active catalytic fragment (14Yoshida K. Miki Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48372-48378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Ren J. Datta R. Shioya H. Li Y. Oki E. Biedermann V. Bharti A. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33758-33765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, downregulation of PKC δ expression by inhibitors and siRNA has been associated with attenuation of the DNA damage-induced response (14Yoshida K. Miki Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48372-48378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Basu A. Woolard M.D. Johnson C.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Many chemotherapeutic drugs work by inducing cell death via the p53 pathway (17Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that TPA can inhibit the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 (18Magnelli L. Cinelli M. Chiarugi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Magnelli L. Cinelli M. Chiarugi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Moreover, other studies with protein kinase inhibitors have suggested that PKC δ regulates the p53 pathway (20Ghosh J.C. Suzuki K. Kodama S. Watanabe M. J. Radiat. Res. (Tokyo). 1999; 40: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Heit I. Wieser R.J. Herget T. Faust D. Borchert-Stuhltrager M. Oesch F. Dietrich C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5143-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined the effect of PKC δ on p53 protein and gene expression and report that PKC δ is required for the basal transcription of the p53 gene. These results are discussed in the context of the tumor promotion by phorbol esters. Reagents—Camptothecin, propidium iodide, and the calpain inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-al (LLnL) were purchased from Sigma. Etoposide, rottlerin, and TPA were purchased from Calbiochem. Zeocin was purchased from Invitrogen. RPMI 1640 and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. D. M. Vyas (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) supplied MC. DMC was synthesized from MC as previously described (22Kim S.Y. Rockwell S. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 39-47Google Scholar). Trizol reagent was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Bryostatin 1 was purchased from LC Laboratories. Actinomycin D was purchased from Calbiochem and was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cell Culture—The ML-1 (with wild-type p53) cells were a generous gift from Michael Kastan. K562 (with no p53 expression) and MCF-7 (with wild-type p53) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The H460 and H1299 cells were provided by Arnold J. Levine and were used as another model to compare cells with and without p53 (23Su F. Overholtzer M. Besser D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All cell lines (with the exception of MCF-7) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2 and were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105/ml, and exponentially growing cells were used in all experiments. MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% calf serum. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was carried out on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Cells were spun down at 2300 rpm for 7 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm Na2HPO4), and resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3. Ethanol (9 ml) was then added dropwise while vortexing. Propidium iodide staining and RNase treatment were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min 24 h prior to flow cytometry. Protein Extract Preparation—Protein extracts were prepared using a variation on the Dignam protocol (24Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Cells were spun down and resuspended in 5 packed cell pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). They were then put on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 2 packed cell pellet volumes of buffer A (volume prior to the initial wash). The cells were run through a 25-gauge needle twice, and nuclei were then spun down at 2,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C followed by an additional 20-min spin at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was saved as our cytoplasmic extract. The pellet was resuspended at 109 cells per 3 ml of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) by running it through a 25-gauge needle twice. The suspension was rocked gently for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with either a mixture of monoclonal antibodies specific to p53 (1801, 240, and 421 supernatant), a monoclonal anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody (Pharmingen), monoclonal anti-PKC δ antibody (SC-937) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p21 antibody (Cell Signaling), or anti-actin (Sigma). Signals were visualized after incubation with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Extraction and Northern blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer. Total RNA (10 or 50 μg) was resolved on a denaturing formaldehyde gel and electrotransferred overnight on a nylon membrane. The membrane was incubated with 10 ml of prehybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h, and radiolabeled probes were added directly to the prehybridization buffer for 24 h. The membranes were then washed twice in 2× SSC buffer at 65 °C with shaking for 5 min each followed by another wash with 1X SSC buffer at 65 °C with shaking for 15 min and twice in 0.1× SSC buffer at 65 °C with shaking for 5 min each. The signal was visualized by autoradiography. Quantitative RT-PCR—For each sample, 3 μg of total RNA obtained with TRIZOL (Sigma) were used for cDNA synthesis using the high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems). 3 μl of the RT products were used for PCR amplification. The TaqMan primer probes for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and p53 were obtained from Applied Biosystems Assays-on-demand. The manufacturer’s conditions were followed for TaqMan PCR with an Applied Biosystems 5700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). One cycle of 50 °C UNG incubation for 2 min and 94 °C priming for 10 min was followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 15 s and 60 °C annealing for 1 min. Fluorescence was measured during the annealing step and plotted automatically for each sample. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—The wild type p53-expressing SN3 plasmid was obtained from Bert Vogelstein (25Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The GFP-PKC δ (K-R)-expressing plasmid is a kinase-negative mutant in which the lysine residue at position 378 in the putative ATP-binding site has been substituted with arginine by site-directed mutagenesis and cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid pRL-TK was purchased from Promega. The human P1-p53 promoter was a generous gift from David Reisman (26Durland-Busbice S. Reisman D. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 2165-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the human P2-mdm2 promoter was cloned into pGL2-Basic (Promega), a generous gift from Gareth Bond and Arnold Levine. H460 and H1299 cells were used as model for p53 present and absent cell lines grown as described above, and subconfluent cultures were transiently transfected with the various plasmid constructs using the LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer. For transfection of the various siRNA constructs, 50% confluent cultures were transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer’s indications (Invitrogen). The siRNA duplexes were obtained from Qiagen (14Yoshida K. Miki Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48372-48378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). siRNA targeting GFP mRNA (Qiagen) was used as a negative control. Transiently transfected cells were harvested and analyzed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s indications. Luciferase activity was assayed using a Luminoskan reader. TPA Inhibits Apoptosis in Cells with Wild-type p53 but Not in Cells Lacking p53—We demonstrated previously that TPA, by virtue of down-regulation of PKC δ, provides a survival signal that prevents apoptosis (12Zhong M. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the survival signals generated by TPA involved p53, we examined the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced apoptosis in human cancer cell lines with (27Kastan M.B. Radin A.I. Kuerbitz S.J. Onyekwere O. Wolkow C.A. Civin C.I. Stone K.D. Woo T. Ravindranath T. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4279-4286PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ramet M. Castren K. Jarvinen K. Pekkala K. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Soini Y. Paakko P. Vahakangas K. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and without wild type p53 (29Law J.C. Ritke M.K. Yalowich J.C. Leder G.H. Ferrell R.E. Leuk. Res. 1993; 17: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The DNA-damaging agents CPT, MC, and DMC induced apoptosis of the human myeloid leukemia cell line ML-1 (which has wild type p53), as demonstrated by the cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP, which is widely used as an indicator of apoptosis (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 5, and 7) (30Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). However, when ML-1 cells were pretreated with TPA for 24 h, PARP cleavage induced by the DNA-damaging agents was almost completely inhibited for CPT and MC (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 6). Similar data were obtained using flow cytometry where the CPT-induced appearance of sub-G1 DNA was also prevented by TPA treatment (data not shown). TPA was also able to inhibit the CPT- and MC-induced apoptosis of a number of other cell lines expressing wild-type p53 including LnCAP, H460, and MCF-7 (data not shown and Fig. 3D). Whereas CPT and MC require p53 in order to mediate significant apoptosis, DMC in addition to activating the p53 pathway is also able to induce apoptosis in the absence of p53 (31Abbas T. Olivier M. Lopez J. Houser S. Xiao G. Kumar G.S. Tomasz M. Bargonetti J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40513-40519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When a similar experiment was performed with K562 cells, which lack p53, the DNA-damaging agent DMC induced significant PARP cleavage; however, TPA treatment had no effect upon PARP cleavage in these cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). Modest PARP cleavage was also induced by CPT and MC in the K562 cells, and this cleavage was similarly unaffected by TPA treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–6). A further demonstration of the lack of TPA inhibition of p53-independent apoptosis is shown in Fig. 1C, where neither the DMC-induced apoptosis of H460 cells (containing wild-type p53) or H1299 cells (without wild-type p53) were rescued by TPA pretreatment. The mechanism of action of DMC is under current investigation. Interestingly, we observed that TPA was able to partially rescue DMC-induced apoptosis in ML-1 cells (Fig. 1A). At this time, we do not know why TPA is able to inhibit DMC-induced apoptosis of ML-1 cells, but this does not detract from our finding that in cell lines that do not have p53, apoptosis is not inhibited by TPA.Fig. 3Pharmacological inhibition or down-regulation of PKC δ specifically inhibits DNA damage-induced p53 protein stabilization and protects against p53-dependent apoptosis. A, the effect of TPA and bryostatin 1 upon DNA damage-induced PARP cleavage and p53 levels in MCF-7 cells was determined by Western blot analysis as in Fig. 2. Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells either left untreated (lane 1), treated with 1 μm CPT for 16 h (lane 2), or pretreated with TPA (400 nm) for 24 h prior to the CPT treatment (lane 3) or pretreated with both 400 nm TPA and bryostatin 1 (1 μm) for 24 h (lane 4) prior to treatment with CPT. B, extracts from MCF-7 cells as shown above were also analyzed by Western blot for PKC δ. C, the ability of rottlerin to inhibit ML-1 cell apoptosis was examined by florescence-activated cell sorting. Exponentially growing ML-1 cells were either treated with 6 μm rottlerin or with 0.5 μm PCT in the presence or absence of 6 μm rottlerin for 4 h. D, the ability of rottlerin to inhibit the DNA damage-induced stabilization of p53 in ML-1 cells was examined by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts. The level of p21 expression was also monitored as indicated. Exponentially growing cells were either left untreated (lanes 1 and 2) or treated with 0.5 μm CPT (lanes 3 and 4), 8 μm etoposide (lanes 5 and 6), 50 μg/ml zeocin (lanes 7 and 8), or 5 μm MC (lanes 9 and 10) for 4 h in the presence or absence of 6 μm rottlerin. E, the corresponding cytoplasmic extracts were also examined. DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our data implicated that p53 was involved in the TPAmediated rescue from apoptosis. We were interested in the kinetics of the rescue by TPA. We examined the kinetics of the TPA-induced prevention of CPT-induced PARP cleavage in ML-1 cells, and, as shown in Fig. 1D, prevention of CPTinduced PARP cleavage can begin to be detected between 6 and 9 h. This kinetics is important, because TPA treatment is known to initially activate PKC δ, but over time depletion of cellular PKC δ levels occurs via the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (9Lu Z. Hornia A. Jiang Y.W. Zang Q. Ohno S. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3418-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lu Z. Liu D. Hornia A. Devonish W. Pagano M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Therefore, we went on to examine the relationship between this TPA-mediated inhibition of apoptosis and the depletion of PKC δ to the ability of DNA-damaging drugs to induce p53 protein accumulation. DNA Damage-induced Stabilization of p53 Is Inhibited by the Depletion and Inhibition of PKC δ—To further our investigation of the influence of TPA on the p53 pathway, DNA damage-induced p53 was compared in the presence and absence of TPA. ML-1 cells were pretreated with TPA for increasing times, and the influence on the induction of p53 was observed by Western blot analysis. Treatment of ML-1 cells with 0.5 μm CPT rapidly induces nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Pretreatment of ML-1 cells with 10 nm TPA for 6 h or longer inhibited CPT-induced p53 accumulation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–9). The ability of TPA to inhibit p53 nuclear accumulation was not due to a change in p53 shuttling, since after TPA pretreatment there was no detectable accumulation of cytoplasmic p53 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, PKC δ is largely depleted by 6 h of TPA treatment in the ML-1 cells. The kinetics of PKC δ depletion slightly preceded the disappearance of p53 induction observed in Fig. 2A (compare lanes 4–9 for A and B), consistent with the inhibition of p53 induction being due to the depletion of PKC δ. Also shown in Fig. 2B is the CPT-induced appearance of the 40-kDa catalytically active fragment of PKC δ. This 40-kDa fragment is associated with apoptosis, and this catalytic fragment is equally depleted by TPA pretreatment (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5) (15Ren J. Datta R. Shioya H. Li Y. Oki E. Biedermann V. Bharti A. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33758-33765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of ML-1 cells with TPA also inhibited the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 by MC, DMC, and zeocin (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the effect of TPA on p53 nuclear accumulation was able to block different DNA damage sensor pathways evoked by different drugs. Once again, depletion of PKC δ correlated with the block of p53 accumulation (Fig. 2D). This was not a cell type-specific phenomenon, since the same correlation between the inhibition of p53 accumulation and PKC δ depletion was observed when H460 cells were treated with MC, DMC, and zeocin (Fig. 2, E and F). To further investigate whether the effect of TPA on p53 and p53-dependent apoptosis was in fact dependent on the ability of TPA to down-regulate PKC δ, we took advantage of the observation that bryostatin 1 can specifically prevent the downregulation of PKC δ by TPA in certain cell lines under specific conditions (9Lu Z. Hornia A. Jiang Y.W. Zang Q. Ohno S. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3418-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, which also has wild type p53 (28Ramet M. Castren K. Jarvinen K. Pekkala K. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Soini Y. Paakko P. Vahakangas K. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, CPT strongly induced PARP cleavage, which was completely inhibited by TPA pretreatment for 24 h. Importantly, the effect of TPA was overcome by bryostatin 1 (Fig. 3A). Bryostatin 1 has been shown to prevent the tumor-promoting effects of TPA in a number of cell lines (9Lu Z. Hornia A. Jiang Y.W. Zang Q. Ohno S. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3418-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3B, the addition of bryostatin 1 to MCF-7 cells was able to reverse the TPA-mediated depletion of PKC δ. Additionally, the TPA-mediated inhibition of p53 accumulation was rescued in the presence of bryostatin 1. Thus, the antiapoptotic effect of TPA in the MCF-7 cells was probably due to the down-regulation of PKC δ. Rottlerin is a compound that has been widely used to inhibit PKC δ (14Yoshida K. Miki Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48372-48378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Basu A. Woolard M.D. Johnson C.L.

Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of rottlerin upon the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 in ML-1 cells. This inhibition of PKC δ activity resulted in the inhibition of CPTmediated apoptosis as indicated by the lack of sub-G1 DNA content observed in the florescence-activated cell sorting analysis of cells treated with CPT together with rottlerin (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the hypothesis that PKC δ was required for p53 accumulation, the specific PKC δ inhibitor, rottlerin, blocked the accumulation of p53 in response to several DNAdamaging agents (Fig. 3D). This inhibition of p53 accumulation by rottlerin was evident in both the cytoplasmic as well as the nuclear extract (Fig. 3, D and E), demonstrating that the inhibition of p53 accumulation does not result from a change in p53 transport. Treatment of ML-1 cells with the conventional PKC isotype-specific inhibitor GO6976 (11Hornia A. Lu Z. Sukezane T. Zhong M. Joseph T. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had no effect on p53 induction by DNA-damaging agents (data not shown), indicating that down-regulation of conventional PKC isoforms does not play a role in the effects observed here. These data suggest that the ability to suppress p53 accumulation is mediated by the inhibition of PKC δ. Stabilization of p53 by Proteosome Inhibitors Is Blocked by TPA Treatment and Pharmacological Inhibition of PKC δ —The increase in the level of p53 after DNA damage has been demonstrated to occur at the post-transcriptional level, although some regulation of p53 at the level of transcription has been observed (34Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 35Kirch H.C. Flaswinkel S. Rumpf H. Brockmann D.

The ubiquitin proteosome pathway is involved in the degradation of p53, and after DNA damage the p53 protein is post-translationally modified so that it is no longer targeted for degradation (37Ashcroft M. Taya Y. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The levels of p53 can therefore be increased chemically by using inhibitors of the proteosome pathway (4Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar, 38Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appela E. Kastan M.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31819-31824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if TPA pretreatment of cells was inhibiting stabilization of p53 through increased degradation of the protein, then chemical inhibition of the proteosome pathway would be able to increase p53 levels even after the cells were pretreated with TPA. However, surprisingly, we observed that TPA pretreatment of ML-1 cells completely inhibited the ability of the proteosome inhibitor LLnL to stabilize p53 (Fig. 4A). Similarly, rottlerin was also able to prevent p53 accumulation induced by proteosome inhibition (Fig. 4B), implicating a requirement of PKC δ for synthesis of p53. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of TPA and PKC δ inhibition on p53 protein accumulation was apparently not due to enhanced p53 degradation by a proteosome-mediated proteolysis pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1978425774,"The folding of β-structured, fibrous proteins is a largely unexplored area. A class of such proteins is used by viruses as adhesins, and recent studies revealed novel β-structured motifs for them. We have been studying the folding and assembly of adenovirus fibers that consist of a globular C-terminal domain, a central fibrous shaft, and an N-terminal part that attaches to the viral capsid. The globular C-terminal, or “head” domain, has been postulated to be necessary for the trimerization of the fiber and might act as a registration signal that directs its correct folding and assembly. In this work, we replaced the head of the fiber by the trimerization domain of the bacteriophage T4 fibritin, termed “foldon.” Two chimeric proteins, comprising the foldon domain connected at the C-terminal end of four fiber shaft repeats with or without the use of a natural linker sequence, fold into highly stable, SDS-resistant trimers. The structural signatures of the chimeric proteins as seen by CD and infrared spectroscopy are reported. The results suggest that the foldon domain can successfully replace the fiber head domain in ensuring correct trimerization of the shaft sequences.

The results suggest that the foldon domain can successfully replace the fiber head domain in ensuring correct trimerization of the shaft sequences. Biological implications and implications for engineering highly stable, β-structured nanorods are discussed. Natural fibrous folds in proteins include collagen triple helices, α-helical coiled coils, or β-structured motifs (1Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 2Jenkins J. Pickersgill R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 111-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Collagen and coiled coils remain well studied structural paradigms in the field of folding studies of fibrous proteins. However, many fewer studies have been done on the folding of elongated, β-structured proteins that very often are used by viruses as their attachment organelles; recent studies revealed novel structural motifs for these proteins (3Mitraki A. Miller S. van Raaij M.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Weigele P.R. Scanlon E. King J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4022-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We use such a viral adhesin, the fiber protein of adenoviruses, as a model system to study folding and assembly of that class of proteins. The fiber is a homotrimeric protein (each monomer contains 582 amino acids) embedded into the viral capsid with a short, N-terminal part (about 45 residues). Its C-terminal, globular head domain is responsible for cell attachment. A central shaft domain contains a repeating sequence motif with an invariant glycine or proline and a conserved pattern of hydrophobic residues (5Green N.M. Wrigley N.G. Russell W.C. Martin S.R. McLachlan A.D. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Ruigrok R.W. Barge A. Albiges-Rizo C. Dayan S. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The shaft from serotype 2 is 30 nm long, featuring 22 such repeats. The trimeric native fiber is resistant to proteases, heat, and to SDS at 4 °C (7Devaux C. Caillet-Boudin M.L. Jacrot B. Boulanger P. Virology. 1987; 161: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Mitraki A. Barge A. Chroboczek J. Andrieu J.P. Gagnon J. Ruigrok R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This SDS resistance serves as the most reliable tool to assess correct folding and trimerization (8Mitraki A. Barge A. Chroboczek J. Andrieu J.P. Gagnon J. Ruigrok R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At 4 °C, trimers migrate slowly in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and can be distinguished easily from partially folded or misfolded forms that migrate in the monomer position. The trimer band chases to the monomer band only upon boiling. In the presence of SDS at ambient temperatures, the full-length trimer starts to unfold from its N terminus. Under these conditions, a fragment of the protein comprising the head and four shaft repeats has been identified and proved to be SDS- and protease-resistant (8Mitraki A. Barge A. Chroboczek J. Andrieu J.P. Gagnon J. Ruigrok R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this stable fragment revealed a novel folding motif for the shaft sequences, termed the “triple β-spiral” (9van Raaij M.J. Mitraki A. Lavigne G. Cusack S. Nature. 1999; 401: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A β-propeller conformation for the globular head domain has already been reported in earlier studies (10Xia D. Henry L.J. Gerard R.D. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1994; 2: 1259-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 11van Raaij M.J. Louis N. Chroboczek J. Cusack S. Virology. 1999; 262: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One natural question in the folding of rod-like molecules that contain repetitive sequences is how to avoid mismatched structures during folding and assembly. It has been established that collagens use noncollagenous domains at their C-terminal ends which act as nucleation points and ensure correct chain registration, preventing misfolded structures (12McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Hulmes D.J.S. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Registration motifs are also used by other fibrous proteins. In the case of phage T4 fibritin, a 27-amino acid C-terminal domain termed “foldon” serves as a registration motif for the segmented, triple coiled coil motif of the fibritin (14Tao Y. Strelkov S.V. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Rossmann M.G. Structure. 1997; 5: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This small domain in a β-propeller conformation can fold and trimerize autonomously (15Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bachinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It has been reported that fibritins with a deleted or mutated foldon domain fail to fold correctly, whereas N-terminal deletion mutants with an intact foldon domain trimerize successfully (16Letarov A.V. Londer Y.Y. Boudko S.P. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). It has been noticed long ago by the virology community that N-terminal deletions of the adenovirus fiber as well as the globular head alone can fold and trimerize correctly both inside eukaryotic and bacterial cells (17Novelli A. Boulanger P.A. Virology. 1991; 185: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Hong J.S. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7071-7078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Henry L.J. Xia D. Wilke M.E. Deisenhofer J. Gerard R.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Louis N. Fender P. Barge A. Kitts P. Chroboczek J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4104-4106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, C-terminal deletions or mutations in the head domain prevented correct folding and assembly of the full-length fiber in vivo. Furthermore, a 41-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to shaft sequences 354–396 that are immediately adjacent to the head failed to fold into the triple β-spiral conformation; instead, it polymerized into amyloid fibrils (21Luckey M. Hernandez J. Arlaud G. Forsyth V.T. Ruigrok R.W. Mitraki A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, isolated shaft segments of any length fail to trimerize when produced in either recombinant or synthetic form (17Novelli A. Boulanger P.A. Virology. 1991; 185: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Hong J.S. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7071-7078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Luckey M. Hernandez J. Arlaud G. Forsyth V.T. Ruigrok R.W. Mitraki A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Taking this evidence into account, it has been postulated that the globular head is required for correct folding and assembly of the fiber and might play a registration role similar to other trimerization domains. To understand the folding and trimerization mechanisms of the fiber, one approach we took was to replace the head domain with a smaller trimerization motif, namely the foldon, prompted by recent reports on its successful use as a foreign trimerization motif. It has been indeed shown that the foldon can successfully play a trimerizing and stabilizing role when fused with other fibrous motifs such as collagen sequences, phage T4 short tail fibers, and human immunodeficiency virus glycoproteins (15Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bachinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Miroshnikov K.A.

Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins of a fibritin fragment comprising the foldon domain and part of the coiled coil domain with the two most N-terminal repeats of the adenovirus shaft have also been reported to be correctly folded and trimeric (24Krasnykh V. Belousova N. Korokhov N. Mikheeva G. Curiel D.T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4176-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this work, we used the adenovirus fiber stable fragment (residues 319–582), whose structure has been reported previously (9van Raaij M.J. Mitraki A. Lavigne G. Cusack S. Nature. 1999; 401: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), as a minimal working model. This stable fragment comprises the shaft residues 319–392, a flexible linker sequence (residues 393–398) and the globular head (residues 399–582). Three chimeric proteins were constructed, two comprising the shaft segment (residues 319–392) with the foldon domain in its C-terminal end (in replacement of the natural head domain) and one with the foldon domain in the N-terminal end of the shaft segment. In one of the chimeric proteins with the foldon at the C-terminal end, the natural linker sequence (Asn-Lys-Asn-Asp-Asp-Lys, residues 393–398) that connects the globular head to the shaft was used to connect the shaft sequences to the foldon domain. In the second, as well as in the protein with the foldon at its N-terminal end, the two domains were joined together without incorporating the linker sequence. We show below that the proteins with the foldon domain at their C-terminal end are expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli and form highly stable, SDS-resistant trimers. We have subsequently purified the chimeric protein with the linker sequence and characterized it by circular dichroism, infrared spectroscopy, and protease-resistance experiments. The ensemble of our results suggests that the foldon domain can lead to efficient formation of SDS- and protease-resistant trimers when appended to the C terminus of the fiber shaft sequences. We finally discuss common themes in the registration mechanisms of fibrous proteins and the potential use of the fibritin domain for engineering β-structured nanorods. E. coli Strains and Plasmids—The strain DH5α (Invitrogen) was used for the selection of recombinant clones and plasmid DNA production. Protein expression was performed in the strain JM109(DE3) (Promega) which contains the λ-lysogen DE3 encoding the T7 RNA polymerase under control of the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible lacUV5 promoter. DNA fragments were cloned in the pT7.7 vector that allows transcription from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and contains the ribosome-binding site for effective translation in the cell (25Tabor S.

Construction of the Genetic Clones—A fragment coding for the stable recombinant fragment of the adenovirus fiber comprising residues 319–582 was obtained by PCR with priming oligonucleotide A (Table I) designed to create an NdeI restriction site overlapping the start codon and oligonucleotide B designed to create a BamHI restriction site. The PCR was performed using the Pwo polymerase purchased from Roche. The plasmid pTaq as described in Ref. 20Louis N. Fender P. Barge A. Kitts P. Chroboczek J. J.

The shaft segment plus the natural linker (residues Val319–Lys398 of the fiber) was amplified between primers C and D using the same template. The gene encoding the foldon domain (residues Gly457–Leu483 of fibritin) was PCR amplified between primers F and G using bacteriophage T4 DNA obtained from Sigma as a template. The generation of the BamHI site results in the addition of two residues, Gly and Ser, at the N-terminal end of the foldon, which are not part of the coding sequence. Finally, for the construction of the clone containing the foldon domain at the N-terminal end of the shaft, the foldon domain (Gly457–Leu483) was amplified between primers H and I and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pT7.7 plasmid. The shaft segment (Val319–Gly392) was amplified between primers J and K into sites BamHI and ClaI of the same plasmid. Between the two segments, three residues, Gly-Ser-Gly, are introduced because of the cloning strategy In all cases the amplification was performed for 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s annealing at 60 °C, and 45 s extension at 72 °C. The amplified DNA fragments were isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis in 4% Nusieve GTG agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The purified bands and pT7.7 vector were digested for 1 h 30 min at 37 °C with restriction endonucleases purchased from Roche Applied Science. The digested DNA was purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Inserts and vector were ligated enzymatically using the Roche Rapid DNA Ligation Kit in a 1:3 ratio. The ligation mixture was transformed into DH5α-competent cells by incubation for 30 min on ice followed by a temperature heat shock at 42 °C for 2 min. The transformed bacteria were plated on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When colonies were visible (approximately after 16 h at 37 °C), they were cultured overnight in 5 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested and the plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). After digestion of the purified plasmid DNA, positive clones were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and were sequenced by the company Genome Express (Grenoble, France) using the T7 universal primer. Protein Expression—Cells of the JM109(DE3) bacterial strain were transformed with 200 ng of the respective vector and plated on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose. Single colonies were grown overnight in 10 ml of LB medium supplemented with 330 mm sorbitol, 2.5 mm betaine hydrochloride, 1% glucose, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C (26Blackwell J.R. Horgan R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The next day, the starter culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 330 mm sorbitol, 2.5 mm betaine hydrochloride, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were grown at 37 °C until the A600 nm reached 0.4, then cooled to 22 °C. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a 0.5 mm final concentration, and the incubation was continued further for 14 h at 22 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and then resuspended in 20 ml of Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl) containing a tablet of Roche Complete™ protease inhibitors. The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell; pellet-supernatant fractionations were performed by centrifugation at 43,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Protein Purification—The chimeric protein with the foldon domain at its C-terminal end and the linker sequence was purified as follows. After French pressure cell passage and removal of the insoluble material, streptomycin sulfate (Sigma) was added to the supernatant of the lysate to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) to precipitate nucleic acids. The protein solution was kept on ice for 15 min with continuous stirring. After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant (with vigorous mixing) to a final concentration of 60% saturation. The solution was incubated for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 43,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was recovered, and precipitation by ammonium sulfate was repeated going up to 80% saturation. The protein precipitate was dissolved in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA and dialyzed against the same buffer in the cold room. The protein solution was loaded onto a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The protein was eluted with a gradient of 0–200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and brought to 1.7 m ammonium sulfate. The protein solution was dialyzed against a phosphate buffer (25 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, pH 6.5) and applied to a phenyl-Superose 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences). For elution, a linear gradient of 1.7–0.0 m ammonium sulfate was applied; the protein eluted at about 1.5 m. The purified protein was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation and stored at 4 °C. The original adenovirus stable fragment as well as the globular head domain were purified as described previously (27Lortat-Jacob H. Chouin E. Cusack S. van Raaij M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9009-9015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The identities of all proteins produced in this study were confirmed with N-terminal amino acid sequencing, using standard procedures as described previously (8Mitraki A. Barge A. Chroboczek J. Andrieu J.P. Gagnon J. Ruigrok R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The specific absorption coefficient of the purified chimeric protein with the foldon at the C-terminal end and the linker sequence was determined by UV spectroscopy combined with in-house quantitative amino acid composition analysis. The protein concentration was subsequently determined by UV spectroscopy using a specific absorption coefficient A280 nm0.1\%, 1 cm, of 0.89. Cell-free Expression of Chimeric Proteins and Immunoblotting—The Rapid Translation System (RTS 500) E. coli Circular Template Kit, supplied by Roche Applied Science, was also used for the cell-free expression of the chimeric proteins with the foldon at the C-terminal end (with and without linker). The lyophilized components of the kit were reconstituted according to the product instructions using the ready-to-use buffer solution supplemented with 10 mm EGTA and one tablet of Complete™ mini-EDTA-free. 15 μg of plasmid DNA was used for a 1-ml reaction. For the coexpression of the two proteins, 7.5 μg of each plasmid was added to the 1-ml reaction mixture. The RTS Instrument was set to 22 °C with a stirring speed of 120 rpm. After 96 h of incubation a 5-μl aliquot was removed, electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) at 12 V overnight under nondenaturing conditions. Both SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic transfer were performed at 4 °C. After transfer the blot was soaked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% powdered milk and 1% Tween 20, followed by incubation with an anti-fiber polyclonal antibody for 2 h. To probe the primary antibody, alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit Ig (Sigma) was used. The color reaction for alkaline phosphatase was developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The membrane was rinsed with distilled water and air dried. The same immunoblotting procedure was used for total E. coli lysates. Dual color precision plus protein standards (Bio-Rad) were used. Protease Digestion—Chymotrypsin (sequencing grade from bovine pancreas, Roche Applied Science) was added to a purified protein solution (0.3 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer, 1 mm EDTA) at a 1:10 ratio w/w, in the presence or absence of 0.1% SDS. One sample of the protein, containing 0.1% SDS, was also boiled for 4 min prior to protease digestion. Digestions were carried out at 22 °C. At determined times, 10-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with 5 μl of 3× concentrated loading buffer (28King J. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 62: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) (to give a final SDS concentration of 2%) and frozen at -20 °C to stop the reaction. The resulting samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, without prior boiling, and visualized with Coomassie Blue staining. The same protocol was followed with endoproteinase Glu-C, also obtained from Roche Applied Science. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD measurements were performed on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostated cell holder, using a quartz cell of 1.0-mm path length. Spectra were recorded at 22 °C over the wavelength range of 250–195 nm at 0.5-nm intervals and corrected for the contribution of the buffer. Each spectrum is the average of 30 scans. 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was used for all proteins, and protein concentrations were as follows: 2.65 μm for the chimeric protein and 1.86 μm for the stable fiber fragment and the globular head domain. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—FTIR 1The abbreviation used is: FTIR, Fourier transform infrared. spectra were collected on a JASCO 610 Fourier transform spectrometer. The protein was dissolved in D2O at a final concentration of 0.86 mm and placed between a pair of CaF2 windows (Spectra tech) separated by a 100-μm spacer. 1,000 interferograms were accumulated at 22 °C at a spectral resolution of 4 cm-1. The water vapor spectrum was subtracted from the protein spectrum. The second derivative of the amide I band was used to identify the different spectral components. The second derivative was calculated using JASCO software with a window of seven points. The fit of the sum of the various components detected in the second derivative spectrum to the raw data was performed with the curve fitting software provided by JASCO. The area under each component was used to estimate the percentage of the various secondary structures. We made the assumption that the extinction coefficient was the same for each type of secondary structure. Design of the Chimeric Proteins—In designing the chimeric proteins the structural compatibility of the two parts (the shaft domain residues 319–392 and the fibritin foldon domain residues 457–483) must be considered and, if necessary, linkers used to avoid potential structural conflicts. Inspection of the crystal structures revealed that the three Gly392 residues of the fiber shaft lie on a triangle with sides of 13.5 Å, and the three Gly457 residues of the foldon domain lie on a triangle with sides of 12.5 Å. These values are close enough to ensure a priori a compatibility. The schematic representations of the various constructs that we decided to build are shown in Fig. 1A. Construct 1 depicts the original adenovirus stable fragment, comprising the shaft segment (residues 319–392), the natural linker sequence (residues 393–398, Asn-Lys-Asn-Asp-Asp-Lys) that connects the shaft to the fiber head, and the globular head (residues 399–582). There is no clearly defined electron density for the natural linker in the crystal structure of the stable fragment (9van Raaij M.J. Mitraki A. Lavigne G. Cusack S. Nature. 1999; 401: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and the crystallographic axis of the shaft is tilted by 2° relative to the axis of the head, suggesting that the linker ensures flexibility of the two domains relative to each other. In construct 2, the foldon domain was joined to the C-terminal end of the shaft with the natural linker sequence. Apart from this linker, this construct also contains an additional Gly-Ser sequence as a consequence of inserting the BamHI site. In construct 3, the foldon domain was joined to the C-terminal end of the shaft domain with just the Gly-Ser insert; this construct will be referred to as having no linker from here on. For the chimeric protein that has the foldon domain at the N terminus of the shaft domain (construct 4), no linker sequence was used; three additional amino acids (Gly-Ser-Gly) were introduced between the domains as a consequence of the cloning strategy. The amino acid sequences of the shaft and the foldon domains are shown in Fig. 1B. Expression of the Chimeric Proteins in E. coli—Fig. 2 depicts supernatants of E. coli lysates for the two chimeric proteins with the foldon domain at the C terminus. For comparison, the supernatant of a lysate of the original fiber stable fragment (residues 319–582) is shown (lanes 1 and 2). This original stable fragment is expressed in soluble form and it is SDS-resistant: the trimer, migrating at an apparent molecular mass of about 70 kDa (lane 1), dissociates to its monomeric form (apparent mass of 28 kDa, lane 2) only after boiling. The supernatant of the chimeric protein with the linker, nonboiled and boiled, is shown in lanes 3 and 4, respectively. The protein is produced in soluble form that migrates at an apparent molecular mass compatible with a trimer, i.e. about 33 kDa. After 3 min of boiling in 2% SDS, a substantial part of the chains still migrates in the position of the trimer, indicating a remarkable stability of the protein. The chimeric protein without the linker sequence migrates, as expected, slightly lower than the linker-containing protein in the nonboiled sample (lane 5) and still appears stable to SDS, although less so compared with the linker-containing protein because a greater percentage of chains is dissociated upon boiling (lane 6). The boiled forms of both chimeric proteins migrate at positions expected from their monomer theoretical molecular masses of 11,514 and 10,800 Da for the linker and nonlinker protein, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the chimeric proteins not only can fold properly in E. coli, but are also remarkably resistant to the combined heat and SDS action. The enhanced production of the chimeric proteins relative to the original fragment is also noteworthy. Oligomerization State of the Chimeric Proteins—In their oligomeric and nondissociated forms, SDS-resistant proteins do not bind SDS efficiently and do not migrate as normal SDS-polypeptide complexes; as a result, very often they migrate anomalously in SDS-polyacrylamide gels depending on their shape, overall charge, and eventual degree of unfolding (8Mitraki A.

The Pdr15p ABC protein is the closest homologue of the multidrug efflux transporter Pdr5p, which mediates pleiotropic drug resistance to hundreds of unrelated compounds. In this study, we show that the plasma membrane protein Pdr15p displays limited drug transport capacity, mediating chloramphenicol and detergent tolerance. Interestingly, Pdr15p becomes most abundant when cells exit the exponential growth phase, whereas its closest homologue, Pdr5p, disappears after exponential growth. Furthermore, in contrast to Pdr5p, Pdr15p is strongly induced by various stress conditions including heat shock, low pH, weak acids, or high osmolarity. PDR15 induction bypasses the Pdr1p/Pdr3p regulators but requires the general stress regulator Msn2p, which directly decorates the stress response elements in the PDR15 promoter. Remarkably, however, Pdr15p induction bypasses upstream components of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway including the Hog1p and Pbs2p kinases as well as the dedicated HOG cell surface sensors. Our data provide evidence for a novel upstream branch of the general stress response pathway activating Msn2p. In addition, the results demonstrate a cross-talk between stress response and the pleiotropic drug resistance network.

Yeast cells in the environment have to cope with various adverse conditions including hyper- or hypo-osmotic, oxidative stress, heat shock, acidic or alkaline challenge, toxins from plants, fungi or bacteria, and heavy metals as well as herbicides. Therefore, yeasts developed a variety of protective mechanisms ranging from general environmental stress response to highly specific regulatory pathways devoted to stress adaptation. For instance, certain membrane proteins of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; HOG, high osmolarity glycerol; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; STRE, stress response element; nt, nucleotide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PDR, pleiotropic drug resistance. 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; HOG, high osmolarity glycerol; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; STRE, stress response element; nt, nucleotide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PDR, pleiotropic drug resistance. transporter family are implicated in cellular detoxification and also mediate pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR).

Drug Resist. 1998; 4: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which may detoxify cells by extruding substrates in an ATP-dependent manner (6Mahé Y. Lemoine Y. Kuchler K. J. Biol.

The Pdr10p and Pdr15p proteins display the closest primary sequence identity with Pdr5p, sharing 66 and 74% identical residues, respectively (8Wolfger H. Mamnun Y.M. Kuchler K. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, Pdr10p and Pdr15p have never been isolated in any genetic screen for drug resistance and no other physiological roles have been discovered to date. Notably, several genomic approaches hint PDR15 as a gene modulated by many adverse stress conditions (transcriptome.ens.fr/ymgv) but a correlation of microarray data with a function of Pdr15p has not yet been possible.Similar to PDR5 (7Decottignies A.

Interestingly, Pdr1p/Pdr3p can exert opposing regulatory effects upon target genes as deletion of PDR1 reduces PDR5 expression but increases PDR15 mRNA levels. In turn, Pdr3p is essential for basal PDR15 expression but only a minor regulator of PDR5 expression (14Wolfger H. Mahé Y. Parle-McDermott A. Delahodde A. Kuchler K.

The related C2H2-zinc finger proteins Msn2p and Msn4p are the master regulators of general stress, because they modulate ∼180 genes (20Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3698) Google Scholar) in response to different environmental stresses including nutrient limitation, heat shock, high osmolarity, or salt treatment. Interestingly, the gene expression pattern of Msn2p/Msn4p targets is distinct for every stress condition (20Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D.

Msn2p/Msn4p function demands increased intracellular cAMP levels, protein kinase A (25Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C.

Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). HOG signaling transduces stress signals from surface osmosensors via intracellular MAPKs such as the MAPKK Pbs2p and MAPK Hog1p (27Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), triggering a rapid activation of Msn2p (25Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Hog1p may also control the activity of several other transcription factors including Msn1p, Hot1p, and Sko1p (28Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2433-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The lack of Hog1p renders cells hypersensitive to high osmolarity (26Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and other adverse conditions. The direct binding of Hog1p to other osmostress regulators such as Hot1p mediates their binding to certain STRE promoters (30Alepuz P.M. de Nadal E. Zapater M. Ammerer G. Posas F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2433-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms of Hog1p-regulated response via Msn2p/Msn4p activation remain unknown.In this study, we show that PDR15 is a target of Msn2p, thus a general stress response gene. Pdr15p is highly induced by various adverse conditions such as high osmolarity, heat shock, low pH, weak acids, and starvation. The induction requires Msn2p, which directly decorates STREs in the PDR15 promoter in vivo. Furthermore, Pdr15p is also controlled by endogenous metabolic stress because it is strongly induced in cells exiting the exponential growth phase. Interestingly, Pdr15p and its closest homologue Pdr5p are differently regulated during various growth phases. Hence, our results describe for the first time a link between ABC efflux pumps and the general stress response and suggest a role for Pdr15p in cellular detoxification during metabolic stress or in non-growing cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Growth Conditions—All of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

For epitope tagging of PDR15, the triple HA or the GFP tag was amplified from plasmids pFA6a-3HA-KANMX6 and pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-KANMX6 (33Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A.

YHW15GFP and YPH499 wild type cells were grown in YPD medium to the early stationary growth phase, and Pdr15p-GFP was visualized in living cells without prior fixation. Light microscopy equipped with Nomarski optics enabled visualization of vacuoles. Cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with fluorescein isothiocyanate filter sets. Images were recorded using a Quantix CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Inc.) with the IP LAB software (Spectra Services, Inc., Webster, NY) and further processed in Adobe Photoshop, version 6.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA).Northern Blot Analysis—RNA preparation and separation on an agarose gel was done exactly as described previously (14Wolfger H. Mahé Y. Parle-McDermott A. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The membrane was prehybridized in 10 ml of 10× Denhardt's buffer (1 g of Ficoll 400, 1 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, fraction V), 2× SSC, and 1% SDS, 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 3–6 h at 65 °C. The respective probes were labeled with a Megaprime labeling kit according to the manufacturer and directly added to the prehybridization solution after purification on a NICK™ column (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent heat denaturation. After an overnight incubation at 65 °C, membranes were washed at 65 °C three times in 2× SSC, 1% SDS, and three times in 1× SSC, 1% SDS and exposed to x-ray films at -70 °C or analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Storm 1840, Amersham Biosciences).In Vivo Footprint Analysis—In vivo footprint experiments were carried out essentially as described previously (25Görner W.

Cultures were grown to the exponential growth phase in YPD until A600 nm of 1.0–1.8 was reached and treated with 8 mm potassium sorbate for 10 min. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 5-ml culture medium, and treated with 5 μl of dimethyl sulfate in the presence of potassium sorbate for 5 min to methylate DNA. The reaction was stopped by rinsing cells with ice-cold TNEβ (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol). DNA was isolated after spheroblasting cells in SCEβ (1 m sorbitol, 100 mm trisodium citrate, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0–7.5) and subsequent lysis (2% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm EDTA) at 65 °C for 5 min. Proteins were precipitated in 0.63 m potassium acetate overnight at 4 °C. DNA from the supernatant was purified by several cycles of ethanol precipitation and RNase digestion followed by digestion with EcoRI. Primer extension was carried out with α-32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides (PDR15-FTP-551s, 5′-AAGAACATTACTTTTTCCGAGCAACAAACGC-3′) for 40 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 58 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C). Oligonucleotides used for this reaction specifically bind to the PDR15 promoter. The products were precipitated twice with ethanol for further purification, dissolved in denaturing loading buffer (50 mm NaOH, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 m urea, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol), and resolved in 8% denaturing sequencing gels. Dried sequencing gels were scanned in a STORM PhosphorImager and quantified using the standard software ImageQuant 5.0.RESULTSPdr15p Is a Plasma Membrane Protein Conferring Resistance to a Limited Number of Substances—Because Pdr15p is the closest homologue of Pdr5p, we were interested to identify common functional features of these proteins. First, we wanted to determine the intracellular localization of Pdr15p. Strain YHW15GFP expressing Pdr15p with a C-terminally fused GFP tag and the corresponding wild type YPH499 were grown in YPD to early or late exponential growth phases. Interestingly, no Pdr15p-GFP signals were detectable in cells growing in early exponential phase (data not shown). However, a distinct fluorescence rim staining, typically indicating plasma membrane localization, was observed in YHW15GFP cells in the late exponential growth phase (Fig. 1). This signal was specific for Pdr15p-GFP because it was absent in wild type control cells. Hence, Pdr15p, similar to its homologue Pdr5p, is a plasma membrane protein suggesting an overlapping function and may be the capability of Pdr15p to export various cytotoxic compounds.To test this idea, we constructed a set of seven isogenic strains containing all possible combinations of deletions of the Pdr5p subfamily genes, PDR5, PDR10, and PDR15. These strains were grown to the exponential growth phase, and identical cell numbers were spotted onto YPD plates containing a wide variety of typical drug substrates of Pdr5p and other ABC transporters (Fig. 2). However, in most cases, we found that only a loss of Pdr5p but not that of Pdr10p or Pdr15p caused drug hypersensitivity (data not shown). Nevertheless, deletion of PDR15 in a pdr5Δ strain increased hypersensitivity to chloramphenicol as well as to the detergent polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (Fig. 2). Although the absence of PDR15 alone did not cause any obvious growth phenotypes when compared with the wild type, the pdr5Δ pdr15Δ double deletion exhibited clearly reduced growth on plates containing chloramphenicol or polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, respectively, when compared with the pdr5Δ single deletion (Fig. 2). Deletion of PDR10 on the other hand did not result in any detectable growth phenotype in the presence of these substances. These data demonstrate a possible drug transport capacity of Pdr15p and suggest that the physiological roles or substrates of Pdr5p, Pdr10p, and Pdr15p may be largely distinct despite a high degree of primary sequence identity.Fig. 2Pdr15p confers resistance to chloramphenicol and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether. The isogenic strains YPH499 (WT), YHW 10G (Δ10), YHW 15K (Δ15), YKK-A7 (Δ5), YHW 105 (Δ10 Δ5), YHW 1015K (Δ10 Δ15), YHW 515K (Δ5 Δ15), and YHW 10515K (Δ10 Δ5 Δ15) were spotted on YPD plates containing chloramphenicol or polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, respectively, at the indicated concentrations. Similar volumes of 10-fold serial dilutions of cultures with an A600 nm of 0.05 (spots at the upper and lower edge) and 0.005 (spots in the center) were spotted onto YPD plates using a sterile multipin aluminum stamp. Cell growth was inspected after a 3-day incubation at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pdr15p Is Induced Upon Various Stresses in a Pdr1p/Pdr3p-independent Way—Beside the obvious similarities between PDR5 and PDR15, previous studies already suggested that PDR15 mRNA levels are extremely low in exponentially growing cells, contrasting the high basal expression level of PDR5 (14Wolfger H. Mahé Y. Parle-McDermott A. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To learn more about the cellular role of Pdr15p, we investigated the expression pattern of this transporter under various stress conditions. YPH499 cells were grown in YPD to A600 nm of 1.0 and stressed with 0.95 m sorbitol, 0.4 m NaCl for osmotic stress, or 5 mm potassium sorbate for weak acid stress. Furthermore, cells growing at room temperature were shifted to 37 °C to impose a heat shock. Before stress treatment and after the indicated time points, samples were taken and total RNA was prepared. Analysis of PDR15 mRNA levels showed that all of the stress conditions caused a dramatic increase of PDR15 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). Low basal levels of PDR15 increased within 10–20 min following stress impact. However, the PDR15 induction appeared transient, peaking after 20 min under all of the stress conditions investigated. After ∼60 min of stress treatment, PDR15 mRNA levels dropped to levels similar to the uninduced state. Notably, PDR5 mRNA levels were not affected by any of the stress conditions tested (Fig. 3A and data not shown).Fig. 3PDR15 expression is highly induced in response to various stress conditions. A, total RNA was prepared from strain YPH499 grown to the exponential growth phase in YPD and stressed for the indicated time with 0.95 m sorbitol, 5 mm potassium sorbate (K-sorbate), or 0.4 m NaCl or transferred from room temperature to 37 °C (Heat Shock). PDR15 and PDR5 mRNAs were detected using appropriate probes homologous to the 5′ end of the respective open reading frame. Equal loading was confirmed with methylene staining of the 18 and 28 S rRNA (data not shown). B, whole cell extracts were prepared from strain YCS15-HA grown to the exponential growth phase in YPD and stressed for the indicated time with 0.4 m NaCl or transferred to fresh medium at pH 4.5. Immunodetection of HA-tagged Pdr15p was performed using monoclonal anti-HA antibody 16B12 diluted 1:2500. An unspecific cross-reaction against the 16B12 antibody confirmed equal sample loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To see whether the transient induction of PDR15 mRNA leads to an increase of Pdr15p protein, we performed immunoblotting to detect Pdr15p-HA under different adverse conditions. YCS15-HA cells were grown in YPD to A600 nm of 1.0 and stressed either with high salt conditions (0.4 m NaCl), low pH (pH 4.5), or weak acid stress (data not shown). Samples were harvested before and after stress treatment at the indicated time points, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with the monoclonal HA antibody 16B12 to detect Pdr15p-HA (Fig. 3B). Equal loading was confirmed by a cross-reaction of the anti-HA antibody. In unstressed cells, Pdr15p levels were very low and the protein migrated as a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 180 kDa. ∼10 min after NaCl addition, protein levels started to increase sharply (Fig. 3B, upper panel). A second, faster migrating band specific for Pdr15p-HA appeared. Because Pdr15p-HA is a glycosylated protein (data not shown), we concluded that this faster migrating band perhaps represents an unmodified Pdr15p-HA precursor or the intermediate form. After 20 min, both immunoreactive bands corresponding to Pdr15p were clearly induced and overall Pdr15p levels remained highly elevated during the 120-min stress duration (Fig. 3B) Similar results as in the high salt stress experiment were obtained for all other adverse conditions tested (Fig. 3B). Hence, Pdr15p protein levels remained high throughout the stress treatments even though the mRNA induction was only transient. Interestingly, a deletion of PDR15 did not result in increased sensitivity to any of the stress conditions applied in our study (data not shown).The Pdr1p and Pdr3p regulators control the basal expression of Pdr15p (14Wolfger H. Mahé Y. Parle-McDermott A. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the influence of these transcription factors on Pdr15p stress induction. Cells lacking Pdr1p, Pdr3p, or both transcription factors as well as the corresponding isogenic wild type cells were grown to an A600 nm of 1.0, and 5 mm potassium sorbate was added. Samples were taken at various time points, and PDR15 mRNA was detected by Northern analysis (Fig. 4). As observed previously, PDR15 mRNA levels rapidly but transiently increased after the addition of potassium sorbate in wild type cells. Notably, cells lacking Pdr1p displayed a higher PDR15 expression than wild type cells, which is in agreement with earlier results indicating a negative control by Pdr1p in wild type cells (14Wolfger H. Mahé Y. Parle-McDermott A. Delahodde A. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the fast induction upon stress treatment was"

We have harnessed the signal sequence hydrophobic region (SSHR) to deliver functional cargoes to cultured cells and to experimental animals. We now report evidence that two chirally distinct forms of SSHR composed of all l or all d amino acids showed similar membrane-translocating activity as assessed by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and direct fluorescence measurement. An attached nuclear localization sequence ferried by the SSHR enantiomers displayed similar intracellular function by inhibiting inducible nuclear import of transcription factor nuclear factor κ B and suppressing nuclear factor κ B-dependent gene expression of cytokines. A nuclear localization sequence comprised of a positively charged cluster of amino acids was rapidly translocated by SSHR enantiomers to the interior of unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. These findings indicate that the SSHR translocates functional peptides directly through the plasma membrane phospholipid bilayer without involving chirally specific receptor/transporter mechanisms.

This mechanism of SSHR translocation is suitable for facile delivery of biologically active peptides for cell-based and animal-based functional proteomic studies. The plasma membrane imposes tight control on the access of extracellular peptides and proteins to the cell interior. Through its mosaic structure of proteins and glycolipids embedded into the phospholipid bilayer, the plasma membrane provides a boundary for the 10,000–15,000 proteins expressed in a typical mammalian cell (1Singer S.J. Nicolson G.L. Science. 1972; 175: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (6100) Google Scholar, 2Lewis T.S. Hunt J.B. Aveline L.D. Jonscher K.R. Louie D.F. Yeh J.M. Nahreini T.S. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol.

Despite this barrier, transfer of information across the membrane is essential for cell development, function, and survival. Membrane receptors and transporters sense the extracellular environment of growth-promoting or -inhibiting ligands, short peptides, ions, and nutrients. This recognition allows their cellular uptake through specific receptor-mediated endocytosis or transporter-based translocation. To bypass these inherent mainstays of the plasma membrane functional integrity, we harnessed a signal sequence-derived hydrophobic region to deliver functional cargoes composed of peptides and proteins to probe and modulate intracellular signaling (3Hawiger J.

The overall structure of signal peptides is conserved in evolution between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, although the sequences of signal peptides are highly diverse (5von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Their tripartite structure comprises an NH2-terminal region (n region), and a hydrophobic h region of variable length; this is followed by a cleavage site (c region) for signal peptidase. The hydrophobic region, which usually forms a helix, is endowed with a membrane-translocating activity (6Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Its primary function is to guide a nascent polypeptide chain from the ribosomal tunnel through a translocon pore that is open laterally toward the phospholipid bilayer and to the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (7Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 8Kowarik M. Kung S. Martoglio B. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, the hydrophobicity of a signal sequence attached to the nascent protein specifies its co-translational or post-translational pathway of transport (8Kowarik M. Kung S. Martoglio B. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J.

Previously we reported that two SSHRs derived from human fibroblast growth factor 4 (Kaposi fibroblast growth factor) and human integrin β3 provided for the efficient outside-in translocation of attached cargo across the plasma membrane of human and murine cell lines (10Lin Y.Z.

Remarkably, primary cells studied ex vivo provide additional examples of the versatile use of the SSHR-based membrane-translocating motif (MTM) to ferry novel inhibitors for studying the function of calpain in human blood platelets (12Croce K. Flaumenhaft R. Rivers M. Furie B. Furie B.C. Herman I.M. Potter D.A. J. Biol.

Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Recently we unexpectedly found that a cell-permeant peptide inhibitor of nuclear import of proinflammatory transcription factors was rapidly (∼20 min) delivered to mouse blood cells and organs following intraperitoneal injection (14Liu X.Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16774-16778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As a consequence of intracellular inhibition of signaling to the nucleus, expression of inflammatory cytokines was suppressed and animals were protected from death (14Liu X.Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16774-16778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These in vivo data imply that the SSHR-based peptide ferrying inhibitor of nuclear import has consecutively crossed into and out of plasma membranes from at least three cell types: mesothelial cells lining the peritoneum, endothelial cells lining blood vessels, and hemopoietic cells that circulate in blood and form organs such as spleens. Similarly, in vivo delivery of functionally active Cre recombinase using SSHR-based MTM led to its distribution in multiple organs in mice, including the brain, which requires crossing the blood-brain barrier (15Jo D. Nashabi A. Doxsee C. Lin Q. Unutmaz D. Chen J. Ruley H.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Despite this striking capacity for intercellular transfer, the mechanism of SSHR translocation through the plasma membrane remains unknown. To study this mechanism, we employed a number of approaches using chirally distinct forms of SSHR. They were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry of macrophages treated with SSHR-containing peptides, and direct fluorescence monitoring of SSHR-based translocation of the nuclear localization sequence with its positively charged cluster of amino acids across unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. These approaches were coupled with the ultimate test of translocating efficiency: functional measurements of the intracellular effect of the cargo on nuclear import of proinflammatory transcription factor NFκB and on expression of cytokine genes regulated by this transactivator in macrophages. Using these approaches, we show that translocation of SSHR-linked cargo across the plasma membrane is based on temperature-sensitive diffusion through the phospholipid bilayer. These mechanistic findings will facilitate the rational design of a new generation of cell-permeant peptides for proteomic and drug delivery studies. Cell Culture—Murine macrophage RAW 264.7 (RAW) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing no detectable lipopolysaccharide (LPS, <0.006 ng/ml as determined by the manufacturer, Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cytotoxicity Assay—A freshly prepared solution of 10 μg/ml fluorescein diacetate and 100 μg/ml ethidium bromide in DMEM was added to an equal volume of peptide-treated or untreated cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were observed by fluorescent microscopy, and orange-stained cells were counted as not viable. Peptide Synthesis and Labeling—The l-SN50 and d-SN50 peptides were synthesized, purified, filter-sterilized, and analyzed as described previously (14Liu X.Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar) using l or d amino acids as indicated (see Fig. 1A). Peptides were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After extensive dialysis against water to remove free FITC, labeled peptides were lyophilized and stored at -20 °C. Before use the peptides were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at 3.3 mm and then diluted to a 1 mm working stock solution with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Relative fluorescence of 50 nm peptide solutions in HEPES-KCl (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, and 100 mm KCl) was measured in a Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 485 nm excitation, 535 nm emission, and 20 nm band pass. Intracellular Detection of Peptides—The intracellular presence of peptides in RAW cells was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy using direct fluorescence. RAW cells in DMEM with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum were transferred to 2-ml glass bottom microwell dishes (Mattek Corp.) at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 20 h. The next day the medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of DMEM without serum. FM5-95, a fluorescent membrane dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), was added to cells at 5 μm for 5 min before the addition of 5 μm FITC-labeled l-SN50 or d-SN50 peptide or unconjugated FITC at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were then washed two times with ice cold DMEM followed by a final addition of 0.2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. They were immediately observed without fixation using a fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510). Flow Cytometry-based Protease Accessibility Assay—This assay was performed to assure that cell-associated fluorescence was due to the pool of FITC-labeled peptide that was translocated across the plasma membrane to reach the cytoplasm. RAW cells in DMEM without serum (200 μl at 2 × 106/ml) were incubated with 5 μm FITC-labeled l-SN50 or d-SN50 peptide or unconjugated FITC at RT for 30 min in duplicate. One of each was then treated with proteinase K (5 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. As a control, peptides were incubated with proteinase K (5 μg/μl) for 10 min at 37 °C before adding to cells. After all incubations, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, two times and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Cell fluorescence was measured in FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) using forward versus side light scatter, and green fluorescence was collected with a 530 ± 30-nm band pass filter. Temperature Sensitivity Assay—RAW cells were incubated with 5 μm FITC-labeled peptides at 4 °C or RT for 30 min and then analyzed for cell fluorescence by FACS as above. Cellular ATP Depletion—RAW cells were treated with antimycin A and 2-deoxyglucose or medium for 2 h as described previously (17Donald R. Ballard D.W. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), then incubated with 5 μm FITC-labeled peptides at RT for 30 min and analyzed for cell fluorescence by FACS as above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—80–90% confluent monolayers of RAW cells (60-mm plates with 3 ml of medium split 1:2 1 day before treatment) were treated with or without peptides at the indicated concentrations for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then further incubated with 2 ng/ml LPS from Escherichia coli 0127:B8 (Sigma) or diluent for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared and nuclear import of NFκB or the constitutively expressed nuclear factor Y was measured with radiolabeled probes as previously described (16Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). Assay for Cytokine Expression—RAW cells in 96-well plates (200 μl/well at 2 × 106/ml) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of peptides or diluent at RT for 30 min. Then 2 ng/ml LPS was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Plates were spun at 800 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was removed and frozen at -80 °C for later assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were performed on dilutions of supernatant according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Preparation of Extruded Large Unilamellar Vesicles (ELUV)—50 mg/ml stocks of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and a 100 mg/ml stock of cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) were prepared in chloroform. Volumes of 100 μl of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, 400 μl of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 64 μl of cholesterol were mixed together and the chloroform removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was hydrated in 250 μl of HEPES-KCl and then frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and thawed at 30 °C five times. This mixture was then passed 10 times through a 100-nm polycarbonate filter in a liposome extruder according to the manufacturer's instructions (Avanti Polar Lipids) and used immediately or stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 3 days (18Swanson S.T. Roise D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ELUV Uptake of FITC-labeled Peptides—1 mm stocks of FITC-labeled peptides were diluted to 5 μm with 50% ethanol in HEPES-KCl. A proteinase K stock (BD Biosciences Clontech) of 20 mg/ml was prepared in analytical grade water. 1 μl of 5 μm FITC-l-SN50 or FITC-d-SN50 was mixed with 3 μl of ELUV in a final volume of 100 μl of HEPES-KCl in duplicate, vortexed for 1–2 s, and then incubated at RT for the times indicated. One sample of each time point was then incubated at 37 °C for 12 min with 200 μg/ml (1 μl of 20 mg/ml in 100 μl) proteinase K. As a control, the same mixtures were prepared without ELUV and incubated at 37 °C for 12 min, followed by ELUV addition and incubation at RT for the times indicated. After incubation, each mixture was passed through a 1-ml Sephadex G-50 (fine) column prepared in a tuberculin syringe and centrifuged at 100 × g for 90 s to remove non-ELUV-associated FITC-labeled peptides (19Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The relative fluorescence of the eluted ELUV was measured in a Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 485 nm excitation, 535 nm emission, and 20 nm band pass. Chirally Distinct SSHRs as Tools to Characterize the Plasma Membrane-translocating Mechanism—Receptor-mediated or transporter-based cellular uptake of peptides and polypeptides is usually dependent on their recognition in a chirally specific manner (20Looger L.L. Dwyer M.A. Smith J.J. Hellinga H.W. Nature. 2003; 423: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In other words, if the SSHR composed of all l-amino acids is recognized by a receptor or transporter, then a “mirror image” of the SSHR made of all d-amino acids is not. By studying two chirally distinct forms of the same SSHR, we can deduce whether its plasma membrane-translocating activity is dependent on a chirally specific receptor/transporter. To characterize the plasma membrane-translocating mechanism of the SSHR, we designed two peptides, each with a chirally distinct MTM based on SSHR but with an identical functional cargo. Fig. 1A shows the sequence of the two peptides that contain MTM based on an SSHR made of either all l or all d amino acids and a cargo that comprises a nuclear localization sequence made of l-amino acids that form a positively charged cluster. The prototypic peptide is denoted l-SN50. The second peptide, containing MTM made of d-amino acids and the same cargo, is denoted d-SN50. The MTM in both peptides represents SSHR derived from fibroblast growth factor 4. Two Chirally Distinct MTMs Translocate Peptide Cargo to Mammalian Cells—To ascertain whether l-SN50 and d-SN50 are equally translocated to mammalian cells, we monitored the transport of FITC-labeled peptides into murine macrophage RAW cells. Confocal microscopy studies indicated that the l-SN50 and d-SN50 peptides were similarly distributed in the cytoplasm of RAW cells (Fig. 1B). This pattern is consistent with the subcellular distribution of a nuclear import adaptor protein, importin/karyopherin α2, identified previously as a cytoplasmic binder of l-SN50 (16Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). To establish whether the distribution pattern of l-SN50 and d-SN50 is independent of the endosomal compartment, RAW cells were treated with a fluorescent lipophilic membrane probe FM5-95 known to stain the plasma membrane and early endosomes as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). Subsequently, cells were pulsed with FITC-labeled l-SN50 peptide. The red fluorescent signal emitted by the FM5-95 probe was localized independently from the green fluorescent signal of l-SN50 (Fig. 1C). The merged image of both fluorescent reagents showed very little if any colocalization in multiple sections of unfixed RAW cells analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 1C). The divergence of fluorescent signals indicates an endosome-independent pathway of membrane translocation by the FITC-labeled l-SN50 peptide. A similar pattern of distinct fluorescent signals was observed with FITC-d-SN50 (not shown). Because of the potential nonspecific binding of peptides to the cell surface, confocal microscopy does not provide definitive proof for intracellular location of the peptides studied (21Lundberg M. Wikstrom S. Johansson M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed peptide translocation across the plasma membrane in RAW cells using flow cytometry coupled with a protease accessibility test. As shown in Fig. 2A, the broad spectrum protease, proteinase K, was used to distinguish between peptides not internalized and those translocated to the interior of the cell. For comparison, the control system contained peptides incubated with cells without proteinase K treatment. This analysis revealed that both peptides are susceptible to proteinase K, yet they escape proteolytic attack after being translocated to RAW cells where they remain inaccessible to proteinase K. The apparent additional gain in fluorescence in control cells that were not treated with proteinase K likely reflects a pool of peptides adsorbed on the cell surface and accessible to proteinase K. Translocation of both peptides across the plasma membrane of RAW cells was temperature-dependent, with the process inhibited at 4 °C (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the results showing peptide translocation independent of the endosomal compartment (Fig. 1C), translocation did not require ATP. Cells depleted of high energy stores demonstrated a similar gain in fluorescence because of peptide transduction as control cells that maintained a steady ATP level (Fig. 2C). These experiments lead us to conclude that both l-SN50 and d-SN50 move similarly across plasma membranes, bypassing the endosomal compartment to reach their cytoplasmic target. Intracellular Function of the Cargo Delivered by Two Chirally Distinct MTMs Is Similar—Detection of a protease-inaccessible pool of l-SN50 and d-SN50 peptides provides a measure of their ability to translocate across the plasma membrane. However, the ultimate test of translocating efficiency is to establish that the cargoes ferried by chirally distinct MTMs display similar intracellular activity. Prior results have demonstrated an inhibitory function of the l-SN50 peptide toward nuclear import of NFκB and other proinflammatory transcription factors in T cells (16Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, this peptide inhibited (in a concentration-dependent mode) inducible nuclear import of NFκB in LPS-stimulated RAW cells, demonstrated by use of electrophoretic mobility shift assay using 32P-labeled probes (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the d-SN50 peptide with chirally distinct MTM displayed a similar inhibitory potency. Transcription factor NFκB plays a key role in the regulation of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines (22Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar). Consistent with inhibition of nuclear import of NFκB, both peptides suppressed expression of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 3B). The inhibition curves were almost identical for both peptides, suggesting that their inhibitory cargo was delivered with a similar efficiency by chirally distinct MTMs. Both peptides, in concentrations up to 150 μm, were not cytotoxic as determined by staining with fluorescein diacetate and ethidium bromide (23Kajstura J. Reiss K. Folia Histochem. Cytobiol. 1989; 27: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these functional studies of intracellular inhibitory activity of nuclear localization sequence cargo ferried by two chirally distinct MTMs reinforce fluorescence-based assays indicating that the mechanism of translocation across the plasma membrane of RAW cells is not due to a chirally specific receptor or transporter. Two Peptides with Chirally Distinct MTMs Are Translocated across Phospholipid Bilayer—Model phospholipid membranes (“liposomes”) are impermeable to charged or hydrophilic molecules (24de Gier J. Mandersloot J.G. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 150: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). To establish whether SSHR-based MTM can ferry its positively charged cargo (i.e. nuclear localization sequence) through the phospholipid bilayer, we used ELUV composed of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol (18Swanson S.T. Roise D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These uniformly sized liposomes were incubated with FITC-labeled l-SN50 and d-SN50. Proteinase K was used to destroy the pool of peptide not translocated across the phospholipid bilayer and thereby not protected from protease action. As shown in Fig. 4, both peptides diffused rapidly with similar kinetics of translocation to the protease-inaccessible interior of ELUV. Proteinase K-digested peptides did not produce any significant gain in fluorescence associated with ELUV, thereby attesting to complete digestion of both peptides under these experimental conditions. In striking contrast, proteinase K treatment of ELUV after peptide translocation revealed a similar gain in fluorescence as compared with control without proteinase K treatment. Thus, there is very little residual binding of either peptide to the surface of ELUV. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that SSHR used as a membrane-translocating motif can ferry its positively charged cargo through a phospholipid bilayer without participation of proteinaceous receptors or transporters. Here we provide four separate lines of evidence indicating that the signal sequence hydrophobic region ferries its functional cargo across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells through a mechanism other than a receptor/transporter-mediated pathway. (i) Peptides containing SSHR enantiomers of all l or all d amino acids gain entry into mammalian cells independently of the endosomal compartment. (ii) Peptides translocated by chirally distinct SSHR exert similar intracellular function by inhibiting nuclear import of a proinflammatory transcription factor and suppressing inflammatory cytokine gene expression. (iii) The SSHR-based translocation mechanism is operational in ATP-depleted cells. (iv) SSHR, with nuclear localization sequence as its positively charged cargo, crosses the phospholipid bilayer of unilamellar liposomal vesicles. The translocation process is also temperature-dependent, presumably due to the well known temperature-dependent lipid phase transition of the phospholipid bilayer (25Torok Z. Tsvetkova N.M. Balogh G. Horvath I. Nagy E. Penzes Z. Hargitai J. Bensaude O. Csermely P. Crowe J.H. Maresca B. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3131-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the SSHR-based translocation mechanism is not dependent on a chirally specific receptor or transporter and can proceed in ATP-depleted cells. Thus, an endocytosis-based uptake mechanism seems unlikely. In this regard, other groups have employed alternative MTMs derived from the fruit fly Antennapedia transcription factor and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein (26Lindgren M. Hallbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 27Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Although these MTMs are capable of ferrying attached cargo from the outside to the inside of mammalian cells, they enter cells via an endocytic pathway (28Thoren P.E. Persson D. Isakson P. Goksor M. Onfelt A. Norden B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 29Console S. Marty C. Garcia-Echeverria C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31192-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Moreover, the TAT motif-based constructs are unable to translocate across liposomal phospholipid vesicles (32Kramer S.D. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Ziegler A. Li Blatter X. Seelig A. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A temperature-dependent endocytic pathway based on cell membrane lipid rafts and caveolar endocytosis is proposed for internalization of the TAT motif-containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (34Fittipaldi A. Ferrari A. Zoppe M. Arcangeli C. Pellegrini V. Beltram F. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34141-34149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a similar TAT motif-based enhanced green fluorescent protein failed to demonstrate its capacity for intercellular transfer (35Leifert J.A. Harkins S. Whitton J.L. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, the mechanisms employed by Antennapedia or HIV TAT-based motifs for crossing the plasma membrane seem to differ from SSHR-directed plasma membrane phospholipid bilayer translocation. How does SSHR, with its positively charged cargo, pass through the membrane phospholipid bilayer? The hydrophobic region of signal sequence we used contains proline as a helix-bending residue (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the “helical hairpin” hypothesis of Engelman and Steitz (36Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), the presence of such a residue may allow SSHR to form, within a phospholipid bilayer, a hairpin-like loop that constitutes a leading edge for the attached cargo (Fig. 5). Thus, the translocation would proceed through looping and unlooping stages as proposed by de Vrije et al. (37de Vrije G.J. Batenburg A.M. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). An alternative “tilted peptide” translocation mechanism envisages that the helix traverses a lipid bilayer after its insertion at a 45° angle (38Peuvot J. Schanck A. Lins L. Brasseur R. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 198: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These two postulated “looping” and “tilted peptide” mechanisms are not mutually exclusive in their destabilizing effects on the phospholipid bilayer (Fig. 5). Such an effect may be attributed to the formation of non-bilayer lipid structures upon contact with the signal sequence hydrophobic region (39Killian J.A. de Jong A.M. Bijvelt J. Verkleij A.J. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transient formation of these non-bilayer lipid structures reflects their ability to undergo topological transformation (40Takiguchi K. Nomura F. Inaba T. Takeda S. Saitoh A. Hotani H. Chemphyschem. 2002; 3: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Conversely, liposomes are known to destabilize the membrane of isolated neutrophil granules and induce a release of membrane-bound lysosomal enzymes (41Hawiger J. Collins R.D. Horn R.G. Koenig M.G. Nature. 1969; 222: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the potential destabilization of the phospholipid bilayer by SSHR-based MTM has no apparent effect on the permeability of the plasma membrane. We did not observe any increase in plasma membrane permeability as evidenced by fluorescein diacetate/ethidium bromide staining with a peptide concentration of up to 150 μm. Thus, SSHR-directed movement of functional cargo through the phospholipid bilayer seems to be harmless in terms of its impact on the structural integrity of the plasma membrane at concentrations sufficient to inhibit intracellular signaling. The SSHR-based mechanism of translocation across the phospholipid bilayer is consistent with the membrane trigger hypothesis formulated by Wickner (42Wickner W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 43Ohno-Iwashita Y. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1895-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that postulated translocation of certain newly synthesized bacterial proteins (e.g. leader sequence-bearing M13 procoat protein) across a phospholipid bilayer without the aid of a proteinaceous pore or transport system. The development of specific tools to analyze the 10,000–15,000 intracellular proteins and their pathways in a typical living cell (2Lewis T.S. Hunt J.B. Aveline L.D. Jonscher K.R. Louie D.F. Yeh J.M. Nahreini T.S. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1343-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) has been hampered by the lack of facile vehicles for delivery of peptides and large protein segments across a plasma membrane. Our work has demonstrated that the SSHR-based MTM possesses a number of desirable attributes. It is based on the hydrophobic region of a signal sequence that has been conserved through evolution. It translocates freely across a phospholipid bilayer, bypassing a more complex endocytic pathway apparently used by other MTMs such as Antennapedia-based or HIV TAT-based sequences (28Thoren P.E.

SSHR-based MTM allows development of specific probes to study intracellular protein networks, including functionally uncharacterized new proteins. Hence, it provides a platform for the development of cell-based proteomic analytical tools and for intracellular delivery of novel drugs by enabling them to cross the plasma membrane barrier in multiple cell types (14Liu X.Y.

https://openalex.org/W1996243309,"β2-Microglobulin (β2m) is a major component of amyloid fibrils deposited in patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis. Although full-length β2m readily forms amyloid fibrils in vitro by seed-dependent extension with a maximum at pH 2.5, fibril formation under physiological conditions as detected in patients has been difficult to reproduce. A 22-residue K3 peptide of β2m, Ser20–Lys41, obtained by digestion with Acromobacter protease I, forms amyloid fibrils without seeding. To obtain further insight into the mechanism of fibril formation, we studied the pH dependence of fibril formation of the K3 peptide and its morphology using a ThT fluorescence assay and electron microscopy, respectively. K3 peptide formed amyloid fibrils over a wide range of pH values with an optimum around pH 7 and contrasted with the pH profile of the seed-dependent extension reaction of full-length β2m. This suggests that once the rigid native-fold of β2m is unfolded and additional factors triggering the nucleation process are provided, full-length β2m discloses an intrinsic potential to form amyloid fibrils at neutral pH. The fibril formation was strongly promoted by dimerization of K3 through Cys25. The morphology of the fibrils varied depending on the fibril formation conditions and the presence or absence of a disulfide bond. Various fibrils had the potential to seed fibril formation of full-length β2m accompanied with a characteristic lag phase, suggesting that the internal structures are similar. β2-Microglobulin (β2m) is a major component of amyloid fibrils deposited in patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis.

Although the increase in β2m concentration in blood over a long period is the most critical risk factor causing amyloidosis, the molecular details remain unknown. Recently β2m, because of its relatively small size, which makes it suitable for physicochemical studies, has been used as a target for extensive studies addressing the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation in the context of protein conformation (20Esposito G.

In many amyloidogenic proteins, short peptides called minimal or essential sequences can form amyloid fibrils by themselves (7López de la Paz M. Goldie K. Zurdo J. Lacroix E. Dobson C.M. Hoenger A.

We found that a 22-residue K3 peptide, Ser20–Lys41 (Fig. 1), obtained by digestion of β2m with Acromobacter protease I, forms amyloid fibrils (30Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently, we further identified an 11-residue peptide, Asn21–His31, in the K3 region that also forms amyloid fibrils (42Hasegawa K. Ohhashi Y. Yamaguthi I. Takahashi N. Tsutsumi S. Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Jones et al. (43Jones S. Manning J. Kad N.M. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) reported that another region, Asp59–Thr71, forms amyloid fibrils. The minimal sequence provides various pieces of information useful for addressing amyloid fibril formation. It is likely that the minimal sequence includes the initiation site for amyloid fibril formation of the whole molecule. Moreover, it may constitute the core of the consequent amyloid fibrils. We found under conditions without agitation that although efficient fibril formation of whole β2m at pH 2.5 requires seeding, K3 peptide can form amyloid fibrils spontaneously, suggesting that the free energy barrier for fibril formation by the K3 peptide is lower than that of whole β2m (30Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this paper, to obtain further insight into the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation of β2m, we studied the pH dependence and role of the disulfide bond on amyloid fibril formation of the K3 peptide. The results show that an optimum for K3 fibril formation exists at neutral pH, suggesting that, although unfolding of the rigid native-fold and additional factors triggering the nucleation process are necessary, the intrinsic amyloidogenic preference of β2m has an optimum at neutral pH. Recombinant β2m and K3 Peptide—Recombinant human β2m was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and purified as described (29Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Three fractions with 6 (Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Val-), 4 (Glu-Ala-Tyr-Val-), and 1 (Val-) additional amino acid residues added to the N-terminal (Leu) of intact β2m were obtained. These additional residues were derived from the signal sequence in the expression vector. The second peak with 4 additional amino acid residues was the major peak, and this fraction was used as the intact β2m. K3 peptide was obtained by digestion of β2m with lysyl endopeptidase from Achromobacter lyticus (Achromobacter protease I, Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) as described previously (30Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For preparation of the K3 peptide, we used a crude β2m fraction made of a mixture of species with different N-terminals. The K3 peptide has a cysteine residue, Cys25 (Fig. 1). Alkylated K3, in which Cys25 was alkylated by iodoacetamide, was prepared by incubating 100 μm K3 with 10 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 9.0 for 1 h. A K3 dimer with a disulfide bond between Cys25 was prepared by air oxidation for 3 days in the same buffer. Both K3 derivatives were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (30Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Polymerization Assay—Fibril formation of K3 and its derivatives were performed at 37 °C using a final peptide concentration of 100 μm for the K3 monomers and 50 μm for the K3 dimer. The buffers used were glycine-HCl (pH 1.5–3.0), sodium acetate (pH 3.5–5.5), MES-NaOH (pH 6.0–7.0), and Tris-HCl (pH 7.5–8.5). The concentration of the buffers was 50 mm and all contained 100 mm NaCl. The lyophilized K3 and its derivatives were dissolved in 100% Me2SO and then diluted into the buffer solutions. The final concentration of Me2SO was less than 1% (v/v). We confirmed that 1% (v/v) Me2SO does not affect the standard seed-dependent extension reaction with intact β2m. For seeding experiments, the sonicated K3 fibrils at a concentration of 5 μg/ml were used as seeds. Amyloid fibril formation of the full-length β2m was carried out using a standard seed-dependent extension at 25 μm β2m at 37 °C (37Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 38Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Takahashi N. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8499-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It must be noted that the protein solution was not agitated during the standard extension reaction. The seed fibrils of full-length β2m used were the 6th generation from original fibrils purified from patients and were extended with monomeric recombinant β2m. ThT Fluorescence Assay—The polymerization reaction was monitored by fluorometric analysis with ThT at 25 °C as described previously (37Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 445 and 485 nm, respectively. From each reaction tube, 5 (for time course measurements) or 7.5 μl (for pH-dependence measurements) was taken and mixed with 1.5 ml of 5 μm ThT in 50 mm glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.5) and the fluorescence of ThT was measured using a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer, F4500. We confirmed that the pH of the ThT assay solution is not affected significantly by the addition of the protein solution at acidic pH. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Reaction mixtures (2.5 μl) were diluted with 25 μl of distilled water. These diluted samples were spread on carbon-coated grids and were allowed to stand for 1 to 2 min before excess solution was removed with filter paper. After drying the residual solution, the grids were negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0) and once more excess solution on the grids was removed by filter paper and dried. These samples were examined under a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 75 kV. CD—Far UV CD measurements were carried out with a Jasco spectropolarimeter, J-720, at 20 °C using a cell with a light path of 1 mm. The protein concentration was 25 μm and the results are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity [θ] (deg cm2 dmol-1). pH Dependence of K3 Fibril Formation—In the present study the fibril formations were examined at various pH conditions, and the amounts of fibril formed were determined from ThT binding using the standard method at pH 8.5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although fibrils prepared at different pH conditions might have different ThT binding capabilities, thus producing some uncertainty in estimating the amounts, we consider that the present method is the most reliable available. Purified and lyophilized K3 peptide was difficult to completely dissolve in water under acidic pH conditions, exhibiting turbidity and a high background as monitored by ThT fluorescence. Among the various solvent conditions examined, we found that a high concentration of Me2SO, which was also useful for dissolving β2m amyloid fibrils (31Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 44Hirota-Nakaoka N. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), could completely dissolve the K3 peptide. Therefore, we used 100% Me2SO to prepare a stock solution of the K3 peptide, which was mostly used within the same day. Under acidic pH conditions, full-length recombinant β2m forms amyloid fibrils by the seed-dependent extension reaction with an optimum at pH 2.5 (29Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F.

We observed no fibril formation without seeding even after incubating for several days. However, it has been shown that agitation can induce fibril formation of β2m without seeding (45Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, we confirmed that agitation of the solution with seeds further accelerated seed-dependent fibril formation. 2Y. Ohhashi and Y. Goto, unpublished results. In contrast, the K3 peptide formed amyloid fibrils spontaneously at pH 2.5 (30Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The kinetics depended on peptide concentration whereby the higher the peptide concentration the faster the reaction. At 100 μm K3, a lag phase of 3 h was observed and the reaction ended after about 6 h incubation (Fig. 2A). The lag phase shortened with increasing K3 concentration, such that the overall reaction accelerated (data not shown; see Fig. 3B of Ref. 30Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although it is likely that agitation also accelerates fibril formation of the K3 peptide, all the experiments were carried out without agitation, where most of the reactions ended after 24 h (Fig. 2).Fig. 3pH dependence of fibril formation of K3 and its modified peptides at 37 °C.

Because most of the reactions ended at 24 h (Fig. 2), the profile was constructed by measuring the fibril formation at 24 h. Intriguingly, the ThT fluorescence intensity after 24 h incubation increased gradually with increasing pH to a maximum at pH 7.5. At pH values above 7.5, a sharp drop in ThT fluorescence was noted. A time course of fibril formation showed a lag phase for all the pH values examined (Fig. 2). The Role of the Disulfide Bond—K3 peptide has a free thiol group at Cys25, such that it can form a homodimer with an intermolecular disulfide bond. Disulfide bond formation by air oxidation is promoted by increasing pH. Thus, it is likely that disulfide bond formation occurs during incubation of K3 under neutral and alkaline conditions, although in our study we started the reaction with monomeric K3 that was purified by high performance liquid chromatography. In fact, analysis of K3 fibrils prepared in alkaline pH regions by high performance liquid chromatography revealed a significant amount of dimer formation during incubation (i.e. 50% at pH 7.5). A small fraction of dimer was observed even for fibrils prepared in weakly acidic pH conditions (data not shown). To analyze fibril formation of the K3 monomer separated from the dimer, we added 10 mm DTT to the reaction mixture. Between pH 2.0 and 7.0, the profile of the ThT fluorescence intensity after 24 h (Fig. 3B) was similar to that without DTT (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this, both at pH 2.5 and 6.0, the kinetics of fibril formation did not depend largely on the presence or absence of DTT, although a small change of lag time was observed (Fig. 2, A and B). On the other hand, the pH profile of the ThT fluorescence after 24 h showed a considerable difference between pH 7.0 and 8.0 (Fig. 3B). The kinetics of fibril formation at pH 7.5 showed that addition of DTT suppressed fibril formation significantly (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that at pH 7.5 the fibrils are formed predominantly by a disulfide bonded dimer. The pH profile of the fibril formation of monomeric K3 peptide in 10 mm DTT revealed a maximum at pH 5.5–6.5. To confirm the role of the disulfide bond, the K3 dimer was prepared by air oxidation, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and fibril formation was examined (Fig. 3D). As anticipated, ThT fluorescence after 5 h showed a dramatic increase. The pH region showing strong ThT fluorescence extended widely from pH 2 to 8, with an optimum at pH 6.0–7.5. The maximal ThT value at pH 7.5 was about 2-fold larger than that of the K3 monomer, although we used the same peptide concentrations with respect to the monomer: 100 μm for the K3 monomer and 50 μm for the K3 dimer. ThT fluorescence was minimum at pH 3, and increased slightly at pH values below 3. The kinetics of fibril formation showed that the lag phase disappeared at pH 6.0 and 7.5 and a shortened lag phase of 30 min was observed at pH 2.5 (Fig. 2). The rapid kinetics at pH 6.0 and 7.5 resemble the standard fibril extension reaction of the full-length β2m at 25 μm and pH 2.5, which was completed in 2 h (29Ohhashi Y. Hagihara Y. Kozhukh G. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, formation of the disulfide bond accelerated fibril formation as well as increasing the amount of fibrils monitored by the ThT fluorescence binding at pH 8.5. As a control, we prepared an alkylated K3 peptide in which the thiol group of Cys25 was alkylated by iodoacetamide. Below pH 5.0, fibril formation of the alkylated K3, as monitored by ThT fluorescence (Fig. 3C), was similar to that of K3 in 10 mm DTT (i.e. K3 with a free thiol) (Fig. 3B). However, no increases in ThT fluorescence above pH 6.5 were observed, suggesting that the acetamide group introduced steric hindrance preventing the formation of tightly packed amyloid fibrils above pH 6.5. The results also suggested the presence of at least two types of fibrils made of monomeric K3 peptide. The first, with thiol groups exposed to the solvent, was mainly formed at pH values below 6.5 and was not affected by alkylation of the thiol groups. The other, with thiol groups buried and formed above pH 6.5, could not be formed once the thiol group was alkylated because of steric hindrance introduced by the alkyl groups. On the other hand, alkylation of Cys25 prevents its ionization. It is possible that the prevention of ionization also contributes to the reduced amyloidogenicity above pH 6.5, although the details are unknown. Fibril Morphology—Figs. 4 and 5 show electron micrographs of fibrils of K3 and its derivatives prepared at pH 2.5 and 6.5, respectively. At pH 2.5, two types of monomer K3 fibrils were mainly observed. One of the monomer K3 fibrils (Fig. 4F) was similar to fibrils of intact β2m prepared at pH 2.5 (Fig. 4E), i.e. twisted thick fibrils with maximal and minimal diameters of 16.5 and 10 nm, respectively, and relatively short in length. The other was clustered thin filaments with a variety of diameters (Fig. 4G). The overall morphology of K3 (Fig. 4A), K3 in the presence of 10 mm DTT (Fig. 4B), and alkylated K3 fibrils (Fig. 4C) appeared similar to each other. Under these conditions, clustered filaments predominated and the fraction of thick filament was low.Fig. 5Electron micrographs of the amyloid fibrils of K3 and its modified peptides prepared at pH 6.5.

The former had a slightly twisted morphology with a longitudinal periodicity of about 60 nm, whereas the twist was not clear in the latter. The former are likely to consist of two latter filaments judging from their observed diameters. In general, the length of the fibrils prepared at pH 6.5 was longer than fibrils prepared at pH 2.5. The K3 dimer produced thin fibrils both at pH 2.5 (Fig. 4D) and 6.5 (Fig. 5D), whereas the fibril length was shorter (100–200 nm) than those of the K3 monomer fibrils at both pH values. The kinetics of fibril formation at pH 6.0 and 7.5 (Fig. 2, B and C) was rapid without a lag phase, similar to the standard fibril extension reaction of the full-length β2m, suggesting that the K3 dimer had a strong potential for initiating fibril formation. It is likely that the shorter length of the fibrils produced by the K3 dimer is related to its strong potential of fibril fo"

The K+-ATPase activities of these mutants were not completely inhibited by SCH 28080. The sensitivity to SCH 28080 was dependent on the bulkiness of the side chain at this position. Therefore, the side chain of Tyr801 is important for the interaction with this inhibitor.

SCH 28080 can dock in this cavity. However, SCH 28080 cannot dock in the same location in the E1 form (conformation with high affinity for proton) of the gastric proton pump due to the drastic rearrangement of the transmembrane helices between the E1 and E2 forms.

These results support the idea that this cavity is the binding pocket of SCH 28080. The gastric H+,K+-ATPase is a proton pump that is responsible for gastric acid secretion (1Wallmark B. Larsson H. Humble L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13681-13684Google Scholar). This pump consists of two kinds of subunits, the α- and β-subunits. The α-subunit is the catalytic subunit containing 10 transmembrane segments. The ATP binding site (2Farley R.A. Faller L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3899-3901Google Scholar, 3Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Google Scholar) and the cation binding sites are located on this subunit (4Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Google Scholar, 5Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. de Boer M. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29764-29772Google Scholar, 6Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y.

The β-subunit is the non-catalytic glycoprotein containing a single transmembrane segment and is involved in stabilization as well as targeting of the α-subunit to the plasma membrane (11Kimura T. Tabuchi Y. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20671-20677Google Scholar). This pump belongs to the family of type II P-type ATPases, which include sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SCH 28080, 2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetonitrile; SPI-447, 3-amino-5-methyl-2-(2-methyl-3-thienyl)imidazo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-c]pyridine; APA, acid pump antagonist; HEK, human embryonic kidney. Ca2+-ATPase (Ca2+ pump) and Na+,K+-ATPase (Na+ pump) (12Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Google Scholar). At present, inhibitors specific for the gastric proton pump are classified into two groups. Irreversible inhibitors such as omeprazole, rabeprazole, and lansoprazole, termed the proton pump inhibitors, are the first group. They are activated in acidic lumens, modify the cysteine residues located on the luminal side of the proton pump, and inhibit its pump activity. They are clinically used for controlling hyperacidity. The second classified group of specific proton pump inhibitors are the reversible inhibitors such as SCH 28080 (13Beil W. Hackbarth I. Sewing K.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 88: 19-23Google Scholar) and 3-amino-5-methyl-2-(2-methyl-3-thienyl)imidazo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-c]pyridine (SPI-447) (Fig. 1) (14Ushiro T. Tsukimi Y. Tanaka H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 303-306Google Scholar), which are described as acid pump antagonists (APAs). They bind to the E2 or E2P forms (conformations showing a high affinity for K+) and inhibit the gastric proton pump in a K+-competitive manner (15Keeling D.J. Laing S.M. Senn-Bilfinger J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2231-2236Google Scholar, 16Tsukimi Y. Ushiro T. Yamazaki T. Ishikawa H. Hirase J. Narita M. Nishigaito T. Banno K. Ichihara T. Tanaka H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 82: 21-28Google Scholar). Elucidation of the precise structure of the binding sites of the proton pump inhibitors and APAs is very important for generation of future drugs for acid-related diseases. Cysteine residues covalently attached by the active molecules (sulfenamides) of the proton pump inhibitors were identified as Cys815 and Cys824 (either in or close to the M6 segment) as well as Cys323 (in the M3/M4 loop) and Cys894 (in the M7/M8 loop) (the amino acid positions are given based upon the rabbit enzyme) (17Besancon M. Simon A. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22438-22446Google Scholar). These cysteine residues themselves are not essential for the function of the proton pump, but the attachment of a bulky drug to the cysteine residues seems to disrupt the conformational change in the proton pump during the catalytic reaction cycles (18Morii M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21553-21559Google Scholar). The binding site of SCH 28080 was first studied by photoaffinity labeling followed by site-directed mutagenesis. Although the first photoaffinity labeling study indicated that the first extracellular loop (the M1/M2 loop) is the direct binding site of SCH 28080 (19Munson K.B. Gutierrez C. Balaji V.N. Ramnarayan K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18976-18988Google Scholar), our mutational and chimeric studies showed that the M1/M2 loop is not the direct binding site (6Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K. Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Google Scholar, 20Asano S. Matsuda S. Hoshina S. Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6848-6854Google Scholar). Several mutants showed lower sensitivity to SCH 28080: the M336I and V339I mutants (mutants in Met336 and Val339 in the M4 segment), the K793S and E797D mutants (mutants in Lys793 and Glu797 in the M5 segment), and the C815T mutant (mutant in Cys815 either in or close to the M6 segment) (21Munson K.B. Lambrecht N. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2997-3004Google Scholar, 22Vagin O. Munson K.B. Lambrecht N. Karlish S.J.D. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7480-7490Google Scholar, 23Lambrecht N. Munson K.B. Vagin O. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4041-4048Google Scholar). However, these mutants showed a less than 10-fold lower affinity for SCH 28080, and until recently there had been no reports on the amino acid residues that are critical for the interaction with this inhibitor. Very recently Vagin et al. (24Vagin O. Denevich S. Munson K.B. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12755-12762Google Scholar) reported that the L811F mutant (mutant in Leu811 at the edge of the M5/M6 loop) showed a 90-fold decrease in the sensitivity to SCH 28080. In this report, we focus on the role of Tyr801 on the M5 segment of the gastric proton pump α-subunit in the interaction with SCH 28080 and SPI-447. Especially the Y801A and Y801S mutants retained the ion transport and K+-ATPase activities and showed much lower sensitivity to SCH 28080, which is almost comparable to that of SCH 28080-insensitive non-gastric H+,K+-ATPase (25Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajendran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551Google Scholar). We constructed the three-dimensional models of the gastric proton pump α-subunit by homology modeling based on atomic structures of SR Ca2+ pump as template molecules, and we propose a cavity structure found in the luminal side of the transmembrane domain to be the putative binding pocket of these drugs. Materials—HEK-293 cells were a kind gift from Prof. Jonathan Lytton (University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada). The pcDNA3.1(+)(ZEO) and pcDNA3 vectors were obtained from Invitrogen. Effectene transfection reagent and EndoFree Plasmid Maxi and Mega kits were obtained from Qiagen (Tokyo, Japan). Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), or Amersham Biosciences. Collagen type I-coated tissue culture wares were obtained from Asahi Technoglass Co. SCH 28080 was a kind gift from Dr. Peter Chiu (Schering-Plough Co., Kenilworth, NJ). SPI-447 was a kind gift from Dr. Hironori Tanaka (Shinnihon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were of molecular biology grade or the highest grade of purity available. cDNAs of the α- and β-Subunits of the Gastric Proton Pump—cDNAs of the α- and β-subunits were prepared from rabbit gastric mucosae as described elsewhere (4Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Google Scholar). The α- and β-subunit cDNAs were digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The fragments obtained were each ligated into the pcDNA3 vector (for the β-subunit cDNA) or pcDNA3.1(+)(ZEO) (for the α-subunit cDNA) treated with EcoRI and XhoI. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A cDNA encoding the rabbit gastric proton pump α-subunit, which contains two SphI sites (nucleotide positions 2033 and 2954) was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to remove the restriction site of SphI at nucleotide position 2954 (corresponding to Gly985). In the resulting cDNA (HK-α ΔSphI), the sequence of “GCATGC” was mutated to “GGATGC” without amino acid replacement. The subsequent introduction of site-directed mutations in the M5 segment of the gastric proton pump α-subunit was carried out by sequential PCR steps (6Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K. Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Google Scholar) in which appropriately mutated α-subunit cDNA sequences between the SphI site (nucleotide 2033) and the AvrII site (nucleotide 2436) were prepared. Two kinds of flanking sequence primers were prepared: one is the 5′-flanking sense primer 5′-GAGACGGTGGAGGACATTGCTGCC-3′ (nucleotides 1948–1971), and the other is the 3′-flanking antisense primer 5′-CAAGGACACGGACGGGAAAATGTC-3′ (nucleotides 2476–2499). In addition, sense and antisense synthetic oligonucleotides, each 21 bases long containing one or two mutated bases near the center, were designed (referred as the sense mutating primer and the antisense mutating primer). In the first PCR amplification step, the HK-α ΔSphI cDNA cloned in pBlue-scriptII SK(-) was used as a cDNA template. Two fragments were prepared in this step: one between the 5′-flanking sense primer and the antisense mutating primer and the other between the sense mutating primer and the 3′-flanking antisense primer. Each amplified fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis, combined, and incubated with the 5′-flanking sense primer and the 3′-flanking antisense primer in the second PCR amplification. The amplified fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis, cloned in pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene), and sequenced. PCR was routinely carried out in the presence of a 300 μm concentration of each dNTP, 6 μm primers, 10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 units of Pfu DNA polymerase for 25 cycles. After sequencing, the amplified fragment in the second PCR was digested with SphI and AvrII and ligated back into the relevant position of the wild-type construct of the α-subunit. DNA sequencing was done by dideoxy chain termination method using a BigDye Terminator DNA sequencing kit and ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Cell Culture and Transient Expression—Cell culture of the HEK-293 cell line was carried out as described previously (4Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Google Scholar). For transient expression, co-transfection of the α- and β-subunit cDNAs was performed by the calcium phosphate method with 10 μg of purified DNA/10-cm dish. Cells were harvested 2 days after the DNA transfection. Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—Stable cell lines co-expressing the α- and β-subunits were constructed as described previously (26Kimura T. Yoshida A. Tabuchi Y. Ikari A. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 923-932Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were first transfected with the β-subunit cDNA that was cloned in pcDNA3 (G418) by lipofection using Effectene transfection reagent, and stable cell lines were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin (G418 sulfate) followed by screening for protein expression of the β-subunit by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Cell lines expressing the β-subunit were then subjected to the second transfection with the gastric proton pump α-subunit (either wild type or mutant) cDNA that was cloned in pcDNA3.1(+)(ZEO), selected, and cloned in a selection medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin and 0.2 mg/ml Zeocin. Mock cells were also constructed by successive transfection with vacant pcDNA3 and pcDNA3.1(+)(ZEO) vectors following the same method as for the construction of the cell lines expressing the α- and β-subunits. Preparation of Membrane Fractions, SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis, and Western Blot—Membrane fractions of HEK cells were prepared as postnuclear pellets as described previously (4Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described elsewhere (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Membrane preparations (30 μg) were incubated in a sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at room temperature for 10 min and applied to the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with a 4% Block Ace solution (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co.). The proteins were detected with an anti-gastric proton pump α-subunit antibody, Ab1024, which recognizes the carboxyl terminal peptide (residues 1024–1034) (28Asano S. Arakawa S. Hirasawa M. Sakai H. Ohta M. Ohta K. Takeguchi N. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 59-64Google Scholar). After incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, the bands were visualized with the ECLplus kit (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned using luminescent image analyzer LAS-1000plus (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Quantification of Expressed α-Subunit in the Membrane Fraction— The content of α-subunit expressed in the membrane fraction was quantified by comparing with the α-subunit content in a pig gastric vesicle preparation as a standard. The α-subunit comprises about 60% of the protein content of the gastric vesicle preparation judged by the densitometric analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel using ATTO densitographic software (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane fractions of HEK cells as well as a series of diluted gastric vesicle preparations were run on the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blotting. The blots were scanned using optical scanning system Multi-Analyst (Bio-Rad). The signal intensity of the α-subunit bands of a series of diluted gastric vesicle preparations was plotted against the content of the α-subunit as a standard curve. The content of α-subunit in membrane fractions was estimated from the linear range of the standard curve of the gastric vesicle preparation as described previously (26Kimura T. Yoshida A. Tabuchi Y. Ikari A. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 923-932Google Scholar). Assay of K+-ATPase Activity—K+-stimulated ATPase (K+-ATPase) activity was measured in 1 ml of a solution containing 50 μg of membrane protein, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, 2 mm ouabain, and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence and absence of 15 mm KCl. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the inorganic phosphate released was measured as described elsewhere (29Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Google Scholar). The K+-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between activities in the presence and absence of KCl. Specific K+-ATPase activities observed in the membrane fractions of the stable cell lines were calculated by subtracting the K+-ATPase activity observed in mock cells and expressed in micromoles of Pi/ milligrams of the α-subunit/hour. Protein was measured using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Rubidium Transport Assay—The 86Rb transport assay was performed as described previously (26Kimura T. Yoshida A. Tabuchi Y. Ikari A. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 923-932Google Scholar). One day before the transport assay, cells were seeded in two sets of 6-well collagen type I-coated plates (Asahi Technoglass), one set for the 86Rb transport assay and the other set for counting of cell number, and they were grown until confluence. For the 86Rb transport assay, the cells were washed with 2 ml of ice-cold wash solution containing 144 mm NaCl and 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. Cells in each well were incubated in 1 ml of a solution containing 144 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm RbCl (3 × 106 cpm 86Rb), 500 μm ouabain, and 10 μm furosemide at 37 °C for 10 min. Rubidium transport was assayed in the presence and absence of various concentrations of SCH 28080 or SPI-447. After 10 min of incubation, the supernatant was removed, and each well was washed with 2 ml of ice-cold wash solution. Cells were solubilized with 2 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. One milliliter of solution was mixed with 5 ml of an aqueous counting scintillant, ACS-II (Amersham Biosciences), and the radioactivity was counted. The 86Rb transport activity was normalized by the number of the cells and expressed in nanomoles of Rb/106 cells/minute. In the case of omeprazole treatment, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of omeprazole in 144 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 2 mm HEPES, pH 5.8, at 37 °C for 20 min before the transport assay. Homology Modeling of the Gastric Proton Pump α-Subunit—Multiple alignments of the transmembrane helices and luminal loops of rabbit SR Ca2+ pump, gastric proton pump (from different animal species), and rabbit Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunits were obtained by ClustalW program. Multiple alignments were used to identify residues predicted to face lipid because lipid-facing residues tend to be variable, whereas those involved in helix-helix contacts tend to be conserved (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar, 31Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Google Scholar). This was used to reduce the possibilities of different alignments. Aligned sequences were inspected and modified manually to avoid gaps within the transmembrane helices. Obtained alignments (Fig. 2) were identical to those previously reported by Ogawa and Toyoshima (31Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Google Scholar) except for the alignment of the M1 helix. 2H. Ogawa and C. Toyoshima, unpublished data. In the alignment of the M1 helix, we aligned the bending region of M1 in the E2(TG) form of SR Ca2+ pump, Asp59, with the predicted flexible region of M1 in the gastric proton pump α-subunit, Gly109. The resulting alignments of M1 are identical with those previously reported by Sweadner and Donnet (32Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (33Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Google Scholar). The three-dimensional models (E1 and E2 forms) of gastric proton pump α-subunit were constructed using the MODELLER6V2 program (34Sali A. Blundell T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Google Scholar) based on the atomic model of the Ca2+-bound form (E1 form, Protein Data Bank code 1EUL) and the thapsigargin-bound form (E2(TG) form, Protein Data Bank code 1IWO) of rabbit SR Ca2+ pump, respectively, with restriction of partial structures. Structures of long insertion (Gly2–Met50 and Arg658–Asn677) were restricted to the predicted structures obtained by PredictProtein (35Rost B. Methods in Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Google Scholar). Energy minimization was then carried out using the AMBER7 program (36Pearman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Google Scholar). Identification and visualization of cavities within an obtained model were calculated by the PASS program (37Patrick Jr., B.G. Stouten P.F.W. J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 2000; 14: 383-401Google Scholar). These models were visualized by the Turbo-Frodo program (38Jones T.A. Methods in Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Google Scholar). All calculations were done using a Silicon Graphics OCTANE graphic work station. Docking of Inhibitors to the Gastric Proton Pump α-Subunit—The docking of inhibitors to the α-subunit was performed by the AutoDock3.0 and AutoDockTools programs (39Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Google Scholar, 40Sanner M.F. Duncan B.S. Carrillo C.J. Olson A.J. Proceedings of the Pacific Symposium in Biocomputing '99, Hawaii, January 4–9, 1999. 1999; : 401-412Google Scholar). The three-dimensional coordinates of the inhibitor that has the least docked energy was chosen as the docked structure. Construction of M5 Mutants of the Gastric Proton Pump α-Subunit—Table I shows the expression level of the mutant α-subunit and the K+-ATPase activity found in the membrane preparations from cells transiently co-expressing the mutant α-subunit and the wild-type β-subunit. The K793A mutant showed very low or no K+-ATPase activity as reported previously (22Vagin O. Munson K.B. Lambrecht N. Karlish S.J.D. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7480-7490Google Scholar, 41Rulli S.J. Louneva N.M. Skripnikova E.V. Rabon E.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 27-34Google Scholar). The Y789A mutant also lost the K+-ATPase activity. Alanine mutants of Asn794 and Glu797, which likely coordinate the transporting cation, showed low K+-ATPase activity as reported previously (9Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1330-1337Google Scholar, 22Vagin O. Munson K.B. Lambrecht N. Karlish S.J.D. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7480-7490Google Scholar). Among them, it is very interesting that the Y801A mutant showed low sensitivity to SCH 28080, although this mutant retained K+-ATPase activity almost comparable to that found in the wild type. Even in the presence of 50 μm SCH 28080, the K+-ATPase activity of this mutant was inhibited by only 20%.

In the immunofluorescence study, a major portion of these mutant α-subunits was expressed at the cell surface, and there was no apparent difference in the intracellular distribution between the wild-type α-subunit and the Tyr801 mutant (data not shown). The cell lines expressing the Y801A mutant retained the 86Rb transport activity (0.88 nmol/106 cells/min), which was almost identical to that found in the cells expressing the wildtype gastric proton pump (0.88 nmol/106 cells/min). The cell line expressing the Y801S mutant showed a lower 86Rb transport activity (0.45 nmol/106 cells/min), whereas the cell lines expressing the Y801L and Y801F mutants showed higher 86Rb transport activities (1.04 and 1.72 nmol/106 cells/min, respectively) than the cells expressing the wild type. Mutants Y801A and Y801S showed much lower sensitivity to SCH 28080 than the wild type as shown in Fig. 3. The IC50 values of the wild type and mutants Y801A and Y801S were 1.2, 69, and 83 μm, respectively. The 86Rb transport activities found in these mutants were not completely inhibited even in the presence of 100 μm SCH 28080. Mutants Y801F and Y801L showed slightly lower sensitivity to SCH 28080 than the wild type as shown in Fig. 3. The IC50 values of mutants Y801F and Y801L were 3.1 and 5.5 μm, respectively. These mutants expressed in the membrane fraction of the stable cell lines also retained the K+-ATPase activity. Fig. 4 shows the effect of SCH 28080 on this K+-ATPase activity. The K+-ATPase activities of the Y801A and Y801S mutants showed much lower sensitivity to SCH 28080 than the wild type. Even in the presence of 100 μm SCH 28080, about 75 and 45% of the K+-ATPase activity was uninhibited for the Y801S and Y801A mutants, respectively. The K+-ATPase activities of the Y801F and Y801L mutants showed lower sensitivity to SCH 28080 than that of the wild type. The IC50 values of the wild type and the Y801F and Y801L mutants were 2.6, 5.0, and 19 μm, respectively. The finding that the Y801F mutant showed slightly lower sensitivity to SCH 28080 than the wild type is in good agreement with that reported by Vagin et al. (24Vagin O. Denevich S. Munson K.B. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12755-12762Google Scholar). They reported that this mutant showed 1.4-fold lower sensitivity to SCH 28080 in the NH4+-stimulated ATPase activity. The behavior of the Tyr801 mutants to SCH 28080 in the inhibition of K+-ATPase activity was comparable to that in the inhibition of 86Rb transport. Non-gastric isoforms of H+,K+-ATPase are expressed in distal colon and kidney and are involved in K+ reabsorption as well as acid secretion. They show lower or no sensitivity to SCH 28080. A human non-gastric H+,K+-ATPase, the ATP1AL1 gene product, showed lower sensitivity to SCH 28080 compared with the gastric proton pump, H+,K+-ATPase. The 86Rb transport activity of the ATP1AL1 gene product expressed in HEK-293 cells was inhibited by a high concentration of SCH 28080 with the Ki value of 42 μm (25Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O.

Mice deficient in bcl-2 (bcl-2-/-) develop renal hypoplastic/cystic dysplasia, a condition that leads to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The precise mechanism of action of bcl-2 has not been elucidated. bcl-2 may merely facilitate survival of precursor cells and/or may play a more ""active"" role during morphogenesis by interacting with other proteins such as paxillin. Recent work in this laboratory demonstrated that bcl-2 directly associates with paxillin. The data presented here demonstrate that the bcl-2 homology 4 (BH4) domain, specifically amino acids 17–31, is necessary for the bcl-2 interaction with paxillin. Paxillin also associated with the BH4 domains of more closely related bcl-2 family members, bcl-xL and bcl-w, compared with that from the non-mammalian homologue ced9. Tyrosines 21 and 28 in the bcl-2 BH4 domain were essential for interaction with paxillin. In embryonic kidney organ culture, incubation with the bcl-2 BH4 domain resulted in inhibition of ureteric bud branching. Therefore, these data suggest that the interaction of bcl-2 with paxillin plays an important role during nephrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2030329379,"Octamers formed by the nonstructural protein NSP2 of rotavirus are proposed to function as molecular motors in the packaging of the segmented double-stranded RNA genome. The octamers have RNA binding, helix unwinding, and Mg2+-dependent NTPase activities and play a crucial role in assembly of viral replication factories (viroplasms). Comparison of x-ray structures has revealed significant structural homology between NSP2 and the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotidyl hydrolases, which in turn has suggested the location of the active site for NTP hydrolysis in NSP2. Consistent with the structural predictions, we show here using site-specific mutagenesis and ATP docking simulations that the active site for NTP hydrolysis is localized to residues within a 25-Å-deep cleft between the C- and N-terminal domains of the NSP2 monomer. Although lacking the precise signature HIT motif (HØHØHØØ where Ø is a hydrophobic residue), our analyses demonstrate that histidines (His221 and His225) represent critical residues of the active site. Similar to events occurring during nucleotide hydrolysis by HIT proteins, NTP hydrolysis by NSP2 was found to produce a short lived phosphorylated intermediate. Evaluation of the biological importance of the NTPase activity of NSP2 by transient expression in mammalian cells showed that such activity has no impact on the ability of NSP2 to induce the hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 or to interact with NSP5 to form viroplasm-like structures. Hence the NTPase activity of NSP2 probably has a role subsequent to the formation of viroplasms, consistent with its suspected involvement in RNA packaging and/or replication.

Rotaviruses, members of the Reoviridae, are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide (1Parashar U.D. Hummelman E.G. Bresee J.S. Miller M.A. Glass R.I. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2003; 9: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). The virion is a triple layered icosahedron with a genome consisting of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA that encode for six structural and six nonstructural proteins (2Kapikian A.Z. Hoshino Y. Chanock R.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Fundamental Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Press, Philadelphia2001: 1787-1833Google Scholar). NSP2 is a conserved, basic nonstructural protein (Mr = 35,000) encoded by the virus that is necessary for replication and packaging (3Ramig R.F. Petrie B.L. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chen D. Gombold J.L. Ramig R.F. Virology. 1990; 178: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NSP2 self-assembles into stable octamers that possess Mg2+-dependent NTPase activity (5Kattoura M.D. Chen X. Patton J.T. Virology. 1994; 202: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activity is associated with autophosphorylation of the protein via linkage of the cleaved γ-phosphate (6Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NSP2 octamers also have strong, sequence-independent single-stranded RNA binding activity capable of destabilizing RNA-RNA duplexes by an ATP- and Mg2+-independent process (7Taraporewala Z.F. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4519-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The activities of NSP2 when considered in concert with the ability of the octamers to undergo nucleotide-induced conformational shifts favor a role for NSP2 during replication as a molecular motor (8Schuck P. Taraporewala Z. McPhie P. Patton J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9679-9687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It can be predicted that NSP2 unwinds the template single-stranded RNA and functions, in coordination with the viral RNA polymerase, to overcome the entropy of genome packaging prior to or as the single-stranded RNA is replicated to double-stranded RNA.NSP2 co-localizes with NSP5, an O-linked glycosylated phosphoprotein, to cytoplasmic inclusions (viroplasms) that form in infected cells (9Gonzalez S.A.

Virol. 1998; 143: 981-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Viroplasms are viral factories in which genome packaging, replication, and early steps in virion morphogenesis are presumed to occur (10Petrie B.L. Greenberg H.B. Graham D.Y. Estes M.K.

When expressed in combination, NSP2 and NSP5 co-localize and form viroplasm-like structures in uninfected cells (13Fabbretti E. Afrikanova I. Vascotto F. Burrone O.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). NSP5 has weak autokinase activity and in vivo is found in several phosphorylated isoforms (28 and 32–34 kDa) (14Afrikanova I. Miozzo M.C. Giambiagi S. Burrone O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2059-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The function of NSP5 phosphorylation is not known but has been correlated with its localization to viroplasms and its association with NSP2 (15Poncet D. Lindenbaum P. L'Haridon R. Cohen J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 34-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Afrikanova I. Fabbretti E. Miozzo M.C. Burrone O.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2679-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NSP5, like NSP2, is a nonspecific RNA-binding protein and a component of replication intermediates (17Vende P. Taraporewala Z.F. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5291-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Kattoura M.D. Clapp L.L. Patton J.T.

Patton J.T. Virology. 1989; 172: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).The structure of the NSP2 octamer, recently solved at 2.6 Å, has led to suggestions concerning the nature of its interactions with NTP and RNA. NSP2 crystallized as a 4-2-2 octamer made up of two tetramers stacked tail-to-tail (Ref. 21Jayaram H. Taraporewala Z. Patton J.T. Prasad B.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Along the outer surface of the octamer are four highly basic grooves that probably serve as RNA-binding sites. NTP was proposed to bind to NSP2 within a 25-Å-deep cleft that forms between the C- and N-terminal domains of the monomer (Ref. 21Jayaram H. Taraporewala Z. Patton J.T. Prasad B.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and Fig. 1.). The location of the NTP-binding site was based on the superposition of the C-terminal domain of NSP2 with the catalytic core of protein kinase C-interacting protein (PKCI), 1The abbreviations used are: PKCI, protein kinase C-interacting protein; HIT, histidine triad; wt, wild-type; mt, mutant; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CKII, casein kinase II; p.i., postinfection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: PKCI, protein kinase C-interacting protein; HIT, histidine triad; wt, wild-type; mt, mutant; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CKII, casein kinase II; p.i., postinfection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a prototypical member of the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotide-interacting proteins (22Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of a precise signature HIT motif (HØHØHØØ where Ø is a hydrophobic residue) in NSP2, significant structural homology with PKCI suggested the existence of a HIT-like motif within its cleft with His225 representing the putative catalytic residue for hydrolysis (21Jayaram H. Taraporewala Z. Patton J.T. Prasad B.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).In this study, we used mutagenesis and computer modeling to identify residues within the cleft that participate in NTP hydrolysis by NSP2. These analyses indicate that His225 and other nearby residues of the predicted HIT-like motif of NSP2 are essential for NTPase activity, including two residues predicted to coordinate binding of Mg2+. Using mutant forms of NSP2, we also found that the NTPase activity is required for NSP2 autophosphorylation and NSP5 phosphorylation in vitro but that the level of the hydrolysis activity is not a direct predictor of the extent of phosphorylation of either of these proteins. Conversely transient expression studies indicate that the NTPase activity of NSP2, and thus NSP2 or NSP5 phosphorylation, have no role in the formation of viroplasms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Viruses—Fetal rhesus monkey kidney cells (MA104) were maintained in Medium 199 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Simian rotavirus SA11 was propagated and titered in MA104 cells.Expression Vectors—The bacterial expression vectors pQE60g8 (6Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pQE30g11 (17Vende P. Taraporewala Z.F. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5291-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) encode NSP2 with a C-terminal tag and NSP5 with an N-terminal tag, respectively, of six histidine residues. The NSP2 open reading frame of the pQE60g8 was mutated by PCR using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The following primer pairs were included in amplification reactions to produce pQE60g8 vectors encoding NSP2 with the mutations H110A (5′-TTAGAAAATTTGGTGATACGTAAAG-3′, 5′-AGCCCTTATTGATACTACTCGTGATA-3′; pQE60-g8/H110A), E153A (5′-GGAGAAATTGTATTTCAAAACGC-3′, 5′-TCCTGCTGCAGTTATTGTAGTTTCAA-3′; pQE60g8/E153A), Y171A (5′-GCTTTAGAACATCAATTGATGCCAA-3′; 5′-AGTTAGTTTCCACATGGTGAAGGC-3′; pQEg8/Y171A), K188A (5′-GCAGTTACATTGAACGAAGATAAACC-3′, 5′-ATATTCAATAAAATTCTGATCCAG-3′; pQE60g8/-K188A), H221A (5′-ACAGCTGGTAAGGGTCATTATAGAATTG-3′, 5′-GATTACAGCAAACTTGTTATATTGCC-3′ pQE60g8/H221A), K223A (5′-ACACATGGTGCGGGTCATTATAGAATTG-3′, 5′-GATTACAGCAAACTTGTTATATTGCC-3′; pQE60g8/K223A), H225A (5′-ACACATGGTAAGGGTGCTTATAGAATTG-3′, 5′-GATTACAGCAAACTTGTTATATTGCC-3′; pQE60g8/H225A), and R227A (5′-ACACATGGTAAGGGTCATTATGCAATTG-3′, 5′-GATTACAGCAAACTTGTTATATTGCC-3′; pQE60g8/R227A) (bases in primers used to change codons in the open reading frame for NSP2 to those for alanine are shown in bold). Following amplification (94 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle; 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 4 min, 35 cycles; 68 °C for 6 min, 1 cycle), products were gel-purified, treated with T4 DNA kinase, self-ligated, and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Appropriate plasmids were identified by DNA sequencing and transformed into E. coli M15(pREP4).The T7 transcription vectors SP72g8, SP72g8/E153A, SP72g8/K188A, and SP72g8/H225A, which contain complete open reading frames for either wild-type (wt) or mutant (mt) NSP2, were generated by PCR amplification of the coding region of pQE60g8, pQE60g8/E153A, pQE60g8/K188A, and pQE60g8/H225A, respectively. Amplification reaction mixtures also contained Elongase DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the primer pair 5′-CGGAATTCATGGCTGAGCTAGCTTGC-3′ (EcoRI site underlined) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAAACGCCAACTTGAGA-3′ (XhoI site underlined). The amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 1 cycle; 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2.5 min, 40 cycles. The amplified DNA product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into SP72. To construct the T7 transcription vector pGEM-4Z/g11, a fragment containing the open reading frame for SA11 NSP5 was released from pBR322g11 (23Mitchell D.B. Both G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 166244Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (a gift of Gerry Both) by digestion with HinPI and SacI and ligated into the AccI and SacI sites of pGEM-4Z. All plasmid contructs with the appropriate inserts were identified by DNA sequencing.Preparation of NSP2 and NSP5—NSP2 and NSP5 were expressed in E. coli M15(pREP4) using the vectors pQE60g8 and pQE30g11, respectively, and purified from bacteria lysates by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (6Taraporewala Z.

NSP2 was dialyzed against low salt buffer (LSB) (2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). NSP5 was dialyzed briefly against 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0) and 300 mm NaCl and then dialyzed extensively against LSB with 75 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard and by co-electrophoresis with known amounts of BSA by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Recombinant NSP2 was purified to near homogeneity using conditions described previously to obtain protein for crystallization (6Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant NSP5 contained trace (<1%) levels of DnaK (17Vende P. Taraporewala Z.F. Patton J.T. J.

After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, ADP and ATP in the mixtures were resolved by ascending TLC (6Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled spots on the sheets were detected by autoradiography and quantified with a PhosphorImager. ADP and AMP markers were generated from [α-32P]ATP using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase. Percentage of ATP hydrolysis = {quantity of [α-32P]ADP/(quantities of [α-32P]ADP + [α-32P]ATP)} × 100. The ATP hydrolysis value was corrected for background by subtracting the value obtained for a reaction mixture containing no protein. Relative specific NTPase activity represents the average ATP hydrolysis value/μg of protein as calculated from five assays carried out in parallel with each containing a different concentration of protein.In Vitro Phosphorylation of NSP2 and NSP5—Reaction mixtures for NSP2 autophosphorylation contained 28 pmol of NSP2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 20 μl and were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures for NSP5 phosphorylation contained 70 pmol of NSP5, 28 pmol of NSP2, or no NSP2 and otherwise contained the same components as used in NSP2 autophosphorylation assays. NSP5 phosphorylation assays were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Phosphorylated NSP2 and NSP5 were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography and quantified with a PhosphorImager.Hydrolytic Stability of NSP2 under Acid/Alkaline Conditions—Reaction mixtures for NSP2 autophosphorylation contained 28 pmol of NSP2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 20 μl and were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The control reaction mixture contained 500 units of casein kinase II (New England BioLabs), casein kinase II (CKII) buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 20 μl and was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). Membranes were air-dried and autoradiographed directly or after an individual incubation at 65 °C for 2 h in alkaline (1 m KOH) or acid (6 m HCl) conditions.Transient Expression of NSP2 and NSP5 in Vivo—Nearly confluent monolayers of MA104 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of ∼10 with SA11 rotavirus. At 1 h postinfection (p.i.), the inoculum was replaced with Medium 199, and the cells were further incubated for 8 h before being processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. To transiently express NSP2 and NSP5 in vivo, MA104 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7.3 (24Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At 1 h p.i., the inoculum was removed and replaced with a transfection mixture consisting of 4% LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of one or more T7 transcription vectors expressing NSP2 and/or NSP5. The cells were processed for immunofluorescence at 16 h p.i.Immunofluorescence Analysis—MA104 cells infected with rotavirus or transiently expressing NSP2 and/or NSP5 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and again washed with PBS. The cells were initially incubated in PBS containing 5% γ-globulin-free BSA for 15 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Afterward the cells were incubated with NSP2-specific guinea pig polyclonal antibody (6Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or NSP5-specific mouse monoclonal antibody 158G37 (15Poncet D. Lindenbaum P. L'Haridon R. Cohen J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 34-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:1,000 in PBS containing 3% BSA for 1.5 h. The cells were then washed successively with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA, and PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-guinea pig IgG and/or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), at a dilution of 1:1,000 in PBS containing 3% BSA were incubated with the cells for 1.5 h. The cells were washed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and with PBS alone and then incubated in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.1 m glycine for 10 min and in the same buffer containing 6 μg of Hoechst 33258 (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Pierce)/ml for 10 min to stain nuclei. Following successive washes with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and PBS alone, the coverslips were mounted in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was detected on a Leica TCS NT inverted confocal microscope with an attached UV laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). Images were overlaid using Adobe PhotoShop Version 5.5.Radiolabeling of NSP2 and NSP5 in Vivo—MA104 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of ∼10 with SA11 rotavirus. At 1 h p.i., the inoculum was replaced with Medium 199. At 8 h p.i., the medium was replaced with either Cys-,Met-free minimal essential medium or phosphate-free minimal essential medium. At 9 h p.i., these media were replaced respectively with Cys-,Met-free minimal essential medium containing 25 μCi of [35S]methionine/ml (>1,000 Ci/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and with phosphate-free Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium containing 25 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/ml (9,000 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 3 h, the cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg of aprotinin and 0.5 μg of leupeptin/ml. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. For vTF7.3-infected cells programmed to transiently express NSP2 and/or NSP5, the cells were labeled beginning at 14 h p.i. with [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate and harvested as described above.Molecular Simulation—The crystallographic data of rotavirus NSP2 (Protein Data Bank code 1L9V) was used for all calculations. The hydrogen atoms of the protein were assigned using CHARMm (Version 27) (25Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13833) Google Scholar) and then energy-minimized using a simulated annealing protocol. The simulated annealing consisted of 500 ps with an initial and a final temperature of 450 and 200 K, respectively. The temperature was decreased in steps of 5 K/10 ps. The other non-hydrogen atoms were restrained during this simulation. The calculations were performed using a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 80. The Autodock 3.02 (26Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8944) Google Scholar) program was then used with the energy minimized NSP2 structure to perform a docking simulation of an ATP molecule. Representations of protein and ATP ligand were prepared using Insight II (27Accelrys Insight II and Delphi User Guide. Accelrys, San Diego, CA1997Google Scholar). The partial charges were assigned using the Consistent Valence Force Field. Unless otherwise stated, all H2O molecules were removed. Atomic solvation parameters and fragmental volumes were assigned to the protein using the Addsol program. The grid maps were calculated using Autogrid and were centered on the putative ligand-binding site (NSP2 cleft). The volume chosen for the grid maps was 81 × 81 × 81 points with a grid-point spacing of 0.375 Å. Autotors was used to define the rotatable bonds in the ATP. For the docking simulation of ATP the bonds between Pβ–O3B and Pγ–O3B were restrained, emulating the conformation in which ATP is bound to the Mg2+ ion. The Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm was used for all docking calculations.RESULTSSelection of Residues in NSP2 for Mutagenesis—The 25-Å-deep cleft between the C- and N-terminal domains of NSP2 encoded by rotavirus SA11 is the proposed site of NTP hydrolysis (Ref. 21Jayaram H. Taraporewala Z. Patton J.T. Prasad B.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and Fig. 1, A and B). Within this region, His221 was suggested as the first histidine of a HIT-like catalytic triad based on structural superposition with a similar residue (His110) of PKCI, and His225 was proposed to be the second histidine of the triad and, possibly, the histidine that carries out the nucleophilic attack (21Jayaram H. Taraporewala Z. Patton J.T. Prasad B.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of NSP2 encoded by group A, B, and C rotaviruses shows that residues forming the cleft are highly conserved despite sequence similarity of only ∼32% between NSP2 of group A and B rotaviruses and ∼55% between NSP2 of group A and C rotaviruses (Fig. 1D). The conservation of a cluster of residues in the vicinity of His225 suggests the presence of a motif, His221-Gly-(Lys/His)-Xaa-His225-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Val, within the cleft that may function in NTP binding and hydrolysis. Certainly the presence of conserved basic residues within this motif (His221, Lys/His223, His225, and Arg227) and surrounding it (Lys188 and His/Lys110) impart an electropositive surface potential to the cleft that makes it suitable for nucleotide binding. Flanking the motif are highly conserved hydrophobic residues (Leu111, Ile/Val157, Val158, Met/Ile167, Ile/Met220, Val229, and Leu/Val234) that likely participate in maintaining the structural integrity of the cleft. Also located within the cleft are Glu153 and Tyr171, residues that based on ordered density peaks noted in the solved structure of NSP2 were proposed to coordinate the binding of Mg2+ (21Jayaram H. Taraporewala Z. Patton J.T. Prasad B.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These putative Mg2+-coordinating residues are conserved among NSP2 encoded by different groups of rotaviruses (Fig. 1D).To identify the NTPase catalytic site, eight residues in the SA11 NSP2 cleft were selected for site-directed mutagenesis based on the x-ray structure of the protein (21Jayaram H. Taraporewala Z. Patton J.T. Prasad B.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), surface exposure (Fig. 1C), and the conservation of the residues among group A, B, and C rotaviruses (Fig. 1D). These residues, His110, Glu153, Tyr171, Lys188, His221, Lys223, His225, and Arg227, were subsequently mutated to alanine. NSP2 proteins containing a mutation are indicated in italics, e.g. H110A. The expression and purification of the NSP2 mutants were carried out following procedures previously established for wtNSP2 (6Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the quaternary structure, and hence the multimeric state, of the mutant proteins were comparable to that of wt-NSP2, the mutant proteins along with protein size markers were subjected to rate zonal centrifugation (6Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sedimentation properties of the NSP2 mutants were indistinguishable from wtNSP2, which migrates in a 5–20% sucrose gradient as an ∼10 S species (data not shown).Glu153, Tyr171, Lys188, His221, His225, and Arg227 Are Essential for NTPase Activity—NSP2 possesses a Mg2+-dependent NTPase activity that hydrolyzes the β–γ phosphodiester bond of any of the four NTPs with similar efficiency (6Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To compare their NTPase activities, wt and mt forms of NSP2 were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with [α-32P]ATP and MgCl2. The products of the hydrolysis reactions were resolved by TLC and identified by autoradiography (Fig. 2A). The average specific NTPase activity of each mutant was determined and then normalized to that of wtNSP2. As shown in Fig. 2B, most of the NSP2 mutants were affected in their NTPase activity. Based on their NTPase activities, the mutants could be broadly grouped as severely affected (retaining ≤10% of activity), viz. E153A, Y171A, K188A, H221A, H225A, and R227A; moderately affected (retaining ∼25% activity), viz. K223A; and minimally affected (retaining ∼65% activity), viz. H110A. Thus, the near complete loss of NTPase activity resulted from mutation of any of the following residues: His221 and His225, the first two histidines of the proposed catalytic triad; Lys188 and Arg227, conserved basic residues in the cleft; and Glu153 and Tyr171, the putative Mg2+-coordinating residues (Fig. 2B). Hence these residues have critical roles in the efficient hydrolysis of NTP by NSP2.Fig. 2NTPase activity and autophosphorylation of NSP2 mutants. A, 32P-labeled ADP generated in reaction mixtures containing no protein, or 28 pmol of wt or mt protein, and 10 μCi of [α-32 P]ATP was detected by TLC and autoradiography. B, same as A except for each protein, five separate but parallel assays were performed differing only in amount of wt or mt NSP2 included (14, 28, 56, 84, or 112 pmol). 32P-Labeled ADP in reaction mixtures was resolved by TLC, quantified with a PhosphorImager, and used to calculate relative specific NTPase activity. Values representing the averages of two independent sets of experiments were reported as a percentage of the wtNSP2 NTPase activity. C, reaction mixtures containing 28 pmol of wt or mt NSP2 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. 32P-Labeled NSP2 was detected by autoradiography. D, values determined for phosphorylation of wt and mt NSP2 from three independent experiments were averaged and normalized to wtNSP2. Error bars represent the S.E. NSP2-P, phosphorylated NSP2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutation of His110 and Lys223 yielded proteins that retained ∼65 and 25%, respectively, of the NTPase activity of wtNSP2, suggesting that these residues may not be directly involved in hydrolysis. Unlike Glu153, Tyr171, Lys188, His221, His225, and Arg227 that are strictly conserved in group A, B, and C rotaviruses, His110 and Lys223 are conserved in groups A and C but not in group B where residue 110 is a lysine and residue 22"
https://openalex.org/W2074760000,"RANK Ligand (RANKL) is a critical osteoclastogenic factor that is expressed on stromal cells and osteoblasts. Most resorption stimuli induce osteoclast formation by modulating RANKL gene expression in marrow stromal/osteoblast cells. However, it is unclear how these stimuli modulate RANKL gene expression in the bone microenvironment. To characterize the transcriptional control of human RANKL gene expression in stromal/osteoblast cells, we PCR-amplified and cloned a 2-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the RANKL gene, using normal human osteoblast derived genomic DNA as a template. Sequence analysis identified the presence of several potential Heat Shock Factor (HSF) responsive elements (HSE) in the human RANKL gene promoter region. Co-expression of HSF-1 or HSF-2 with the RANKL gene promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid in human osteoblastic cells (NOBC) demonstrated a 2-fold and 4.5-fold increase in promoter activity, respectively. RT-PCR analysis for HSF-1 and 2 mRNA expression in human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (SAKA-T) and osteoblast cells detected only HSF-2 expression. As evident from EMSA analysis, in contrast to 1,25(OH)2D3 SAKA-T cells treated with b-FGF demonstrated increased levels of HSF-2 binding to the HSE present in the RANKL gene promoter region. Immunocytochemical staining further confirmed nuclear localization of HSF-2 in both SAKA-T transformed stromal cells and human bone marrow derived primary stromal/preosteoblastic cells in response to b-FGF treatment. Furthermore, b-FGF treatment of SAKA-T cells transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the hRANKL HSE region (-2 kb to -1275 bp) upstream to a heterologous promoter showed increased levels of transactivation. Western blot analysis further demonstrated enhanced levels of RANKL expression and HSP-27 phosphorylation in SAKA-T cells treated with b-FGF. In addition, overexpression of HSF-2 in SAKA-T cells resulted in a 5-fold increase in the levels of RANKL expression in these cells. These data further suggest that HSF-2 is a downstream target of b-FGF to induce RANKL expression in stromal/osteoblast cells, and that HSF may play an important role in modulating RANKL gene expression in the bone microenvironment.

Receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) 1The abbreviations used are: RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; HSF, heat shock factor; HSP, heat shock protein; b-FGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; HSE, HSF response element; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family and is a critical osteoclastogenic factor that is expressed on bone marrow stromal/osteoblast cells (1Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocrine Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RANKL is also expressed on cells of the immune system including T cells, dendritic cells, and fibroblastic stromal cells (2Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L.A. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 3Quinn J.M. Horwood N.J. Elliott J. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There have been three isoforms of RANKL identified in the murine bone marrow stromal cell line ST2 and the pre-osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 (4Ikeda T. Kasai M. Utsuyama M. Hirokawa K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of RANKL in marrow stromal/osteoblast cells was also reported in pathological conditions such as Paget’s disease and Multiple Myeloma (5Menaa C. Reddy S.V. Kurihara N. Maeda H. Anderson D. Cundy T. Cornish J. Singer F.R. Bruder J.M. Roodman G.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1833-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Roux S. Meignin V. Quillard J.

Several osteotropic factors/resorption stimuli including 1,25-(OH)2D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin-11, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induce osteoclast differentiation through up-regulation of RANKL expression on marrow stromal/osteoblast cells (7Nakashima T.

Lorenzo J.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2374-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) but the regulation of RANKL expression appears to be complex. Hofbauer et al. (9Hofbauer L.C. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. Khosla S. Bone. 1999; 25: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) have previously reported that IL-1β and TNF-α but not IL-6 stimulate RANKL expression in human osteoblastic cells. In addition, b-FGF has been shown to stimulate RANKL production through COX-2 mediated prostaglandin synthesis in mouse osteoblastic cell (10Nakagawa N. Yasuda H. Yano K. Mochizuki S. Kobayashi N Fujimoto H. Shima N. Morinaga T. Chikazu D. Kawaguchi H. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, b-FGF has also been shown to induce RANKL expression in both human bone marrow stromal cells and vascular endothelial cells via non-prostaglandin-mediated mechanisms (11Colin-Osdoby P. Osdoby R.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; (abstr.): M134Google Scholar). Therefore, the downstream targets for b-FGF actions that modulate RANKL expression are unclear. Similarly, lipopolysaccharide treatment of primary murine osteoblasts results in increased levels of RANKL expression through Toll-like receptors (12Kikuchi T. Matsuguchi T. Tsuboi N. Mitani A. Tanaka S. Matsuoka M. Yamamoto G. Hishikawa T. Noguchi T. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3574-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) has been shown to dramatically increase the expression of anti-CD3-induced RANKL expression in activated T cells (13Wang R. Zhang L. Zhang X. Moreno J. Celluzzi C. Tondravi M. Shi Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, cellular stress has been implicated in osteoclastogenesis (14Ishijima M. Rittling S.R. Yamashita T. Tsuji K. Kurosawa H. Nifuji A. Denhardt D.T. Noda M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how these stimuli modulate RANKL gene expression in the bone microenvironment. Although multiple osteotropic factors including b-FGF are known to modulate RANKL expression, but not common regulatory mechanisms known. Even less is known about control of the human RANKL gene expression in stromal/osteoblast cells. Recently, the mouse RANKL gene 5′-flanking regions were isolated and shown to have a TATA box, CCAAT boxes, and putative Cbfa1 and vitamin D responsive element (VDRE) motifs (15O'Brien C.A. Kern B. Gubrij I. Karsenty G. Manolagas S.C. Bone. 2002; 30: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Maeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cbfa1 did not regulate the murine RANKL gene promoter activity, however it demonstrated binding to the consensus motifs present in the promoter region, suggesting a novel function for Cbfa1 in RANKL gene expression (16Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Maeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). More recently, Geoffroy et al. (17Geoffroy V. Kneissel M. Fournier B. Boyde A. Matthias P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6222-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) have developed transgenic mice overexpressing Cbfa1/Runx2 in cells of the osteoblastic lineage and showed that RANKL levels were markedly increased in transgenic cells and enhanced bone resorption in vivo. Similarly, functional VDRE were identified in the murine RANKL promoter region by transient expression of luciferase reporter gene constructs in murine ST-2 stromal cells (18Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). TGF-β has been shown to induce RANKL expression in endothelial cells by stimulating transcription factors that bind to the CRE-like domains in the murine RANKL gene promoter (19Ishida A. Fujita N. Kitazawa R. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although immediate upstream sequences from the transcription start site (215 bp) of the mouse and human RANKL gene appear to be conserved (74% identity), there is no significant homology of sequences further upstream (15O'Brien C.A. Kern B. Gubrij I. Karsenty G. Manolagas S.C. Bone. 2002; 30: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine if common regulatory elements in the hRANKL promoter region that may be involved in transcriptional control, we have cloned and sequence confirmed the hRANKL promoter region. We have further identified the presence of several HSE in the hRANKL gene promoter region. Two members of the heat shock transcription factor family, HSF-1 and HSF-2 both function as transcriptional activators of heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression (20Mathew A. Mathur S.K. Jolly C. Fox S.G. Kim S. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7163-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). HSP are molecular chaperones that catalyze protein folding and modulate HSF activation (21Snoeckx L.H.E.H. Cornelussen N.R. Van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Reneman R.S. Van Der Vusse A.G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1461-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). HSF-1 gene knockout mice have been shown to exaggerate production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α (22McMillan D.R. Christians E. Forster M. Xiao X. Connell P. Plumier J. Zuo X. Richardson J. Morgan S. Benjamin I.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8005-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, HSF-1 has been shown to repress interleukin 1β gene transcription through physical interaction with the nuclear factor of IL-6 (23Xie Y. Chen C. Stevenson M. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11802-11810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HSF play important roles in inflammatory cytokine expression. HSF-1 has been shown to be a negative regulator of TNF-α expression in murine macrophage cells (24Singh I.S. Viscardi R.M. Kalvakolanu I. Calderwood S. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has been reported that various extracellular and intracellular factors associated with several pathological conditions resulted in activation of HSP and HSF modulating the gene transcription (21Snoeckx L.H.E.H. Cornelussen N.R. Van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Reneman R.S. Van Der Vusse A.G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1461-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). High level expression of RANKL in the bone microenvironment play important role in osteoclastogenesis and high bone turnover. Furthermore, transgenic mice overexpressing soluble RANKL demonstrated severe osteoporosis (25Mizuno A. Kanno T. Hoshi M. Shibata O. Yano K. Fujise N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K. Tsuda E. Murakami A. Yasuda H. Higashio K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2002; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the effect of osteotropic stimuli on HSP/HSF activation and the role that HSF may play in the transcriptional control of hRANKL gene expression are unknown. Therefore, we examined the functional role of HSF in the transcriptional regulation of the RANKL gene expression in stromal/osteoblast cells present in the bone microenvironment. Reagents—b-FGF (FGF-2) was purchased from R&D systems Inc (Minneapolis, MN). Restriction endonucleases used were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA) and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. HSF-1 and HSF-2 cDNA containing plasmids were a generous gift from Dr. Robert E. Kingston, Harvard Medical School, Boston. Cloning and Identification of HSE in the hRANKL Gene Promoter—To characterize the transcriptional control of human RANKL gene expression in stromal/osteoblast cells, the RANKL gene promoter region (-1 to -2 kb relative to the transcription start site) was PCR-amplified using the template genomic DNA isolated from normal human osteoblast cells and RANKL gene-specific primers, Sense: 5′-TCC CCC GGG AAG AAC TCT GTA GGA ATG TAA CAT A-3′ and antisense 5′-GCC CCC GGG GTC CTG GGG CGC GCG GAG CGG-3′ (Genbank™ accession no. AF 333234). Sequences underlined are the SmaI restriction enzyme site added for subcloning purposes. The PCR-amplified RANKL promoter fragment was subcloned into the PCR 2.1 TA cloning vector, and the resulting plasmid termed TA-hRANKLP 8 was sequence analyzed using the TF data base search. The presence of potential HSE, NGAAN contigs (26Fernandes M. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) in the hRANKL gene promoter region were thus identified. hRANKL Gene Promoter Activity Assays—The human RANKL gene promoter fragment (2 kb) was excised from the TA-hRANKLP 8 plasmid by SmaI restriction enzyme digestion and subcloned into a pGL2 Basic vector at the SmaI site. The resulting plasmid was termed, hRANKLP 3 and contained the full-length RANKL promoter capable of driving luciferase reporter gene expression. RANKL promoter deletion mutants were also generated by digesting the TA-hRANKLP 8 plasmid by HindIII and EcoRV restriction enzymes. The hRANKL promoter fragment (-1 bp to -1.27 kb) thus obtained was gel-purified and was subcloned into the pGL2 Basic vector at the SmaI enzyme site. The resulting hRANKL promoter deletion plasmid was termed hRANKLP Δ1.2. Similarly a 0.72-kb EcoRV fragment obtained was subcloned into the pGL2 promoter plasmid at the SmaI site and the resulting plasmid termed hRANKLP Δ0.8. The hRANKL-luciferase reporter plasmid constructs (2 μg) were transiently transfected into stromal/osteoblast cells, SAKA-T and the normal human osteoblast cell line (NOBC) respectively by the Lipofect-AMINE method following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.). Human bone marrow-derived stromal cells, SAKA-T, and normal human bone-derived osteoblast cells (NOBC) were immortalized using Adeno-SV40 recombinant virus expressing SV40 virus large T-antigen as described previously (27Takahashi S.

Vautravers-Leone P. Kurihara N. Roodman G.D. Colgin L.M. Tullberg-Reinert H. Pfeifer A.M. Offord E.A. Mace K. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar). DNA transfection in these cells was normalized by co-transfection with the pCMV β-galactosidase reporter plasmid and measuring β-galactosidase activity in the total cell lysates (30Reddy S.V. Hundley J.E. Windle J.J. Alcantara O. Rebecca L. Leach R.J. Boldt D.H. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Min. Res. 1995; 10: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—Approximately 2 μg of total RNA was isolated from stromal/osteoblast cells using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx, Houston, TX) (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar) and reverse transcribed with random hexamers and AMV reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNA products were subjected to PCR analysis using gene-specific primers for HSF-1: Sense, 5′-TAC AGC AGC TCC AGC CTC TAC G-3′; Antisense, 5′-TGG CGT CCG TGA GGG CTG TGA C-3′ and HSF-2: Sense, 5′-GAA GAA CCT GTT TCA GCA CAT AGT C 3′; Antisense, 5′-GAT GTT ATG ATT CAA AAT GGA ATC CAT C-3′. Osteoblastic lineage markers, type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin mRNA expression were assessed using gene-specific primers as previously described (52Carmeliet G. Nys G. Bouillon R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The PCR mixture contained 0.15 μm concentrations of sense and antisense primers, 2 units of TaqDNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT), 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) in a 100-μl volume. The PCR amplification was performed by incubating the samples at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min and 60 °C for 1 min, with a final extension for 5 min at 60 °C. The amplified products were electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel with a 123-bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen Life Technologies) as a size marker. The bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Western Blot Analysis—SAKA-T cells were seeded in 10-cm plates at a density of 106 cells in 10 ml of α-MEM media containing 10% fetal calf serum and cultured for 48 h in the presence of b-FGF. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mm, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin (1 mg/ml). The protein content of the samples was measured using the BioRad reagent as per the manufacturer’s protocol (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Protein (20 μg) samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), using 12% Tris-HCl gels. The proteins were transferred from SDS gels onto a NitroBind nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA) for immunoblot analysis. Blocking was performed with 5% nonfat dry milk in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) buffer. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h with the anti-RANKL, HSF-2, HSP27, and antiphospho-HSP27 mouse monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:500 in 5% nonfat dry milk-TBST. The blots then were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, diluted 1:2500 in 5% nonfat dry milk-TBST, and developed using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The human RANKL gene promoter sequence containing HSE, (-1717 bp to -1750 bp relative to transcription start site) (Sense 5′-ATA AGA AAG AAG AAA TAT GGA ATT ATT TCC TGA-3′) was 32P radiolabeled and used as a probe. Nuclear extracts were prepared from SAKA-T cells (5 × 106) cultured in α-MEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum as described by Andrews and Faller (32Andrews N.D. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 192499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). The DNA binding reaction was performed in a volume of 15 μl, which contained the binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), 50 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC), 105 cpm of 32P-labeled probe, and nuclear extract (30 μg). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% native polyacrylamide gel with 10 mm Tris-glycine (pH 8.6) buffer followed by autoradiography. Immunostaining of HSF-2—Human bone marrow derived primary stromal cells/preosteoblastic cells were isolated as described (33Reffitt D.M. Ogston N. Jugdaohsingh R. Cheung H.F.J. Evans B.A.J. Thompson R.P.H. Powell J.J. Hampson G.N. Bone. 2003; 32: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow aspirates obtained from three normal subjects were suspended in 10 ml of α-MEM containing 20 units/ml heparin. Marrow mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation on Histopaque 1077 (Sigma Chemical Co.) and allowed to attach to plastic tissue culture dishes for 7 days. At confluence, the cells were subcultured in 6-well plates and only cells of the first three passages were used for further studies. However, none of the cells used were dexamethasone treated and therefore represent a heterogeneous population of cells containing osteoblast precursors. The cells were cultured in Lab-Tek Chamber Slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) and treated with or without b-FGF (4 ng/ml) for a 24-h period and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized by adding cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Endogenous peroxydase was inactivated by 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. Blocking was performed in 1% bovine serum albumin in saline. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of goat anti-human HSF-2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:500 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were washed and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated bovine anti-goat IgG (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h. Peroxidase activity was detected by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Pierce) in the presence of 0.1% hydrogen peroxide. Identification of HSE in the Human RANKL Gene Promoter Region—We PCR-amplified and cloned a 2-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the hRANKL gene using normal human osteoblast-derived genomic DNA as a template. Sequence analysis identified the presence of several potential HSE contigs in the hRANKL promoter region (Fig. 1). In addition, we have also identified the presence of motifs with significant identity (>85%) for other transcription factors such as CdxA, SRY, MZF-1, Nkx-2, NF-E2, AML-1a, C/EBP-β, ADR1, AP-4, GATA1, 2, and c-Myb in the hRANKL gene promoter sequence analyzed. Co-expression of HSF-1 or HSF-2 with the hRANKL gene promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid in normal human osteoblast-like cells (NOBC) demonstrated a 2-fold and 4.5-fold increase in promoter activity respectively (Fig. 2). Total RNA isolated from the stromal/osteoblast cells was subjected to RT-PCR analysis to determine the type of HSF mRNA expressed. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that HSF-2 but not HSF-1 was expressed in normal and pagetic stromal cells, SAKA-T and PSV10 cells respectively. Similarly, only HSF-2 was expressed in normal and pagetic osteoblast cells, NOBC and POBC, respectively (Fig. 3). These data suggest that the HSE identified in the RANKL promoter region are functional and that heat shock factors play an important role in modulating RANKL gene expression in stromal/osteoblast cells.Fig. 2Transcriptional regulation of hRANKL gene promoter activity by HSF-1 and HSF-2. RANKL promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (hRANKLP 3) was transiently co-expressed with HSF-1 and HSF-2 in normal osteoblast-like cells (NOBC). After 48 h, total cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection with a pCMV β-galactosidase reporter plasmid and assayed for β-galactosidase activity in cell lysates. *, p > 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3HSF mRNA expression in stomal/osteoblast cells.

As shown in the Fig. 4, nuclear extracts derived from the control SAKA-T cells demonstrated HSF-2 binding to the hRANKL HSE (32P-radiolabeled probe) and that b-FGF treatment of these cells significantly enhanced HSF-2 binding to the HSE. In contrast 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-8 m) treatment to these cells did not significantly affect HSF-2 binding. Furthermore, addition of 100× cold HSE probe to the EMSA reaction mixture completely blocked HSF-2 binding to the HSE further confirming the specificity of DNA binding. To further confirm the capacity of b-FGF to stimulate hRANKL promoter activity, we subcloned the hRANKL promoter region (-2 kb to -1275 bp), which contains the HSE, into the pGL2 promoter plasmid upstream to the SV40 minimal promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene expression. The resulting plasmid, hRANKLP Δ0.8 was transiently transfected into SAKA-T cells using the LipofectAMINE method and the cells cultured in the presence and absence of b-FGF. As shown in Fig. 5, total cell lysates obtained from the b-FGF-treated SAKA-T cells showed a significant increase in luciferase activity compared with untreated cells. However, b-FGF did not affect luciferase activity in cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-expression of pCMV β-galactosidase plasmid and measuring the β-galactosidase activity in these cells. Taken together, our data suggest that HSF-2 is the downstream target for b-FGF induction of RANKL expression in stromal cells. b-FGF Enhances RANKL Expression and HSP-27 Phosphorylation in SAKA-T Cells—Previously it has been reported that small HSPs such as HSP27 are inducible and phosphorylated in response to cellular stress (21Snoeckx L.H.E.H. Cornelussen N.R. Van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Reneman R.S. Van Der Vusse A.G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1461-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have further determined the effects of b-FGF on RANKL expression, the status of HSP27 and HSF-2 in SAKA-T cells. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, Western blot analysis of total cell lysates obtained from the SAKA-T cells treated with b-FGF (4 ng/ml) for a period of 24 h demonstrated significantly enhanced (2.5-fold) levels of RANKL expression. In contrast b-FGF treatment to these cells did not affect the levels of HSP27, but moderately (1.5–2-fold) increased HSF-2 expression. However, total cell lysates derived from the b-FGF treated cells demonstrated a significant increase (3-fold) in HSP27 phosphorylation compared with untreated SAKA-T cells. There was no significant change in the levels of HSP70 and HSP90 expression in these cells (data not shown). We have further confirmed these results in normal human bone marrow-derived primary stromal/preosteoblastic cells by immunoblot analysis. Similar to SAKA-T cells, primary stromal cells also demonstrated enhanced levels of RANKL expression in response to b-FGF treatment. Also, we have detected high levels of HSF-2 expression in these cells. Furthermore, b-FGF treatment moderately enhanced HSF-2 expression in primary stromal cells compared with SAKA-T transformed stromal cells. However, we have observed a 2.5-fold increase in HSP27 phosphorylation upon b-FGF treatment to these cells analogous to SAKA-T cells (Fig. 6C). Nuclear Localization of HSF-2 in Human Bone Marr"
https://openalex.org/W2005442004,"Comparative kinetic and structural analyses of a variety of polymerases have revealed both common and divergent elements of nucleotide discrimination. Although the parameters for dNTP incorporation by the hyperthermophilic archaeal Family B Vent DNA polymerase are similar to those previously derived for Family A and B DNA polymerases, parameters for analog incorporation reveal alternative strategies for discrimination by this enzyme. Discrimination against ribonucleotides was characterized by a decrease in the affinity of NTP binding and a lower rate of phosphoryl transfer, whereas discrimination against ddNTPs was almost exclusively due to a slower rate of phosphodiester bond formation. Unlike Family A DNA polymerases, incorporation of 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]X triphosphates (where X is adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine; acyNTPs) by Vent DNA polymerase was enhanced over ddNTPs via a 50-fold increase in phosphoryl transfer rate. Furthermore, a mutant with increased propensity for nucleotide analog incorporation (VentA488L DNA polymerase) had unaltered dNTP incorporation while displaying enhanced nucleotide analog binding affinity and rates of phosphoryl transfer. Based on kinetic data and available structural information from other DNA polymerases, we propose active site models for dNTP, ddNTP, and acyNTP selection by hyperthermophilic archaeal DNA polymerases to rationalize structural and functional differences between polymerases.

One group of analogs, 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]X triphosphates (where X is adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine; acyNTPs), 1The abbreviations used are: acyNTP, 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]X triphosphate, where X is adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine; acyCTP, 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl)]cytosine triphosphate; dCTPαS, 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); ddCTPαS, 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); ROX-, 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein. is particularly intriguing due to the wide spectrum of incorporation efficiency noted in different DNA polymerases, even within the same family of polymerase. For example, within Family B, the herpes simplex virus type 2 and human cytomegalovirus DNA polymerases incorporate acyNTPs more efficiently than ddNTPs, whereas human polymerase α more readily inserts ddNTPs over acyNTPs (42Reid R. Mar E.C. Huang E.S. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3898-3904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such differences have been exploited in drug therapies where infective agents encode polymerases that more readily insert acyNTP than does the host DNA polymerase (43Freeman S. Gardiner J.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 1996; 5: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hyperthermophilic archaeal DNA polymerases (Vent®, Deep Vent™, 9°N™, and Pfu) all incorporate acyNTPs with greater efficiency than ddNTPs (33Gardner A.F. Jack W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), in contrast with the behavior of Taq and Klenow fragment DNA polymerases, which prefer ddNTPs (33Gardner A.F. Jack W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 44Trainor G.L. U. S. Patent 5,558,991. February 7, 1996; Google Scholar). In the course of probing the determinants of nucleotide sugar discrimination in the Family B DNA polymerase from the hyperthermophilic Archaea Thermococcus litoralis (Vent DNA polymerase), we identified a mutant (VentA488L DNA polymerase) that reduces discrimination against several altered nucleotides (32Gardner A.F. Jack W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2545-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Gardner A.F. Jack W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Subsequent crystal structures of closely related DNA polymerases strongly suggested that this residue makes neither direct nor indirect contacts with the reaction substrates, raising questions about the structural basis for the observed variation (Fig. 1B). The universality of the A488L phenotype was later confirmed by homologous mutations in other hyperthermophilic DNA polymerases (Pfu A486Y DNA polymerase (34Evans S.J. Fogg M.J. Mamone A. Davis M. Pearl L.H. Connolly B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), 9°N A485L DNA polymerase (33Gardner A.F. Jack W.E.

Biol. 2002; 322: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)), further emphasizing a conserved role for this residue. Although instructive, these steady-state observations failed to address the underlying kinetic mechanisms responsible for nucleotide and nucleotide analog incorporation in hyperthermophilic DNA polymerases. Therefore, we initiated pre-steady-state kinetic studies to compare the modes of nucleotide discrimination in Vent and other DNA polymerases. Nucleotides, Nucleotide Analogs, DNA Substrate, and Enzymes—All DNA polymerases used in this study are 3′ → 5′ exonuclease-deficient as a result of mutation of catalytic aspartic and glutamic acids to alanine in the exonuclease active site (31Kong H.

Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These mutations prevent exonuclease removal of newly incorporated nucleotides or terminators. Vent and VentA488L DNA polymerases were purified as described previously (31Kong H. Kucera R.B. Jack W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1965-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined spectroscopically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 115,960 liter mol-1 cm-1. The concentration of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment exo-; New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) was calculated using a specific activity of 20,000 units/mg. dNTPs, ddCTP, and 9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl)]cytosine triphosphate (acyCTP) were from New England Biolabs Inc. 2′-Deoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (dCTPαS) and CTP were from Amersham Biosciences. 2′,3′-Dideoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (ddCTPαS) was from TriLink BioTechnologies (San Diego, CA). 6-Carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX)-derivatized nucleotide analogs ROX-ddCTP and ROX-acyCTP were kindly provided by Phil Buzby (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (Fig. 2). Oligonucleotides used to measure 2′-deoxycytosine 5′-triphosphate (dCTP) and cytosine analog incorporation were synthesized and purified by the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Division at New England Biolabs with a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) label on the primer strand for detection: 5′-FAM-CCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′ (25-mer) and 3′-GGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTGCCTCTTGTTT-5′ (36-mer). FAM-duplex DNA was formed by mixing equimolar amounts of the dye-labeled 25-mer primer with the 36-mer template in annealing buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 20 °C), 5 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA) and heating the solutions to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by incubation for 10 min at 60 °C and then cooling for 15 min at room temperature. Burst Kinetics and Active Site Titration—To measure the fraction of active Vent DNA polymerase and to determine the position of the rate-limiting step within the polymerase reaction pathway, we investigated whether the reaction followed burst kinetics. Rapid quench reactions were carried out as described below with 50 nm FAM-duplex DNA; 10 or 20 nm Vent or VentA488L DNA polymerase; and 0.20 mm dCTP, ddCTP, ddCTPαS, CTP, or acyCTP (final concentrations after mixing) in 1× ThermoPol buffer (10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25 °C), 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The steady-state rate (k2), the burst amplitude (A, which is equal to the active site concentration), and the initial rate of product formation (r, the burst rate) were extrapolated from the burst equation: [product] = A(1 - exp-rt) + k2t (45Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The steady-state turnover number (kSS) was calculated by dividing k2 by A. Measurement of DNA Polymerase Pre-steady-state Kinetic Parameters—Single turnover nucleotide incorporation reactions were initiated by mixing Vent or VentA488L DNA polymerase (0.10 μm) and FAM-duplex DNA (0.050 μm) in 1× ThermoPol buffer together with an equal volume of nucleotides or nucleotide analogs in 1× ThermoPol buffer. The reactions were allowed to proceed for the indicated times and then quenched by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 0.35-0.40 m. Reactions in the range of 3 ms to 10 s were sampled using an RQF-3 rapid quenched-flow instrument (Kintek Corp., Austin, TX). Reactions with an initial time point >10 s were mixed and quenched manually. All Vent DNA polymerase reactions were analyzed at 60 °C. Although this temperature is lower than the optimal reaction temperature of 72 °C (31Kong H. Kucera R.B. Jack W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1965-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is the highest temperature at which the rapid quench instrument can be operated reliably. Single turnover acyCTP incorporation by Klenow fragment DNA polymerase was initiated by mixing 1.0 μm Klenow fragment DNA polymerase (exo-) and 0.10 μm FAM-duplex DNA substrate in 1× Klenow buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 2 mm MgCl2) with an equal volume of acyCTP in 1× Klenow buffer. Reactions were then incubated at 25 °C for various times and quenched manually with EDTA (0.1 m final concentration). Conversion of the fluorescently labeled DNA primer-template to product was monitored by denaturing PAGE and automated fluorescence detection methods. Product DNA was denatured by mixing a 7.5 μl aliquot of quenched sample with 45 μl of formamide and 1.5 mm EDTA and heating at 90 °C for 3 min. Fluorescent 5′-FAM-labeled 25-mer oligonucleotide substrate and 5′-FAM-labeled 26-mer oligonucleotide product bands were fractionated by electrophoresis on an 8.8 m urea and 16% polyacrylamide denaturing gel using an ABI377 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and quantified using GeneScan Version 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). The first-order rate constant for polymerase-catalyzed addition at each nucleotide concentration was calculated from a plot of ln[substrate] versus time. Rate constants (kobs) were subsequently plotted as a function of nucleotide or analog concentration and fitted to the hyperbolic equation: kobs = (kpol[nucleotide])/(KD + [nucleotide]), yielding kpol, the maximum rate of nucleotide addition, and KD, the dissociation constant for nucleotide binding (46Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The activation energy difference between dNTP and nucleotide analog incorporation was calculated by Equation 1 (47Fersht A.R. Shi J.P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Carter P. Waye M.M. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). ΔΔG‡=-RTln((kpol/KD)dNTP/(kpol/KD)nucleotideanalog)(Eq. 1) Single turnover kinetics require saturating enzyme concentrations. We established that 0.10 μm Vent DNA polymerase was sufficient under the reaction conditions described by demonstrating that the rates of ddCTP incorporation were the same using Vent DNA polymerase concentrations of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.40 μm (data not shown). Measurement of Pyrophosphorolysis Catalyzed by Vent DNA Polymerase—To measure the rate of DNA degradation by pyrophosphorolysis, Vent or VentA488L DNA polymerase (0.10 μm) was equilibrated with the DNA substrate (0.050 μm) in 1× ThermoPol buffer and then mixed with PPi in 1× ThermoPol buffer at 60 °C using rapid quench techniques as described above. The extent of pyrophosphorolysis at each time point was calculated by multiplying the mole fraction of each DNA species by the number of phosphodiester bonds hydrolyzed to generate that species. KD(PPi) and kpyro were derived using fitting protocols analogous to those described above for nucleotide addition. Analysis of dNTP Incorporation by Vent DNA Polymerase—Previous studies with Family A DNA polymerases have shown that the steady-state rate-limiting step for addition of a single correctly paired dNTP follows phosphodiester bond formation (8Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 13Brandis J.W. Edwards S.G. Johnson K.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consequently, the first round of polymerization occurs more rapidly than subsequent rounds, resulting in a rapid initial burst of product. Incorporation of dCTP by Vent DNA polymerase displayed a burst pattern similar to those seen with RB69 and AmpliTaq-CS DNA polymerases, with a rapid burst (kburst = 60 s-1) followed by slow steady-state turnover (kSS = 0.90 s-1) (Fig. 3A and Table I). As indicated above, the burst is diagnostic for a rate-limiting step following bond formation; moreover, its amplitude is equal to the concentration of active enzyme, indicating that >90% of the Vent DNA polymerase preparation was active. Under similar conditions, Vent DNA polymerase failed to show a significant burst with ddCTP (Fig. 3B) or CTP (data not shown) incorporation. These data suggest that the rate-limiting step during nucleotide analog incorporation has changed compared with dNTP. Upon substitution of ddCTP with ddCTPαS, both Vent and VentA488L DNA polymerases showed a 10- and 6-fold thio elemental effect (kburst(ddCTP)/kburst(ddCTPαS)), respectively (Table I), consistent with an altered rate-limiting step.Table IPre-steady-state burst kineticsEnzymekburst(dCTP)kSS(dCTP)kburst(ddCTP)kburst(ddCTPαS)s−1s−1s−1s−1Vent60 ± 400.90 ± 0.090.47 ± 0.050.044 ± 0.024VentA488L45 ± 90.10 ± 0.010.23 ± 0.020.039 ± 0.013RB69aRef. 25.230 ± 402.7 ± 0.2NDNDAmpliTaq-CSbRef. 13.50 ± 72.5 ± 0.2NDNDa Ref. 25Yang G.

Open table in a new tab Determinations of KD and kpol for dCTP addition by Vent DNA polymerase gave kinetic constants similar to those determined for other DNA polymerases (Fig. 4A and Tables II and III). The relatively high KD for nucleotides (KD = 70 μm) is similar to the Km for nucleotides determined in multiple turnover steady-state measurements (Km = 40 μm) (31Kong H. Kucera R.B. Jack W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1965-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic constants show little dependence on nucleotide identity, as similar Vent DNA polymerase binding (KD = 58 μm) and rate (kpol = 64 s-1) constants were observed for dATP incorporation. Substitution of dCTP with dCTPαS had little effect on binding (KD) or phosphodiester bond formation (kpol); thus, the polymerase displays a minimum thio elemental effect (kpol(dCTP)/kpol(dCTPαS) = 0.80) (Table II).Table IIPre-steady-state kinetic constants for nucleotide and nucleotide analog incorporation by Vent and VentA488L DNA polymerasesNucleotideVent DNA polymeraseVentA488L DNA polymeraseKDkpolkpol/KDSelectivityaSelectivity between incorporation of dCTP and other NTPs is the ratio of the efficiency of dCTP incorporation (kpol/KD) to the efficiency of CTP, ddCTP, or acyCTP incorporation.KDkpolkpol/KDSelectivityaSelectivity between incorporation of dCTP and other NTPs is the ratio of the efficiency of dCTP incorporation (kpol/KD) to the efficiency of CTP, ddCTP, or acyCTP incorporation.μms−1m−1 s−1μms−1m−1 s−1dCTP70 ± 766 ± 19.5 × 10577 ± 956 ± 37.3 × 105dCTPαS120 ± 4082 ± 136.6 × 1051.468 ± 5328.0 ± 0.34.1 × 1051.8CTP1100 ± 1000.160 ± 0.0051.5 × 1026000360 ± 300.70 ± 0.201.6 × 103450ddCTP46 ± 70.16 ± 0.013.5 × 10327018 ± 60.30 ± 0.021.8 × 10440acyCTP81 ± 257.6 ± 1.19.7 × 1041024.0 ± 0.413 ± 25.4 × 1051.4ROX-ddCTP10 ± 20.029 ± 0.0032.9 × 1033256.0bThe kinetic parameters for VentA488L DNA polymerase are from single determinations.0.2bThe kinetic parameters for VentA488L DNA polymerase are from single determinations.2.5 × 10430ROX-acyCTP8.0 ± 0.22.00 ± 0.012.5 × 10546bThe kinetic parameters for VentA488L DNA polymerase are from single determinations.1bThe kinetic parameters for VentA488L DNA polymerase are from single determinations.1.6 × 1054.5a Selectivity between incorporation of dCTP and other NTPs is the ratio of the efficiency of dCTP incorporation (kpol/KD) to the efficiency of CTP, ddCTP, or acyCTP incorporation.b The kinetic parameters for VentA488L DNA polymerase are from single determinations.

https://openalex.org/W2047812106,"Mitochondrial preproteins are synthesized in the cytosol with N-terminal signal sequences (presequences) or internal targeting signals. Generally, preproteins with presequences are initially recognized by Tom20 (translocase of the outer membrane) and, subsequently, by Tom22, whereas hydrophobic preproteins with internal targeting signals are first recognized by Tom70. Recent studies suggest that Tom70 associates with molecular chaperones, thereby maintaining their substrate preproteins in an import-competent state. However, such a function has not been reported for other Tom component(s). Here, we investigated a role for Tom20 in preventing substrate preproteins from aggregating. In vitro binding assays showed that Tom20 binds to guanidinium chloride unfolded substrate proteins regardless of the presence or absence of presequences. This suggests that Tom20 functions as a receptor not only for presequences but also for mature portions exposed in unfolded preproteins. Aggregation suppression assays on citrate synthase showed that the cytosolic domain of Tom20 has a chaperone-like activity to prevent this protein from aggregating. This activity was inhibited by a presequence peptide, suggesting that the binding site of Tom20 for presequence is identical or close to the active site for the chaperone-like activity. The cytosolic domain of Tom22 also showed a similar activity for citrate synthase, whereas Tom70 did not. These results suggest that the cytosolic domains of Tom20 and Tom22 function to maintain their substrate preproteins unfolded and prevent them from aggregating on the mitochondrial surface.

Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes as preproteins with N-terminal signal sequences (presequences) or internal targeting signals.

Cytosolic chaperones Hsc70 or Hsp90 carrying a substrate protein dock onto a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of Tom70 and transfer preproteins to another set of TPR domains that serve as a binding site for the substrate preproteins (18Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 19Brix J. Ziegler G.A. Dietmeier K. Schneider-Mergener J. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The association of chaperones with Tom70 prevents substrate preproteins from aggregating until the preproteins are transferred to the general import pore for subsequent membrane translocation (18Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). For Tom20-dependent preproteins, it is unclear how these are prevented from aggregating on the mitochondrial surface. Recently, we found that the cytosolic arylhydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP), a FKBP52 homolog, interacts with human Tom20 and that AIP stabilizes pre-ornithine transcarbamylase (pOTC), a presequence-containing preprotein, and facilitates its import into mitochondria (20Yano M. Terada K. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). AIP, which has a chaperone-like activity, appears to transfer a preprotein-Hsc70 complex to Tom20. However, the Hsc70 is not incorporated into the Tom20-preprotein complex when the preprotein is transferred to Tom20 (20Yano M. Terada K. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Komiya T. Rospert S. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that Tom20 itself has a function to prevent preproteins from aggregating on the mitochondrial surface. Human Tom20 has a presequence binding site that mainly consists of a TPR domain and a glutamine-rich segment (22Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The binding groove of Tom20 contains hydrophobic residues and interacts with the hydrophobic face of amphiphilic presequence peptides. However, Tom20 shows little specificity for binding to presequence peptides (23Obita T. Muto T. Endo T. Kohda D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, the cytosolic domain of Tom20 is able to bind to hundreds of mitochondrial presequences, although no obvious sequence homology exists among them (24von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Furthermore, peptide scan analysis suggests that Tom20 binds not only to the presequences but also to the mature portion of preproteins (25Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tom20 binding is not restricted to presequence-containing preproteins but can also associate with preproteins with internal targeting signals such as the phosphate carrier protein and mitochondrial porin (25Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Schleiff E. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that the cytosolic domain of Tom20 serves as a preprotein receptor that binds not only to presequences but also to the unfolded mature portion of preproteins. An aggregation suppression assay indicated that Tom20 has a chaperone-like activity to prevent a substrate protein, citrate synthase (CS), from thermal aggregation. Furthermore, the cytosolic domain of Tom22 showed a similar activity, whereas that of Tom70 did not. These results suggest that the cytosolic domains of Tom20 and Tom22, but not Tom70, maintain their substrate preproteins unfolded on the mitochondrial surface and prevent them from aggregation. Materials—Mitochondrial CS (EC 4.1.3.7) from pig heart was obtained from Sigma. The PTH-(69–84) peptide (EADKADVNVLTKAKSQ), corresponding to the region 69–84 of human parathyroid hormone, was purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). The presequence peptide (MLFNLRILLNNAAFRNGHNFMVRNFRCGQPLQ), corresponding to the presequence of human pOTC, was commercially synthesized. The anti-porcine CS antibody was purchased from Nordic Immunological Laboratories (Tilburg, The Netherlands). Anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antiserum was prepared as described previously (27Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Takeya M. Hoogenraad N. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26844-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids—Human Tom70 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_014820) (12Alvarez-Dolado M. Gonzalez-Moreno M. Valencia A. Zenke M. Bernal J. Munoz A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2240-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Suzuki H. Maeda M. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1895-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was excised and cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen). The resulting plasmid, pQE30-His6-cTom70, expresses the N-terminally histidine-tagged cytosolic domain of human Tom70 (residues 95–608). cDNA for pOTC-GFP (28Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Namchai C. Yamaizumi M. Hanson B. Hoogenraad N. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and GFP were PCR-amplified and cloned into pET-30a(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). The resulting plasmids, pET-30a(+)-pOTC-GFP-His6 and pET-30a(+)-GFP-His6, express C-terminally histidine-tagged pOTC-GFP and GFP, respectively. Expression and Purification of Proteins—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused human Tom20 and Tom22 proteins were expressed and purified as described (14Yano M. Hoogenraad N. Terada K. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7205-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Takeya M. Hoogenraad N. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26844-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To obtain the cytosolic domain of human Tom70, the pQE30-His6-cTom70 plasmid was transformed into SG13009 cells (Qiagen), and the expressed protein was purified, as the native protein, by metal chelation chromatography. To obtain pOTC-GFP-His6 and GFP-His6 proteins, the pET-30a(+)-pOTC-GFP-His6 or pET-30a(+)-GFP-His6 plasmid was transformed into SG13009 cells, respectively. The expressed proteins were purified by metal chelation chromatography under denaturing conditions in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride. In Vitro Binding Assay—Purified GST-fused proteins were absorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). A reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled proteins was mixed with the beads in the binding buffer (total 300 μl). Binding reaction was performed for 30 min at 25 °C with gentle shaking. Unbound proteins were removed by centrifugation in an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter unit (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the retained beads were washed once with binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by adding elution buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 15 mm glutathione), and the eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity in the gels was visualized and quantified using a FUJIX BAS2000 image plate analyzer (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Elution of proteins was checked by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The purified proteins pOTC-GFP-His6, GFP-His6, and CS were also subjected to the binding assay. They were denatured in 6 m guanidinium chloride and diluted into binding buffer containing GST-fused proteins prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The native form of CS solved in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, was also subjected to the binding assay. Binding reaction and elution were performed as described above. The eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis. Chemiluminescence signals were visualized using ECL kits (Amersham Biosciences) and detected using a Las-1000 Plus Bioimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Chaperone Assay—Thermal denaturation of CS (0.15 μm) was carried out by incubation at 43 °C in 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5 (29Pirkl F. Fischer E. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37034-37041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Aggregation was measured by light scattering in a F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a thermostated cell holder at an excitation and emission wavelength of 360 nm. For SDS-PAGE analysis, aggregation was performed at 43 °C for 10 min. Samples were then cooled on ice for 5 min. Aggregated proteins were recovered by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The Cytosolic Domain of Tom20 Binds to Both the Presequence and the Unfolded Mature Portion of Preproteins—To examine whether Tom20 serve as a receptor only for the presequence or for the whole preprotein, a GST-capture binding assay was performed (Fig. 1). We first confirmed our previous observation (27Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Takeya M. Hoogenraad N. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26844-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that Tom20 binds to a presequence (Fig. 1A). Reticulocyte lysates containing in vitro translated proteins were incubated with GST fusions prebound with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and GST fusions and the bound proteins were then eluted with reduced glutathione. pOTC-GFP is a protein in which the presequence of pOTC is fused with GFP (28Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Namchai C. Yamaizumi M. Hanson B. Hoogenraad N. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8459-8465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Tom20-(25–145) is a GST-fused protein in which GST was N-terminally fused with residues 25–145 of Tom20 (27Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Takeya M. Hoogenraad N. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26844-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 2A). When in vitro translated pOTC-GFP and GFP were subjected to the binding assay, pOTC-GFP bound to Tom20, whereas GFP did not. This result, together with our previous observations (27Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Takeya M. Hoogenraad N. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26844-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), indicate that Tom20 binds to the presequence portion of pOTC-GFP but not to the GFP domain. We showed previously that the GFP domain of pOTC-GFP is stably folded when it is translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (27Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Takeya M. Hoogenraad N. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26844-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, Tom20 apparently does not bind to the folded form of GFP.Fig. 2Tom20 (T20) has a chaperone-like activity. A, the schematic structures of human Tom20 and its deletion mutants fused with GST are shown. Tom20-(25–145), Tom20-(25–125), and Tom20-(25–105) are fusion proteins in which GST was N-terminally fused with region 25–145, region 25–125, and region 25–105 of Tom20, respectively. TM, predicted transmembrane domain; TPR, tetratricopeptide-repeat domain; Gln, glutamine-rich segment. B, aggregation of CS, (0.15 μm) was monitored at 43 °C in the absence (open circle) or presence of 0.15 μm (closed triangle) or 0.5 μm (closed square) GST-fused Tom20 mutants by measuring the turbidity of the solution at 360 nm. Aggregation of GST-fused Tom20 mutants in the absence of CS (open square) was also monitored. C, aggregation of CS (0.15 μm) was performed in the presence of 0.5 μm GST-fused Tom20 mutants at 43 °C for 10 min. Aggregated proteins were recovered by centrifugation, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. % Input represents the percentage of input CS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then asked whether Tom20 can bind to the unfolded form of GFP. Purified GFP and pOTC-GFP denatured in 6 m guanidinium chloride were subjected to the binding assay (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, unfolded GFP as well as unfolded pOTC-GFP bound to Tom20. This suggests that Tom20 binds to the unfolded GFP polypeptide regardless of the presence or absence of the presequence portion. Thus, Tom20 appears to have a specificity for unfolded proteins. To confirm this, we used another protein, citrate synthase (Fig. 1C). CS is a mitochondrial protein that is initially synthesized as a precursor form with an N-terminal presequence. The precursor form of CS is imported into the mitochondria and processed into the mature form. Therefore, purified CS from pig heart has no presequence. When native and unfolded forms of purified CS were subjected to the binding assay, the denatured form of CS bound to Tom20, whereas the native form of the enzyme did not. This suggests that Tom20 can recognize the unfolded CS but not the folded enzyme. Taken together with the observation regarding GFP, Tom20 has a general specificity for unfolded proteins. These results suggest that Tom20 serves as a receptor for unfolded preproteins on the mitochondrial surface. Tom20 Has a Chaperone-like Activity—The observation that Tom20 binds to unfolded proteins suggests that Tom20 has a chaperone activity. Therefore, we examined whether Tom20 can prevent a substrate protein from aggregation by using an aggregation suppression assay (Fig. 2). Native CS was incubated with Tom20-(25–145) (Fig. 2A) at 43 °C, and the aggregation of CS was monitored by measuring the light scattering (Fig. 2B). When CS alone was incubated, it began to aggregate after 4 min and reached a plateau at ∼15 min. Aggregation of CS was not affected by the addition of GST. In contrast, when CS was incubated with equimolar Tom20-(25–145), aggregation was markedly suppressed. The addition of Tom20-(25–145) in 3.3-fold excess led to a stronger suppression. Thermal aggregation of CS was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). A large amount of aggregated CS was observed when CS was incubated with GST. In contrast, when CS was incubated with Tom20-(25–145), aggregation of CS was much reduced. These results indicate that the cytosolic domain of Tom20 has a chaperone-like activity to suppress thermal aggregation of CS. This activity may be important for Tom20 to maintain substrate preproteins unfolded on a mitochondrial surface and prevent them from aggregation. The deletion mutants of the cytosolic domains of Tom20, Tom20-(25–125), and Tom20-(25–105) (Fig. 2A) were also examined for chaperone-like activity (Fig. 2B). Tom20-(25–125) suppressed aggregation of CS to the same degree as Tom20-(25–145). However, Tom20-(25–105) suppressed the aggregation less effectively. In SDS-PAGE analysis, the aggregation of CS was efficiently reduced by Tom20-(25–125) as well as by Tom20-(25–145) and was partially reduced by Tom20-(25–105) (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that Tom20 has chaperone-like activity and that the region 106–125 of Tom20 is important for effective chaperone-like activity. The region 106–125 is partially involved in the binding site for presequence peptides (22Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of this region in Tom20 significantly reduced the binding of presequence peptides to Tom20 (27Yano M. Kanazawa M. Terada K. Takeya M. Hoogenraad N. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26844-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is likely that the binding site for presequence peptides is identical or close to the region responsible for chaperone-like activity. The Presequence Binding Site of Tom20 Is Responsible for a Chaperone-like Activity—Presequence peptides of preproteins directly bind to Tom20 (22Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the binding site of Tom20 for presequence peptides is also responsible for the chaperone-like activity, the addition of a presequence peptide will block the active site and inhibit the chaperone-like activity. To check this possibility, we investigated the effect of a presequence peptide on the chaperone-like activity of Tom20 (Fig. 3). When CS was incubated with Tom20-(25–145), aggregation of CS was suppressed as in Fig. 2B, indicating again that Tom20 has a chaperone-like activity (Fig. 3A). The addition of a control peptide (PTH-(69–84) peptide) did not influence the chaperone-like activity of Tom20-(25–145). In contrast, the addition of a presequence peptide increased CS aggregation, suggesting that the presequence peptide inhibits the chaperone-like activity of Tom20. The presequence peptide itself did not increase CS aggregation (data not shown). In SDS-PAGE analysis, the addition of the presequence peptide increased the amount of aggregated CS (Fig. 3B), confirming that the chaperone-like activity of Tom20 is inhibited by the presequence peptide. These results suggest that the binding site of Tom20 for presequences is also responsible for the chaperone-like activity. The Cytosolic Domain of Tom22 Also Has a Chaperone-like Activity—Because the preproteins initially recognized by Tom20 are subsequently transferred to Tom22, Tom22 as well as Tom20 may have a chaperone-like activity. Therefore, we examined a chaperone-like activity of Tom22 (Fig. 4). A series of GST-fused Tom22 deletion mutants (Fig. 4A) were examined for aggregation suppression of CS (Fig. 4B). When CS was incubated with Tom22-(1–71), the aggregation of CS was strongly suppressed, suggesting that the cytosolic domain of Tom22, as well as Tom20, has a chaperone-like activity. Tom22-(1–62) and Tom22-(1–48) also suppressed the aggregation. These results indicate that the region 1–48 of Tom22 is important for the chaperone-like activity. In contrast, Tom22-(102–142) did not suppress the aggregation, suggesting that the intermembrane space (IMS)-faced domain of Tom22 has no chaperone-like activity. SDS-PAGE analysis also showed that the aggregation of CS is largely suppressed by a series of the cytosolic domain mutants of Tom22 but not by the IMS domain (Fig. 4C). In the binding assay, denatured CS associated with the cytosolic domain of Tom22 but not with the IMS-faced domain (Fig. 4D). Native CS did not bind to either domain. These results indicate that the cytosolic domain of Tom22 binds to unfolded protein. Thus, Tom22 also has a function to maintain substrate preproteins in an unfolded state and prevent them from aggregation. Tom70 Has Only a Weak Chaperone-like Activity for CS— Finally, we examined whether the cytosolic domain of Tom70 can suppress the thermal aggregation of CS (Fig. 5). When CS was incubated with Tom70-(95–608), a histidine-tagged cytosolic domain of Tom70, the turbidity started to increase after 4 min (Fig. 5A). During the incubation from 4 to 10 min, the turbidity observed in the presence of Tom70-(95–608) was a little lower than control (CS alone). However, after ∼10 min the turbidity in the presence of Tom70-(95–608) increased much higher than control, probably due to thermal aggregation of Tom70-(95–608) itself. In SDS-PAGE analysis, the aggregated CS was reduced a little by the addition of Tom70-(95–608) (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the cytosolic domain of Tom70 has only a weak activity to suppress the aggregation of CS. Although the importance of cytosolic chaperones in mitochondrial protein import has been established (1Mori M. Terada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Terada K. Ohtsuka K. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Terada K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), there are few studies on the chaperone-like function of the receptor proteins on the mitochondrial surface. In the present study, we found that the cytosolic domain of Tom20 binds to unfolded proteins regardless of the presence or absence of presequence (Fig. 1). This suggests that Tom20 functions as a receptor not only for presequences but also for the unfolded portions of mature preproteins. Although a number of mitochondrial preproteins are known to be maintained in an unfolded state during their cytosolic transport and during translocation into mitochondria, the extent to which preproteins are in a folded or unfolded state on the mitochondrial surface was not known. Our finding suggests that preproteins are maintained unfolded throughout the import process from the cytosol to the inside of mitochondria. On the other hand, some preproteins are transferred to the mitochondrial surface in a folded state. They are then imported into the mitochondria by sequential unfolding of the preprotein driven by the pulling force applied by mitochondrial Hsp70 (30Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Also in this case, Tom20 and Tom22 may serve as receptors for partially unfolded portions of the preproteins. The present results also suggest that Tom20 has a chaperone-like activity capable of suppressing the thermal aggregation of CS (Fig. 2). This activity may be important for maintaining mitochondria-targeted preproteins unfolded on the mitochondrial surface and suppressing their aggregation. Because preproteins that failed to be translocated into mitochondria are rapidly degraded (20Yano M. Terada K. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Wright G. Terada K. Yano M. Sergeev I. Mori M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the activity of Tom20 may increase the efficiency of preprotein import by preventing preproteins from degrading. The importance of this activity for the mitochondrial protein import was suggested by our recent finding on AIP (20Yano M. Terada K. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The chaperone-like activity of AIP appears to stabilize matrix precursor proteins such as pOTC and facilitate its import into mitochondria. The importance of chaperones in protein transport is also illustrated by the role of trigger factor as a ribosome-associated protein that stabilizes the translocationcompetent form of a secretory precursor protein in Escherichia coli (32Crooke E. Guthrie B. Lecker S. Lill R. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Lill R. Crooke E. Guthrie B. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1013-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Trigger factor exhibits chaperone-like activity to suppress the thermal aggregation of substrate proteins (34Maier R. Scholz C. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the current studies, the active site of Tom20 responsible for chaperone-like activity was suggested to be identical or close to the binding site for a presequence peptide (Fig. 3). In general, chaperone proteins have a hydrophobic surface for binding to their unfolded substrate proteins. Because the binding groove of Tom20 for presequences is composed of hydrophobic residues (22Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), it is possible that the groove also serves as a binding site for unfolded proteins. More than one Tom20 molecule may sequentially bind to a single preprotein molecule to prevent it from aggregation. We suppose that a Tom20 molecule first binds to the presequence of a preprotein, and then another Tom20 molecule(s) binds to the mature portion. Then the preprotein, dissociated from the Tom20 molecules, is transferred to Tom22 and is translocated across the outer membrane through the general import pore. Mitochondrial preproteins may be strictly distinguished from other proteins by cooperative recognition by Tom20 and other receptors such as Tom22 and/or by sequential recognition of the multiple sites in presequences by these receptors. Furthermore, we also found that the cytosolic domain of Tom22 has a chaperone-like activity (Fig. 4). Because preproteins initially recognized by Tom20 are subsequently transferred to Tom22, it is not unexpected that Tom22 has a chaperone-like activity. Tom22 is contained in a large complex forming a general import pore. Therefore, Tom22 may maintain unfolded preproteins on a general import pore when preproteins are transferred from Tom20. In contrast, we found only a weak chaperone-like activity of Tom70 when CS was used as a substrate protein (Fig. 5). Because Tom70 preferentially recognizes preproteins with internal targeting signals, such as the ADP/ATP carrier protein, it is not unexpected that Tom70 cannot recognize CS as its substrate. Our finding of chaperone-like activities of Tom20 and Tom22 will contribute to further understanding of the properties and functions of these receptors. We thank Dr. Nicholas J. Hoogenraad (La Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia) for Tom70 cDNA and for critical reading of the manuscript. We also thank colleagues of our laboratory (Kumamoto University) for discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2014982863,"We demonstrated previously that laminar shear stress (LSS) enhances human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) wound closure via a vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin)-dependent mechanism. VE-cadherin can interact with p120 catenin (p120ctn) to mediate cell locomotion and proliferation. In this study, we hypothesized that p120ctn and an interacting protein, Kaiso, a transcriptional factor with which p120ctn may interact, would be expressed differentially at the wound border and away from the wound border in HCAEC exposed to LSS. One of the major goals in this study was to assess the differential gene expression of p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin in HCAEC at specific locations along the wound border to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in wound closure. We combined the technique of laser capture microdissection with quantitative real time PCR to compare p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin mRNA expression in HCAEC at and away from the wound border under LSS. Total RNA was isolated from 200–1,000 laser-captured HCAEC and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Detection of p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin mRNA was carried out using quantitative real time PCR. Normalization of cDNA templates was achieved by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) quantification. Quantitative real time PCR analysis revealed p120ctn:GAPDH ratios, Kaiso: GAPDH ratios, and VE-cadherin:GAPDH ratios, relative to static control for each set, of 0.99–4.18 (mean ± S.E., 1.94 ± 0.404), 1.0–5.24 (2.11 ± 0.51), and 0.99–1.42 (1.09 ± 0.09) after 3 h of LSS, respectively. With these techniques, we found that p120ctn and Kaiso transcripts were increased in laser-captured HCAEC at the wound border compared with HCAEC away from the wound border. In addition, differential expression of p120ctn and Kaiso mRNA was observed in HCAEC depending on how LSS was applied in relation to the wounding process. These techniques may have wide applicability for studying wound healing because gene expression of key adhesion molecules in HCAEC may now be determined from select regions of the endothelial wound border. We demonstrated previously that laminar shear stress (LSS) enhances human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) wound closure via a vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin)-dependent mechanism. VE-cadherin can interact with p120 catenin (p120ctn) to mediate cell locomotion and proliferation. In this study, we hypothesized that p120ctn and an interacting protein, Kaiso, a transcriptional factor with which p120ctn may interact, would be expressed differentially at the wound border and away from the wound border in HCAEC exposed to LSS. One of the major goals in this study was to assess the differential gene expression of p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin in HCAEC at specific locations along the wound border to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in wound closure. We combined the technique of laser capture microdissection with quantitative real time PCR to compare p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin mRNA expression in HCAEC at and away from the wound border under LSS. Total RNA was isolated from 200–1,000 laser-captured HCAEC and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Detection of p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin mRNA was carried out using quantitative real time PCR. Normalization of cDNA templates was achieved by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) quantification. Quantitative real time PCR analysis revealed p120ctn:GAPDH ratios, Kaiso: GAPDH ratios, and VE-cadherin:GAPDH ratios, relative to static control for each set, of 0.99–4.18 (mean ± S.E., 1.94 ± 0.404), 1.0–5.24 (2.11 ± 0.51), and 0.99–1.42 (1.09 ± 0.09) after 3 h of LSS, respectively. With these techniques, we found that p120ctn and Kaiso transcripts were increased in laser-captured HCAEC at the wound border compared with HCAEC away from the wound border. In addition, differential expression of p120ctn and Kaiso mRNA was observed in HCAEC depending on how LSS was applied in relation to the wounding process. These techniques may have wide applicability for studying wound healing because gene expression of key adhesion molecules in HCAEC may now be determined from select regions of the endothelial wound border.

Unlike β-catenin that directly links VE-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton via α-catenin, p120ctn regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is thought to occur via the Rho family of GTPases (3Noren N.K.

The importance of p120ctn in endothelial cell motility, adhesion, and migration (4Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) has been highlighted recently by the additional discovery of Kaiso, a protein that interacts with p120ctn and which is speculated to have a possible nuclear signaling function (4Reynolds A.B.

Vascular endothelial cells lining our blood vessels are constantly exposed to the hemodynamic forces of blood flow which produce a tangential force, a shear stress, upon the endothelial cell surfaces. Several laboratories including our own (6Brooks A.R. Lelkes P.I. Rubanyi G.M. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 9: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 7Chiu J.J. Chen L.J. Lee P.L. Lee C.I.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, the effects of laminar shear stress (LSS) on specific cells along a wound border and their gene expression of key adhesion molecules have not been examined. We demonstrated previously that LSS increases VE-cadherin protein expression, immunolocalization, and translocation during the process of wound closure (9Albuquerque M.L.C. Flozak A.S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 1006-1016Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, we relied on immunohistochemical techniques to detect changes in expression along a wound border, and protein expression by Western blot was reflective of the entire monolayer and not of specific cells along the wound border. Through adaptation and refinement of the techniques of laser capture microdissection (LCM) and real time PCR, we are now able to determine specifically expression of a given adhesion molecule mRNA at the wound border. In the current report we hypothesized that the gene expression of VE-cadherin, p120ctn, and Kaiso, a transcription factor putatively for p120ctn, would be regulated differentially by LSS and dependent on the specific location of the cells along the wound border and away from the wound border. Most techniques for assessing gene expression such as Northern blot analysis, RNase protection assay, and in situ hybridization cannot produce quantitative, cell-specific gene expression data. However, with microdissection methods one can selectively obtain pure cell populations from tissue sections for RNA analysis (15Boylan S. Honda S. Hjelmel L.M. Handa J.T. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 1167-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Simone N.L. Bonner R.F. Gillespie J.W. Emmert-Buck M.R. Liotta L.A.

The development of laser capture microdissection (LCM) and high through-put mRNA analysis platforms may therefore provide a unique and powerful opportunity to assess directly the molecular and genetic events that are associated with the initiation and progression of wound closure in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) subjected to LSS. Because LCM techniques have been optimized for tissue sections and not for cells grown on a glass slide, this is the first report to demonstrate the feasibility of LCM to capture and study the gene expression of specific cells in a wounded monolayer model of the coronary artery endothelium. In this study we also report the obstacles faced in optimally applying LCM to gene expression analysis of p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin in cultured HCAEC. The development of LCM has challenged the sensitivity of any chosen molecular assay because the amount of material obtained by LCM is limited. We present here an effective method for mRNA quantification for gene expression profiling from as few as 200 cells obtained by LCM followed by quantitative real time PCR analysis. We did not experience the RNA degradation that may occur during LCM procedures. By applying the techniques of LCM and real time PCR, we are now better positioned to study adhesion molecule gene expression in endothelial cells involved in the process of human coronary artery wound healing. Cell Culture—HCAEC were purchased from Clonetics, Inc. (San Diego) and cultured in Endothelial Growth Medium-2 (EGM-2, Clonetics, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HCAEC of six or seven passages were plated on collagen I-coated glass slides, incubated at 37 °C overnight, and used at 80–100% confluence by the time of the experimentation. Application of Shear Stress—HCAEC monolayers were placed in a parallel plate flow chamber (CytoShear) and subjected to two different protocols as described previously (9Albuquerque M.L.C. Flozak A.S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 1006-1016Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Albuquerque M.L.C. Flozak A.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 270: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Albuquerque M.L.C. Flozak A.S. J. Cell.

In the first protocol, HCAEC were preconditioned by applying a LSS of 12 dynes/cm2 for 18 h to achieve alignment, wounded with a metal spatula, and finally resheared at 20 dynes/cm2 for 1 or 3 h or left in static maintenance. In the second protocol, HCAEC were not preconditioned but instead immediately wounded and subjected to a LSS of 20 dynes/cm2 for 1 or 3 h or left in static maintenance. All HCAEC monolayers were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. LCM and Processing of HCAEC—Cells were washed with PBS and dehydrated in a graded series of 75, 95, and 100% ethanol for 1 min each. Finally, cells were submerged for 3 min in pure xylene, air dried for 5 min, and stored in a dry atmosphere. All steps were carried out under RNase-free conditions. LCM was performed using an Arcturus PixCell™ II system (Arcturus Engineering, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Slides were pretreated with PrepStrip (Arcturus Engineering, Inc.) to remove debris and to flatten the cells. Cells were visualized using a 10× objective on the Arcturus PixCell II system. The laser was focused using a power setting of 40 mW and a 7.5-μm spot size. Cell capture was performed using the fixed 7.5-μm spot size, varying the power setting between 40 and 80 mW, and using a pulse duration ranging from 1 to 2 ms. Samples of shear-stressed and static HCAEC at the wound border and several rows away from the wound border were captured selectively using CapSure LCM caps (Arcturus Engineering, Inc.). RNA Isolation from LCM—The CapSure caps containing LCM-derived cells were inserted into 500-μl microcentrifuge tubes containing 20 μl of extraction buffer. The tubes were inverted to ensure maximum contact between the buffer and the surface of the cap. The tubes were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. After gently vortexing the cap end of the tubes, they were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 1 min to remove all fluid from the cap surfaces, and the caps were removed. To the final volume of lysate, an equal volume of 70% ethanol was added, and the total RNA was isolated and eluted in 15 μl of elution buffer using the PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus Engineering, Inc.) within 2 h after LCM capture according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality and approximate yield of RNA were analyzed by real time PCR on an ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Optimization of the Reverse Transcription (RT) Reaction—RT was carried out in an identical 20-μl reaction with Superscript II RNase H- (Invitrogen) or with MuLV reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) using an oligo(dT) primer and 10 ng of RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real Time PCR Optimization—Real time PCR was performed either directly from RNA samples (one-step) or from reverse transcribed cDNA samples (two-step) for relative quantification of mRNA levels for the genes of interest and to determine which method, one-step or two-step, was of superior reproducibility. Quantitative real time PCR was performed using TaqMan® universal PCR master mix. Primers and TaqMan® probe were designed using PrimerExpress 1.0 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and detailed in Table I. Although p120ctn is expressed as multiple isoforms that share the central armadillo repeat domain but have divergent N and C termini, in the present study primers were designed to flank the conserved region shared by all isoforms of p120ctn and not targeted for a particular isoform (Table I). Vic-labeled ready-for-use GAPDH probe and primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems. For the two-step method, 10 μl of RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction. The cDNA was diluted to 5-fold, and 4 μl was used as a template in each PCR with PCR TaqMan® universal master mix containing 1× PCR buffer and the appropriate concentrations of gene-specific primers, TaqMan® probe (Table I), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.025 unit AmpliTaq Gold, and 0.2 mm dNTPs combined in a total volume of 25 μl. A negative control lacking RT enzyme was also included in each assay. For the one-step PCR method, 4 μl of 5-fold diluted RNA and MuLV reverse transcriptase were included in the reaction mixture. The PCR cycling for one-step PCR was performed at 42 °C for 30 min (reverse transcriptase reaction) followed by 95 °C for 10 min (denaturation) and then 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for a total of 40 cycles. The same cycling parameters were followed for two-step PCR with exception of the RT reaction. The cycle threshold (Ct) values corresponding to the PCR cycle number at which fluorescence emission in real time reaches a threshold above the base-line emission were determined. The Ct value assigned to a particular well thus reflects the point during the reaction at which a sufficient number of amplicons have accumulated, in that well, to be at a statistically significant point above base line.Table IPrimers and TaqMan® probes used for real time PCR Forward primer and the reverse primers and TaqMan® probes (FAM™-labeled) were designed using Primer Express software. p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin genes were analyzed with a TaqMan® PCR system.GeneSequence 5′—3′GenBankConcentrationPositionμmKaiso_FtctgctgaactccttgaatgagcNM_0067770.2551Kaiso_Rtcggtcttccacaataacggt123Kaiso_P6FAM-cgtggccatggactcttctgtgatgt-TAMRA0.2576p120_FgatgctgtcaagtccaatgcagNM_0013310.31674p120_Ragtactgggatgcccttgagc0.31773p120_P6FAM-ctgcaacacttatgctaccgcaatgacaag-TAMRA0.251704VEcad_FggcaagatcaagtcaagcgtgX799810.3109VEcad_Racgtctcctgtctctgcatcg0.3209VEcad_P6FAM-tcgcaagaatgccaagtacctgctcaa-TAMRA0.25132 Open table in a new tab Effect of LCM Processing on RNA Quality—Two sets of replicates of 100 and 1,000 HCAEC grown on glass slides were used in this study. One set of slides was simply washed with PBS, and the other set was processed for LCM as described previously. The total RNA isolated from both sets of samples was reverse transcribed with Superscript II RNase H- according to the supplier's instructions. The cDNA was diluted 10 times, and 4 μl of template was used in 25-μl PCRs for real time PCR and detection of GAPDH-specific amplification. RNA Yield and Laser Pulses—RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed from LCM samples containing HCAEC captured with 200, 400, 800, or 1,000 laser pulses. 1 μl of cDNA from each sample was used in a 25-μl PCR to determine the Ct values of GAPDH gene by real time PCR. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Real time PCR was performed for amplification of p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin mRNA using two-step PCR. In each assay, PCRs were performed in duplicate for the standards and unknown samples to determine the relative quantities of GAPDH, p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin amplicons. To compare expression patterns in HCAEC, mRNA template concentrations for GAPDH and the target genes were calculated using the standard curve method. Standard curves were constructed using 5-fold dilutions of HCAEC cDNA (1, 0.2, 0.04, 0.08, and 0.016 ng). The mRNA quantity of each amplicon was calculated for each standard and experimental sample. After normalization for GAPDH, target genes were expressed relative to the static control away from the wound border. End products of the PCR were run on a 2% agarose gel for confirmation of the correct amplicon size and identification of a single PCR band. Immunofluorescence—HCAEC monolayers subjected to experimental protocols were rinsed in PBS containing calcium and magnesium and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Cells were blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS, incubated in primary antibodies (rabbit anti-p120ctn, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA; or mouse anti-Kaiso, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco) diluted 1:500 in PBS, and visualized with species appropriate secondary IgG conjugated with Rhodamine Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:250 in PBS. Coverslips were placed over the slides with Aqua Poly Mount, and unsaturated images at and away from the wound edge were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40× oil objective. Images were analyzed for relative fluorescence intensity using Metamorph software version 4.5r (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Confocal images were color separated, and three measurement lines drawn across regions of the image spanning six cells and five cell junctions. Pixel intensity was measured over a scanning width of eight pixels along each line, and intensities of the three lines were averaged for each experimental condition in three separate experiments at the time point of 3 h. Pixel intensities were normalized for average background on each slide. For both p120ctn and Kaiso, average intensities were normalized to and expressed as a percentage of the static control for that experimental condition. Data Analysis—Samples of two different reactions from three independent experiments were grouped for statistical analysis. The efficiencies of PCRs using various primer sets were similar, and standard curve methods were performed to quantify relative amounts of transcripts as means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to test for differences of means between the groups. All probability (p) values were based on two-tailed t tests, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. LCM of HCAEC—Cell morphology with respect to cytoplasmic and nuclear details was well preserved after dehydration as shown in Fig. 1. HCAEC from the wound border and away from wound edge were captured. As shown In Fig. 1, HCAEC are indicated at the wound border (A), during microdissection (B), after capture (C), and on the cap (D). The arrows in A and C point to some representative cells captured at the wound border. Isolation efficiency was high with all HCAEC targeted by the laser being transferred to the capture disc. For some of the cell preparations, the strength and duration of the laser pulse were increased above the initial settings of 40 mW for 1.0 ms to ensure that cells adhered to the cap. Based on subsequent analysis, the use of longer duration (2 ms) and higher voltage (100 mW) for LCM capture were used and caused no damage to the RNA. RNA Quality—To determine whether RNA isolated from cells via dehydration and LCM was of the same quality as RNA isolated from cells that were not processed by LCM, RNA was isolated from 100 or 1,000 HCAEC by both techniques. The mean Ct values for the 100 and 1,000 PBS-washed (29.30 and 24.30, respectively) and dehydrated cells (28.80 and 23.90, respectively) were found to be similar (Fig. 2). The RNA isolated from LCM cells was of high quality without DNA contamination as evidenced with RT negative reaction in the PCR assay. RNA Yield after LCM—To determine whether the RNA yield corresponded to the quantity of cells collected by LCM pulses, RNA was isolated by LCM from HCAEC using 200, 400, 800, and 1,000 laser pulses. As shown in Fig. 3, the Ct values of the cDNAs from LCM samples obtained by real time PCR for GAPDH amplicon plotted against the number of pulses gave a correlation coefficient of 0.92. This demonstrates a linear relationship between the number of pulses and the Ct values (Fig. 3). RT Efficiency—To determine which reverse transcriptase was more efficient in transcribing RNA to cDNA, two popular commercially available enzymes were used in this study. The results obtained with first strand cDNA synthesis by Superscript II RNase H- (Fig. 4, curves 1 and 3) and MuLV (Fig. 4, curves 2 and 4) by real time PCR, based on the Ct values for each cDNA dilution, were almost identical. The differences in efficiency were negligible. Analysis showed similar amplification plots and Ct values for both reverse transcriptases. Standard Curve Method for Determining Relative Quantities of Gene Expression—The standard curves for GAPDH (Fig. 5A), p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin amplicons (data not shown) were generated by plotting Ct values versus log ng of cDNA. The slope of the regression line was used to calculate the amount of cDNA, and thus mRNA, in each sample. In Fig. 5B, amplification plots (fluorescence data versus cycle number) of GAPDH indicate the Ct values for each cDNA dilution. The mRNA expression levels of target genes were normalized to GAPDH mRNA. Expression Levels of p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin mRNA—In an attempt to understand the role of p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin in HCAEC wound closure under LSS, the mRNA expression patterns in HCAEC at and away from the wound border were compared with and without preconditioning prior to wounding and exposure to LSS or static maintenance for 1 h (Fig. 6A) and 3 h (Fig. 6B). The expression levels of p120ctn, Kaiso, and VE-cadherin were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression and then expressed relative to the static control away from the wound border for that experimental condition. As we have reported previously, preconditioning allows for a more physiologic milieu for HCAEC and a closer approximation to the state of HCAEC that line the coronary vasculature (9Albuquerque M.L.C. Flozak A.S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 1006-1016Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Albuquerque M.L.C. Flozak A.S. Exp.

The static control for this condition received 18 h of preconditioning with LSS prior to wounding and reexposure to LSS and differs from the static control of HCAEC that were not preconditioned and exposed to LSS only after the wounding process. RNA obtained from LCM samples (600 laser shots) was enough for analysis of three genes. Ethidium bromide-stained PCR products after real time PCR confirmed specific amplification for the three genes of interest (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 6, we selected the static control away from the wound border as the base-line control for each experimental condition. HCAEC in the more physiologic environment afforded by preconditioning demonstrated significantly greater p120ctn and Kaiso expression in cells at the wound border compared with cells away from the wound border at both time points. At 1 h (Fig. 6A) imposition of LSS after preconditioning produced a more robust and significant increase in p120ctn expression at the wound border compared with cells away from the wound edge and compared with p120ctn expression at 3 h (Fig. 6B). In preconditioned HCAEC that were subsequently left in static maintenance, p120ctn expression was increased significantly at the wound border compared with cells away from the wound edge at 1 h but not at 3 h. HCAEC that had not been preconditioned but rather were subjected to the immediate forces of LSS only after wounding had less robust p120ctn mRNA expression at 1 h compared with 3 h. However, despite the absence of preconditioning there remained a difference in p120ctn expression in cultured HCAEC at the wound border compared with cells away from the wound edge in this set. Thus, there seems to be an effect of the wounding process on p120ctn mRNA expression which is significantly augmented by LSS in HCAEC at 1 h after preconditioning and at 3 h without preconditioning. In both cases, p120ctn mRNA expression was increased significantly by LSS, albeit to different degrees. These data suggest that the physiologic environment of preconditioning is associated with earlier increases in p120ctn mRNA expression relative to cultured HCAEC lacking this milieu. The mRNA expression of Kaiso was increased in cells at the wound border compared with cells away from the wound edge at both time points but only in preconditioned HCAEC (Fig. 6, A and B). There were no significant differences in VE-cadherin mRNA expression at either time point.Fig. 7Confirmation of real time PCR products for target genes after 40 cycles. Ethidium bromide-stained PCR products of Kaiso (lane 1), VE-cadherin (lane 2), p120ctn (lane 3), and negative control (lane 4) after real time PCR are shown. A 100-bp ladder is on the right. No-template controls for RT and PCR were also performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunolocalization—All immunolabeling was performed 3 h after the wounding process. With respect to protein expression, p120ctn relative immunofluorescence nearly doubled at the wound border (relative intensity 190% of control) compared with cells away from the wound edge (relative intensity 60% of control) in preconditioned HCAEC and compared with HCAEC left in static maintenance (p = 0.0001, data not shown). As seen in Fig. 8, preconditioned HCAEC that were reexposed to LSS after wounding demonstrated greater immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of cells at the wound edge (B, arrowheads), and to a lesser but still significant degree at cell-cell junctions, compared with HCAEC away from the wound edge (A). In all cases Kaiso protein expression was significantly greater at the wound edge compared with cells away from the wound border, but preconditioning did not yield greater protein expression compared with cells that had not been preconditioned. In HCAEC that were not preconditioned, Kaiso protein expression was enhanced at the wound edge (D, arrows) compared with cells away from the wound edge (C). These data suggest that Kaiso protein expression is increased at the wound border and may not solely depend on LSS for its protein expression. We re"

Here we report the crystal structure of a metallo-dependent or class II FBP aldolase from an extreme thermophile, Thermus aquaticus (Taq). The quaternary structure reveals a tetramer composed of two dimers related by a 2-fold axis. Taq FBP aldolase subunits exhibit two distinct conformational states corresponding to loop regions that are in either open or closed position with respect to the active site. Loop closure remodels the disposition of chelating active site histidine residues. In subunits corresponding to the open conformation, the metal cofactor, Co2+, is sequestered in the active site, whereas for subunits in the closed conformation, the metal cation exchanges between two mutually exclusive binding loci, corresponding to a site at the active site surface and an interior site vicinal to the metal-binding site in the open conformation. Cofactor site exchange is mediated by rotations of the chelating histidine side chains that are coupled to the prior conformational change of loop closure. Sulfate anions are consistent with the location of the phosphate-binding sites of the FBP substrate and determine not only the previously unknown second phosphate-binding site but also provide a mechanism that regulates loop closure during catalysis. Modeling of FBP substrate into the active site is consistent with binding by the acyclic keto form, a minor solution species, and with the metal cofactor mediating keto bond polarization. The Taq FBP aldolase structure suggests a structural basis for different metal cofactor specificity than in Escherichia coli FBP aldolase structures, and we discuss its potential role during catalysis. Comparison with the E. coli structure also indicates a structural basis for thermostability by Taq FBP aldolase.

In subunits corresponding to the open conformation, the metal cofactor, Co2+, is sequestered in the active site, whereas for subunits in the closed conformation, the metal cation exchanges between two mutually exclusive binding loci, corresponding to a site at the active site surface and an interior site vicinal to the metal-binding site in the open conformation. Cofactor site exchange is mediated by rotations of the chelating histidine side chains that are coupled to the prior conformational change of loop closure. Sulfate anions are consistent with the location of the phosphate-binding sites of the FBP substrate and determine not only the previously unknown second phosphate-binding site but also provide a mechanism that regulates loop closure during catalysis. Modeling of FBP substrate into the active site is consistent with binding by the acyclic keto form, a minor solution species, and with the metal cofactor mediating keto bond polarization. The Taq FBP aldolase structure suggests a structural basis for different metal cofactor specificity than in Escherichia coli FBP aldolase structures, and we discuss its potential role during catalysis. Comparison with the E. coli structure also indicates a structural basis for thermostability by Taq FBP aldolase. Aldolases are essential enzymes that catalyze carbon-carbon bond formation in living organisms. They are ubiquitous and highly abundant in pathways of intermediate cellular metabolism such as gluconeogenesis, the Calvin cycle, and glycolysis, where they reversibly cleave ketohexose sugars. In synthetic chemistry, the action of aldolases is precisely controlled by the stereochemistry of these reactions, and thus these enzymes are often used as an alternative to conventional chemical methods in biotransformations and synthetic organic chemistry (1Takayama S.

Aldolases that cleave ketohexose substrates are among the most studied enzymes and, depending on their reaction mechanism, fall into two distinct groups. The class I enzymes utilize a lysine in Schiff base formation during catalysis and are mainly found in higher order organisms.

Structurally, these aldolases display an (α/β)8 barrel in a homotetrameric arrangement. In contrast, class II enzymes, found in yeast, bacteria, fungi, and blue-green algae, are most often homodimeric (α/β)8 barrels (20Blom N. Tetreault S. Coulombe R. Sygusch J. Nat. Struc. Biol. 1996; 3: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Cooper S.J. Leonard G.A. McSweeney S.M. Thompson A.W. Naismith J.H. Qamar S. Plater A. Berry A. Hunter W.N. Structure. 1996; 4: 1303-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and require for catalysis a divalent metal cation, typically a transition metal such as Zn2+. The divalent cation functions as a Lewis acid to polarize the carbonyl bond of the incoming ketoses, thereby promoting cleavage of the adjacent carbon-carbon bond as well as proton transfer during enamine formation. Class II aldolases are activated by monovalent cations, such as NH4+, are generally more stable than their class I counterparts, exhibit a wide range of substrate specificity, and are preferred for use in biotransformation chemistry (22von der Osten C.H. Sinskey A.J. Barbas C.F. Pederson R.L. Wang Y.-F. Wong C.-H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3924-3927Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 23Schoevaart R. van Rantwijk F. Sheldon R.A. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 4559-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Their reaction mechanisms are diverse. For instance, in one class II enzyme, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-galactarate aldolase, a phosphate anion rather than an amino acid side chain mediates proton transfer during enamine formation (24Izard T. Blackwell N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3849-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Chiral discrimination among class II aldolases is subtle, and in the case of the stereoisomers fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate, recognition and turnover depend on fine details of active site interactions made with substrate (25Hall D.R. Bond C.S. Leonard G.A. Watt C.I. Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22018-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Class II aldolases also represent potential targets for the development of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal drugs because they almost exclusively belong to prokaryotes, yeasts, and lower order eukaryotes. Among class II aldolases, FBP 1The abbreviations used are: FBP, d-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; SeMet, seleno-l-methionine; Taq, Thermus aquaticus. 1The abbreviations used are: FBP, d-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; SeMet, seleno-l-methionine; Taq, Thermus aquaticus. aldolase (E.C. 4.1.2) has been extensively characterized because of its important metabolic role in intermediate metabolism. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible aldol cleavage of FBP to the triose phosphates, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Substrate cleavage occurs during glycolysis, and the reverse reaction, aldol condensation, is used during gluconeogenesis or the Calvin cycle. Binding sites corresponding to both the catalytic divalent metal ion as well as the activation site of the monovalent cation were identified in the high resolution FBP aldolase crystal structure from Escherichia coli (21Cooper S.J. Leonard G.A. McSweeney S.M. Thompson A.W. Naismith J.H. Qamar S. Plater A. Berry A. Hunter W.N. Structure. 1996; 4: 1303-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal structures of E. coli FBP aldolase crystal structure in complex with a triose phosphate transition state analogue suggested structural features involved in substrate recognition and processing (26Hall D.R. Leonard G.A. Reed C.D. Watt C.I. Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One important issue that remained unresolved was apparent induced fit movements that class II FBP aldolases undergo during the catalytic cycle and their relationship with active site binding. To address conformational changes during catalysis, the crystal structure of class II FBP aldolase was determined to 2.3 Å Bragg spacing from the extreme thermophile Thermus aquaticus, successfully crystallized in the presence of sulfate, a phosphate anion analogue. The resultant crystal structure not only defined the role of the induced conformational changes during the catalytic cycle but also provided an explanation as to the metal cofactor affinity by Taq FBP aldolase for Co2+, rather than Zn2+, which is preferred in mesophiles such as E. coli. Structure Determination—Native crystals of Taq FBP aldolase were grown as described (27Sauvé V. Sygusch J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) by vapor diffusion using sitting drops made up of 8.75 μl of protein at 1.75 mg ml-1, 1 μl of 2 mm sucrose monolaurate, and 5 μl of the precipitant solution containing 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm CoCl2 that were then equilibrated against 1 ml of the precipitant solution at 295 K. The crystals harvested were cryoprotected in mother liquor to which had been added 20% glycerol before freezing in liquid nitrogen. The crystals of the seleno-l-methionine (SeMet) isoform of Taq FBP aldolase were obtained from hanging drops (27Sauvé V. Sygusch J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) that were made up of 5 μl of protein solution containing 0.25 mg ml-1 of Taq FBP aldolase and 2 μl of the precipitant solution made of 0.6 m ammonium sulfate and 20 mm citric acid, pH 4, that was equilibrated against 1 ml of the precipitant solution at 295 K. The crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 15% glycerol before freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data collection for the SeMet isoform of Taq FBP aldolase and the native protein in complex with cobalt has been described previously (27Sauvé V. Sygusch J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and is summarized in Table I. The structure solution strategy consisted of determining the structure of the SeMet isoform, crystallized in tetragonal space group I41 (a = b = 88.6 Å, c = 164.1 Å), and then using it to solve by molecular replacement the native structure, crystallized in monoclinic space group P2 (a = 99.5 Å, b = 57.5 Å, c = 138.6 Å, β = 90.25°). Multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) data were scaled together with the CCP4 (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19727) Google Scholar) program SCALEIT. Twelve of the fourteen selenium sites expected in the asymmetric unit were determined using SOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen D.W.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 52: 743-748Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The N-terminal SeMet was not found, probably because of positional disorder. Initial phases were calculated with the program MLPHARE (30Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar) and were improved by 200 cycles of solvent flattening and gradual phase extension from 3.65 to 2.8 Å resolution using the program DM (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19727) Google Scholar). The final R factor for the phase extension at 2.8 Å resolution was 0.347. The selenium positions allowed unambiguous matching of the electron density to the sequence and construction of an atomic model by using the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar). The modest resolution and apparent mobility of the two loop regions (residues 134-152 and 175-190), closing over the active site, made electron density tracing challenging.Table ICrystallographic data statisticsData collectionEdgePeakRemoteNativeCo2+YWavelength (Å)0.97910.97830.931.1051.105Resolution (Å)2.82.82.82.32.0Total data387,740390,048396,141989,324912,165Spage groupI41I41I41P2P2Unique data14,20814,07814,06568,76099,328Redundancy27.327.728.214.49.2Overall completeness0.9120.9110.9080.9770.928Completeness (last shell)0.9620.9600.9600.9380.929F2 > 3σ (F2)0.8590.8600.8510.7930.774Rmerge (overall)aRmerge=∑uniquereflections(∑i=1NIi-I¯)/∑uniquereflections(∑i=1NIi).0.0920.0880.0880.0750.067Rmerge (last shell)aRmerge=∑uniquereflections(∑i=1NIi-I¯)/∑uniquereflections(∑i=1NIi).0.4080.3670.4110.1950.400〈F2/σ(F2)〉32.232.229.130.027.5a Rmerge=∑uniquereflections(∑i=1NIi-I¯)/∑uniquereflections(∑i=1NIi). Open table in a new tab Structure determination was substantially aided by the higher diffracting native enzyme x-ray data. The preliminary SeMet model was successfully used as a search model to determine the native Taq FBP aldolase monoclinic crystal structure by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19727) Google Scholar). Structure solution revealed two half-tetramers in the asymmetric unit cell of the native enzyme, and except for the loop regions, the subunits within the half-tetramers could be related by noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry. The loops could be traced in three Taq aldolase protomers whose loop regions corresponded to an open conformation, whereas only one loop was fully traced in the remaining Taq aldolase protomer and corresponded to the loop region having a closed conformation. Electron density could not be associated with loop residues 140-147 in the closed conformer. Crystallographic Refinement—All Taq FBP aldolase structures were refined with the program CNS (31Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M.

The free R value (33Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3853) Google Scholar) was monitored throughout the refinement. Table II lists the final parameters obtained for the native model. In the half-tetramer containing both protomer conformations, electron density was weakest for residues 182-185 and 230 in the closed protomer and residues 134-151, 180-187, and 230-231 in the open conformer. The half-tetramer having all subunits in their open conformation density was weakest for residues 146-148, 182-187, and 229-231 in one subunit and 183 and 230 in the other subunit. The temperature factors of these residues refined to ∼40-50 Å2 only with the occupancy set to 0.5. The electron density was also weak for one of the two sulfate anions bound to the active site of all three protomers in their open conformation, and their occupancy was set to 0.5. Water molecules were initially identified in the Fo - Fc maps and screened for reasonable geometry and refined thermal factor <80 Å2. The tables show the overall crystallographic R factor and the free R factor for all observed reflections within the indicated resolution range. A Ramachandran plot analysis by the program PROCHECK (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19727) Google Scholar) indicates that 90.4% of all residues lie in most favorable regions, and 9.6% lie in additional allowed regions. The structure analysis also showed that all stereochemical parameters are better than expected at the given resolution. A Luzzati plot indicated a 0.33 Å error in the atomic coordinates.Table IICrystallographic refinement statisticsCrystallographic refinement of Taq aldolaseNativeCo2+YNo. of reflections68,51998,502Final model parametersNo. of amino acid residues1,2251,226No. of protein atoms9,1929,272No. of solvent molecules933974Resolution range (Å)40.4-2.340.6-2Last shell (Å)2.3-2.442-2.13R factor (overall)aRfactor=∑hkl||Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑hkl|Fabs| where N represents the number of equivalent reflections, and hkl represents the total number of unique Bragg reflections.0.2110.225R factor (last shell)aRfactor=∑hkl||Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑hkl|Fabs| where N represents the number of equivalent reflections, and hkl represents the total number of unique Bragg reflections.0.2650.358Rfree (overall)bRfree represents the R factor calculated for a test data set randomly selected from the observed reflections prior to refinement.

Open table in a new tab Substrate Modeling—The acyclic conformation of FBP (atomic coordinates from Protein Data Bank entry 1FDJ) was modeled into the active site of the refined structure by superposing the phosphate residues onto the sulfate-binding sites. The substrate was oriented in the active site such that its C1-phosphate coincided with the fully bound sulfate anion in the closed conformation and keto oxygen oriented toward the metal cation. In this orientation, the C6-phosphate could be readily superimposed onto the second sulfate-binding site. 200 cycles of coordinate energy minimization were then performed at 300 K using CNS (version 1.1) without the x-ray term to relax possible bad contacts introduced by substrate modeling into the active site. The coordinates of the protein and the substrate did not deviate significantly after minimization compared with the starting coordinates. Structure of the Taq FBP Aldolase Protomer—The structure of the Taq FBP aldolase protomer (subunit molecular mass of 33 kDa) adopts an (α/β)8 barrel fold (Fig. 1). The dimensions of the protomer are ∼70 Å in height and 45 Å in width, with a depth of 38 Å. The barrel is closed on its N-terminal end by an α-helix (α0) comprising residues 5-14. The core of the structure consists of an eight-stranded parallel β-strand assembly (strands labeled β1-β8), and each β-strand is accompanied by an α-helix. In addition to the eight times repeated β-strand-loop-α-helix-loop motif, the structure also contains a α-helix directly following a β-strand, in the case of β2 (labeled α-helix α2a), β7 (labeled α-helix α7a), and β8 (labeled α-helix α8a). Furthermore, the two C-terminal α-helices, α8a and α8, are antiparallel to each other and create an arm from the barrel that mediates oligomerization. Within each protomer, 27 pairs of residues are involved in electrostatic interactions. Quaternary Structure—Class II Taq FBP aldolase behaves as a homotetramer in solution with a molecular mass of 139 kDa (35Freeze H. Brock T.D. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 541-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) consistent with point group 222 (Fig. 2). The mutually perpendicular molecular dyads are defined as a right-handed set of axes P, Q, and R, where the P dyad is the crystallographic 2-fold axis, whereas the Q and R dyads are the local 2-fold axes. The dimensions of the tetramer are ∼103 Å in height (along the R axis), 91 Å in width (along the P axis), and 83 Å in depth (along the Q axis). Each protomer is in contact with the other three subunits within the tetramer. The intersubunit interactions across the Q dyad are more extensive than those across the R dyad (Fig. 2A). As a consequence, the former interface buries about three times as large a surface area (1844 Å2 buried per subunit, representing 27% of total surface area) as the latter (582 Å2 buried per subunit, or 9% of total surface area) upon tetramerization, whereas the interactions between the P axis-related subunits are minor (386 Å2 per subunit, 6% of total surface; Fig. 2B). This arrangement results in a dimer of dimers within the homotetramer. The interdimer interactions across the R dyad involve residues located on α-helices α2, α3, and α4, as well as those in the loop regions following α-helices α3 and α4. Dimer-dimer interactions implicate seven residues (Leu89, Arg90, Arg93, Gly95, Ala121, Val125, and Val127) that participate in hydrophobic interactions and four residues (Tyr85, Leu92, Arg93, and Phe96) that promote interdimer hydrogen bonds. More extensive and predominantly hydrophobic interactions are formed between Q axis-related subunits. Several secondary structural elements contribute up to 40 residues that participate in intersubunit (intradimer) van der Waals' contacts across the Q dyad. These contacts involve residues located on the α-helices α1, α2, α2a, α7a, α8a, and α8, as well as those located on the loops following α-helices α1, α6a, and α7a. This interface implicates 27 residues that participate in hydrophobic interactions, 12 residues (Asn25, Glu28, Tyr55, Gly56, Arg58, Thr261, Arg265, Pro272, Phe275, Arg278, Tyr280, and Arg285) that promote 19 intersubunit hydrogen bonds, and three electrostatic interactions between residues Glu70 and Arg58, Glu227 and Lys273, and Asp276 and Arg257. Only one electrostatic interaction is observed across the crystallographic related subunits, between residues Glu7 and Arg72. Finally, some hydrophobic interactions are also formed across the P axis-related subunits involving residues Met1, Glu7, Glu70, Ala71, and Arg72. Open and Closed Conformations—Taq FBP aldolase crystallizes using ammonium sulfate as the precipitating agent at physiological pH in space group P2 or at pH 4 in space group I41 (27Sauvé V. Sygusch J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The SeMet-substituted protein crystals are tetragonal, with two protomers in the asymmetric unit and diffraction to 2.8 Å Bragg spacing. Diffraction to 2.3 Å Bragg spacing was observed from native Taq FBP aldolase monoclinic crystals with four protomers in the asymmetric unit. The two protomers in the tetragonal cell are in the closed conformation, which contains one small loop (residues 175-190) and one large loop (residues 134-152) that close over the active site. These two loop regions show that weak electron density and residues 138-149 and 176-188 are disordered in the SeMet model. In contrast, native monoclinic protein crystals in the presence of the cofactor Co2+ comprise one protomer in the closed conformation shown in Fig. 3B, with continuous electron density for residues 1-139 and 148-305 and three protomers in the open conformation having electron density for all 305 residues shown in Fig. 3A. Application of the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry thus generates one tetramer having all four protomers in the open conformation and one tetramer with two protomers in the open conformation and two protomers in the closed conformation. Cobalt in the Active Site—The catalytic cobalt in Taq FBP aldolase was identified based on its coordination and peak size in Fo - Fc electron density maps. During refinement, difference Fourier electron density maps were calculated from models comprising all atoms except those subsequently identified as cobalt cations. The three strongest peaks in the difference electron density maps were 24-28 times over the noise level. These three peaks are the best candidates for the binding sites of the catalytic Co2+ in the three subunits in their open conformation within the asymmetric unit. Interestingly, the protomer in the closed conformation has two mutually exclusive binding sites for cobalt metal cations (Fig. 4A). This dual binding is mediated by a conformational transition involving side chain rotations that occur following chelation by histidine residues 81, 178, and 208 (Fig. 4A). Because these two mutually exclusive Co2+ cations are only partially occupied, their corresponding peaks in the difference electron density maps are only half the height (∼14 times the noise level) of that of the single cobalt ion having full occupancy found in the other three subunits within the asymmetric unit that display the open conformation. Ligands for the two mutually exclusive cobalt cations in the closed protomer include nitrogen atoms from His81 (2.3 and 2.5 Å), His178 (2.1 and 2.4 Å), and His208 (2.2 and 2.4 Å) and one oxygen atom from a water molecule (2.3 and 2.8 Å), respectively (Fig. 4A).

When isolated from the Hodgkin's lymphoma analogous cell line L540 Ki-1/57 co-immunoprecipitated with a Thr/Ser protein kinase activity. It has been also found to interact with hyaluronic acid and has therefore been termed intracellular IHABP4 (hyaluronan-binding protein 4). Recent studies demonstrated, however, that Ki-1/57 engages in specific interaction with the chromo-helicase-DNA-binding domain protein 3, a nuclear protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to find proteins interacting with Ki-1/57 and identified the adaptor protein RACK1 (receptor of activated kinase 1). Next, we confirmed this interaction in vitro and in vivo, performed detailed mapping studies of the interaction sites of Ki-1/57 and RACK-1, and demonstrated that Ki-1/57 also co-precipitates with protein kinase C (PKC) when isolated from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated L540 tumor cells and is a substrate for PKC phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the interaction of Ki-1/57 with RACK1 is abolished upon activation of L540 cells with PMA, which results in the phosphorylation of Ki-1/57 and its exit from the nucleus. Taken together, our data suggest that Ki-1/57 forms a stable complex with RACK-1 in unstimulated cells and upon PMA stimulation gets phosphorylated on threonine residues located at its extreme C terminus. These events associate Ki-1/57 with the RACK1/PKC pathway and may be important for the regulation of its cellular functions.

The first monoclonal antibody that specifically detected the malignant Hodgkin's and Sternberg-Reed cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma was called Ki-1 and binds to the 120-kDa lymphocyte co-stimulatory molecule CD30 (Ki-1/120) on the surface of the Hodgkin's cells (1Schwab U.

Cell. 1992; 68: 421-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). It has however been noticed early on that this antibody also cross-reacts with an intracellular phosphoprotein antigen of 57 kDa termed Ki-1/57 (3Hansen H. Lemke H. Bredfeldt G. Könnecke I. Havsteen B. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1989; 370: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Froese P. Lemke H. Gerdes J. Havsteen B. Schwarting R. Hansen H. Stein H. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2081-2087PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation experiments performed with the Ki-1/57 antigen isolated from tumor cells demonstrated that it is associated with a serine/threonine protein kinase activity (5Hansen H. Bredfeldt G. Havsteen B. Lemke H. Res. Immunol. 1990; 141: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis showed that the Ki-1/57 antigen is located in the cytoplasm, at the nuclear pores, and in the nucleus, where it is frequently found in association with the nucleolus and other nuclear bodies (6Rohde D. Hansen H. Hafner M. Lange H. Mielke V. Hansmann M.L. Lemke H. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 473-482PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion of the Ki-1/57 antigen resulted in the cloning of a partial cDNA encoding Ki-1/57 (7Kobarg J. Schnittger S. Fonatsch C. Lemke H. Bowen M.A. Buck F. Hansen H.P. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar).

Later, another group cloned the full-length Ki-1/57 cDNA (8Huang L. Grammatikakis N. Yoneda M. Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29829-29839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Huang et al. (8Huang L. Grammatikakis N. Yoneda M. Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. J. Biol.

They also found that IHABP4/Ki-1/57 binds to other negatively charged glycosaminoglycans like chondroitin sulfate, heparane sulfate, and RNA, although with lower affinity. The functional meaning of Ki-1/57 interaction with these macromolecules remains open. When we were searching the sequence data bank for Ki-1/57 related molecules, we found the human protein CGI-55, which amino acid sequence has 40.7% identity and 67.4% similarity with that of Ki-1/57 (9Lemos T. Passos D.O. Nery F.C. Kobarg J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This high degree of similarity suggests that both proteins might be paralogues and may have related functions. CGI-55 has also been described to bind to the 3′-region of the mRNA encoding the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) type 1 (10Heaton J.H. Dlakic W.M. Dlakic M. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol.

We explored the yeast two-hybrid system to identify possible interacting proteins for both Ki-1/57 and CGI-55 and in this way obtain clues for the functional context of these proteins. Our analysis resulted in the identification of the human protein chromo-helicase-DNA-binding domain protein 3 (CHD3) as a partner for both proteins (9Lemos T. Passos D.O. Nery F.C. Kobarg J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The CHD proteins are members of the chromo domain family, a class of proteins that are involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (11Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C.

The binding of the proteins Ki-1/57 and CGI-55 to CHD3 might define them as a family of CHD3-binding proteins and suggested the possibility that they could be involved in nuclear functions associated with the remodeling of chromatin and the regulation of transcription. Whereas in the case of the CGI-55, 42% of the found interacting clones represented CHD3, only 4% of the clones interacting with Ki-1/57 represented CHD3 (9Lemos T. Passos D.O. Nery F.C. Kobarg J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we report that the vast majority of clones (54%) found to interact with Ki-1/57 represent the scaffold and regulatory protein RACK-1 (receptor of activated kinase 1), a protein that we did not identify in the interaction screen of the putative Ki-1/57 paralogue CGI-55. RACK1 has a molecular mass of 36 kDa and is composed of seven WD repeats (18McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol.

On a molecular level the interaction of RACK1 with Src has been described to result in an inhibition of the kinase activity of Src (25Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell.

Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14909-14917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although RACK1 has been reported to have a stimulatory effect on the substrate phosphorylation by PKC (22Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 39Csukai M. Chen C.H. DeMatteis M.A. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), others found that RACK1 does not influence the kinase activity of serine/threonine kinases such as PKC, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and casein kinase II (25Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the RACK1 activity on PKC may be influenced by the kind of substrate involved. Here we show that RACK1 interacts with Ki-1/57, confirm this interaction in vitro and in vivo, and map the interaction sites of Ki-1/57 and RACK-1 in detail. Furthermore, we found that Ki-1/57 is a substrate for PKC and that its interaction with RACK1 is abolished in the course of the PMA activation of the cells. Our data suggest that Ki-1/57 is involved in specific protein-protein interactions and provide a plausible explanation for the long known fact that Ki-1/57, which does not contain a kinase domain, in fact co-precipitates with kinase activity. The co-precipitated kinase activity appears to be PKC. This could be confirmed by the co-immunoprecipitation of Ki-1/57 with PKC, which associates with Ki-1/57 after PMA stimulation of the cells. Our results further suggest that the cellular functions of Ki-1/57 may be subject to regulation via a PKC/RACK1 pathway. Plasmid Constructions—Several sets of oligonucleotides were designed to allow subcloning of the complete Ki-1/57 coding region in different expression vectors. Insertion into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) allowed expression of Ki-1/57(1–413) as a C-terminal fusion to GST (GST-Ki-1/57). The cDNAs encoding full-length Ki-1/57, Ki-1/57(122–413), and the eight other indicated deletion constructs (numbered in the same way) were inserted into the yeast two-hybrid expression vector pBTM-116 (40Bartel P.L.

Other deletions were also subcloned into bacterial expression vectors peT28a, pProEx, or pGEX to allow their expression as His6-tagged or GST-tagged fusion proteins. In a similar fashion the cDNAs encoding the indicated deletions of the protein RACK-1 were amplified and inserted into the yeast two-hybrid vector pGAD424 (Clontech), and full-length RACK1 was inserted into the bacterial expression vector pET-28a (Novagen) to allow expression of the His6-RACK1 fusion protein. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Interaction Analysis—The pBTM116-Ki-1/57(122–413) (40Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) vector was used to express a fragment spanning 60% of the C terminus of the protein Ki-1/57 linked to the C terminus of LexA DNA-binding domain peptide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40. A human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech) expressing GAL4 activation domain fusion proteins was co-transformed with the recombinant pBTM116-Ki-1/57 vector. Selection of transformants, the β-galactosidase activity test, plasmid DNA extraction, and sequencing were performed as described previously (9Lemos T. Passos D.O. Nery F.C. Kobarg J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Bacterial Expression and Protein Purification—GST, GST-Ki-1/57, and His6-RACK-1 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus-RIL (Stratagene) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or Ni-NTA-Sepharose as described before (44Moraes K.C.M. Quaresma A.J.C. Maehnss K Kobarg J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 384: 25-37Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assay, Western Blot Analysis, Antibodies, and Cell Culture—GST or GST-Ki-1/57 fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing, the beads were incubated with His6-RACK-1 for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized by immunochemiluminescence using a mouse anti-GST antibody (for control of equal loading of beads) or anti-His5 monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) and secondary anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The anti-RACK-1 monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. The specific anti-Ki-1/57 monoclonal antibodies A26, E203 (7Kobarg J. Schnittger S. Fonatsch C. Lemke H. Bowen M.A. Buck F. Hansen H.P. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar), and Ki-1 (1Schwab U. Stein H. Gerdes J. Lemke H. Kirchner H. Schaadt M. Diehl V. Nature. 1982; 299: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Anti-Ki-1/67 control antibody had been provided by Prof. Dr. Hilmar Lemke (45Diehl V.

An anti-phospho-PKC antibody sampler kit was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. L540 Hodgkin's analogous cells (46Gerdes J. Schwab U. Lemke H. Stein H. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 31: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar) were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (L540 standard medium). HeLa cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) under equal conditions. In Vivo Binding Assay—5.0 × 107 L540 cells were or were not stimulated with PMA (100 ng/ml) for 4 h (33Baumann M. Gires O. Kolch W. Mischak H. Zeidler R. Pich D. Hammerschmidt W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3891-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer NaCl/Tris (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors). The lysates were treated with DNase (Promega) and cleared at 14.000 × g for 30 min. Next 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were loaded with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed in buffer NaCl/Tris, and incubated with the L540 lysate overnight at 4 °C. After further three washes with the buffer Tris/EDTA (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl), the beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using the indicated antibodies. Western blots were developed by chemiluminescence as described previously (44Moraes K.C.M. Quaresma A.J.C. Maehnss K Kobarg J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 384: 25-37Google Scholar). Loading controls consisted either of protein detection by SDS-PAGE or of Western blot development with control antibodies as indicated in the figures. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis— 5 × 107 L540 cells were treated or not with PMA, collected, and lysed as described above. Endogenous PKC was immunoprecipitated from these lysates with anti-phospho-PKC-Pan antibody (Cell Signaling) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Next these beads were incubated with purified GST-Ki-1/57, His6-RACK-1, both, or GST in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.32 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1.25 EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 nm PMA, 5 μm ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, in a total volume of 25 μl for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were run out by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. In other experiments purified GST, GST-Ki-1/57, His6-RACK1, and deletion constructs of Ki-1/57 were phosphorylated in complete kinase buffer in a final volume of 50 μl at 30 °C with purified PKC-Pan, PKCζ, or PKCθ for 15 min. The PKCζ or PKCθ are human recombinant His-tagged and affinity-purified proteins (Promega). PKC-Pan was purified from rat brain and consists predominantly of the PKC isoforms α, β, and γ (Promega). Radioactively labeled proteins were visualized as described above. Phosphoamino acid analysis was basically performed as described in Machado et al. (47Machado E.L. Silva A.C. Silva M. Leite A. Ottoboni L.M.M. Phytochemistry. 2002; 61: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 32P-radiolabeled phosphorylated proteins were hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl for 60 min at 90 °C. The hydrolysate was lyophilized, dissolved in water, and spotted onto Sigma cell type 100 cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Sigma). The solvent system was isobutyric acid, 0.5 m ammonium hydroxide (5:3). Phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards (2 μg) (Sigma) were mixed with the radiolabeled protein hydrolysate and spotted together on the TLC plates. Amino acids were visualized with 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol, and radiolabeled residues were detected by autoradiography (AR). Theoretical phosphorylation site prediction was performed by the software NetPhos 2.0 Prediction server available at the web site of the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos). Metabolic Labeling, in Vivo Phosphorylation Assay, and Kinase Inhibitors—5 × 106 L540 cells were preincubated or not for 1 h with protein kinase inhibitors: Ro-32-0432 (28 nm), and staurosporine (0.7 nm) (Calbiochem). This inhibitor incubation was performed with phosphate-free L540 standard medium (the fetal calf serum in this medium had been dialyzed against a 150 mm NaCl solution). Next the cells were activated or not by the addition of 100 ng/ml of PMA for a second hour. In parallel to the PMA treatment, the cells were metabolically labeled by the addition of 0.4 mCi of radioactive 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate (Amersham Biosciences). After lysis Ki-1/57 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of the metabolically labeled L540 cells with anti-Ki-1 antibody A26 coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads and analyzed by autoradiography and SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Cell Fractions—L540 cells were harvested and incubated with 300 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice (33Baumann M. Gires O. Kolch W. Mischak H. Zeidler R. Pich D. Hammerschmidt W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3891-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant represents the cytoplasmic fraction. To obtain the nuclear fraction, the crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of hypertonic buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25% v/v glycerol) followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, the fractions were incubated with the antibodies at 4 °C overnight. On the next day 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose were added for 2 h. Immunofluorescence Analysis—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were stimulated or not with PMA for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were fixed with 100% methanol and immunostained with primary antibody monoclonal mouse Ki-1, mouse anti-RACK1, or rabbit anti-Phospho-PKC, and secondary antibody fluorescein anti-mouse or rhodamine anti-rabbit antibody. The cells were examined with a Nikon microscope. DAPI staining was used to show the positions of the nuclei. The cells were examined with Nikon fluorescence microscope. Immunolabeled proteins were presented with the respective color. Superimposing the two colors (merge) results in a yellow/orange signal. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To identify Ki-1/57 interacting proteins, the yeast two-hybrid system (40Bartel P.L. Fields S.

In a first screen we used a fragment of the Ki-1/57 cDNA that encodes its C-terminal 60% as a bait. 2.0 × 106 screened co-transformants yielded 250 clones positive for both His3 and LacZ reporter constructs. Library plasmids DNA of 80 clones were sequenced. 54% of the sequenced clones all encoded the full-length protein RACK1 (48Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Another protein identified was CHD3, which had already been described previously elsewhere (9Lemos T. Passos D.O. Nery F.C. Kobarg J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and represented 4% of the interacting clones. Other nuclear proteins involved in the regulation of transcription have also been identified but will be described elsewhere. Mapping the Interaction Sites of Ki-1/57 and RACK1—Next, we mapped the Ki-1/57 region required for the interaction with RACK1 using the yeast two-hybrid method (Fig. 1). N- and C-terminal deletion constructs of the Ki-1/57 protein were fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1A) and tested for their ability to bind full-length RACK1 (Fig. 1B). The two constructs that encompass the N-terminal and central regions: Ki-1/57(1–150) and Ki-1/57(151–263) failed to bind to RACK1. Full-length Ki-1/57, the C-terminal construct used in the two hybrid screen Ki-1/57(122–413) as well as the C-terminal deletion Ki-1/57(264–413) all interacted with RACK1. This suggests that the RACK1-binding site is located at the Ki-1/57 C terminus. The co-transformation of pBTM116-Ki-1/57 with several unrelated “bait” constructions, including pACT2-AUF1 (44Moraes K.C.M. Quaresma A.J.C. Maehnss K Kobarg J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 384: 25-37Google Scholar) (not shown) and with empty pBTM116 vector (Fig. 1B), showed no interaction. Furthermore, we mapped the RACK1 regions that are required for the interaction with Ki-1/57. N- and C-terminal deletion constructs of the RACK1 protein were fused to the Gal4 activation domain (vector pACT2; Fig. 1C) and tested for their ability to bind to full-length Ki-1/57 (Fig. 1D). None of the four different deletion constructs of RACK1 interacted with Ki-1/57. This shows that full-length RACK1 is required for an interaction with Ki-1/57. In Vitro Confirmation of the Ki-1/57-RACK1 Interaction with Purified Fusion Proteins—To confirm the interaction between Ki-1/57 and RACK1 in vitro, we next performed in vitro pull-down assays with purified recombinant proteins that had b"

Although cellular mechanisms leading to cell desensitization have been widely studied, those responsible for cell resensitization are still poorly understood. We examined here the traffic of the high affinity neurotensin receptor (NT1 receptor) following prolonged exposure to high agonist concentration. Fluorescence and confocal microscopy of Chinese hamster ovary, human neuroblastoma (CHP 212), and murine neuroblastoma (N1E-115) cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged NT1 receptor revealed that under prolonged treatment with saturating concentrations of neurotensin (NT) agonist, NT1 receptor and NT transiently accumulated in the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC). During this cellular event, cell surface receptors remained markedly depleted as detected by both confocal microscopy and 125I-NT binding assays. In dividing cells, we observed that following prolonged NT agonist stimulation, NT1 receptors were removed from the PNRC, accumulated in dispersed vesicles inside the cytoplasm, and subsequently reappeared at the cell surface. This NT binding recovery allowed for constant cell sensitization and led to a chronic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases p42 and p44. Under these conditions, the constant activation of NT1 receptor generates an oncogenic regulation. These observations support the potent role for neuropeptides, such as NT, in cancer progression.

Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Agonist interaction instantly leads to GPCR activation, phosphorylation, sequestration, and cell desensitization. Upon receptor endocytosis, the GPCRs may return to the cell surface directly from sorting endosomes (short cycle) (2Innamorati G. Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, a long cycle involving the passage through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC), before reaching the plasma membrane, has been suggested recently (2Innamorati G. Le Gouill C.

In the present study, by examining the effect of prolonged agonist exposure on neurotensin receptor (NT1 receptor) intracellular trafficking, we determined the conditions leading to cell agonist re-sensitization, along with the physiological consequences of this recovery on intracellular signalization. Neurotensin (NT) is a brain and gastrointestinal peptide that fulfils many central and peripheral functions through its interaction with specific receptors (5Carraway R. Leeman S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7045-7052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Vincent J.P. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Three subtypes of NT receptors have been cloned: NT1, NT2, and NT3 (7Tanaka K. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1990; 4: 847-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 8Chalon P.

NT1 and NT2 exhibit high (sub-nanomolar) and low (nanomolar) affinity for NT, respectively, and belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. NT3 is a single transmembrane domain receptor with 100% homology to gp95/sortilin (9Mazella J. Zsurger N. Navarro V. Chabry J. Kaghad M. Caput D. Ferrara P. Vita N. Gully D. Maffrand J.P.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the periphery, the bulk of NT is released into the circulation by endocrine cells, called N-cells, localized along the luminal epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract (13Helmstaedter V. Taugner C. Feurle G.E. Forssmann W.G. Histochemistry. 1977; 53: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, NT is released by neurons distributed throughout the neuraxis (14Jennes L. Stumpf W.E. Kalivas P.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1982; 210: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Most studies on the intracellular trafficking of GPCRs, including NT1 receptor, have been performed on naive cells and exposed to agonists for short periods ranging from a few minutes to a couple of hours. Within this time frame, most GPCRs are not recycled to the plasma membrane following ligandinduced internalization but a few GPCRs are efficiently recycled and mediate permanent responses to agonist (for review see Ref. 15Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies using these short time frames may not illustrate NT1 receptor trafficking under normal physiological or pathological conditions, because in vivo the stimulated state can subsist as long as several hours to a few days, or even longer in the case of abnormal autocrine or paracrine regulation. For example, the ingestion of a meal causes a prompt and prolonged rise in plasma levels of NT, lasting for at least 10 h (16Gullo L. Pezzilli R. Tomassetti P. de Giorgio R. Gastroenterol. Clin. Biol. 1998; 22: 25-28PubMed Google Scholar). In cancer cells, mRNA of pro-NT/NN is expressed in cancer tissues and cell lines from gut (17Evers B.M. Ishizuka J. Chung D.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Thompson J.C. Ann. Surg. 1992; 216: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), lungs (18Wood S.M. Wood J.R. Ghatei M.A. Lee Y.C. O'Shaughnessy D. Bloom S.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 1310-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), pancreas (19Feurle G.E. Helmstaedter V. Tischbirek K. Carraway R. Forssmann W.G. Grube D. Roher H.D. Dig. Dis.

A. 1994; 91: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). NT1 receptor was also found to be deregulated in several human cancers, such as ductal pancreatic adenocarcinomas (21Reubi J.C. Waser B. Friess H. Buchler M. Laissue J. Gut. 1998; 42: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), prostate (20Sehgal I. Powers S. Huntley B. Powis G. Pittelkow M. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: S2737-S2742PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an NT autocrine receptor activation. Previous studies demonstrated that human colon adenocarcinoma cells, HT-29, or human neuroblastoma cells, CHP 212, challenged for 48 h with high concentrations of a NT agonist recovered and maintained NT sensitization (23Souaze F. Rostene W. Forgez P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10087-10094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Najimi M. Souaze F. Mendez M. Hermans E. Berbar T. Rostene W. Forgez P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21634-21641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In these studies, a correlation was made between an intensive NT1 receptor internalization, occurring in the early phases of cell stimulation, and the activation of NT1 receptor gene by NT agonist and cell resensitization. Other studies, using fluorescent NT analogs, demonstrated that in neurons endogenously expressing NT1 receptor, the ligand was internalized together with its receptor and was retrieved in the perinuclear region within small vesicular organelles (25Faure M.P. Alonso A. Nouel D. Gaudriault G. Dennis M. Vincent J.P. Beaudet A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4140-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Faure M.P. Nouel D. Beaudet A.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our objective was to examine intracellular trafficking and targeting of NT1 receptors after a prolonged agonist exposure in relation with cell resensitization. As cellular models, we established CHO, CHP 212, and N1E-115 cells, which stably expressed a fusion protein comprising the NT1 receptor and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). By combining the use of NT1 receptor-EGFP fusion proteins and fluorescent NT, we were able to visualize intracellular trafficking of NT1 receptor and its ligand. We demonstrated that when cells were chronically exposed to high doses of NT agonist, NT1 receptors accumulate in the perinuclear recycling compartment and subsequently recycle to the cell surface. Consequently, the cells remain permanently sensitized leading to the chronic activation of MAP kinase. Cell Culture and Stable Cell Line Establishment—CHO cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's α-medium, without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (Invitrogen). Human (CHP 212) and murine (N1E-115) neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nut Mix F12 (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. N1E-115 differentiation was induced with 1.5% FCS and 1% Me2SO for 48 h (28Cusack B. Stanton T. Richelson E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 206: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transfection of N1E-115 and CHP 212 cell lines with pNT1-EGFP, a plasmid expressing rat NT1 receptor fused at the C terminus with the EGFP coding sequence, was performed using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method for 16 h at 37 °C (29Lenkei Z.

Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.32Google Scholar). After transfection, the media were removed, and fresh medium was added for 24 h. Stable transfectants were selected with G418 (1 mg/ml), and colonies were screened for EGFP expression using a Nikon Diaphot inverted fluorescence microscope at a ×40 magnification and by 125I-NT binding assays. Transient transfection experiments were performed as described above, in 12-well dishes, with 0.1 μg of pCMV-LUC and 1.4 μg of pDNA3-CAT per well, for 16 h at 37 °C. After transfection cells were treated or not with a concentration range of JMV 449 for 2–24 h and harvested. As control experiments for product efficiency, cells were also concomitantly treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D or 70 μm cycloheximide in the presence or in the absence of JMV 449. In both cases luciferase expression was abolished. Immunocytochemistry—Stably transfected and wild type cells were treated with or without 1 μm JMV 449 (31Doulut S. Rodriguez M. Lugrin D. Vecchini F. Kitabgi P. Aumelas A. Martinez J. Pept. Res. 1992; 5: 30-38PubMed Google Scholar) for 6 h, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, preincubated in the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% normal rabbit serum (NRS) for 1 h, and rinsed again with PBS. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-NT1 receptor goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:100 for transfected cells and 1:50 for wild type cells or anti-Rab11 goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at the concentration 1 μg/ml, or anti-LAMP2 goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:25 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% NRS. After rinsing three times (5 min each) with PBS, cells were incubated, for 45 min at room temperature, with a rabbit anti-goat Texas Red-tagged secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 for transfected cells and 1:600 for CHP 212 cells and 1:1200 for N1E-115 cells, in PBS. The coverslips were then mounted on glass slides with Aquamount and examined by confocal microscopy. The absence of cross-reactivity of the secondary antibody was verified by omitting primary antibody. Colocalization of Texas Red Transferrin and NT1 Receptor-EGFP— Cells were treated with 1 μm JMV 449 for 6 h. Twenty minutes before the end of the treatment, Texas Red transferrin (Molecular Probes) was added to the culture medium without fetal calf serum at a concentration of 25 μg/ml for labeling of the perinuclear recycling compartment (32Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were mounted on glass slides with Aquamount and examined by confocal microscopy. Fluo-NT Traffic in CHO-NT1-EGFP Cells—Cells were plated on Lab-Tek chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc) and were incubated for various times (30 min and 1, 3, and 6 h) with 20 nm Bodipy-NT in the same culture medium, at 37 °C, or with 10 μm SR 48692 (Sanofi-Synthelabo), a NT1 receptor antagonist, for 3 or 6 h. Cells were then directly processed for confocal microscopy. Binding Studies—Cell membrane preparations were obtained from CHO-NT1-EGFP and N1E-115-NT1-EGFP cells using the procedure of Boudin et al. (33Boudin H. Grauz-Guyon A. Faure M.P. Forgez P. Lhiaubet A.M. Dennis M. Beaudet A. Rostene W. Pelaprat D. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with cold PBS in order to remove agonist used for treatment. Under these conditions, the binding recovery of cells incubated with JMV 449 was 85 ± 15% as compared with control cells (23Souaze F. Rostene W. Forgez P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10087-10094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding studies were performed as follows: 15 μg of protein were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-NT in a final volume of 250 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA, and 0.8 mm 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline, 1.6 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled NT. Binding assays were terminated by the addition of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, followed by filtration through glass-microfiber filters (GF/B, Whatman) pre-incubated in 0.2% polyethyleneimine. After washing three times with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer, the radioactivity retained on the filters was counted in a γ-counter (Wallac model 1470 Wizard). Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopic analysis was carried out using a TCS SP Leica microscope (Lasertechnik, GmbH) equipped with a 63× objective (plan apo; NA = 1.4). A focal series was collected for each specimen every 0.5 μm for CHO-NT1-EGFP and CHP212-NT1-EGFP cell lines and every 1 μm for the N1E-115-NT1-EGFP cell line. Each confocal image shown here corresponded to the middle image from a 10-section series. For each optical section, double fluorescence was simultaneously acquired using a krypton-argon mixed gas laser adjusted to 488 nm for GFP and to 568 nm for TRITC. The variable center of spectrophotometers was adjusted to recover green (500–550 nm) and red (580–630 nm) fluorescence. The signal was treated with line averaging to integrate the signal collected over 4 lines in order to reduce signal noise. Selected paired sections were then processed to produce a single overlay image (color merged) using a personal computer equipped with Photoshop software (version 6). p42/p44 MAP Kinase Phosphorylation Assay—Differentiated and non-differentiated N1E-115-NT1-EGFP cells and CHO-NT1-EGFP cells were treated with 1 μm JMV 449 for 10 or 20 min or 24 h at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were detached by gentle scraping and centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, transferred into an ice-cold microtubes, and centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.2% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 1 μg/ml aprotinin (Roche Applied Science). The samples were then bath-sonicated twice for 15 s, incubated in ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g, at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were assayed using protein assay (Pierce) for relative protein concentration. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was run for 3 h at 50 mA and then transferred overnight, at 200 mA, onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 192 mm glycine). Activation of MAP kinase was determined by measuring the phosphorylation state of p42 MAP kinase and p44 MAP kinase using an antiactive p42/p44 MAP kinase polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total p42/p44 MAP kinase was detected regardless of its phosphorylation state by using a MAP kinase antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). To assess activated p42/p44 MAP kinase, the nitrocellulose blot was incubated in blocking buffer (PBS 1×; 0.05% Tween 20; 5% nonfat dry milk) for 2 h at room temperature and then probed with mouse polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated p42/p44 MAP kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1:750 in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The blot was washed three times for 5 min each with PBST (PBS 1×, 0.05% Tween 20) and then probed with sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer) (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After three final washes, the immunoreactive bands were revealed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was then stripped with stripping buffer (100 mm citric acid, pH 1.5) for 20 min at room temperature and re-probed with antibody to total p42/p44 MAP kinase (0.4 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:2000) (Sigma) as described above. Upon Exposure to a High Dose of Agonist, NT1 Receptor and NT Transiently Accumulate in a Juxtanuclear Compartment— The agonist-induced intracellular trafficking of NT1 receptor was studied in CHO cells stably transfected with a plasmid expressing the rat NT1 receptor fused at the C terminus with the EGFP coding sequence (29Lenkei Z. Beaudet A. Chartrel N. De Mota N. Irinopoulou T. Braun B. Vaudry H. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Binding characteristics were studied on the chosen clone, CHO-NT1-EGFP. Prepared membranes exhibited a Kd of 0.43 ± 0.05 nm and a Bmax of 1590 fmol/mg of protein. The binding affinity of NT1 receptor-EGFP is identical to the NT1 receptor because prepared membranes from CHO-NT1 cells expressing the rat NT1 receptor revealed a Kd of 0.44 ± 0.03 nm (33Boudin H. Grauz-Guyon A. Faure M.P. Forgez P. Lhiaubet A.M. Dennis M. Beaudet A. Rostene W. Pelaprat D. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Signal transduction was shown to be operational in CHO-NT1-EGFP cells, because inositol phosphate production was obtained with the same EC50 value as in cell lines expressing the endogenous gene (29Lenkei Z. Beaudet A. Chartrel N. De Mota N. Irinopoulou T. Braun B. Vaudry H. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Amar S. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the absence of agonist, NT1 receptors were localized at the cell surface (Fig. 1A, unstimulated). In order to study agonist-induced receptor trafficking, CHO-NT1-EGFP cells were incubated for 0–24 h at 37 °C with 100 or 0.1 nm of a weakly degradable NT agonist, JMV 449 (31Doulut S. Rodriguez M. Lugrin D. Vecchini F. Kitabgi P. Aumelas A. Martinez J. Pept. Res. 1992; 5: 30-38PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to saturating and non-saturating binding conditions, respectively. Confocal microscopic examination of CHO-NT1-EGFP cells revealed that after3hof exposure to 100 nm JMV 449, EGFP was accumulated in a distinct juxtanuclear compartment (Fig. 1A). This phenomenon was transient; the localization peaked at 6 h of treatment, declined at 8 h, and disappeared completely at 24 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when cells were treated with 0.1 nm JMV 449, the perinuclear localization was not observed at 3, 6, and 8 h of JMV 449 treatment. At 24 h of 100 nm NT agonist treatment, the intensity of EGFP fluorescence at the cell surface was identical to that observed in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1A). The dose response inducing this cellular phenomenon was studied after 6 h of JMV 449 treatment. As shown in Fig. 1B, only saturating concentrations of JMV 449 (10 nm and 1 μm), providing 99.9 and 100% binding site occupancy, respectively, induced EGFP accumulation in the perinuclear region. The same observation was made with 1 μm NT, 1 μm NT8-13, and 1 μm of the NT analog ESAI 11D348 (data not shown). No EGFP accumulation was observed in the perinuclear region under non-saturating agonist concentrations of 0.1(Fig. 1B), 0.3 (Fig. 1B), and 1 nm (not shown) providing for 43, 69, and 89% site occupancy. As expected, 1 μm of NT1-11 did not affect NT1 receptor trafficking (data not shown). To verify that the accumulation of the NT1 receptor in the juxtanuclear compartment was not fibroblast-specific, the experiments were repeated in CHP 212 cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line that endogenously expresses NT1 receptor (24Najimi M. Souaze F. Mendez M. Hermans E. Berbar T. Rostene W. Forgez P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21634-21641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and in N1E-115 cells, a murine neuroblastoma cell line (28Cusack B. Stanton T. Richelson E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 206: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were stably transfected with the pNT1-EGFP plasmid (29Lenkei Z. Beaudet A. Chartrel N. De Mota N. Irinopoulou T. Braun B. Vaudry H. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In unstimulated CHP212-NT1-EGFP and N1E-115-NT1-EGFP cells, the green fluorescence was located at the cell surface (Fig. 2, Unstimulated). Also, as seen in CHO-NT1-EGFP cells, EGFP accumulation was detected in the perinuclear region of both cell types, following a 6-h treatment with 1 μm JMV 449 (Fig. 2A). We confirmed by immunocytochemistry that the NT1 receptor was still fused to EGFP during the trafficking process, using an antibody directed against the rat C-terminal portion of NT1 receptor. As showed in Fig. 2A, a perfect overlap between EGFP labeling (green) and NT1 receptor immunoreactivity (red) was apparent (Fig. 2A, Overlay). For control purposes, we confirmed that the C-terminal rat antibody did not recognize the endogenously expressed human NT1 receptor in CHP 212 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, it should be noted that in N1E-115-NT1-EGFP cells, endogenous murine NT1 receptor is only expressed in differentiated cells, whereas the N1E-115-NT1-EGFP cells used in this experiment are undifferentiated. Therefore, the NT1 receptor immunoreactivity observed corresponds to the rat protein. For subsequent experiments, the green fluorescence was considered to reflect NT1 receptor traffic. In order to evaluate whether the overexpression of NT1 receptor is responsible for NT1 receptor accumulation near the nucleus, NT1 receptor immunocytochemistry was performed on wild type CHP 212 cells and differentiated wild type N1E-115 cells. CHP 212 cells present a low expression of NT1 receptor with a Bmax of 15 fmol/mg of protein. N1E-115 cells express NT1 receptor only in the differentiated state with a Bmax of 52 fmol/mg of protein membrane. As shown in Fig. 2B, the receptor is mainly localized at the membrane in control cells, whereas after 6 h of JMV 449 treatment, NT1 receptor is accumulated in a juxtanuclear compartment in both cell lines. NT trafficking was followed in CHO-NT1-EGFP cells by using the Bodipy-NT as a fluorescent ligand. Cells were treated with Bodipy-NT at the saturating concentration of 20 nm and examined by confocal microscopy. After 30 min and 1 h of treatment, most NT1 receptors were internalized and distributed throughout the cytoplasm in small endosome-like organelles (Fig. 3A). Bodipy-NT was also found in intra-cytoplasmic vesicles distinct from those containing the re"

The diffusion of three PH domain-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions (PH2-GFP, PH10-GFP, and PH-CRAC (cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase)-GFP) in the cytoplasm of vegetative and chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells has been studied using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to gain a better understanding of the functioning of the domains and to assess the effect of initiation of chemotaxis on these domains in the cell. PH2-GFP was homogeneously distributed in vegetative as well as chemotaxing cells, whereas PH10-GFP and PH-CRAC-GFP showed translocation to the leading edge of the chemotaxing cell. The diffusion characteristics of PH2-GFP and PH-CRAC-GFP were very similar; however, PH10-GFP exhibited slower diffusion. Photon counting histogram statistics show that this slow diffusion was not due to aggregation. Diffusion of the three PH domains was affected to similar extents by intracellular heterogeneities in vegetative as well as chemotaxing cells. From the diffusion of free cytoplasmic GFP, it was calculated that the viscosity in chemotaxing cells was 1.7 times lower than in vegetative cells. In chemotaxing cells, PH2-GFP showed increased mobility, whereas the mobilities of PH10-GFP and PH-CRAC-GFP remained unchanged.

The social ameba Dictyostelium discoideum begins its life as single cells, feeding on bacteria. When the food supply is exhausted, starvation induces the single cells to aggregate and to develop, eventually forming a multicellular organism. Aggregation of cells is governed by chemotaxis to cAMP. During chemotaxis, cellular movement is mediated by pseudopod formation that results from the activation of several second messenger pathways in response to the binding of cAMP to the receptor. It is thought that one crucial step leading to pseudopod formation is the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which generates negatively charged phospholipids that act as binding sites for pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; PCH, photon counting histogram. domains at the plasma membrane (1Firtel R.A. Chung C.Y. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). PH domains are homologous regions of ∼120 amino acids found in a number of proteins that are quite diverse in their cellular functions. Although the level of sequence similarity between different PH domains is quite low, the secondary structures of the domains are very similar. PH domains can form electrostatically polarized tertiary structure that can interact with negatively charged membrane surfaces. Apart from phospholipids, the βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins and protein kinase C have been proposed as common ligands for PH domains. PH domains are thought to be responsible for translocation of cytosolic PH domain-containing proteins to the plasma membrane, where they can initiate further action (2Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Takeuchi H. Yagisawa H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells are polarized. It has been suggested that the directional response of the Dictyostelium cell comes from the selective recruitment of certain PH domain-containing proteins to the leading edge (1Firtel R.A. Chung C.Y. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284 (P. N.): 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Although PH domains are known to play a very important role in the process of chemotaxis, very little is known about the dynamics of these domains in cells. Thus, we do not know if PH domains that have different functions in the cell would still show similar diffusion behavior, a property that depends on the structure, localization, and intracellular interactions of the domain in the cell. Also, upon initiation of chemotaxis, it is not known how these diffusion characteristics would be affected. In polarized Dictyostelium cells, the formation of pseudopods may lead to change in fluidity of cytoplasm or generation of force due to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. The changes in the intracellular environment upon polarization of the cell would affect the various intracellular species. A study by Potma et al. (6Potma E.O. de Boeij W.P. Bosgraaf L. Roelofs J. van Haastert P.J. Wiersma D.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2010-2019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that, due to reduction of actin cytoskeleton in the non-cortical regions of polarized Dictyostelium cells, free green fluorescent protein (GFP) in these regions shows faster mobility than in vegetative cells. The altered environment in the cell should also affect the PH domains. Quantifying the diffusion characteristics of the species of interest in vegetative cells and determining the changes in these characteristics upon polarization of the cells would thus provide information not only about the dynamics of different PH domains and their possible interactions with other intracellular moieties, but also about the effect of cell polarization. The technique of choice for obtaining quantitative information on dynamic events in living cells in a noninvasive manner is fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (7Hess S.T. Huang S. Heikal A.A. Webb W.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). FCS has been applied successfully to quantify the diffusion rates of cellular moieties (8Schwille P.

A. 1999; 96: 10123-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Along with FCS, the complementary technique photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis can be used to provide additional information about the system, e.g. the aggregation state of the fluorescent species in the system on the basis of their brightness and independent of their diffusion times (13Chen Y. Muller J.D. So P.T. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 553-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 14Müller J.D. Chen Y. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 474-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this study, we have applied FCS to study the diffusion characteristics of PH domain-GFP fusions in the cytoplasm of Dictyostelium. PCH analysis has been applied to determine the aggregation state of proteins in the cell. For our study, we chose three PH domains: PH2, PH10, and the PH domain of CRAC (cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase; referred to as PH-CRAC). PH2 is a domain of an unidentified protein in Dictyostelium, the gene of which has not yet been completely described (C4V01S0022.G12). 2Available at dictybase.org. The protein contains two PH domains, one N-terminal and one C-terminal, with a Rho GTPase-activating protein domain in between. PH2 is the C-terminal PH domain. PH10 is the domain of a protein the gene of which has been cloned and is thought to be a novel Akt/protein kinase B homolog (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF093877). PH-CRAC has been studied widely and is known to play a role in the directional response of a cell (5Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284 (P. N.): 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). It transiently translocates to the leading edge of the chemotaxing cell. As an indicator of the intracellular environment, we used free GFP, which is not likely to show nonspecific interactions with intracellular moieties (9Dittrich P. Malvezzi Campeggi F. Jahnz M. Schwille P. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), expressed in Dictyostelium cytoplasm. The goal of this study was thus to determine the diffusion characteristics of PH2-GFP, PH10-GFP, and PH-CRAC-GFP in Dictyostelium cytoplasm to gain a better understanding of the functioning of these domains in the cell and to assess the effect of initiation of chemotaxis on these domains. Cells—Wild-type D. discoideum strain AX3 cells were grown in HG5 medium (14.3 g/liter peptone, 7.15 g/liter yeast extract, 0.54 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.49 g/liter KH2PO4, and 10.0 g/liter glucose). For expressing free GFP in the cells, AX3 cells were transfected with the S65T GFP mutant gene cloned into the extrachromosomal expression vector for Dictyostelium MB74, which bears a neomycin resistance cassette. The open reading frame of the GFP gene was cloned behind a Dictyostelium actin-15 promoter and succeeded by an actin-8 terminator. For expression of the PH domains, the shuffle vector LB3Neo was created. It contains an actin-15 promoter and a Kozak sequence (AAAAATG) succeeded by the S65T GFP gene, which was cloned into the expression vector HK12Neo. LB3Neo also bears a neomycin resistance cassette and has a BglII site, an SpeI site, and a 2H3 terminator behind the GFP gene. For PH10, primers 5′-GCG CCA GAT CTA ATA ATA TGG CAG ATA AAC AAG-3′ (BglII site underlined) and 5′-GCG CGA CTA GTC CAT TTA ATT GTT GAG TTA TAA TCT C-3′ (SpeI site underlined) were used for PCR with genomic Dictyostelium DNA as a template. Likewise, PH2 was amplified using primers 5′-GCG GGG GAT CCG AAA TTG TTA AAC AAG GTT A-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-GCG CCA CTA GTC CTT GTT GTG TTA TAC AAT TTG-3′ (SpeI site underlined). PH2 and PH10 were cloned into the BglII and SpeI sites of LB3Neo using the indicated restriction sites of the primers. The PH-CRAC-GFP construct WF38 was a kind gift of C. A. Parent and P. N. Devreotes. It is also an extrachromosomal Dictyostelium expression vector bearing neomycin resistance. The transfected cells were grown in HG5 medium in the presence of 10 μg/ml neomycin (Geneticin, G418 disulfate salt; Sigma). The molecular masses of free GFP and the PH-CRAC-GFP, PH2-GFP, and PH10-GFP fusion proteins are 27, 39, 40, and 39 kDa, respectively. Sample Preparation—200 or 40 μl of cell suspension was taken from a confluent Petri dish and added to either a LabTek 8-chambered cover glass (Nalge Nunc International Corp.) or a 96-chambered glass bottom microplate (Whatman), respectively. Cells were allowed to settle down for 15–20 min. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with 17 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Measurements were performed in cells incubated in buffer. For measurements in polarized cells, the cells were incubated in phosphate buffer for ∼5 h. After incubation, the cells had elongated and had started aggregating. Cell Immobilization—Vegetative cells expressing free GFP were immobilized in a 3% agarose gel (gelling temperature for 2% (w/v) of 36–42 °C; Invitrogen), a solution of which was added to the cells after removing the buffer completely. The agarose solidified in a couple of seconds, reducing the mobility of cells significantly. Fig. 1 compares the movement of cells incubated in buffer with that of cells in agarose. The slow movement of cells in agarose indicates that the cells were alive. Instrumentation—FCS and PCH measurements were performed with a Zeiss EVOTEC ConfoCor inverted confocal microscope. The details of the setup have been described previously (15Hink M.A. van Hoek A. Visser A.J.W.G. Langmuir. 1999; 15: 992-997Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Hink M.A. Borst J.W. Visser A.J.W.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The microscope was equipped with a water immersion objective (C-Apochromat ×40, numerical aperture of 1.2) and a fluorescein filter set (Omega 505 dichroic, 540 DF 50 band-pass filter) to separate the excitation and emission light. The sample was excited at a wavelength of 488 nm from the argon ion laser. The excitation intensity was attenuated with neutral density filters to ∼10 microwatts. The pinhole, present for confocal detection, was set at a diameter of 40 μm. The autocorrelation curve was generated with a hardware correlator (ALV-5000E, ALV, Langen, Germany). For PCH analysis, the signal was processed by a dual channel 32-bit PCI photon-counting card (ISS Inc.) (17Eid J.S. Muller J.D. Gratton E. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2000; 71: 361-368Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Confocal images of the cells were obtained with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss ConfoCor 2-LSM 510 combination setup). GFP was excited with the 488-nm argon ion laser controlled by an acousto-optical tunable filter. A dichroic beam splitter (HFT 488) separated the excitation from the emission. The GFP fluorescence was filtered through a band-pass 505–550-nm filter. The objective used was a ×40 oil immersion Plan-Neofluar with a numerical aperture of 1.3. The pinhole was set at 73 μm. Images were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM Image Browser software package. FCS Measurements—Around 100–150 autocorrelation traces were obtained for each cell strain in vegetative and polarized stages. The measurements were made at two to four randomly chosen spots in the cytoplasm of 10–20 different cells of each cell strain. At each spot in the cell cytoplasm, the measurements were repeated three or five times. Only cells that showed high expression and appeared healthy were chosen for the experiment. In cells expressing free GFP, PH-CRAC-GFP, and PH2-GFP, the expression level was too high for FCS measurements. In these cases, the proteins were photobleached to acceptable fluorescence intensity levels before the measurement by exposing the cells to a high intensity laser beam (∼8 milliwatts) for <1 s. Typically, for cells incubated in buffer, measurements of 10 s were performed in vegetative cells and 5 s in polarized cells. Measurements of 20–30 s were made in cells immobilized in agarose. Diffusion of GFP in 17 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 50% sucrose was also measured under similar experimental conditions as those employed for cellular measurements. Around 100 autocorrelation curves were collected for a measurement time of 10 s. PCH Measurements—The data were obtained from Dictyostelium cells expressing free GFP and PH10-GFP and incubated in 17 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Single measurements were made in 20 cells of each strain. Raw data were obtained in photon mode. 2 × 106 photons for cells with free GFP and 1 × 106 for cells expressing PH10-GFP were collected at sampling frequencies of 2 and 1 MHz, respectively. Data Analysis—The autocorrelation traces were analyzed with FCS Data Processor Version 1.3 (Scientific Software Technologies Centre, Department of Systems Analysis, Belarusian State University, Minsk, Belarus). The analysis was performed using the global analysis approach, where five or six autocorrelation traces were fitted simultaneously with their diffusion times (Tdif) and triplet lifetimes (Ttrip) linked. The traces were fitted with a fixed value of the structural parameter (sp) that was obtained from calibration with a rhodamine 110 solution and varied between 8 and 12. The structural parameter is defined as the ratio of axial (ωz) to radial (ωxy) radii of the sample volume element. The average number of molecules (N) and the fractional population of the triplet state (Ftrip) were allowed to vary. An offset term was added to take into account artifacts in the autocorrelation due to drift in average fluorescence intensity on time scales of >1 s, possibly arising from cellular and intracellular movement (12Brock R. Vamosi G. Vereb G. Jovin T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10123-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The quality of the fit was judged by the reduced χ2 criterion and by visual inspection of the residuals. Because all measurements were made in the cell cytoplasm, the autocorrelation function (G(τ)) was fit to Equation 1, which describes the three-dimensional Brownian motion of a single species.

D=ωxy24Tdif(Eq. 2) The intracellular viscosity was calculated according to the Stokes-Einstein equation (Equation 3), D=kT6πηr(Eq. 3) where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, η is the viscosity of the solution, and r is the hydrodynamic radius of the solute. The raw data for PCH analysis were acquired and analyzed using Alba FCS Version 2.55 (ISS Inc.). The data were analyzed at a sampling frequency of 50 kHz and fit assuming single species. The PCH function for an open system describes the possibility of observing k photon counts per sampling time, with N as the average number of molecules in the detection volume (13Chen Y. Muller J.D. So P.T. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 553-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The molecular brightness (∈), expressed as kilohertz/molecule, is the ratio of the average number of photon counts (〈k〉) received per second to N (Equation 4). ɛ=〈k〉N(Eq. 4) ∈ is independent of the sampling frequency, and values from different experiments can be directly compared (13Chen Y.

Localization of PH Domain-GFP Fusions and Free GFP in Cells—Confocal images showing the localization of PH domain-GFP fusions and free GFP in vegetative Dictyostelium cells are shown in Fig. 2. PH2-GFP and free GFP were homogeneously distributed in the cell, whereas PH-CRAC-GFP and PH10-GFP transiently localized to parts of the membrane. Fig. 3 shows the translocation of PH10-GFP to a macropinosome in a vegetative cell. In polarized cells, PH10-GFP translocated to the leading edge of the cell (Fig. 4). The distribution of free GFP and PH2-GFP in polarized cells remained similar to that in vegetative cells.Fig. 3Translocation of PH10-GFP to a macropinosome in Dictyostelium cells.

For comparison with in vitro values, the distribution of diffusion coefficient values for GFP in 17 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8) containing 50% sucrose, obtained under similar experimental conditions as used for the cellular measurements, is plotted in Fig. 5a. The diffusion coefficient distributions of PH-CRAC-GFP and PH2-GFP overlapped with that of free GFP, whereas that of PH10-GFP showed smaller diffusion coefficient values. The width of the distribution of diffusion coefficient values for GFP and the fusion proteins in cells was larger than for GFP in solution. An estimate of the width can also be obtained from the relative S.D. associated with each average value. The numerical average diffusion coefficients, S.D. values, confidence intervals, and relative S.D. values as determined for each protein and for GFP in vitro are listed in Table I. The relative S.D. values for free GFP and PH domain-GFP fusions are between 18 and 20%, whereas that for free GFP in vitro is 5%. From the average diffusion coefficient obtained for free GFP in cells and buffer, the average intracellular viscosity in the vegetative cells was calculated to be 3.5 ± 0.7 centipoise (Equation 3).Table IDiffusion of PH domain-GFP fusions and free GFP in cells and in vitroSampleVegetative cellsPolarized cellsDCIR.S.D.DCIR.S.D.μm2/s%μm2/s%Cells incubated in buffer Free GFP20 ± 418-222032 ± 629-3519 PH-CRAC-GFP22 ± 421-241823 ± 421-2517 PH2-GFP22 ± 421-241827 ± 624-2922 PH10-GFP11 ± 210-121812 ± 211-1317Cells immobilized in 3% agarose Free GFP24 ± 422-2517In vitro GFP18 ± 118-195 Open table in a new tab PH10-GFP Is Not Aggregating—PCH measurements were performed to determine whether the slow diffusion of PH10-GFP could be caused by aggregation of the protein. PCH analysis uses the intensity amplitude distributions to give a quantitative description of the molecular brightness values for the fluorescent species present in the sample. In the autocorrelation curve, this amplitude information can be obtained only from G(0). The molecular brightness of PH10-GFP in vegetative Dictyostelium cells was determined and compared with the molecular brightness of free GFP in the cells. The measurements gave an average molecular brightness of 3.7 ± 1.3 kHz/ molecule for PH10-GFP and of 3.1 ± 0.9 kHz/molecule for free GFP. A representative histogram is shown in Fig. 6. The similar molecular brightness for the two proteins indicates that PH10-GFP is not aggregating. Diffusion Characteristics in Polarized Cells—The effect of polarization on the distributions of diffusion coefficients for PH domain-GFP fusions and free GFP is shown in Fig. 7. PH2-GFP and free GFP showed faster diffusion in polarized cells, as indicated by the shift in the diffusion coefficient distribution of the two proteins to higher values with respect to the distribution in vegetative cells. That the differences in these distributions are significant was confirmed by the unpaired t test (p < 0.005). The shift was more pronounced for free GFP than for PH2-GFP. However, the diffusion coefficient distributions of PH-CRAC-GFP and PH10-GFP totally overlapped with those obtained in vegetative cells. The unpaired t test gave p > 0.5. The numerical average diffusion coefficient values are listed in Table I. The relative S.D. associated with each value is between 17 and 22%, similar to the results in vegetative cells. From the average diffusion coefficient obtained for free GFP in the polarized cells, the intracellular viscosity was calculated to be 2.1 ± 0.4 centipoise, ∼1.7 times lower than in vegetative cells. Cellular Movement and Autofluorescence—Dictyostelium cells incubated in buffer moved around continuously. The vegetative cells showed random pseudopod formation, and the movement of cells in this stage was slower than the movement of cells in the polarized stage. Measurement times of 10 s for vegetative cells and 5 s for the polarized cells were chosen. This ensured that the cells did not move excessively during the measurement. Even during the chosen time, the fluorescence fluctuations did not remain steady around an average value, probably due to cellular or intracellular movement. A comparison of the intensity traces obtained from GFP diffusion in buffer containing 50% sucrose and GFP diffusion in cells is shown in Fig. 8. The autocorrelation curves obtained from cells could be fit well to the model describing three-dimensional Brownian motion for a single species after an offset term had been added to it (Equation 1). The offset term was needed to account for the slow intensity drifts. Fig. 9 shows a representative autocorrelation curve with the fit and the residuals of the fit.Fig. 9Representative autocorrelation curve.

Lower panel, residuals of the fit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To estimate the contribution of cellular movement to the widening of the diffusion coefficient distributions obtained from measurements in the cells, autocorrelation traces were also obtained from free GFP-expressing vegetative cells immobilized in agarose. Longer measurement times of 20–30s were possible here. The numerical average diffusion coefficient for free GFP in the immobilized cells is 24 ± 4 μm2/s, with the S.D. corresponding to 17% of the average diffusion coefficient value (Table I). The relative S.D. is similar to that obtained for the various cell strains incubated in buffer, indicating that the movement of the cells does not contribute significantly to the S.D. values associated with the measurements. Also in the case of immobilized cells, slow drifts in fluorescence intensity were seen, probably indicating intracellular movement. The contribution of cellular autofluorescence was determined from measurements made in wild-type Dictyostelium strain AX3 cells. The autofluorescence did not autocorrelate and hence did not interfere with the measurement of diffusion times. It was thus ignored. The diffusion characteristics of PH2-GFP, PH10-GFP, and PH-CRAC-GFP in the cytoplasm of vegetative and polarized Dictyostelium cells have been characterized to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of these domains in the cell and to study the effect of initiation of chemotaxis on these domains. The diffusion of the PH domain-GFP fusions was compared with the diffusion of free GFP in the cells. Free GFP was homogeneously distributed in the Dictyostelium cytoplasm (Fig. 2a). Of the three PH domains studied, PH2-GFP was homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm in vegetative cells (Fig. 2c) and did not show change in localization upon cell polarization. This indicates that the role of PH2 in the signaling pathway in Dictyostelium might be other than membrane recruitment of the protein bearing it. Because it remains cytosolic in polarized cells, it is possible that PH2, like some other PH domains (3Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Takeuchi H. Yagisawa H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Varnai P. Lin X. Lee S.B. Tuymetova G. Bondeva T. Spat A. Rhee S.G. Hajnoczky G. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27412-27422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), binds to soluble inositol phosphates and perform functions such as negative regulation of signaling pathways by reducing the amount of free inositol phosphates available for other processes. PH10-GFP and PH-CRAC-GFP showed transient translocation to macropinosomes in vegetative cells (Fig. 3) and to the leading edge of the polarized cell (Fig. 4) (19Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Thus, PH-CRAC and PH10 are involved in membrane binding in Dictyostelium, whereas PH2 is not. However, the diffusion characteristics of PH2-GFP and PH-CRAC-GFP in vegetative cells were very similar. Their diffusion coefficient distributions also overlapped with that of free GFP. This is expected, as the molecular mass of GFP differs from that of the PH domain-GFP fusions only by a factor of 1.5. With FCS, it is not possible to distinguish between two species in an identical environment without a priori knowledge until the molecular masses differ by a factor of 4 at least (20Meseth U. Wohland T. Rigler R. Vogel H. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1619-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Free GFP, which lacks nonspecific interactions with cellular moieties (9Dittrich P. Malvezzi Campeggi F. Jahnz M. Schwille P. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), is a good indicator of the intracellular environment. The similarity in the diffusion characteristics of PH2-GFP and PH-CRAC-GFP with those of free GFP indicates that the two PH domains are not interacting with any bulky intracellular moiety in the cytosol. It is surprising that the diffusion of PH10-GFP was slower than that of the other PH domains and free GFP. With PCH analysis, it has been shown that this slow diffusion is not due to aggregation of the protein. A possible reason for the slow diffusion of PH10-GFP could be that the domain is interacting with a bulky intracellular moiety, ∼8 times its molecular mass, because the diffusion is twice as slow as that of the other PH domains or that it is enclosed in high viscosity microregions formed by the cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm. Luby-Phelps et al. (21Luby-Phelps K. Taylor D.L. Lanni F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2015-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the presence of structural barriers in the form of filamentous meshwork of varying pore sizes in the cytoplasm. The diffusion coefficients obtained from measurements at different positions in cells show wide distributions compared with GFP in vitro (Figs. 5 and 7). The wide distributions illustrate the heterogeneity and dynamics of the intracellular environment. From the width of the distributions and relative S.D. values for the PH domain-GFP fusions and free GFP in the cells (Table I), it is clear that the intracellular heterogeneities affected all the species to a similar extent. The effect was also similar in vegetative and polarized cells. However, the changes in the intracellular environment upon polarization of the cell affected free GFP and the three PH domain-GFP fusions differently. The diffusion of free GFP in the cell cytoplasm was faster in polarized cells than in vegetative cells, as indicated by the shift in the distribution of the diffusion coefficient values to higher values (Fig. 7). The diffusion coefficients obtained for free GFP in buffer and cells indicate that the intracellular viscosity in polarized cells was ∼1.7 times lower than in vegetative cells. A 1.4-fold decrease in the cytoplasmic viscosity in polarized Dictyostelium cells was observed in a previous study using FRAP (6Potma E.O. de Boeij W.P. Bosgraaf L. Roelofs J. van Haastert P.J. Wiersma D.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2010-2019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Faster diffusion was also seen for PH2-GFP in polarized cells, although, in this case, the shift in the distribution of diffusion coefficient values was less pronounced. Surprisingly, PH10-GFP and PH-CRAC-GFP showed no change in their diffusion characteristics upon polarization of the cells. Thus, the lowering of viscosity had no detectable effect on PH10-GFP and PH-CRAC-GFP diffusion. This can be the case if the effect of change in viscosity on PH10 and PH-CRAC diffusion is cancelled by another event taking place in the polarized cells. At this stage, it is not clear what that event might be. The factors that can interfere with FCS measurements are cellular autofluorescence and fluorophore depletion in the cell because of photodestruction at the focus (22Brock R. Jovin T.M. Rigler R. Elson E.S. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy: Theory and Applications. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 132-161Google Scholar). An additional factor in Dictyostelium is the movement of the cells. Below, it is shown that these three factors did not interfere with our measurements. The autofluorescence from the cells did not correlate and so did not contribute to the autocorrelation function derived from the diffusion of GFP and GFP fusion proteins. Thus, it did not interfere with the measurement of diffusion times and was ignored. The second factor, i.e. the possibility of photodestruction in the excitation volume during the measurement, was minimized by using short measurement times (5–10 s) at low excitation intensities (<10 microwatts). The expression levels of cells with free GFP, PH-CRAC-GFP, and PH2-GFP were too high for FCS, and so the fluorophore was bleached before the measurement. However, no fluorescence recovery or photobleaching was observed during the measurement. This indicates that the average number of molecules in the detection volume remained constant. Consequently, the diffusion times were not affected by the bleaching procedure. The third factor that has to be taken into account is the high mobility of Dictyostelium cells. Cells incubated in buffer constantly formed pseudopods and moved around. This made it difficult to make repeated measurements in these cells. The measurement times chosen for the experiments (5–10 s) not only minimized the possibility of photodepletion, but also ensured that the movement of the cells during the measurement was limited. Longer measurement times of up to 30 s were possible in cells immobilized in agarose. For most of the measurements, it was observed that the average fluorescence intensity did not remain steady around an average value, but showed a slow drift (Fig. 8). This also held true for cells immobilized in agarose. Similar drifts in average fluorescence intensity obtained from the cytoplasm have been observed in other cells (10Chen Y. Muller J.D. Ruan Q. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The slow drifts in intensity on the time scale of seconds were attributed to cellular and intracellular movements. The drifts were accounted for by adding an offset value to the autocorrelation curve (Equation 1). In conclusion, we have characterized the diffusion of three PH domains in Dictyostelium cells. Of the three domains, PH2 was homogeneously distributed in vegetative and polarized cells, whereas PH10 and PH-CRAC showed transient translocation to the leading edge of the polarized cell. The diffusion characteristics of PH2 and PH-CRAC in vegetative cells were very similar, but PH10 exhibited slower diffusion. All three PH domains were similarly affected by the intracellular heterogeneities. However, in polarized cells, where the viscosity was 1.7 times lower than in vegetative cells, only PH2 showed increased mobility. PH10 and PH-CRAC did not show any change."

Reconstitution of PDE6 and activated Gαt, on the surface of large unilamellar vesicles containing d-myo-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), stimulated PDE activity nearly 4-fold above the level observed with membranes containing no phosphoinositides, whereas G protein-independent activation by trypsin was unaffected by the presence of phosphoinositides.

In many signaling cascades there is cross-talk between cyclic nucleotide second messenger signaling and signaling by phosphoinositides and their metabolic products.

Acta. 1988; 970: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We reported previously (10Womack K.B. Gordon S.E. He F. Wensel T.G. Lu C.C. Hilgemann D.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2792-2799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that d-myo-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), added in micellar form, stimulates PDE6 activation in rod cells in Xenopus laevis outer segment membranes, as measured with electrophysiological methods, and in bovine rod outer segments, as measured using an enzymatic assay. The cGMP-gated cation channel of rod outer segments was also found to be inhibited by PI(4,5)P2. These results left in question whether lipids delivered in this manner act at a site relevant for physiological regulation of PDE activation in rod cells, where they would be presented at the surface of the disk membrane. They also left in question whether other phosphoinositides, such as PIP, a more abundant lipid in rod cells than PIP2, may also play a role. An important role for phospholipids in G protein-effector interactions is well established, particularly in photoreceptors. The presence of phospholipid bilayers dramatically enhances activation of PDE6 by Gαt (see Ref.11Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and the references cited therein), and the magnitude of the effect is determined by the character of the head group and the side chains. A recent study demonstrated specific interactions between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and PDE6 and between phosphatidylserine and Gαt (12Hessel E. Heck M. Muller P. Herrmann A. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22853-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Gαt-GTPγS, in contrast, did not bind l-α-phosphatidylserine (PS) but enhanced interactions of PDE6 with l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC). PDE6 and transducin are both peripheral membrane proteins that can be readily isolated in soluble form and whose membrane attachment is assisted by covalently attached lipids. Gαt is heterogeneously acylated at its N-terminal glycyl residue, and PDE6 has farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups attached in thioether linkages to C-terminal methyl-esterified methionyl residues on the α and β subunits. Because it has two attached lipids as compared with one for Gαt, PDE6 binds more tightly to lipid bilayers than does Gαt, and, under dilute conditions, we have observed that PDE6 enhances binding of Gαt to vesicles. Moreover, lipid surfaces that favor Gαt activation of PDE6 also enhance its binding to vesicles containing bound PDE6. Both PDE6 and Gαt are acidic proteins with large net negative charges at neutral pH, yet they bind fairly tightly to negatively charged rod outer segment disk membranes and to vesicles containing negatively charged lipids. Thus, in contrast to many peripheral proteins whose attraction to membranes is largely electrostatic and therefore somewhat nonspecific in nature, these phototransduction proteins seem to rely on hydrophobic interactions between the hydrocarbon phase of the membrane and their attached lipid chains and on specific interactions with certain head groups. Here we explore the ability of phosphorylated inositol phospholipids to modulate these interactions as a possible mechanism for modulating the efficiency of phototransduction. Buffers—Standard buffers include a PDE pH assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT), a binding buffer for immobilized phospholipids (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2), and a washing buffer for immobilized lipids (300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8).

Lipids used were as follows: PS (brain, porcine-sodium salt), PC (egg, chicken), and l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (egg, chicken) from Avanti Polar Lipids; d-myo-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) (bovine brain) and PI(4,5)P2 (bovine brain) from Calbiochem; and d-myo-phosphatidylinositol (PI), d-myo-phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI(5)P), and d-myo-phosphatidylinositol-3,5-biphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) from Echelon Biosciences Inc. Vesicle Binding Assays—Assays were carried out essentially as described previously (11Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified proteins (20 nm PDE6 holoenzyme and/or 150 nm Gαt-GTPγS) were mixed with vesicles (150 μm total phospholipid) and, after 10 min of incubation, spun at 44,000 rpm for 20 min in a TLA-100.3 tabletop ultracentrifuge rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and equivalent proportions of the total pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting with Gαt- or PDE-specific antibodies. Phosphodiesterase Assays—Assays of PDE-catalyzed cGMP hydrolysis were carried out as described (11Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by continuous pH recording with the following standard conditions in pH assay buffer: 20 nm PDE; 150 nm Gαt-GTPγS (when present); 2 mm cGMP; and 150 μm total phospholipid in the form of synthetic vesicles (when present). To assess maximal PDE activity, samples were treated with 0.2 mg/ml trypsin. Ca2+Assays—To determine the influence of [Ca2+] on phosphoinositide effects, pH assay samples were buffered with 0.6 or 0.8 mm EGTA and varying amounts of CaCl2 (0–2.4 mm) added. Free [Ca2+] was determined in parallel samples containing 1 μm Fura-2 (Molecular Probes) by measuring fluorescence excitation spectra and calculating [Ca2+] as described (17Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using a Kd value under our conditions of 224 nm for the binding of Fura-2 to Ca2+. Phospholipase Treatment—Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus was obtained from Sigma. ROS membranes were incubated at a concentration of 50 μm rhodopsin with 5 units/ml of enzyme (or no enzyme for the control samples) in pH assay buffer in a volume of 80 μl, at 37 °C. After the reaction had proceeded for the indicated times, the sample was diluted to 500 μl and then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C (TLA-100.3 rotor). The supernatant was removed, and then the ROS membranes were washed again with PDE assay buffer and finally resuspended in 40 μl of PDE assay buffer for adding to phosphodiesterase assays. Phospholipid Filter Binding Assay—Filter binding assays were performed using immobilized lipid membranes (Echelon Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The membrane was blocked in TBST/0.1% ovalbumin for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with 2.25 nm PDE6 or 5 nm Gαt-GTPγS diluted in blocking solution at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was extensively washed in TBST prior to standard immunoblotting with the appropriate primary antibody (see above). After final washing, ECL detection was used to indicate binding of protein to lipids. Effect of Phosphoinositides on PDE6 Activation by Gαt-GTPγS—To present phosphoinositides in a more physiologically relevant context than the addition of micelles employed previously (10Womack K.B. Gordon S.E. He F. Wensel T.G. Lu C.C. Hilgemann D.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2792-2799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we prepared large unilamellar vesicles with fixed proportions of PE, PC, and PS containing various phosphoinositides. These were then reconstituted with purified PDE6 and activated transducin in the form Gαt-GTPγS. As reported previously, reconstitution of PDE6 and Gαt-GTPγS on vesicles greatly enhances the activation of PDE, even in the absence of phosphoinositides (Fig. 1). However, the presence of phosphoinositides phosphorylated at the 4-OH position enhanced the activation even further, by as much as a factor of 3.8 (see below). PI(4,5)P2 was consistently the most potent, followed by PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4)P. In contrast, PI and PI(5)P had little effect on PDE activation above that observed with the control vesicles containing only PC, PE, and PS. PI(3,5)P2 had some enhancement activity, which, over a large number of experiments, ranged between <10% to as much as 44% of the activity of PI(3,4)P2. Thus the effect is specific for certain isomers of the phosphoinositides, with a preference for those phosphorylated at the 4 position. Binding of PDE and Gαt to Phospholipid Vesicles—In previous experiments with reconstituted vesicles, we observed a strong correlation between PDE6-dependent Gαt binding to vesicles and PDE activation (11Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assayed binding of PDE6 and transducin to vesicles with different phosphoinositides incorporated. The results, shown in Fig. 2, are in good agreement with the results obtained by activity assays. The strongest binding is to vesicles containing PI(4,5)P2, which is the most potent activator, and there is somewhat weaker binding to PI(4)P, which also activates less potently. The addition of PI(5)P to vesicles only slightly enhanced binding of the PDE6-Gαt-GTPγS complex. Effects of Divalent Cations on Phosphoinositide Stimulation of PDE Activation—Because PDE6 and Gαt are both negatively charged and the most potent lipid mixtures for stimulating their interactions include synthetic lipids with positive charges (11Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to propose that divalent cations may play a role in the interactions of these negatively charged protein surfaces with lipids possessing multiple negative charges. Ca2+ plays a critical role in the recovery phase of phototransduction and changes dramatically in response to light, as it is extruded from the cell upon closure of the major influx route, the cGMP-gated channels. Therefore we tested whether the concentration of Ca2+ affects the ability of phosphoinositides to stimulate activation of PDE and stimulate binding of PDE or the PDE-Gαt-GTPγS complex to membranes. The results, shown in Fig. 3, show at most a modest ability of Ca2+ to stimulate the phosphoinositide effect. It seems unlikely that such small changes play an important physiological role. However, assays at the physiologically relevant [Ca2+] of 81 nm do demonstrate the greatest enhancement, 3.8-fold, of PDE activation induced by PI(4,5)P (Fig. 3A). Mg2+ is essential for PDE enzymatic activity (18Srivastava D. Fox D.A. Hurwitz R.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19He F. Seryshev A.B. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20572-20577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), so we were not able to assay directly its role in the phosphoinositide enhancement of activity. However, we were able to measure its effect on the enhancement of membrane binding by phosphoinositides by carrying out vesicle binding assays such as those shown in Fig. 2 with 2 mm EDTA in the presence or absence of 4 mm MgCl2. We detected no significant difference in PDE6 or Gαt-GTPγS bound to vesicles in samples with or without millimolar free Mg2+ (data not shown). Thus, divalent cations do not play a major role in the interaction between the negatively charged protein complex and the negatively charged lipids. Effect of Phosphoinositide Depletion by Phospholipase C—If endogenous phosphoinositides present in disk membranes act to enhance transducin activation of PDE6, then depletion of those lipids would be expected to decrease the Gαt-GTPγS-PDE6 interactions in membranes from rod outer segments. When ROS membranes were incubated with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C before assaying Gαt-GTPγS-stimulated PDE6 activity, the activity was found to be lower in the phospholipase samples (Fig. 4). The relative G protein-stimulated activity decreased over a 2-h PLC incubation, whereas the total PDE activity, triggered by trypsinization of the PDEγ inhibitory subunits, remained nearly constant. These results are consistent with the loss, upon phospholipase treatment, of endogenous phosphoinositides in ROS membranes that enhance PDE6-G protein interactions. Binding of Immobilized Phosphoinositides by PDE6 and Transducin—In addition to assaying phosphoinositide binding using vesicles, we also tested PDE6 and Gαt binding to commercially available filter membranes containing immobilized phospholipids, including various phosphoinositides. When a PDE6 heterotetramer was incubated with filters containing immobilized phospholipids, which were then washed and probed with PDE6-specific antibodies, binding of PDE6 to specific phosphoinositides was easily detectable (data not shown). However, there was little correlation between the specificity of binding of PDE to immobilized phospholipids and the effects of different phosphoinositides on PDE activation. PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4)P2 were much more potent in stimulating Gt activation of PDE than were PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2, but the preference was reversed in binding assays using immobilized phospholipids, where the strongest binding was seen with PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2. We were also unable to detect significant enhancement of Gαt-GTPγS binding to the immobilized phosphoinositides in the presence of PDE6. We conclude that the patterns of specificity of these proteins binding to lipids as presented on these membranes are not representative of their binding to either reconstituted lipids or, in all likelihood, native membranes. Nearly two decades of investigation have failed to uncover convincing evidence that phosphoinositides play a major role in the activation phase of dim flash responses in rod cells. Experiments with gecko rods suggest that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) does not play an important role in phototransduction (20Jindrova H. Detwiler P.B. Physiol. Res. 1998; 47: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that phosphoinositides in general and their ability to modulate G protein-effector interactions as documented here, in particular, may have a role to play in the changes in sensitivity and kinetics that occur under varying background lighting conditions. Light and dark adaptation, although more subtle than the immediate dramatic responses of dark-adapted rod cells to light, are also more complex processes (21Hurley J.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Arshavsky V.Y. Makino C.L. J. Gen.

They are known to have multiple components, not all of which have been definitively identified. An interesting possibility is that phospholipase C activation, either directly by G protein subunits or by changes in intracellular Ca2+, could modulate PDE6 activation efficiency. Alternatively, synthesis of phosphoinositides by regulation of lipid kinases or the enzymes responsible for PI synthesis could serve as a point of regulation during adaptation. Immunostaining experiments using antibodies specific for PI(4,5)P2, revealed strong immunostaining of rod outer segments in the dark, which was rapidly abolished upon illumination (27Das N.D. Yoshioka T. Samuelson D. Shichi H. Cell Struct. Funct. 1986; 11: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Das N.D. Yoshioka T. Samuelson D. Cohen R.J. Shichi H. Cell Struct.

Eye Res. 1990; 51: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have indicated that rod outer segments contain the enzymes necessary for phosphorylation of PI and PIP as well as phospholipase C, which can degrade PIP and PIP2. These previous results suggest that there may be fairly high levels of PIP2 and, possibly, PIP in the dark and that they can be reduced in response to illumination. Recently, our standard preparation of ROS membranes was assayed using a novel chromatographic method that can detect PIP and PIP2 without radiolabeling (29Nasuhoglu C. Feng S. Mao J. Yamamoto M. Yin H.L. Earnest S. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Hilgemann D.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PIP was detected at a level of 1% of the level of phosphatidylserine or ∼10 moles per mole of PDE6, and this endogenous PIP likely accounts for the PLC effect we observe. PIP2 levels were undetectably low, likely as a result of the operation of lipid phosphatases and phospholipases in our ATP-depleted preparation from frozen retinas. Phosphatidylinositol, the precursor for PIP and PIP2, was found at 40% of the level of phosphatidylserine. It will be important to quantify PIP and PIP2 levels in vivo in light-adapted and dark-adapted conditions. Sites for sensitivity modulation in G protein signaling pathways are coming under increasing scrutiny as potential sites for therapeutic intervention with drugs that might fine tune rather than completely block certain pathways. The photo-transduction system might serve as a useful model for understanding the role of phosphoinositide modulation of G protein-effector interactions in desensitization and sensitization.

The purification and study of integral membrane proteins present serious problems, derived from the requirements of a partly aqueous, partly hydrophobic environment for the maintenance of a native-like conformation and activity by those proteins (1Haltia T.

Among them, bacterial conjugation is one of the major routes by which bacterial pathogens acquire antibiotic resistance. Conjugative plasmid R388 has the shortest known mobilization region (12Bolland S. Llosa M. Ávila P. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TrwB is the conjugative coupling protein encoded by this region (13Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F.

The intact protein binds ATP with significantly higher affinity than the truncated soluble form. Availability of both the native protein (TrwB) and the truncated mutant lacking the transmembrane domain (TrwBΔN70) prompted us to compare the stability of both protein forms. Native and truncated TrwB were subjected to different stability challenges, namely guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl), 1The abbreviations used are: GdmHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; DDM, β-d-dodecylmaltoside; TrwBΔN70, a truncated form of the TrwB protein lacking amino acid residues 1–70. 1The abbreviations used are: GdmHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; DDM, β-d-dodecylmaltoside; TrwBΔN70, a truncated form of the TrwB protein lacking amino acid residues 1–70. heat, and low ionic strength. In all cases the whole protein was more stable than the truncated form. Moreover, truncated TrwB was found to be stabilized by detergent, but even in this case stability was lower than for whole TrwB. These results provide direct evidence for the role of the transmembrane anchor in maintaining the functional conformation of an extramembranous domain in an integral membrane protein.

Lowercase letters show the variation from the wild type sequence introduced by oligonucleotide (2White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar) at the 3′-terminus of the trwB gene to eliminate the stop codon to accommodate an in-frame C-terminal His tag in the TrwB protein. To overproduce TrwBH6 protein, plasmid pBU3 was constructed as follows. Plasmid pUB1, which carries the trwB gene with a silent mutation that creates a KpnI site (17Hormaeche I. Alkorta I. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46456-46462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was used as template for a PCR reaction with oligonucleotides 1 and 2. The resulting 1.5-kbp fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI. Subsequently, this fragment was cloned in NdeI-XhoI-digested pET-22b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). This construction places a His6 tag at the C terminus of TrwB. The resulting construction directs expression of TrwB protein under control of the T7 promoter. Plasmid pBU3 was transformed to and stored in strain D1210. For protein overproduction, plasmid pBU3 was introduced in E. coli BL21 C41(DE3), a mutant strain of E. coli BL21(DE3) (18Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Genetic Techniques—Bacterial transformation with plasmid DNA was carried out by the CaCl2 method (19Cohen S.N. Chang A.C.Y. Hsu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Genetic complementation analysis of the conjugal ability of TrwB was carried out as described by Llosa et al. (14Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Donor cells were selected on Tp + Ap and transconjugants on Su + Tp. Purification of TrwBΔN70 —TrwBΔN70 was produced by overexpression and purified as described by Moncalián et al. (13Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Purification of His-tagged TrwBH6—TrwBH6 protein was overproduced and solubilized in dodecylmaltoside (DDM) as described by Hormaeche et al. (17Hormaeche I. Alkorta I. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46456-46462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The membrane fraction was loaded onto a cellulose phosphate P-11 column (Whatman), and the elution pattern was as described by Hormaeche et al. (17Hormaeche I. Alkorta I. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46456-46462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), so that fractions II (eluted at 500 mm NaCl) and II′ (eluted at 1 m NaCl) were obtained. From this point onward the two fractions were purified separately. Fraction II was supplemented with 5 mm imidazole and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a Pharmacia FPLC system equilibrated with a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) DDM, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Proteins were eluted from the column with a 0–175 mm imidazole gradient in the above described buffer at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Fractions containing TrwB protein were pooled (Fraction III), concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex HR-200 column. TrwB eluted from this column in a monomeric state (Fraction IV). Fraction II′ was loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column as described previously. The resulting Fraction III′ was concentrated and loaded onto a Superose 6 column. A TrwB sample was obtained that corresponded to the hexameric form. All protein determinations were performed by the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Intrinsic Fluorescence Measurements—The intrinsic tryptophanyl fluorescence of TrwB and TrwΔN70 was measured in a PerkinElmer LS50 spectrofluorometer. Excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and emission wavelength was 336 or 340 nm. Slits were 10 nm. Protein concentration was in the 0.8 to 1 μm range. Treatment of Enzyme with GdmHCl—Enzyme (0.5 μm) was incubated with different concentrations of GdmHCl ranging from 0 to 8 m at 25 °C for 1 h in a volume of 100 μl. Emission spectra of the enzyme in the presence of GdmHCl were recorded in a 100 μl volume in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, either 150 mm KCl or 200 mm NaCl, and 0.05% DDM. Infrared Spectroscopy—The protein samples were measured typically at 4 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.8. The H-D exchange was carried out by lyophilization. The spectra were recorded in a Nicolet Magna II 550 spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector using a demountable liquid cell (Harrick Scientific, Ossining, NY) with calcium fluoride windows and 50-μm spacers. A tungsten-copper thermocouple was placed directly onto the window, and the cell was placed into a thermostatted cell mount. Typically 1000 scans for each, background and sample, were collected, and the spectra were obtained with a nominal resolution of 2 cm–1. The data treatment and band decomposition of the original amide I have been described elsewhere (21Arrondo J.L.R. Muga A. Castresana J. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 22Bañuelos S Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M Pifat G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The mathematical solution to the decomposition may not be unique, but if restrictions are imposed such as maintenance of the initial band positions in an interval of ±1 cm–1, preservation of bandwidth within the expected limits, or agreement with theoretical boundaries or predictions, the result becomes, in practice, unique. Thermal analysis was performed by heating continuously in the range of 25 to 80 °C with a heating rate of 1 °C/min. Spectra were collected by using a rapid scan software running under OMNIC (Nicolet). Typically 305 interferograms were collected/spectrum and then referred to a background, the spectra being obtained with a nominal resolution of 2 cm–1. Thermal profiles were obtained as described elsewhere (24Echabe I. Dornberger U. Prado A. Goñi F.M. Arrondo J.L.R. Protein Science. 1998; 7: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Denaturation by Guanidinium Hydrochloride—To compare the stability of TrwB with that of TrwBΔN70, the proteins (0.5 μm) were equilibrated in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% DDM (w/v)) with different GdmHCl concentrations. Protein unfolding was detected by measuring fluorescence emission due to aromatic residues, likely dominated by the tryptophan residues. Unfolding is accompanied by a shift of the maximum fluorescence emission wavelength toward higher values, because of exposure of Trp residues to a more polar (aqueous) environment. Fig. 1A shows that the proteins followed different denaturation patterns. For the intact protein in detergent, denaturation started above 3 m GdmHCl and increased linearly with denaturant agent concentration, up to about 7 m GdmHCl. The truncated form displayed a higher maximum fluorescence emission wavelength (λem) even in the absence of GdmHCl. This may be a sign of partial unfolding or else because two Trp residues are missing in the truncated protein, so that its fluorescence emission properties may be different. There was no significant change in TrwBΔN70 fluorescence until GdmHCl reached 4 m. However, complete denaturation of TrwBΔN70 took place at concentrations as low as about 5 m GdmHCl. Note that in Fig. 1A, TrwBΔN70 was suspended in the same detergent concentration as TrwB, so that the difference in stability can be solely attributed to the transmembrane domain. Resistance to GdmHCl denaturation was also used to test the effect of the detergent on the soluble protein TrwBΔN70. Fig. 1B shows the effect of GdmHCl (up to 8 m) on the fluorescence emission maximum wavelength in protein preparations incubated in buffer with or without 0.05% (w/v) DDM. Although similar red-shifts in the emission maximum were observed in both cases (11 nm), the detergent confers stability to the protein because in its presence the red-shift occurs only at concentrations above 4 m GdmHCl, whereas in the absence of detergent even at 2 m GdmHCl a change in fluorescence emission maximum is detectable. In consequence, the stability of the proteins under study increases in the order: TrwBΔN70 in the absence of detergent < TrwBΔN70 in 0.05% (w/v) DDM < TrwB in 0.05% (w/v) DDM. Secondary Structure of TrwB and TrwBΔN70 —Information on the secondary structure of the native and truncated proteins was obtained by analysis of the infrared amide I band, located between 1700 and 1600 cm–1 and arising mainly from the C=0 stretching vibration of the peptidic bond. This band is conformationally sensitive and can be used to monitor either the secondary structure composition or the changes induced in the protein by external agents (21Arrondo J.L.R. Muga A. Castresana J. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 23Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the curve-fitted spectra of TrwB and of TrwBΔN70, both in the presence of DDM, i.e. the same initial conditions as in Fig. 1A. The original amide I envelope was curve-fitted using the band positions obtained from the deconvolved spectra, and the results are summarized in Table III. TrwB was an α/β protein, in agreement with data from the crystal structure of the truncated form; 38% α-helix and 17% β-sheet were found by x-ray versus 35.9% α-helix and 32.5% β + unordered estimated from IR measurements of TrwBΔN70 (15Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. de la Cruz F. Coll M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7556-7566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For the intact protein in detergent, α-helical structures clearly predominated. In TrwBΔN70 removal of the transmembrane domain caused major changes in the distribution of secondary structure elements, mainly a decrease in the proportion of α-helix with a concomitant increase in the band components centered at 1639 and 1625 cm–1. The signal at 1639 in D2O corresponds to both β-sheet and unordered structure, and thus truncation appeared most likely to increase the proportion of unordered components. The band at 1625 cm–1 in non-aggregated proteins has been associated with monomer-monomer contacts in oligomeric proteins (25Martínez A. Haavik J. Flatmark T. Arrondo J.L.R. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 33: 19737-19742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar), thus suggesting subunit aggregation under the conditions of the IR measurements. It should be noted in this respect that TrwBΔN70 crystallized in hexamers (15Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. de la Cruz F. Coll M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7556-7566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, the band component around 1660 cm–1 has been attributed to turns but also to 310-helices (21Arrondo J.L.R. Muga A. Castresana J. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). X-ray data indicated a 310-helix structure for helix E in the so-called all-alpha domain of TrwBΔN70 (15Gomis-Rüth F.X.

The study of protein structural changes caused by an external perturbation such as temperature provides information on the protein conformation and organization during unfolding. Fig. 3, A and B, shows plots of the deconvolved amide I band in D2O of TrwB and TrwBΔN70 in the 20–80 °C interval. At high temperatures, the infrared spectrum was characterized by the appearance of two bands around 1617 and 1685 cm–1, representative of protein aggregation. The temperature at which these bands appear is usually related to the compactness of the protein. A looser protein tends to melt at a lower temperature (23Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This denaturation temperature could be obtained from the changes in the amide I; the widths at half-height (Fig. 3C) showed that there was a difference of around 15 °C in the denaturation temperature between the truncated and native proteins, the latter being more stable. Similar differences have been reported between cytochrome c and its apocytochrome (26Muga A. Mantsch H.H. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2629-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and in concanavalin A between the native and the Mn2+-depleted forms (27Arrondo J.L.R. Young N.M. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Ionic Strength and Protein Stability—Ionic strength and salt composition of the medium are well known factors that influence protein stability. In our case, experiments were designed to test the effect of salt concentration on the stability of TrwB and of the soluble mutant TrwBΔN70. To study the effect of ionic strength, TrwBΔN70 (0.8 μm) was incubated in different detergent-free, salt-containing buffers. Protein stability was detected by measuring the time course of decrease in fluorescence emission due to aromatic residues, likely dominated by the tryptophan residues. The decrease in fluorescence emission intensity is likely because of the transfer of Trp residues to a more polar (aqueous) environment. Fig. 4A shows the effect of salt concentration on TrwBΔN70 intrinsic fluorescence. There is an important decrease in tryptophan fluorescence in the absence of salt. On the contrary, when salt concentration was 150 mm, the protein intrinsic fluorescence remained virtually unaltered with time, even when other buffer components, e.g. glycerol, were removed (Fig. 4A, plots 1 and 2). To establish a relationship between ionic strength and fluorescence stability, TrwBΔN70 was incubated in buffers containing different salt concentrations. Fig. 4B illustrates the salt-dependent profile of the protein intrinsic fluorescence. As salt concentration increased, the difference between the initial intrinsic fluorescence value and the one measured after 90 min of incubation was smaller, indicating that salt had a stabilizing effect. The relative stabilities of TrwB and TrwBΔN70 under low salt conditions were studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 5A. In this case, because of technical difficulties in exchanging the buffer of TrwB, the salt concentration could not be decreased below 30 mm. Thus for both proteins in Fig. 5A the buffer composition was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3% (v/v) glycerol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) DDM. As expected from the data in Fig. 4B, protein denaturation was not dramatic at 30 mm NaCl, but still TrwB was clearly more stable than TrwBΔN70, in agreement with the GdmHCl and thermal denaturation studies. Dodecylmaltoside and TrwBΔN70 Stability—The protective effect of DDM against denaturation, which already had been observed in the presence of GdmHCl, was also seen against the low salt challenge for TrwBΔN70, as shown in Fig. 5B. In the presence of 0.05% (w/v) DDM and the complete absence of NaCl, TrwBΔN70 was perfectly stable judging from the constancy of the fluorescence emission signal. The phenomenon of low salt denaturation and detergent protection was further studied by IR spectroscopy. The amide I bands of the IR spectra of TrwBΔN70 in (a)50mm Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl buffer, (b)50mm Tris HCl, pH 7.8 buffer, and (c) 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 0.05% (w/v) DDM buffer are shown in Fig. 6. The corresponding results of curve fitting and quantification of secondary structure components are summarized in Table IV.Table IVSecondary structure components of truncated TrwB (TrwBΔN70) in various buffers at 20 °CBufferBand positionBand widthAreaAssignmentcm-1cm-1%Control167924.00.7β-Sheet (high)167221.915.8Turns166116.313.5Turns (310)165116.624.6α-Helix163919.137.1β + unordered162715.18.3Oligomers0 m NaCl168214.72.3β-Sheet (high)167018.411.9Turns165914.72.7Turns (310)165122.744.5α-Helix163619.229.5β + unordered162517.69.0Oligomers0 m NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) DDM168017.92.3β-Sheet (high)167021.313.9Turns165917.916.5Turns (310)165117.021.3α-Helix164017.629.7β + unordered163114.48.6β + unordered162414.87.7Oligomers Open table in a new tab The secondary structure of the control protein (Fig. 6A) is qualitatively similar to that recorded in the presence of both salt and detergent in Fig. 2B, except that in Fig. 6A (salt but no detergent) the proportion of α-helix appears decreased, particularly at the expense of turns and monomer-monomer contacts. Salt removal (Fig. 6B and Table IV) has as its main effect the apparent conversion of turns and β-sheet + unordered structures into α-helix, the latter becoming the dominant feature of the spectrum. In contrast, when DDM is present instead of salt, the IR spectrum (Fig. 6C) is virtually indistinguishable from that of the control protein sample (Fig. 6A). Thus IR spectroscopy confirms the low salt denaturation data in presenting the detergent DDM as stabilizing the structure of the water-soluble TrwBΔN70. As a part of an investigation on the conjugation proteins encoded by plasmid R388, the study of TrwB was undertaken in our laboratories. TrwB is an integral membrane protein that is essential in R388-directed bacterial conjugation (14Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The specific role of TrwB consists of coupling conjugative DNA processing with DNA transfer (28Llosa M. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Coll M. de la Cruz F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). After some preliminary purification efforts (29Moro F. Purification and Characterization of TrwB of Plasmid R388, an Integral Membrane Protein Essential in Bacterial Conjugation. University of the Basque Country, 1996Google Scholar), a strategy was devised to purify a truncated form of TrwB lacking the 70 N-terminal amino acids (TrwBΔN70) (13Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TrwBΔN70 lacks the transmembrane domain of TrwB, and thus the truncated form is a soluble protein that can be purified in a convenient way. TrwBΔN70 binds with high affinity fluorescent ATP derivatives, although no ATP hydrolase activity has been elicited to date. TrwBΔN70 has been crystallized and the three-dimensional atomic structure solved (15Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. de la Cruz F. Coll M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7556-7566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). More recently, the complete TrwB has been purified in detergent micelles and has been found to bind fluorescent ATP derivatives with higher affinity than TrwBΔN70. TrwB also binds ATP, with an apparent Kd = 0.48 mm, in the same order of magnitude of other cytosolic ATP-binding proteins (17Hormaeche I. Alkorta I. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46456-46462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In keeping with the above results, the data presented in this paper are relevant not only for bacterial conjugation but also in the wider context of the variety of integral membrane proteins that consist of a cytosolic domain in which the biochemical activity resides and a transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to the cell membrane. From this perspective, the experiments described above demonstrate that (a) the transmembrane domain may be instrumental in ensuring the maintenance of the native conformation and activity of the cytosolic domain, and (b) the soluble cytosolic domain may be stabilized by interaction with amphiphilic molecules, detergents, and perhaps lipids. The Transmembrane Domain Stabilizes the Cytosolic Domain—Heat and GdmHCl are two conventional methods for inducing protein denaturation. Low salt denaturation is perhaps less widely used but is also well known. These three methods are based on rather different physical principles, and thus it is conceivable that TrwBΔN70 will give rise to different denatured forms when subjected to the above treatments. The fact that with all three denaturing agents TrwB happens to be more stable than TrwBΔN70 (Figs. 1A, 3C, and 5A) indicates that the observation that the transmembrane domain stabilizes the cytosolic domain is certainly significant. The inherent structural instability of the truncated protein also has a functional correlation, because TrwB has a significantly higher affinity for ATP than TrwBΔN70 (17Hormaeche I. Alkorta I. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46456-46462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In turn, ATP binding by and/or ATPase activity of TrwB is essential in bacterial conjugation, because a point mutant in the Walker box of TrwB inhibited conjugation with a negative dominant character (13Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The structural studies by Gomis-Rüth et al. (16Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) reveal an analogy between the hexameric structure of TrwBΔN70 and that of mitochondrial H+-ATPase. Hormaeche et al. (17Hormaeche I. Alkorta I. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46456-46462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) also showed that, under certain conditions, TrwB would form hexamers with a protruding hydrophobic stalk. The present study indicated an important difference between TrwB and H+-ATPase in that, in the former, transmembrane and cytosolic domains are covalently bound. In the case of H+-ATPase, the hexameric F1 domain can be easily solubilized without the use of detergents, and soluble F1 is a stable protein that readily binds and hydrolyzes ATP. For TrwB, however, the fact that both domains are covalently bound appears to have important structural and functional implications. For similar two-domain membrane proteins, the present data are an indication that studies involving the truncated, water-soluble moieties must be interpreted with care. Amphiphiles Stabilize the Water-soluble Domain—The observation that the non-ionic surfactant DDM was able to stabilize TrwBΔN70 was made only (Fig. 1) as a consequence of our interest in subjecting both TrwB and TrwBΔN70 to Gdm-HCl under the same initial conditions. A detailed IR study (Fig. 6) confirmed that the detergent has an obvious stabilizing effect on the truncated protein. This can be interpreted in the light of the three-dimensional structure of TrwBΔN70. In fact, β-strands 9 and 10 are not defined in the TrwBΔN70 crystal structure, probably because they form the internal lining of the inner membrane pore covered by the absent transmembrane α-helices (15Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. de la Cruz F. Coll M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7556-7566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). If this were the case, the detergent would cover the hydrophobic surfaces in these β-strands that are apposing the transmembrane helices in the complete protein. This observation would imply tertiary structure interactions between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains that are not immediately obvious from the sequence. Further studies involving other two-domain (cytoplasmic + transmembrane) integral membrane proteins will be required to determine the more or less general validity of the observations in this paper concerning the structural implications of the transmembrane domain for protein stability."

We provide here evidence that H/R induces Lck kinase activity and Lck-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. H/R also stimulates MEK-1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations, and H/R-induced phosphorylations were suppressed by the dominant negative form of Lck (DN Lck, K273R) as well as pharmacological inhibitors of EGF receptor and Lck indicating that EGF receptors and Lck are involved in these processes. Transfection of these cells with wild type Lck or Lck F505 (Y505F) but not with Lck F394 (Y394F) induced phosphorylations of EGF receptor followed by MEK-1 and ERK1/2, suggesting that Lck is upstream of EGF receptor and Tyr-394 of Lck is crucial for these processes. H/R also induced uPA secretion and cell motility in these cells. DN Lck and inhibitors of Lck, EGF receptor, and MEK-1 suppressed H/R-induced uPA secretion and cell motility. To our knowledge, this is the first report that p56lck in presence of H/R regulates MEK-1-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and uPA secretion through tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor, and it further demonstrates that all of these signaling molecules ultimately control the motility of breast cancer cells. We have recently reported that tyrosine kinase, p56lck regulates cell motility and nuclear factor κB-mediated secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα following hypoxia/reoxygenation (Mahabeleshwar, G. H., and Kundu, G. C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 52598–52612). However, the role of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) on ERK1/2-mediated uPA secretion and cell motility and the involvement of p56lck and EGF receptor in these processes in breast cancer cells is not well defined. We provide here evidence that H/R induces Lck kinase activity and Lck-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells.

To our knowledge, this is the first report that p56lck in presence of H/R regulates MEK-1-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and uPA secretion through tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor, and it further demonstrates that all of these signaling molecules ultimately control the motility of breast cancer cells. Signal transduction by reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Lck, leukocyte-specific tyrosine kinase; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; GF, growth factor; GFR, GF receptor; EGF, epidermal GF; EGFR, EGF receptor; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; DN, dominant negative. has recently become an important target in cellular biology studies (1Bevan P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1429-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hensley K. Floyd R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The signaling properties of ROS are largely due to the reversible oxidation of redox-sensitive target proteins. The generated ROS act as intracellular second messengers to modulate signal transduction pathways. ROS play significant roles in regulating disease- and stress-induced cellular injuries such as ischemia/reperfusion, UV irradiation, and inflammation (3Fan C. Li Q. Ross D. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2072-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The data also showed that the exposure of cultured cells to H2O2 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of several growth factor receptors (GFR) in the absence of growth factor (GF) stimulation (4Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of GFR plays important role to induce the activation of downstream events similar to that observed upon GF stimulation. Lck, a member of the Src family protein tyrosine kinase, is mostly expressed in T cells and some B cells. We and others have recently reported that Lck is expressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines (5Koster A. Landgraf S. Leipold A. Sachse R. Gebhart E. Tulusan A.H. Ronay G. Schmidt C. Dingermann T. Anticancer Res. 1991; 11: 193-201PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol.

Lck is a typical Src-like tyrosine kinase, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue, Tyr-505, located near the carboxyl terminus (8Amrein K.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In vitro, Lck undergoes autophosphorylation at Tyr-394 (9Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the extent of phosphorylation at Tyr-394 correlates with Lck activity and appears to be required for maximum catalytic activity (10Boulet I. Fagard R. Fischer S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). T-cell antigen receptor ligation of an Lck-deficient Jurkat mutant, J.CaM1, failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p42MAPK upon anti-CD3 or monoclonal anti-T-cell antigen receptor β antibody treatment. The same stimuli activated p42MAPK in J.CaM1 cells transfected with p56lck, demonstrating that Lck plays an important role in MAP kinase activation (11Gupta S. Weiss A. Kumar G. Wang S. Nel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the erbB growth factor receptor family. EGF and its receptor are frequently up-regulated in many human cancers. It has also been described that c-Src catalytic activity is required for integrin-EGF receptor macromolecular complex formation and EGF receptor phosphorylation. Similarly, when cells were exposed to the Src kinase inhibitor pp1, tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor induced by integrin-mediated adhesion was strongly reduced. Simultaneously, overexpression of a kinase negative form of c-Src strongly reduced integrin-dependent EGF receptor phosphorylation, suggesting that c-Src is upstream of EGF receptor (12Laura M. Laura D. Sara C. Elena B. Elisabetta B.E. Monica S. Emilia T. Saverio F.R. Maria G.G. Mascia V. Jasminka G-Z. Amedeo C. Erik S. Laura B. Carlo T. Paolo G. Lorenzo S. Guido T. Paola D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9405-9414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The EGF receptor has been shown to be instrumental in the activation of MAPK pathways and cell motility in different cell types (13Maheshwari G. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Mariotti A. Kedeshian P.A. Dans M. Curatola A.M. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Previous results indicated that extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), a member of the MAPK family, plays an important role in EGF receptor-mediated cell signaling. Inhibition of ERK1/2 by the MEK-1 inhibitor, PD98059, resulted in the significant inhibition of the basal cell migration (15Price J.T. Tiganis T. Agarwal A. Djakiew D. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5475-5478PubMed Google Scholar). ERK1/2 also plays a key role in the regulation of AP-1 as its activation leads to the induction of c-Fos, which may associate with c-Jun to form a second AP-1 heterodimeric complex for the regulation of uPA expression (16Karin M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which p56lck in the presence of H/R regulates EGF receptor phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation in human breast cancer cells is not well defined. uPA is involved in cell adhesion, cell motility, tumor growth, and metastasis. It is also regulated at transcriptional level by multiple transcription factors. AP-1 transcription factor duplex plays a major role in the control of inducible uPA expression through binding of enhancer regions in the promoter of the uPA gene (17DeCesare D. Vallone D. Caracciolo A. Sassone-Corsi P. Nerlov C. Verde P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 365-376PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathways by which p56lck in the presence of H/R controls the uPA secretion and cell motility through the activation of MEK-1/ERK1/2 pathways in breast cancer cells are not clearly understood. In this study, we investigate the involvement of p56lck in the redox-regulated activations of MEK-1 and ERK1/2 and secretion of uPA through the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor following H/R in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. We demonstrate that H/R induced p56lck kinase activity, which ultimately phosphorylates EGF receptor and activates ERK1/2 through the MEK-1-dependent pathway. These lead to the induction of uPA secretion and cell motility, which is prerequisite for proteolytic degradation, extracellular matrix invasion, and distant metastasis. Materials—The rabbit polyclonal anti-p56lck, anti-actin, anti-EGF receptor, anti-ERK1/2, anti-MEK-1, anti-phospho-MEK-1 and mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The mouse monoclonal anti-uPA antibody was obtained from Oncogene. pp2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo [3,4-d] pyrimidine), emodin (6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone), aminogenistein (4′-amino-6-hydroxyflavone), damnacanthal (3-hydroxy-1-methoxy anthraquinone-2-aldehyde), AG-99 (α-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy) cinnamide), PD153035 [4-((3-bromophenyl)amino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio) butadiene), and PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone) were purchased from Calbiochem. Rabbit muscle enolase was from ICN. [γ-32P] ATP was purchased from the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (Hyderabad, India). pTRACER-A vector and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. Boyden type cell migration chambers were from Corning. All other chemicals were analytical grade. Cell Culture—The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Hypoxic Cultures—The MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells grown to 50–70% confluency were made hypoxic in evacuation chambers by intermittent application of vacuum and sparging with 95% N2, 5%CO2. Cells were analyzed at this point or maintained under hypoxic conditions in the presence of 100 mm dithionate (an oxygen scavenger) at 37 °C for 0–3 h. These cells were reoxygenated for the indicated periods by replacing the medium with fresh medium and incubating the cultures in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Plasmids and DNA Transfection—The wild type Lck, mutant Lck F394 (Y394F), and Lck F505 (Y505F) cDNAs in an expression vector (pCEP4) were generous gifts from Dr. B. M. Sefton (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). The dominant negative form of Lck (DN Lck, K273R) in pcDNA3 was a kind gift from Dr. D. R. Branch (Canadian Blood Services, Toronto, Ontario). Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with Lck cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the methods as described earlier (6Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52598-52612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These transfected cells were used for Lck kinase activity, detection of phosphorylations of Lck, EGF receptor, MEK-1, and ERK1/2, and uPA secretion by Western blot analysis and cell migration. The transfection efficiency was assessed as described previously (18Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Ito Y. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34541-34551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, both of these cells were cotransfected with wild type or mutant Lck cDNA and pTRACER-A vector (Invitrogen) containing green fluorescent protein in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus. The cells were allowed to grow for 24 h and then analyzed under fluorescence microscopy. Transfection efficiency was assessed by dividing the number of green fluorescent cells by the total cell number in the same randomly chosen fields in each transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—To examine whether EGF receptor is involved in H/R-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p56lck, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of EGF receptor inhibitors (0–35 pm PD153035 or 0–15 μm AG-99) and then induced by H/R for 90 min. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 solution containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm EDTA). Equal amounts of total proteins in lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blot using mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The same blots were reprobed with rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibody. To delineate whether H/R plays any role in the regulation of EGF receptor phosphorylation, both of these cells were induced by H/R for 0–120 and 0–135 min, respectively. An equal amount of total proteins from the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The same blots were reprobed with anti-EGFR antibody. To check whether Lck plays any role in regulation of EGF receptor phosphorylation, both of these cells were individually treated with various concentrations of Lck inhibitors (0–16 μm emodin, 0–4 nm pp2, 0–2 μm aminogenistein, and 0–0.8 μm damnacanthal) for 24 h and then induced by H/R for 75 min in MCF-7 cells and for 90 min in MDA-MB-231 cells. In separate experiments, cells were individually transfected with DN Lck and then induced by H/R. The dominant negative activity of Lck was also verified by Yousefi et al. (19Yousefi S. Ma X.-Z. Singla R. Zhou Y.-C. Sakac D. Bali M. Liu Y. Sahai B.M. Branch D.R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 133: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In other experiments, cells were transfected with wild type Lck, Lck F394, and Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with maximum doses of Lck inhibitors (16 μm emodin, 4 nm pp2, 2 μm aminogenistein, and 0.8 μm damnacanthal) and then induced by H/R as described above. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described above. The same blots were reprobed with anti-EGFR antibody. To examine whether H/R induces the phosphorylation of MEK-1 and whether H/R-induced MEK-1 phosphorylation is regulated by Lck or EGF receptor, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with DN Lck, wild type Lck, mutant Lck F394, or Lck F505 and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with Lck inhibitors (16 μm emodin, 4 nm pp2, 2 μm aminogenistein, and 0.8 μm damnacanthal) for 24 h and then induced by H/R for 90 min. In other experiments, cells were treated with various concentrations of EGF receptor inhibitors (0–35 pm PD153035 and 0–15 μm AG-99) and then induced by H/R as described above. Equal amount of total proteins from treated or transfected cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using rabbit anti-phospho-MEK-1 antibody. The same blots were reprobed with rabbit anti-MEK-1 antibody. To check whether H/R regulates the ERK1/2 phosphorylation and H/R-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation is governed by Lck, EGF receptor, and MEK-1, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with DN Lck, wild type Lck, mutant Lck F394, or Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with Lck inhibitors or EGF receptor inhibitors or MEK-1 inhibitors as described above. These cells were then induced with H/R, and cell lysates were immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. The same blots were reprobed with rabbit anti-ERK1/2 antibody. To investigate the roles of Lck, EGF receptor, and MEK-1 on H/R-induced uPA secretion, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with DN Lck, wild type Lck, mutant Lck F394 or Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with maximum concentrations of inhibitors of Lck, EGF receptor, or MEK-1 as described above and induced by H/R for 24 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using mouse monoclonal anti-uPA antibody. As loading controls, the same blots were reprobed with rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—To delineate the effect of H/R on Lck kinase activity, both of these cells were either transiently transfected with wild type Lck, mutant Lck F394, or Lck F505 or treated with different concentrations of EGF receptor inhibitors (0–35 pm PD153035 or 0–15 μm AG-99) and then induced by H/R for 90 min. Cell lysates containing an equal amount of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Lck antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were used for Lck kinase assay using acid denatured enolase as substrate as described earlier (10Boulet I. Fagard R. Fischer S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To examine whether H/R regulates the EGF receptor kinase activity and to check the specificity of Lck inhibitors in H/R-induced EGF receptor activation, the EGF receptor kinase assays were performed as described (20Donato N.J. Gallick G.E. Steck P.A. Rosenblum M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20474-20481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were induced by H/R, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody. The immunocomplex was incubated with Lck inhibitors and used for EGF receptor kinase assay. Cell Migration Assay—The migration assay was conducted using a Transwell cell culture chamber according to the standard procedure as described previously (21Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Philip S. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14487-14497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed with H/R, and a cell suspension (5 × 105 cells/well) was added to the upper chamber of the polycarbonate membrane filter. The lower chamber was filled with fibroblast-conditioned medium, which acted as chemoattractant. In separate experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with Lck inhibitors (0–16 μm emodin, 0–4 nm pp2, 0–2 μm aminogenistein, and 0–0.8 μm damnacanthal) and induced by H/R for 24 h. In other experiments, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were individually transfected with DN Lck, wild type Lck, mutant Lck F394 or Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with inhibitors of Lck, EGF receptor or MEK-1, or anti-uPA antibody as described earlier and then induced by H/R for 24 h. After treatment or transfection, cells were added to the upper chamber of the polycarbonate membrane filter and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The non-migrated cells on the upper side of the filter were scraped, and the filter was washed. The migrated cells in the reverse side of the filter were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa. The migrated cells on the filter were counted under an inverted microscope (Olympus). The experiments were repeated in triplicate. Preimmune IgG served as a non-specific control. H/R Induces Lck Phosphorylation and Its Kinase Activity— We have investigated the effect of H/R on Lck-dependent MEK-1/ERK1/2-mediated uPA secretion through tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in breast cancer cells. Accordingly, we first examined whether H/R is able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck and its kinase activity in low invasive (MCF-7) and highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells. Both of these cells were transiently transfected with wild type Lck, mutant Lck F394, and Lck F505 and induced with H/R for 90 min. These transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck antibody, and immunoprecipitated samples were used for kinase assay using enolase as substrate. The data revealed that H/R induced Lck kinase activity in MCF-7 (Fig. 1A, lane 2) and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1B, lane 2) cells as compared with cells grown under normoxic conditions (lane 1). Both wild type Lck and mutant Lck F505 enhanced the phosphorylation of enolase in MCF-7 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 5) and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 5) cells as compared with cells transfected with Lck F394 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 4). These results indicated that H/R induced the Lck kinase activity in both of these cells and also suggested that Tyr-394 of Lck is important for this process. To delineate whether p56lck is located upstream of EGF receptor in ROS-mediated signaling pathway, both of these cells were pretreated with EGF receptor inhibitors, induced by H/R, and immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck antibody, and immunoprecipitated samples were used for Lck kinase assay. The data indicated that EGF receptor inhibitors have no effect on Lck kinase activity in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1, C and D, lanes 1–4), suggesting that Lck is located upstream of EGF receptor in these pathways. To delineate whether EGF receptor plays any significant role in H/R-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck, both of these cells were treated with EGF receptor inhibitors and then induced by H/R. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Lck antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1, E and F, upper panels, lanes 1–8), and the same blots were reprobed with anti-Lck antibody as loading control (Fig. 1, E and F, lower panels, lanes 1–8). The inhibitors of EGF receptor have no effect on H/R-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck. These data further confirmed that Lck is upstream of EGF receptor in these pathways. All of these bands were quantified by densitometric analysis, and the values of -fold changes are calculated. To examine the transfection efficiency, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cotransfected with Lck and pTRACER-A vector (Invitrogen) in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus. The cells were analyzed under fluorescence microscopy. The transfection efficiency was quantified by dividing the number of green fluorescent cells by the total cell number in the same randomly chosen fields in each transfection, and a high level of transfection efficiency was observed in MCF-7 (82%) and MDA-MB-231 (78%) cells (data not shown). H/R Enhances EGF Receptor Phosphorylation and Its Kinase Activity—We have examined the effect of H/R on phosphorylation of EGF receptor in breast cancer cells. Accordingly, MCF-7 cells were stimulated with H/R for 0–120 min, and MDA-MB-231 cells were induced by H/R for 0–135 min. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody, and the immunocomplex was analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The data showed that H/R induced EGF receptor phosphorylation in MCF-7 (Fig. 2A, upper panel, lanes 1–8) and in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lanes 1–9) cells. The same blots were reprobed with anti-EGF receptor antibody as loading control (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panels). The bands were quantified densitometrically, and the values of -fold changes are calculated. To examine the effect of H/R on EGF receptor kinase activity and to check the specificity of Lck inhibitors on this activity, both of these cells were induced by H/R and immunoprecipitated with anti-EGF receptor antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were treated in the absence or presence of Lck inhibitors and used for kinase assay. The results showed that H/R induced EGF receptor kinase activity and Lck inhibitors have no inhibitory effect on H/R-induced kinase activity of EGF receptor in both of these cells (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 1–6). p56lck Is Involved in H/R-induced EGF Receptor Phosphorylation—To delineate the role of Lck in H/R-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation, both of these cells were pretreated with different concentrations of Lck-specific inhibitors and then induced by H/R. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGF receptor antibody and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. The data showed that H/R-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor was dramatically suppressed by Lck inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner in MCF-7 (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 1–14) and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 1–14) cells. The same blots were reprobed with anti-EGF receptor antibody as loading control (Fig. 3, A and B, lower panels, lanes 1–14). These results clearly suggested that Lck plays a crucial role in H/R-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation. To further confirm whether Lck plays any role in H/R-induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, both of these cells were transfected with DN Lck and induced by H/R. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGF receptor antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The data indicated that DN Lck suppressed the H/R-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in MCF-7 (Fig. 3C, upper panel, lanes 1–3) and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3D, upper panel, lanes 1–3) cells. The same blots were reprobed with anti-EGF receptor antibody as loading control (Fig. 3, C and D, lower panels, lanes 1–3). In separate experiments, both of these cells were transiently transfected with wild type Lck, mutant Lck F394, or Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with maximum doses of Lck inhibitors and induced by H/R. The data showed that both wild type Lck and Lck F505 enhanced the H/R-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in MCF-7 (Fig. 3E, upper panel, lanes 3 and 5) and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3F, upper panel, lanes 3 and 5) cells as compared with cells transfected with Lck F394 (Fig. 3, E and F, upper panels, lane 4) or induced by H/R alone (Fig. 3, E and F, upper panels, lane 2). As expected, no phospho-specific band was detected in cells grown under normoxic conditions (Fig. 3, E and F, upper panels, lane 1). Lck inhibitors drastically suppressed the H/R-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation in wild type Lck transfected cells (Fig. 3, E and F, upper panels, lanes 6–9). The expression of non-phospho-EGF receptor was shown as loading control (Fig. 3, E and F, lower panels, lanes 1–9). This data clearly suggested that Lck is directly involved in H/R-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation and Tyr-394 of Lck plays a critical role in this phosphorylation process. All of these bands were quantified by densitometric analysis and the values of -fold changes are calculated. H/R-induced Breast Cancer Cell Migration Is p56lck-dependent—In this study, we have demonstrated that p56lck is involved in EGF receptor phosphorylation upon H/R induction. Therefore, we sought to determine whether p56lck has any role in breast cancer cell migration in the presence of H/R. MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of Lck inhibitors and then induced by H/R. These treated cells were used for a cell migration assay. The data indicated that MDA-MB-231 cells exposed with H/R showed higher migration (695%) than cells grown under normoxic conditions (100%) (Fig. 4, A and B). Pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with emodin (398–132%), pp2 (320–109%), aminogenistein (415–134%), or damnacanthal (308–119%) showed drastic suppression of H/R-induced cell migration (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar results were obtained when MCF-7 cells were used for these studies (data not shown). In other experiments, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were individually transfected with wild type Lck, DN Lck (K273R), Lck F394, or Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with maximum doses of Lck inhibitors and induced by H/R. The high level of transfection efficiency was observed in both MCF-7 (82%) and MDA-MB-231 (78%) cells. These cells were used for migration assay, and both wild type Lck (880% in MCF-7 and 1076% in MDA-MB-231) and Lck F505 (872% in MCF-7 and 1072% in MDA-MB-231) transfected cells showed maximum migration as compared with Lck F394 transfected cells (560% in MCF-7 and 700% in MDA-MB-231) (Fig. 4, C and D). H/R-induced migration was suppressed when cells were transfected with DN Lck (K273R) in MCF-7 (Fig. 4C) and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 4D) cells. Lck inhibitors dramatically blocked the H/R-induced cell migration in wild type Lck-transfected MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggested that H/R induced Lck-mediated breast cancer cell migration and Tyr-394 of Lck plays a crucial role in this process. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three determinations. The values were also analyzed by Student’s t test (p < 0.002). H/R-induced p56lck and EGF Receptor-dependent MEK-1 and ERK1/2 Phosphorylations—To examine the effect of H/R on phosphorylations of MEK-1 and ERK1/2 and whether Lck and EGF receptors are involved in these processes, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with wild type Lck, DN Lck (K273R), mutant Lck F394, or Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with various Lck inhibitors and then induced by H/R. In other experiments, cells were either treated with EGF receptor inhibitors or transfected with wild type Lck, DN Lck (K273R), mutant Lck F394, or Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with EGF receptor inhibitors or MEK-1 inhibitors and then induced by H/R. The transfection efficiency was monitored, and a high level of transfection efficiency was detected in both MCF-7 (82%) and MDA-MB-231 (78%) cells. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-phospho-MEK-1 or anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. The data indicated that both wild type Lck and Lck F505 enhanced the H/R-induced MEK-1 phosphorylation as compared with Lck F394 transfected cells (Fig. 5A, upper panel, lanes 2–5). H/R-induced MEK-1 phosphorylation is reduced when cells were transfected with DN Lck (lane 6). A low level of phosphorylated MEK-1 was detected in cells grown under normoxic conditions (lane 1). Lck inhibitors drastically inhibited the H/R-induced MEK-1 phosphorylation in wild type Lck transfected cells (lanes 7–10). The data also showed that EGF receptor inhibitors dose-dependently blocked the H/R-induced MEK-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B, upper panel, lanes 1–8). Similarly, wild type Lck or Lck F505 enhanced the H/R-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation as compared with Lck F394 transfected cells or cells induced by H/R alone (Fig. 5C, upper panel, lanes 2–5). Lck inhibitors dramatically suppressed the H/R-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in wild type Lck transfected cells (lanes 6–9). DN Lck blocked the H/R-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D, upper panel, lanes 1–3). The results also indicated that inhibitors of EGF receptor or MEK-1 suppressed the H/R-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in wild type Lck transfected cells (lanes 1–7). The same blots were reprobed with either anti-MEK-1 or anti-ERK1/2 antibody as loading control (Fig. 5, A–E, lower panels). These results suggested that H/R induces MEK-1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations through Lck and EGF receptor-mediated pathways. The same results were obtained in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). H/R Induces uPA Secretion through p56lck-dependent EGF Receptor and MEK-1-mediated Pathways—To delineate the roles of Lck, EGF receptor, and ERK in H/R-induced uPA secretion, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with wild type Lck, DN Lck, mutant Lck F394, or Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with inhibitors of Lck, MEK-1, and EGF receptor and then induced by H/R for 24 h. The high level of transfection efficiency was observed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using mouse monoclonal anti-uPA antibody. The data indicated that both wild type Lck or Lck F505 transfected cells showed a higher level of uPA secretion as compared with H/R-induced or Lck F394 transfected cells (Fig. 6A, upper panel, lanes 2–5). Lck-specific inhibitors blocked the H/R-induced uPA secretion in wild type Lck transfected cells (lanes 6–9). DN Lck suppressed the H/R-induced uPA secretion (Fig. 6B, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). The data also revealed that inhibitors of EGF receptor or MEK-1 suppressed the H/R-induced uPA secretion in wild type Lck transfected cells (Fig. 6C, upper panel, lanes 2–7). A low level of uPA was detected in cells grown under normoxic conditions (Fig. 6, A–C, upper panels, lane 1). All of these blots were reprobed with anti-actin antibody as loading controls (Fig. 6, A–C, lower panels) and quantified by densitometric analysis. The values were normalized with respect to actin, and -fold changes were calculated. These results demonstrated that H/R induced uPA secretion through Lck-dependent EGF receptor and ERK-mediated pathways. Similar results were obtained in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). H/R Stimulates Lck-dependent EGF Receptor, MEK-1, and uPA-mediated Cell Migration—We and others have recently demonstrated that uPA plays significant role in regulation of breast cancer cell migration (6Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52598-52612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, in this study, we have shown that Lck regulates the EGF receptor-mediated ERK-dependent uPA secretion in breast cancer cells in the presence of H/R. Therefore, we sought to determine whether EGF receptor and MEK-1 play any roles in Lck-mediated breast cancer cell migration in the presence of H/R. Accordingly, both MCF-7 (Fig. 6D) and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 6E) cells were transfected with wild type Lck, Lck F394, or Lck F505, and wild type Lck transfected cells were treated with inhibitors of EGF receptor or MEK-1 and induced by H/R. The high level of transfection efficiency was observed in both of these cells. These cells were used for cell migration assay. The data indicated that both wild type Lck (880% in MCF-7 and 1076% in MDA-MB-231) and Lck F505 (872% in MCF-7 and 1072% in MDA-MB-231) transfected cells showed maximum migration as compared with Lck F394 transfected cells (560% in MCF-7 and 700% in MDA-MB-231) or cells induced by H/R alone (Fig. 6, D and E). The inhibitors of EGF receptor, PD153035 (65% in MCF-7 and 68% in MDA-MB-231 cells), or AG-99 (65% in MCF-7 and 70% in MDA-MB-231 cells) and MEK-1, U0126 (102% in MCF-7 and 150% in MDA-MB-231 cells), or PD98059 (110% in MCF-7 and 115% in MDA-MB-231 cells) suppressed the H/R-induced cell migration in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The results showed that the H/R-induced cell migration is also blocked by anti-uPA antibody in wild type Lck-transfected MCF-7 (184%) and MDA-MB-231 (205%) cells. The data are expressed as the mean of three determinations ± S.E. The values were also analyzed by Student’s t test (p < 0.001). These results suggested that EGF receptor and MEK-1 play crucial roles in H/R-induced Lck-dependent breast cancer cell migration. These data further demonstrated that p56lck induces EGF receptor phosphorylation and subsequently stimulates MEK-1-ERK1/2-dependent uPA secretion, and all of these ultimately control the motility of breast cancer cells in the presence of hypoxia/reoxygenation (Fig. 7). In a recent study (6Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52598-52612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that tyrosine kinase, p56lck, regulates cell motility and NFκB-mediated secretion of uPA through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). However, it was not clear how p56lck in the presence of H/R regulates EGF receptor phosphorylation and ERK-dependent uPA secretion in breast cancer cells. Accordingly, we have investigated the role of H/R on p56lck-dependent EGF receptor phosphorylation in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In this report, we have shown that H/R induced p56lck phosphorylation and Lck kinase activity in these cells. H/R also enhanced Lck-dependent EGF receptor phosphorylation. Lck induced the phosphorylation of MEK-1 and ERK1/2 in the presence of H/R, and both inhibitors of EGF receptors and Lck suppressed these effects, indicating that H/R-induced MEK-1/ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred through Lck and EGF receptor-mediated pathways in breast cancer cells. Transfection of these cells with wild type Lck or Lck F505 but not with Lck F394 induced phosphorylations and activations of EGF receptor followed by MEK-1 and ERK1/2, suggesting that Tyr-394 of Lck plays important roles in these processes and Lck is upstream of EGF receptor. H/R also stimulated uPA secretion and cell motility in these cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of Lck, EGF receptor, and MEK-1 suppressed the H/R-induced uPA secretion and cell motility. Similarly, genetic inhibitor of Lck, DN Lck, also inhibited H/R-induced EGF receptor and ERK1/2 phosphorylations, uPA secretion, and cell motility. These data revealed that p56lck in the presence of H/R regulates EGF receptor-mediated MEK-1-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, uPA secretion, and cell motility in breast cancer cells. Previous results indicated that phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 by H2O2 is dominant over phosphorylation of Tyr-505 (25Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It has been also documented that treatment of cells with pervanadate or diamide induces Lck phosphorylation at Tyr-394 and its kinase activity (26Nakamura K. Hori T. Sato N. Sugie K. Kawakami T. Yodoi J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3133-3139PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that these agents may act through a similar mechanism. Our data reveal that ROS generated by hypoxia/reoxygenation induced p56lck phosphorylation at Tyr-394 and its kinase activity. In this study, we have demonstrated that p56lck in the presence of H/R induced MEK-1 followed by ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Both pharmacological (emodin, pp2, aminogenistein, and damnacanthal) and genetic (DN Lck) inhibitors of Lck suppressed the H/R-induced MEK-1 phosphorylation, indicating that Lck is present upstream of MAPK kinase. Epidermal growth factor and its receptor are frequently up-regulated in different types of human cancers. Earlier reports have indicated that expression of EGF receptor in colon carcinoma cells directly correlates with their metastatic potential (27Radinsky R. Risin S. Fan D. Dong Z. Bielenberg D. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 19-31PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that H/R enhanced the Lck-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in breast cancer cells and further demonstrated that EGF receptor inhibitors have no effect on H/R-induced Lck phosphorylation and its kinase activity, suggesting that Lck is upstream of EGF receptor. EGF promotes the migration and invasion of a number of cell types, which has been linked to alternation in cell-extracellular matrix interactions (28Fujii K. Dousaka-Nakajima N. Imamura S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we have also demonstrated that EGF receptor is directly involved in H/R-induced Lck-mediated breast cancer cell migration. Previous data also indicated that EGF receptor plays a crucial role in the activation of MAP kinase pathways, induction of gene expression (29Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Cir. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and cell motility in different cell types (13Maheshwari G. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Mariotti A. Kedeshian P.A. Dans M. Curatola A.M. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In our study, we have shown that H/R induced EGF receptor phosphorylation, which leads to MEK-1-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell motility in breast cancer cells. EGF receptor inhibitors blocked the H/R-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell motility in these cells. uPA is a serine protease that plays a major role in tumor cell invasion, malignant progression, and distant metastasis. uPA is also responsible for regulation of matrix metalloproteinase activation and cell migration (30Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. O'Shea M. Ward R. Atkinson S. O'Connell J. Docherthy A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 31Das R. Mahebeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28593-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). uPA is regulated at transcriptional level by multiple transcription factor. AP-1 transcription factor duplex plays a major role in the control of inducible uPA expression through the binding of enhancer regions in the promoter of the uPA gene (17DeCesare D. Vallone D. Caracciolo A. Sassone-Corsi P. Nerlov C. Verde P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 365-376PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that ERK1/2 might regulate the AP-1 transcription that ultimately controls the uPA secretion and cell migration in breast cancer cells. In this study, we have detected the level of uPA in both highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells following H/R. H/R-induced uPA secretion is blocked by both genetic and pharmacological inhibitors of Lck and pharmacological inhibitors of MEK-1, suggesting that Lck in the presence of H/R regulates uPA secretion through MEK-1/ERK1/2-dependent pathways. H/R-induced Lck-mediated cell migration is also suppressed by uPA antibody, indicating that uPA plays an important role in breast cancer cell motility. In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that H/R induces Lck kinase activity and further indicated that Lck in the presence of H/R induces the cell migration through tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in low and highly invasive breast cancer cells. H/R also enhanced the phosphorylation of MAP kinase kinase and ERK1/2 in these cells. Both pharmacological and genetic inhibitors of Lck suppressed the H/R-induced MEK-1/ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that Lck plays a significant role in these processes. Lck also induced uPA secretion and cell motility in the presence of H/R, and these are suppressed by inhibitors of Lck, EGF receptor, and MEK-1, indicating that these molecules are involved in uPA secretion and cell motility. Finally, these data showed that p56lck in the presence of H/R regulates MEK-1-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and uPA secretion through tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor and further demonstrates that all of these signaling molecules ultimately control the motility of breast cancer cells. These findings may be useful in designing novel therapeutic interventions that may disrupt the redox-regulated p56lck-dependent EGF receptor and MEK-1/ERK1/2-mediated signaling pathways, resulting in reduction of uPA secretion and consequent blocking of cell motility and metastatic spread of breast cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2096607730,"The thrH gene product of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to complement both homoserine kinase (thrB gene product) and phosphoserine phosphatase (serB gene product) activities in vivo. Sequence comparison has revealed that ThrH is related to phosphoserine phosphatases (PSP, EC 3.1.3.3) and belongs to the l-2-haloacid dehalogenase-like protein superfamily. We have solved the crystal structures of ThrH in the apoform and in complex with a bound product phosphate. The structure confirms an overall fold similar to that of PSP. Most of the catalytic residues of PSP are also conserved in ThrH, suggesting that similar catalytic mechanisms are used by both enzymes. Spectrophotometry-based in vitro assays show that ThrH is indeed a phosphoserine phosphatase with a Km of 0.207 mm and kcat of 13.4 min-1, comparable with those of other PSPs. More interestingly, using high pressure liquid chromatography-based assays, we have demonstrated that ThrH is able to further transfer the phosphoryl group to homoserine using phosphoserine as the phosphoryl group donor, indicating that ThrH has a novel phosphoserine:homoserine phosphotransferase activity.

In most bacteria, a major portion of endogenous threonine is generated from homoserine (Hse) 1The abbreviations used are: Hse, homoserine; P-Hse, phosphohomoserine; P-Ser, phosphoserine; PSP, phosphoserine phosphatase; mjPSP, M. jannaschii PSP; HAD, l-2-haloacid dehalogenase; HSK, homoserine kinase; r.m.s., root mean square; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PDB, Protein Data Bank. in a two-step pathway: 1) phosphorylation of homoserine to phosphohomoserine (P-Hse), a reaction catalyzed by homoserine kinase (thrB gene product), followed by 2) isomerization and dephosphorylation of P-Hse to produce l-threonine (1Patte J.C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. I. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 528-541Google Scholar). On the other hand, serine is synthesized from phosphoglycerate through sequential reactions catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (SerA), 3-phosphoserine aminotransferase (SerC), and phosphoserine phosphatase (SerB) (2Stauffer G.V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. I. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 506-513Google Scholar). ThrB and SerB thus function in two distinct pathways of amino acid biosynthesis. In Escherichia coli and many other species, inactivation of thrB gene results in threonine auxotrophy (3Robichon-Szulmajster H. Surdin Y. Mortimer R.K. Genetics. 1966; 53: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thrB mutants do not lead to threonine auxotrophy (4Clepet C. Borne F. Krishnapillai V. Baird C. Patte J.C. Cami B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3109-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A new gene named thrH has been identified that complements homoserine kinase activity in vivo (5Patte J.C. Clepet C. Bally M. Borne F. Mejean V. Foglino M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of ThrH also rescues serine auxotrophy caused by serB mutant in both P. aeruginosa and E. coli (5Patte J.C. Clepet C. Bally M. Borne F. Mejean V. Foglino M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In vitro assays have confirmed the phosphoserine phosphotase (PSP) activity of ThrH, but no homoserine kinase (HSK) activity of ThrH has been detected by the standard coupled kinase assays (5Patte J.C. Clepet C. Bally M. Borne F. Mejean V. Foglino M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison reveals that ThrH protein is homologous to the PSP encoded by serB gene, which belongs to the HAD (l-2-haloacid dehalogenase)-like hydrolase superfamily (5Patte J.C. Clepet C. Bally M. Borne F. Mejean V. Foglino M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem.

Several members of this superfamily including phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase, phosphomannomutase, and β-phosphoglucomutase use a aspartyl-phosphate phosphoenzyme intermediate during catalysis (7Collet J.F.

Recent structural studies on these enzymes in complex with a series of substrates and transition state intermediates provided a wealth of structural data delineating the catalytic mechanism of this class of aspartyl-utilyzing enzymes (9Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Lahiri S.D. Zhang G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10385-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). ThrH is expected to use a similar phospho-aspartyl intermediate during its catalytic cycle. It is intriguing though how ThrH, homologous to PSP, would perform the function of HSK in the cell. A recent survey of all of the kinases has shown that the majority of HSKs belong to the GHMP family, and its structure representatives have been characterized (13Cheek S. Zhang H. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 855-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, homoserine kinases found in certain bacteria including P. aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitides, Zymomonas mobilis, and Methylobacillus flagellatus are different from the GHMP-type kinases, instead they are distantly related to protein kinases (13Cheek S. Zhang H. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 855-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Marchenko G.N. Marchenko N.D. Tsygankov Y.D. Chistoserdov A.Y. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3273-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Additionally, ThrH protein in P. aeruginosa that compensates HSK activity in vivo belongs to yet another different protein fold, namely the HAD-like fold (5Patte J.C. Clepet C. Bally M. Borne F. Mejean V. Foglino M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To elucidate the structural and the chemical mechanisms of catalysis performed by ThrH, we have undertaken a crystallographic and functional analysis of this enzyme. Here we report the crystal structures of ThrH protein in its apoform and in complex with one of the products (phosphate). These structures delineate the active site architecture of ThrH, which displays significant similarity to PSP. The PSP activity of ThrH is characterized with the continuous spectrophotometric assays. Moreover, using HPLC-based assays, we have found that ThrH is able to phosphorylate homoserine in the presence of phosphoserine in an ATP-independent manner, indicating that ThrH has a novel phosphotransferase activity and can transfer phosphate from phosphoserine to homoserine directly and generate phosphohomoserine. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of ThrH—The thrH gene encodes a 205-residue polypeptide with a molecular mass of 23.5 kDa. It was amplified from P. aeruginosa (ATCC 17933) genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and was cloned into a pProEX (Invitrogen) prokaryotic expression vector containing a trc promoter, His6 tag, and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The resulting plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) for expression. The overexpressed protein was first purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column followed by cleavage of the N-terminal His tag by tobacco etch virus protease. The final purification step was gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The selenomethionine-substituted ThrH protein was expressed in the minimum medium supplemented with selenomethionine and other nutrients following standard protocols (17Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) and purified as described above. Crystallization and Data Collection—ThrH crystals were grown at 20 °C using hanging drop vapor diffusion method. ThrH protein of concentration 25 mg/ml in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 0.3 m NaCl was used for crystallization. 2 μl of this protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 200 mm MgCl2, and 22.5% polyethylene glycol 1000 and equilibrated against the reservoir. Crystals of ∼0.5-1.0 mm appeared typically within 2 days. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221 with cell dimensions of a = 71.75 Å, b = 97.24 Å, c = 131.77 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. With two molecules per asymmetric unit, the Matthew's coefficient was calculated to be 2.39 Å3/Da with a solvent content of 48.6%. The selenomethionine crystals were grown under similar conditions and were of similar diffraction quality as the native crystals. Crystals of the phosphate complex were grown in the presence of 10 mm sodium phosphate, and they are isomorphous to the native crystal. For data collection at 100 K, crystals were transferred sequentially into the cryoprotectant solutions containing the reservoir solution and additional 10, 20, and 30% ethylene glycol. A 2.0-Å resolution data set at selenium absorption peak wavelength (0.979 Å) and a 1.5-Å resolution native data set were collected at beamline 8.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA). Data for the phosphate bound complex was collected in-house on an RAXIS-IV image plate detector. All of the diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 package (18Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The initial phases were obtained by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing method with data collected to 2.0 Å at the selenium peak wavelength (0.979 Å) using the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Eight selenium sites were located, and the resulting phases had a figure of merit of 0.63 after density modification procedures using RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The phases were further improved and extended for native data set to 1.5 Å using the program DM as implemented in the CCP4 package (21P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19764) Google Scholar, 22Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). This resulted in a clearly interpretable electron density map. The polypeptide chain was first traced automatically using ARP/wARP (23Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13867) Google Scholar). The final model contains a total of 412 amino acids for the 2 ThrH monomers in the asymmetric unit, 391 solvent atoms, 4 Mg2+ ions, and 6 ethylene glycol molecules. The structure of the phosphate bound form of the enzyme was solved by molecular replacement using the native structure as the starting model. The refinement statistics of both structures are listed in Table I. Continuous Kinase and Phosphatase Assays—Homoserine kinase activity of ThrH was assayed by the method described by Huo and Viola (27Huo X. Viola R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The activity was monitored by following the production of ADP using the pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay. The assay mixture (typically 500 μl) contained 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg acetate, 2 mm ATP, 0.7 mm phosphoenopyruvate, 0.1 mm NADH, and 20 units each of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. 2-10 μm ThrH was added in the mixture. The reaction was monitored following the disappearance of NADH at 340 nm using a Beckman Coulter DU640 spectrophotometer. The temperature of the assay was maintained at 30 ± 1 °C by an Isotemp circulating water bath. As a control, the same assay was also carried out with a known HSK from Methanococcus jannaschii (14Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Daugherty M. Vonstein V. Overbeek R. Osterman A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Phosphoserine phosphatase assay of ThrH was performed using EnzChek™ phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) following manufacturer's instructions. The assay uses the method of Webb (29Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) that monitors the release of free phosphate by coupling the phosphatase reaction with the enzymatic conversion of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl-purine riboside to 2 amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl purine and ribose-1-phosphate by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl-purine riboside has an absorbance maximum of 330 nm, whereas the maximum absorption of the product is 360 nm. Each 500-μl reaction mixture contains 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium azide, 200 μm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl-purine riboside, 1 unit of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 2.7 μm of the enzyme ThrH. Reactions were started by the addition of various phosphorylated amino acid substrates (5 μl). To test whether ThrH can dephosphorylate P-Hse, the HSK-catalyzed homoserine phosphorylation was coupled to the phosphatase assay. The following components were added in place of the substrate: 1.3 μm M. jannachii HSK, 100 μm ATP, and 100 μm homoserine. HPLC Assays—HPLC assays were performed on a Beckman Coulter HPLC GOLD® system equipped with a UV detector and a Rainin Dynamax fluorescence detector (model FL1). Amino acids were analyzed using the AccQ·Tag™ method of Waters Corporation (Milford, MA) by labeling the reaction contents with the AccQ·Fluor™ reagent (6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate) prior to loading on a C18 reverse-phase column. Compositions of the two elution buffers were as follows: (A) 140 mm sodium acetate, 17 mm triethylamine, pH 4.95, and (B) 60% acetonitrile in H2O and 0.01% acetone. For fluorescence detection, excitation wavelength was λex = 250 nm and emission wavelength was λemm = 395 nm. Labeling of reaction contents was done by mixing 5 μl of the reaction mixture with 15 μl of 20 mm HCl and 60 μl of borate buffer supplied by the manufacturer. 20 μl of the Fluor reagent was then added. The mixture was vortexed for 10 s and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. This was followed by incubation in 55 °C water bath for exactly 10 min. Labeled samples were stored on ice until prior to injection. Following injection, linear gradients of 0-7% Buffer B over 17 min, 7-10% B over 4 min, and 10-34% B over 13 min were applied. The retention times of individual amino acid standards phosphoserine (P-Ser), Ser, and Hse were first determined by individually labeling freshly dissolved 10 mm amino acid using the above protocol. The retention time of P-Hse was determined using P-Hse generated from homoserine and ATP in the presence of M. jannaschii HSK (28Daugherty M. Vonstein V. Overbeek R. Osterman A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The phosphotransferase reaction was done by incubating 100 μm each of Hse and P-Ser along with ThrH enzyme for 3 h in the presence of 20 mm each of KCl and MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 mm HCl, and the reaction contents were labeled with the Fluor reagent as noted above. 5 μl of the labeled reaction mixture was loaded onto the C18 column and monitored by both fluorescence and UV absorbance. Structure Description of ThrH—The crystal structure of P. aeruginosa ThrH contains two monomers in the asymmetric unit. Each ThrH monomer folds into a kidney bean-shaped structure with two lobes or domains (Fig. 1A). Domain I adopts a classical Rossmann-like fold consisting of a central six-stranded parallel β-sheet with helices on either side. Domain II comprises a four-helix bundle (residues 14-68) inserted between the first strand (a) and the first helix (E) of domain I (Fig. 1A) and a β-hairpin (residues 111-127) inserted between the third strand c and the third helix G of the Rossmann domain. The second helix (B) in the four-helix bundle is shorter than the other three and is structurally more flexible (see below). Superposition of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit resulted in an r.m.s. deviation of 0.875 Å for 196 Cα positions. There appears to be a hinge motion between the four-helix bundle and the rest of the structure (Fig. 1B). The largest difference is in the positions of the two helices (B and C) along with their connecting loop. In one of the monomers, this region moves toward domain I by ∼4.2Å compared with the other monomer. Residues in this loop region in both monomers have higher temperature factors than the rest of the structure, indicating a higher degree of flexibility (Fig. 1C). The two ThrH monomers observed in the asymmetric unit are organized in such a manner that the six-stranded β sheet of the Rossmann-like domain in each monomer are packed side-by-side to form a nearly continuous twelve-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 1C). The strand c at the edge of each monomer makes extensive interactions with the other monomer across the interface. The active site of each monomer, as marked by the bound phosphate and Mg2+ ions, is facing away from the interface and is located on opposite sides of the dimer. The dimer interface is predominantly hydrophobic and buries a surface area of 1344 Å2/monomer (∼13% of the total surface area) upon dimerization. The B-factor distribution for the two monomers indicates that one of the monomers is more flexible in the four helical bundle region when compared with the other (Fig. 1C). Structure Comparison with PSP and Other HAD Superfamily Proteins—Sequence comparison has shown that ThrH is clearly related to phosphoserine phosphatases (5Patte J.C. Clepet C. Bally M. Borne F. Mejean V. Foglino M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The previously determined crystal structures of PSP have revealed that PSP belongs to the HAD-like hydrolase fold (30Wang W. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Kim H.Y. Heo Y.S. Kim J.H. Park M.H. Moon J. Kim E. Kwon D. Yoon J. Shin D. Jeong E.J. Park S.Y.

As expected, the overall structure of ThrH is similar to that of PSP. Superposition of ThrH with M. jannaschii PSP resulted in an r.m.s. deviation of 2.6 Å for 182 superimposable Cα atoms (Fig. 2A). This similarity is not limited to the Rossmann-like domain or the conserved sequence motifs. It extends to the second domain as well (Fig. 2, A and B). The domain II of both ThrH and PSP contains a four helical bundle and a β-hairpin, and these secondary structure elements are largely superimposable (Fig. 2A). Even though all of the members of HAD superfamily are marked by three highly conserved sequence motifs that are mapped on the three loop regions in domain I (Figs. 1A and 2B), there are large differences in the structures of the second domains. Some members of the HAD superfamily such as phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (PDB code 1fez) (12Morais M.C. Zhang W. Baker A.S. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10385-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), phosphoglucomutase (PDB code 1lvh) (11Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8351-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and l-2-haloacid dehalogenase (PDB code 1qq5) (32Ridder I.S. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Janssen D.B. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33015-33022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) also contain a second four-helical bundle domain with the same topological connections as PSP/ThrH, although other HAD members such as the hypothetical protein Cof from Thermoplasma acidophilum (PDB code 1l6r) and the catalytical domain P of Ca2+-ATPase (PDB code 1eul) (33Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar) may contain a completely different second domain. In the case of the probable phosphatase YrbI of Haemophilus influenzae (PDB code 1k1e) (34Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the second domain is missing entirely. The Active Site of ThrH—The closest protein neighbor of ThrH, PSP, has recently been well characterized structurally (7Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol.

De Ranter C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sequence and structure comparison of ThrH and PSP revealed a very similar active site configuration. The active site of ThrH is located at the junction of the two domains. Two Mg2+ ions are found in and near the active site (Fig. 3). Their coordination exhibits a nearly ideal octahedral geometry. The ligands for the first Mg2+ ion are the negatively charged side chains of Asp-7, Asp-152, the backbone carbonyl of Glu-9, and three water molecules. The second Mg2+ ion is coordinated to the side chain oxygen of Asp-152 and five well ordered water molecules (Fig. 3). The presence of the second Mg2+ may help to neutralize the negative charges around the active site (Fig. 4A) and thus facilitate substrate binding. However, this second Mg2+ is not observed in the PSP structures. Because ThrH crystals were grown in the presence of 0.2 m MgCl2, the possibility remains that this second Mg2+ may be a crystallization artifact.Fig. 4Phosphate binding site. A, distribution of electrostatic potential shown on the molecular surface of ThrH. The two Mg2+ ions (in gray) and the bound phosphate molecule are shown in space-filling spheres, indicating the location of the active site. This figure was generated using GRASP (37Nicholls A. GRASP: Graphical Representation and Analysis of Surface Properties. Columbia University, New York1992Google Scholar). B, summary of interactions observed between the bound phosphate and ThrH. The hydrogen bonds are indicated by dotted lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the phosphate product-bound structure, the phosphate interacts directly with the first Mg2+ ion (2.31 Å), replacing one of the Mg2+ ligand water molecules in the apostructure (Fig. 4B). It also interacts with side chains of Lys-133 (2.74 Å) and Ser-90 (3.04 Å) and with the backbone amide groups of Asp-91 (3.04 Å) and Glu-9 (2.90 Å). Additionally, the side chains of Asp-7 and Glu-9 are also within the contact distance to the phosphate (3.2-3.4 Å from the phosphorus). Asp-7 is the invariant Asp in the first conserved motif of HAD superfamily that is involved in the nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus of the substrate and subsequent formation of the phospho-aspartyl intermediate. Glu-9 is also highly conserved, and it probably acts as a general base to extract a proton from the attacking water molecule during the later step of hydrolyzing the phosphoenzyme intermediate (9Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Phosphatase Activity of ThrH—Given the profound similarity between ThrH and PSP, it is not surprising that ThrH possesses PSP activity as has been shown previously (5Patte J.C. Clepet C. Bally M. Borne F. Mejean V. Foglino M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We have carried out steady state kinetic analysis of phosphoserine phosphatase activity of ThrH. (Fig. 5A). The measurements yielded a Km of 0.207 mm and kcat of 13.4 min-1, comparable with what have been reported for M. jannaschii PSP (Km = 0.62 mm, kcat = 20 min-1) (9Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The ability of ThrH to dephosphorylate phospho-dl-Thr and phospho-d-Ser was also tested (Fig. 5B). Mor"

Interchanging of the whole i2 loop and its N-terminal half (i2N) had no effect on the binding of both receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. Agonist-induced cAMP formation was observed in wild type EP2 but not in the i2 loop- or i2N-substituted EP2. Wild type EP3β left cAMP levels unaffected, whereas i2 loop- and i2N-substituted EP3 gained agonist-induced adenylyl cyclase stimulation. In EP2, the ability to stimulate cAMP formation was lost by mutation of Tyr<sup>143</sup> into Ala but retained by mutations into Phe, Trp, and Leu. Consistent with this observation, substitution of the equivalent His<sup>140</sup> enabled EP3β to stimulate cAMP formation with the rank order of Phe > Tyr > Trp > Leu. The point mutation of His<sup>140</sup> into Phe was effective in another EP3 variant in which its C-terminal tail is different or lacking. Simultaneous mutation of the adjacent Trp<sup>141</sup> to Ala but not at the following Tyr<sup>142</sup> weakened the acquired ability to stimulate cAMP levels in the EP3 mutant. Mutation of EP2 at adjacent Phe<sup>144</sup> to Ala but not at Tyr<sup>145</sup> reduced the efficiency of agonist-induced cAMP formation. In Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing G<sub>s</sub>-acquired EP3 mutant, an agonist-dependent cAMP formation was observed, and pertussis toxin markedly augmented cAMP formation. These results suggest that a cluster of hydrophobic aromatic amino acids in the i2 loop plays a key role for G<sub>s</sub> coupling."

The amino propeptide of the α1 chain remains attached to the rest of the molecule for a longer period of time after synthesis than the other amino propeptides of type XI collagen and has been localized to the surface of thin collagen fibrils. Yeast two-hybrid system was used to demonstrate that a homodimer of α1(XI) amino propeptide (α1(XI)Npp) could form in vivo.

Type XI collagen is a constituent of the extracellular matrix of cartilage. It belongs to the family of fibrillar collagens, which includes types I, II, III, V, and XI (1Eyre D.E. Wu J.J. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1987: 261-309Google Scholar). As with all of the fibrillar collagens, type XI contains a 300-nm uninterrupted triple helical domain (2Smith G.N. Williams J.M. Brandt K.D. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Type XI collagen forms the heterotypic collagen fibrils characteristic of cartilage along with types II and the nonfibrillar type IX collagen (3Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Although minor in quantity, type XI collagen is thought to play a critical role in collagen fibril assembly and extracellular matrix organization in early development as demonstrated by the chondrodystrophic mouse (cho/cho) (4Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B. Lifferth G.D. Teuscher C. Woodward S.R. Taylor B.A. Seegmiller R.E.

Fibrils of developing cartilage are of uniform 20 nm in diameter and oriented more randomly than fibrils of adult articular cartilage. Collagen fibril assembly in embryonic cartilage is known to rely upon the ratio of the collagenous constituents, types II and XI (5Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Burgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1982: 133-149Google Scholar).

Chem. 1995; 270: 18865-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The role of type XI collagen in limitation of lateral growth of collagen fibrils is well established, although the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Type XI collagen may also play a role in the maturation of thin fibrils into the larger diameter fibrils of the territorial zone of cartilage matrix, either by regulation of the accretion of more collagen molecules onto the surface of thin fibrils or by mediating the fusion of thin fibrils. Type XI collagen is initially synthesized as a procollagen, which is subsequently proteolytically processed at both the amino and carboxyl termini (7Sussman M.D. Ogle R.C. Balian G. J. Orthop.

Recently, type XI α1 pro-collagen was identified as a substrate for the enzyme bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; α1(XI)NTD, α1(XI) amino-terminal domain containing the variable region; Npp, amino propeptide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. (10Medeck R.J. Sosa S. Morris N. Oxford J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl propeptide of the α1 chain of type XI collagen is homologous to the other fibrillar collagens, whereas the amino propeptide of type XI α1 pro-collagen is markedly different. In addition to the characteristic minor triple helix, the α1 chain of XI contains a large non-triple helical domain at the amino terminus. The α1 chain of type XI collagen exists as a set of isoforms that arise by alternative splicing of the primary RNA transcript (11Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The portion encoding the variable region gives rise to biochemically unique domains. However, common to all isoforms is the amino propeptide, the distal globular 233 amino acids, which is ultimately proteolytically removed during the process of extracellular matrix assembly and fibril formation. Proteolytic removal of the amino propeptide may rely on the action of BMP-1, as it does in the case of α1(V) collagen chain (12Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The amino propeptide domain is structurally related to other amino propeptides including that of the α2(XI) and α1(V) collagen chains. The position of four cysteine residues are conserved, and sequence analysis predicts a conserved secondary structural motif rich in β-strand (13Moradi-Ameli M. Deleage G. Geourjon C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1994; 3: 233-239Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This prediction has been supported by analysis of circular dichroism spectra, demonstrating a relatively high percentage β-strand and a markedly low percentage of α helix (14Gregory K.E. Oxford J.T. Chen Y. Gambee J.E. Gygi S.P. Aebersold R. Neame P.J. Mechling D.E. Bachinger H.P. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11498-11506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The dimensions of the globular amino propeptide domain of α1(XI) collagen chain has been estimated by rotary shadowing to be at least 8 nm in diameter. This domain has been localized to the surface of collagen fibrils by immunoelectron microscopy (15Keene D.R. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 10: 967-979Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the amino propeptides are ultimately removed from the collagen triple helical molecule by proteolytic processing, the rate and extent of removal vary. Although the processing of α1(XI) collagen chain is relatively slow, thus achieving 50% completion by 18 h after synthesis in pulse-chase experiments, the processing of the α2(XI) collagen chain is much faster, 75% complete by 5 h after synthesis (16Thom J.R. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7262-7269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the amino propeptides carry out different functions and that the α1(XI) amino propeptide may function while still retained on the surface of collagen fibrils for the extended period of time after synthesis. Globular domains poised on the surface of newly synthesized collagen fibrils may play a role in both the mechanism of growth of an individual fibril as well as lateral fusion of neighboring collagen fibrils or interaction between the collagen fibrils and other constituents of the extracellular matrix. We report the interaction between amino propeptide domains of α1(XI) collagen chains. The interaction had a dissociation constant on the order of 130 nm. This interaction was stabilized in cell culture by an association that was not disrupted by reducing agents, EDTA, SDS, or heat. Such an interaction may explain, in part, how collagen XI functions to regulate growth of collagen fibrils in developing tissues. Synthesis and Purification of Recombinant Rat α1(XI)Npp Domain—A cDNA fragment encoding the amino propeptide of α1 chain of type XI collagen was inserted into expression vector pET11a (Stratagene). BL21 DE3 transformants were screened for expression of recombinant protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subsequent transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for detection of recombinant proteins by nickel affinity blot using nickel-NTA conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Qiagen). Cells from transformant cultures were collected by centrifugation, and proteins were solubilized using bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) with 1 unit of DNase I per 10 ml of cell suspension. This extraction solubilized the majority of cellular proteins, leaving recombinant α1(XI) amino propeptide (α1(XI)Npp) insoluble in the inclusion bodies. Protein from inclusion bodies was solubilized and unfolded in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with freshly prepared 8 m urea, and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol at a protein concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. Refolding was initiated by diluting solubilized unfolded protein drop-wise and with stirring into 100 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, and 2 m urea at 4 °C. Incubation at 4 °C was continued for 16 h. Refolded protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centriprep filtration unit (Amicon). Insoluble material, if present, was removed by centrifugation. Refolded protein was further purified by chelation chromatography on a Hi-Trap nickel column (Amersham Biosciences) (Fig. 1). Disulfide-bonded cysteine pairs were verified by tryptic digest followed by protein sequencing of those bands present in the absence of 10 mm DTT but absent when the sample was treated with reducing agent as described previously (17Soni R. Carmichael J.P. Murray J.A. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Refolded protein was characterized by circular dichroism and compared with native protein isolated from tissue (17Soni R. Carmichael J.P. Murray J.A. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Npp without a His6 tag was generated by removing the carboxyl portion of a recombinant α1(XI) amino-terminal domain containing the variable region (α1(XI)NTD), which contains a functional BMP-1 proteolytic processing site (10Medeck R.J. Sosa S. Morris N. Oxford J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was incubated in the presence of purified recombinant human BMP-1 (FibroGen, Inc.) as described previously (10Medeck R.J. Sosa S. Morris N. Oxford J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid System—A protein-protein interaction was tested in vivo using Matchmaker GAL4 (Clontech, Inc.) yeast two-hybrid system. cDNA encoding α1(XI)Npp was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using the following primers: 5′-cca tgg ttg ata tac tga aag ctt tag at-3′ and 5′-att agg atc ctc atc tat gtg cgg ctc ctg-3′. This fragment was used to make two different gene fusions: one with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and the other with the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4 in the plasmids pGBKT7 and pGADT7, respectively. Yeast host strain AH109 was transformed using the lithium acetate method (17Soni R. Carmichael J.P. Murray J.A. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Selection of positive transformants was carried out by plating on SD minimal medium agar plates lacking the nutrient leucine and tryptophan to select for the plasmids derived from pGBKT7 and pGADT7, respectively. Plates lacking both nutrients were used to select for double transformants. To select for colonies in which the two-hybrid proteins interact, double transformants were plated on SD minimal medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Protein-protein interaction was verified by determining the expression of β-galactosidase activity by colony-lift filter assay and by determining the level of expression in liquid culture using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (Clontech). Weight Average Molecular Weight Determination by Light Scattering—Recombinant α1(XI)Npp was applied to a TSK 3000SW size exclusion column at 10 °C in the following buffer: 30 mm Na2HPO4, 45 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.6, containing 100 mm KCl. The eluting peak was analyzed using a refractive index detector, a UV monitor, and by multi-angle laser light scatter (DAWN, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) to determine the absolute molecular weight of α1(XI)Npp in solution. A vertically polarized laser beam was passed through the flow cell containing the sample. The scattered light was simultaneously detected by 18 separate detectors at different angles. The intensity of the scattered light was digitized and transmitted to a computer for analysis by software provided by the manufacturer. The weight-average molar mass was determined from the Rayleigh ratio of scattered light, molecular concentration in grams/milliliters, and the specific refractive index increment of the dissolved molecules (dn/dc). The concentration was determined from the refractive index at each slice of the chromatogram and also from the absorbance at 280 nm and the 0.1% extinction coefficient, calculated for recombinant rat α1(XI)Npp to be 0.548 assuming all cysteine residues exist as half-cystines. The dn/dc value used was 0.185. Recombinant α1(XI)Npp was analyzed under three salt conditions: 75, 175, and 500 mm with respect to additive concentration of KCl and buffer components. Molar mass was determined for individual slices of data across the eluting size exclusion chromatographic peak and plotted as a function of elution volume. Molecular weight at the leading and trailing edges of the chromatographic peak was compared with to determine whether recombinant α1(XI)Npp multimerized under the buffer conditions of the column. Antibodies—A peptide coding for the human α1(XI)Npp was used to make the α1(XI)Npp antibody that showed specificity for the endogenous α1(XI)Npp but not the recombinant α1(XI)Npp. Preparation and characterization of this antibody was reported previously (18Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20401-20408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the α1(XI)Npp antibody to discriminate between endogenous and recombinant α1(XI)Npp was demonstrated by immunoblot and nickel affinity blot (Fig. 6). Samples of increasing amounts of recombinant α1(XI)Npp were loaded onto an SDS gel and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nickel-NTA-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used to detect recombinant protein from a sample that was three orders of magnitude more dilute than the concentration needed for detection by the polyclonal antibody to α1(XI)Npp. Generation of the α2(XI)Npp antibody was carried out using the sequence RERPQRQPSHRTQ from bovine sequence (18Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20401-20408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the immunizing peptide. Antibody to the variable region of the recombinant α1(XI) amino-terminal domain was described previously (19Davies G.B. Oxford J.T. Hausafus L.C. Smoody B.F. Morris N.P. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ELISA Assay—Recombinant α1(XI)Npp was adsorbed to a microtiter plate in 96-well format at room temperature. To block unoccupied sites on plastic surface, wells were incubated with buffered skim milk powder solution for 1 h at room temperature. Recombinant α1(XI)NTD was allowed to interact with the α1(XI)Npp bound to the plate for 2 h at room temperature. Antibody to the unique variable region was used to detect interaction. Absorbance at 405 nm was plotted as a function of the concentration of bound α1(XI)NTD with variable region detected. This antibody did not recognize α1(XI)Npp. Nonspecific binding of the primary antibody was tested in the absence of antigen. Nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody was tested in the absence of primary antibody. Bovine serum albumin was bound to the 96-well plate as a control to detect nonspecific binding of α1(XI)NTD. Data was subjected to Scatchard analysis to determine KD and Bmax. Co-precipitation of Recombinant and Endogenous α1(XI)Npp Domains—Recombinant α1(XI)Npp, synthesized with six histidine residues in tandem at the carboxyl terminus of the protein, was bound to nickel-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) to investigate the specificity of the interaction between α1(XI)Npp domains. Protein was extracted from bovine chondrocyte pellet cultures using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. No denaturants such as guanidine hydrochloride or urea were present during the extraction. Salt concentration was reduced to 150 mm by dialysis prior to incubation with α1(XI)Npp-bound nickel-agarose. Material that bound to the recombinant α1(XI)Npp was separated from that which did not bind by centrifugation. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot using an antibody that recognized α1(XI)Npp and one that recognized a very similar domain, α2(XI)Npp. Pellet Culture of Bovine Chondrocytes—Fetal bovine chondrocytes were maintained in pellet culture (20Ballock R.T. Reddi A.H. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Where indicated in the text, β-aminopropionitrile fumarate was included in pellet culture medium at a final concentration of 64 μg/ml, putrescine was included at a final concentration of 2 mm, AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonylfluoride·HCl) was included at a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and recombinant α1(XI)Npp was included in tissue culture medium at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 24 h. Proteins from medium and cell pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol and subsequent immunoblot and nickel affinity blot. Recombinant Rat α1(XI)Npp Domain—A 682-bp fragment encoding α1(XI)Npp was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into the pET11a expression vector. Recombinant α1(XI)Npp was expressed as a fusion protein with gene-10 gene product of bacteriophage T7, resulting in the addition of amino acids MAS at the amino terminus of the protein. Protein was expressed by BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The DNA sequence of the insert was determined by automated fluorescence DNA sequencing. The terminal methionine was removed in the bacterial expression system as verified by LCQ™MS/MS. The sequence of interest proceeded from the first proline after the signal peptide processing site of α1(XI) and continued to the glutamine one amino acid before the amino propeptide processing site. Codons for six histidine residues were included in the downstream PCR primer immediately preceding a stop codon. The penultimate amino acid, alanine, was changed conservatively to a valine to allow the antibody to discriminate between endogenous bovine α1(XI)Npp and recombinant rat α1(XI)Npp. In addition, this change modified the sequence at the proteolytic processing site of α1(XI) collagen, reducing the chance that the histidine tag would be removed from the recombinant protein. Recombinant α1(XI)Npp with a His6 tag had a molecular weight of 24,826 g/mol and a theoretical pI of 6.91. Recombinant α1(XI)Npp was recovered from inclusion bodies. After unfolding and refolding, recombinant α1(XI)Npp was purified by nickel-chelation chromatography (Fig. 1). Purified bacterial recombinant α1(XI)Npp co-migrated with human embryonic kidney 293 recombinant α1(XI)Npp by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Unfolded and refolded α1(XI)Npp was previously characterized by spectropolarimetry, electron microscopy, and LCQ-MS/MS (17Soni R. Carmichael J.P. Murray J.A. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Detection of Interaction Using Yeast Two-hybrid System— Expression vectors encoding fusion proteins between the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and α1(XI)Npp and between the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4 and α1(XI)Npp were constructed. Cells cotransfected with both constructs were able to grow in the absence of histidine (Fig. 2), indicating an interaction between the α1(XI)Npp domain portion of each of the fusion proteins. Interaction was also demonstrated by detection of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2C). The level of β-galactosidase activity in double transformants was ∼10-fold higher than background. Size Exclusion Chromatography and Multi-angle Laser Light Scatter—At physiological ionic strength (175 mm), the weight average molar mass varied from the molecular mass of a monomer (25,000 g/mol) at the trailing edge of the size exclusion chromatography peak to 40,000 g/mol, an average molar mass lying between that of a dimer (50,000 g/mol) and a monomer at the leading edge of the peak (Fig. 3). Interaction was favored by low ionic strength (75 mm) and disrupted by high ionic strength (500 mm). Maximum molecular weight observed corresponded to a dimer with no indication of higher multimerization. Multimerization was inferred by an increase in molar mass of purified recombinant α1(XI)Npp. ELISA—Binding was shown to be saturable by ELISA (Fig. 4) in which recombinant α1(XI)Npp was bound to the plate and a tagged recombinant isoform of α1(XI) amino-terminal domain was allowed to interact with the α1(XI)Npp bound to the plate. Antibody to the unique region of the alternate isoform was used to detect interaction. This antibody did not recognize α1(XI)Npp. The dissociation constant was determined to be on the order of 0.13 μm. Specificity of α1(XI)Npp Interaction: Co-precipitation of Endogenous and Recombinant α1(XI)Npp—Bovine chondrocytes maintained in pellet culture were used as a source of cartilage extracellular matrix proteins. Extracts were prepared from 10-day pellets using 1 m NaCl in Tris buffer in the absence of denaturants. These extracts were incubated with recombinant α1(XI)Npp bound to agarose beads. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblot (Fig. 5). As a control, endogenous α2(XI)Npp was analyzed for its ability to bind to recombinant α1(XI)Npp under the same conditions. Using an α2(XI)-specific antibody, α2(XI)Npp was found primarily in the free fraction, whereas bovine α1(XI)Npp bound to the recombinant α1(XI)Npp-agarose beads (Fig. 5). Specificity of Antibody for the Endogenous α1(XI)Npp—The ability of the α1(XI)Npp antibody to discriminate between endogenous and recombinant α1(XI)Npp was demonstrated by immunoblot and nickel affinity blot (Fig. 6). Samples of increasing amounts of recombinant α1(XI)Npp were loaded onto an SDS gel and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nickel-NTA-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used to detect recombinant protein from a sample that was three orders of magnitude more dilute than the concentration needed for detection by the polyclonal antibody to α1(XI)Npp. Location of the epitope site within the amino propeptide and differences in amino acid sequence among the peptide antigen, endogenous bovine sequence, and the sequence within the recombinant protein are demonstrated in Fig. 6C. Interaction in Chondrocyte Pellet Culture System Resulted in a Stable Association—Recombinant α1(XI)Npp was converted from a protein that migrated as an ∼30-kDa protein to one that had an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa under denaturing and reducing conditions when incubated for 24 h with bovine chondrocytes maintained in pellet culture. Both the 30- and 60-kDa bands were detectable via the His6 tag by Nickel affinity blot (Fig. 7). Using the α1(XI)Npp antibody that can discriminate between recombinant and endogenous bovine α1(XI)Npp, the 60-kDa band was also recognized by this antibody, suggesting the formation of a dimer of α1(XI)Npp monomers, one contributed by the endogenous bovine α1(XI) and the other by the added recombinant α1(XI)Npp. In addition, a band with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa was identified as immunologically related to endogenous α1(XI)Npp. The nature of this band is currently unknown. Stability of the 60-kDa band was investigated by subjecting samples to prolonged incubation in the presence of 250 mm imidazole, EDTA, or β-mercaptoethanol at 90 °C with no change observed in migration on SDS gels. The generation of the 60-kDa band during 24 h in bovine pellet culture was not inhibited by inclusion of β-aminopropionitrile fumarate to inhibit lysine-derived covalent cross-linking or by inclusion of putrescine to inhibit transglutaminase in the culture (data not shown). To rule out a possible interaction mediated by the His6 tag present on the recombinant protein, recombinant α1(XI)Npp was generated without a His6 tag, by removing the carboxyl domain from the recombinant α1(XI) amino-terminal domain isoform by enzymatic proteolysis with BMP-1 (Fig. 7, lanes 6 and 7). The resulting recombinant α1(XI)Npp was included in chondrocyte cell culture with similar results (Fig. 7). The α1 chain of type XI collagen exists as a set of isoforms that arise by alternative splicing of the primary RNA transcript. The portion encoding the variable region gives rise to biochemically unique domains. However, common to all isoforms is the amino propeptide, the distal globular 233 amino acids, which is ultimately proteolytically removed during the process of extracellular matrix assembly and fibril formation. Although the amino propeptide domain is thought to play a role in the regulation of fibril diameter, the molecular mechanism of this event is not fully understood. A homotypic interaction was detected among the α1(XI)Npp domains. The possibility of such an interaction was supported by the use of multi-angle laser light scattering by which purified recombinant Npp was found to exist in equilibrium between monomer and dimer. Yeast-two hybrid system also supported the possibility that an interaction between two α1(XI)Npp domains could exist. Freshly isolated chondrocytes were maintained as pellet cultures under conditions that allow the maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype and reestablishment of a characteristic cartilage extracellular matrix. The newly synthesized matrix constituents were used as a source of cartilage matrix candidates for this study. An interaction between recombinant rat α1(XI)Npp and endogenous bovine α1(XI)Npp was detected by co-precipitation. The interaction resulted in a stable and apparently covalent cross-link. The interaction was neither a result of lysine-derived cross-linking nor transglutaminase-mediated cross-links as β-aminopropionitrile fumarate or putrescine did not inhibit the cross-link. The interaction was also not mediated by the His6 tag present on the recombinant protein. Noncollagenous domains of other collagens have been reported to form stable interactions including type X collagen (21Barber R.E. Kwan A.P. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, no such interaction has been described for any of the other fibrillar collagens and no such interactions have been described between propeptide domains. In the case of types IV and X, the interactions were hydrophobic in nature rather than due to covalent bond formation. In the case of the type XI α1 Npp dimer, the stable interaction takes place only in the presence of living cells because incubation of purified Npp does not result in the appearance of higher molecular weight bands on subsequent SDS gels, neither does the incubation of mixtures of recombinant isoforms of α1(XI) amino-terminal domain that contains any of the possible variable domains adjacent to the Npp domain (data not shown). This interaction may because of hydrophobic interaction or may be the result of covalent bond formation between the two Npp subunits. Data from the light scattering experiments do not support a hydrophobic interaction, because a decrease in average molecular weight was observed with increasing ionic strength of the buffer. If the stable interaction is the result of the formation of a covalent bond, it is unknown what enzyme is responsible at this time. Type XI collagen serves primarily a regulatory function in collagen fibrillogenesis. The interaction between α1(XI)Npp domains demonstrated in this study may be coupled to enzymatic events including covalent cross-linking of amino propeptide domains and proteolytic cleavage to remove these domains from collagen fibrils. Such an interaction could contribute to our understanding of 1) initial nucleation of collagen fibrils, 2) lateral fusion of preexisting thin fibrils, and 3) increase in diameter because of accretion of individual collagen molecules to the surface of a growing collagen fibril. The role of type XI collagen in limitation of lateral growth of collagen fibrils is well established, although the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. The α1(XI)Npp has been localized to the surface of thin collagen fibrils, it is relatively long-lived at the surface, and it is clear from the molecular dimensions that the α1(XI)Npp, the variable region, and the minor helix would not be accommodated within the gap region and would therefore sterically hinder further accretion of type II collagen molecules to the surface of a growing fibril. An interaction between Npp domains that favor proteolytic removal of globular domains from the surface may facilitate lateral growth of collagen fibrils.

https://openalex.org/W2071068944,"Expression of trout anion exchanger 1 (tAE1) in Xenopus oocyte led to the stimulation of a Na+- and Cl--dependent Rb influx. Functional features and pharmacological data strongly suggest that this Rb influx is mediated by the endogenous Na-K-2Cl (NKCC) co-transporter. The functional relationship between expression of tAE1 and activation of the NKCC co-transporter was investigated. Indeed, it was shown previously that tAE1 expressed in Xenopus oocyte induces a strong anion conductance which is correlated with an increased taurine permeability. Measurements of intracellular ion contents ruled out the involvement of any modification of known electrochemical parameters in NKCC co-transporter activation by tAE1. Furthermore, using chimera of tAE1 made with AE1 from other species unable to exhibit anion conductance led to the conclusion that there was no correlation between tAE1 anion conductance and NKCC co-transporter stimulation. Therefore, a possible molecular interaction between tAE1 and the NKCC co-transporter was investigated. Our results clearly show that NKCC activation is dependent upon the C-terminal part of tAE1. Chimeric constructions where tAE1 C-terminal part was substituted by the corresponding part of mouse AE1 abolished co-transporter activation. Moreover, steric encumbrance on the C-terminal end of tAE1 with a specific antibody or with a protein fusion also prevented the co-transporter activation. These data suggest a new role for some anion exchangers in controlling other transporter activity by molecular interactions.

These data suggest a new role for some anion exchangers in controlling other transporter activity by molecular interactions. Membrane permeability is an essential property that governs cell physiology. Concentration of intracellular osmolytes and, therefore, of intracellular enzyme activities, specific cell functions, and metabolism depends on cell membrane permeability. To ensure control of intracellular medium, the functioning of membrane transporters must be regulated and coordinated. Regulation of membrane permeability could be achieved by direct modifications on transporters such as phosphorylation by means of kinase or phosphatase action that could change transport features (1Palfrey H.C. Strange K. Cellular and Molecular Physiology of the Cell Volume Regulation. CRC Press, 1994: 201-214Google Scholar). Another regulation possibility is obtained by interactions between transporters. These interactions could be functional, which means that the functioning of one transporter may create electrochemical conditions favorable to stimulate the functioning of other transporters. Many examples of such functional interactions between membrane transporters are known (for instance, electric coupling between channels, thermodynamic coupling between Na-K-2Cl (NKCC) 1The abbreviations used are: NKCC, Na-K-2Cl; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; AE, anion exchanger; tAE1, trout anion exchanger 1; hAE1, human AE1; mAE1, mouse AE1; skAE1, skate AE1. co-transporter and KCl transporter (2Gillen C.M.

Interest in such interactions has been focused on the example of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Different studies report possible molecular interaction of the CFTR with other membrane transporters, such as the Na+ channel ENaC (epithelial Na+ Channel) (5Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R.

Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (in this last example, stimulation of members of the SLC26 family through molecular interactions with the CFTR is only documented by co-immunoprecipitation experiments). To our knowledge, CFTR is the only example of transporter susceptible to regulate other transporters by protein-protein interactions. In the present paper, we provide another example of membrane transporter regulation by direct protein interactions that are not related to transport functions. It concerns interaction between the trout anion exchanger, tAE1, and the NKCC cotransporter. This protein catalyzes the simultaneous transport of one Na+ with one K+ and two Cl- across cell plasma membrane. It can be detected by measuring a Na+- and Cl--dependent K+ influx. Moreover, this co-transport is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of bumetanide. Two different isoforms of this co-transporter are known (NKCC1 and NKCC2), and it has been extensively studied in a great number of cell types (for review, see Ref. 10Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). tAE1 is the anion exchanger of trout erythrocytes. Anion exchangers (AEs) are transmembrane proteins catalyzing the electroneutral exchange of 1 Cl- for 1 bicarbonate. Up to now, three different genes, named slc4a1, slc4a2, and slc4a3, have been known, each of them coding for different polypeptide products, depending on the splicing and transcription initiation site (for reviews, see Refs. 11Alper S.L. Darman R.B. Chernova M.N. Dahl N.K. J. Nephrol. 2002; 15: S41-S53PubMed Google Scholar, 12Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All of the AE polypeptides can be divided into two main domains of about the same size: an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain interacting with cytoskeleton and a membrane spanning domain, which is responsible for ion translocation, with a short C-terminal end in the cytoplasm. By expression studies of tAE1 in Xenopus oocytes, we have demonstrated previously that this normally electroneutral anion exchanger is able to form an anion conductive pathway permeable to different charged or neutral osmolytes such as urea, choline, sorbitol, Na+, and K+ (13Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Fievet B. Perset F. Gabillat N. Guizouarn H. Borgese F. Ripoche P. Motais R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Guizouarn H. Gabillat N. Motais R. Borgese F. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In physiological conditions, these transport properties of tAE1 are activated by a decrease in intracellular ionic strength in swollen erythrocytes, and they are involved in the cell regulatory volume decrease response (16Garcia-Romeu F. Cossins A.R. Motais R. J. Physiol. 1991; 440: 547-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Guizouarn H. Motais R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276 (Pt 1): C210-C220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we focused on another unexpected feature of this anion exchanger. Independently of its own transport ability, this exchanger is able to stimulate the endogenous NKCC co-transporter in Xenopus oocyte. We show that this stimulation is not linked to tAE1 activity but rather to the interaction between the C-terminal end of tAE1 and the NKCC co-transporter. This interaction could involve a direct contact between the two transporters, or it could involve intermediary regulatory proteins. Even though this interaction between tAE1 and the NKCC co-transporter was observed in Xenopus oocyte, it is likely that such interactions could take place in physiological conditions to coordinate transporter activity and regulate cell membrane permeability. RNA Synthesis—tAE1, tAE1gyrB, TZM, T-4M, T-5M, and tAE1ΔN cloned in pSP64polyA vector (Promega) were linearized by EcoR1. mAE1 cloned in pSPT19 was linearized by HindIII. skAE1 and SZT, cloned in a modified pSP64polyA vector, were linearized by ApaI. Linearized DNA were transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase following instructions from Ambion mMessage mMachine SP6 transcription kit. cRNA were then stored at 100 ng/μl in -20 °C before use. Taking of Oocytes—Xenopus laevis were cooled on ice with MS222 until completely anesthetized and were kept covered with ice during the surgery, according to the procedure recommended by our ethics committee. The surgery consisted of removing about five ovarian lobes containing oocytes. After surgery, the animals were placed in cold water between 0 and 4 °C to recover from anesthesia, monitored for 3 hours, and then placed back in their aquaria. Oocyte Injection—Collected oocytes were washed in modified Barth's saline (MBS) (85 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm NaOH, pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin). After washing with MBS, defolliculation was obtained by overnight incubation at 19 °C in MBS containing between 0.8 and 1.3 mg/ml collagenase (Serva) corresponding to 1 unit/ml, followed by a 30-min incubation in Ca2+-free MBS. Stage V-VI oocytes were then injected with 50 nl of 100 ng/μl cRNA and maintained at 19 °C in MBS. This cRNA concentration was found to induce maximal expression of the corresponding proteins in oocyte. Influx Measurements—Cl influx measurements were done as described previously (13Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Guizouarn H. Gabillat N. Motais R. Borgese F. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rb influx measurements were done in media containing 10-4m ouabain to avoid looking at K+ movements through the Na-K-ATPase. Before incubation with radioactive medium, oocytes were quickly washed three times with 1.5 ml of radioactive-free medium containing ouabain 10-4m to adapt the oocyte to the eventually different influx conditions. Eight oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in 80 μl of influx medium containing 86Rb used as a radioactive substitute for K (Amersham Biosciences) with a specific activity of 36,000 dpm/nmol potassium. After 60 min of incubation in radioactive medium (during the linear phase of the uptake kinetic), the oocytes were washed twice in 8 ml of ice-cold MBS and transferred individually into counting vials. Radioactive Rb uptake in each oocyte was determined after scintillation counting with external standard. The incubation medium was counted in duplicate on 5-μl aliquots, using the same protocol to determine the specific activity in each experiment. Rb influx was calculated as the mean of the eight values and expressed as pmol/hour per oocyte. When we compared Rb influx between isosmotic medium (210 mosm) and hyperosmotic medium (270 mosm), both media had the same ion concentrations. Hyperosmotic medium was obtained by adding 60 mosmol of saccharose per liter of MBS. Osmolarity of the media was controlled by measuring osmotic pressure with a Wescor vapor pressure osmometer. The NO3--containing MBS composition was 88 mm NaNO3, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm KNO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.74 mm CaNO3, 10 mm Hepes, 4 mm NaOH, pH 7.4. Na+-free MBS was composed of 88 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.74 mm CaNO3, 10 mm Hepes, 4 mm KOH, pH 7.4. “Control oocytes” refers to non-injected oocytes. In previous experiments, non-injected oocytes were compared with water-injected oocytes, and no difference in Cl or Rb influx between the two groups had been observed. The influx experiments were done 1 or 2 days after oocyte injection (see legends to Figs. 1 and 4). No great difference in Cl as well as Rb influxes was observed between 1 and 2 days of protein expression. Thus, data presented that were obtained at day 1 or 2 after injection are comparable.Fig. 4Effect of different AE1 isoforms on oocyte Cl-dependent Rb influx. Oocytes were injected with cRNA (5 ng/oocyte) of AE1 from different species: trout (tAE1), mouse (mAE1), or skate (skAE1), and the Cl-dependent Rb influx was measured 2 days later in the presence of ouabain. Control refers to non-injected oocytes. Means ± S.E, n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determination of Ion and Water Concentrations of Oocytes—To determine the intracellular Cl concentrations, oocytes were incubated in 36Cl containing MBS up to the equilibrium of specific radioactivity (363 dpm/nmol of Cl). By counting intracellular 36Cl dpm accumulated, it was possible to deduce the intracellular Cl concentration. Na+ and K+ contents were measured as described previously (15Guizouarn H. Gabillat N. Motais R. Borgese F. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Intracellular ions were extracted from dried oocytes in 4 ml of milliQ water overnight at 4 °C. Measurements of sodium and potassium were done with a flame photometer (Eppendorf). Results are expressed in mm (see Table I). The oocyte water content was measured by weighing a group of five oocytes after a quick wash in milliQ water (to remove extracellular ion contaminants) containing 3H-inuline (to be able to determine the extracellular water volume). The oocytes were weighed wet and then dry (they were dried overnight at 80 °C). Subtraction of the dry weight from the wet weight after correction for extracellular water trapped between the five oocytes, gives the water content of five oocytes. Assuming that the five oocytes are equivalent, we deduced the intracellular water content of an oocyte to be around 500 nl.Table IIon concentrations and membrane potentials Illustration of ion concentrations and membrane potentials measured in oocytes expressing tAE1 for one day (tAE1 I+1) compared to non-injected oocytes (NI).

Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique with a TEV 200 amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) monitored by computer through Digidata 1200 A/D converter PC clamp software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Measurements were done in MBS at room temperature. Chimera Construction—Except for TB3-gyraseB, all other chimera constructions are described in previously published papers (13Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 2F. Borgese, C. Renard, N. Gabillat, B. Pellissier, and M. Guizouarn, submitted for publication. The chimera tAE1-gyraseB was made by PCR with plasmids pSP64tAE1 and pcDNA3Raf-gyrB. This last plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Michael Farrar (19Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). tAE1 was amplified with primers 5′-tAE1 (AAGCTTGGGCTGCAGGTCGAG) and 3′-tAE1 (GCGGCCGCCTGGCAACGGGGACTCGTA). The gyrase B was amplified with primers 5′-GyrB (GGCGGCCGCAGCAATTCTTATGAC) and 3′-GyrB (GAGCTGTCAACTAGTGTCGACTTT). The primers 3′-tAE1 and 5′-gyraseB have an overlapping part of nine nucleotides. 100 μl of PCR contained 100 ng of tAE1 or gyraseB plasmids, 200 μm 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate (dNTP), 0.4 μm of each primer, 1 μl of VentDNA polymerase (NEBio-labs); denaturation was for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR products tAE1 (2.7 kb) and gyraseB (0.7 kb) were then diluted 10 times and mixed in a secondary PCR to amplify the fusion tAE1-gyraseB with primers 5′-tAE1 and 3′-gyrB in a final volume of 100 μl containing 1 μl of the two 10×-diluted first PCR products, 200 μm dNTP, 0.4 μm of each primer, 1 μl of Expand high fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The amplification protocol was the same as for the first PCR. This yielded a 3.4-kb product corresponding to the fusion tAE1-gyraseB that was cloned in pGEMT-easy vector (Promega). Then tAE1-gyrB was subcloned in pSP64polyA (Promega) using Fast-Link DNA ligase (Epicenter) and restriction enzymes from NEBiolabs. Top10F′ competent cells (Invitrogen) were transfected, and positive recombinant pSP64polyA-tAE1GyrB containing plasmids were selected and analyzed. Western Blot of Oocyte Membrane Proteins—Oocyte membranes were prepared by homogenization of 20 oocytes (control or injected) in cooled 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 mm protease inhibitor (Pefabloc, Roche Applied Science). The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C at 2000 rpm, 4000 rpm, and finally at 6000 rpm in an Eppendorf tube; after each centrifugation, the pellet was discarded. Collected supernatant after the third centrifugation was ultracentrifugated at 65,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the membrane pellet was solubilized in the homogenization buffer. Protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad kit, and 50 μg of proteins were then loaded per lane of SDS-PAGE electrophoresis gel. Western blot transfer was done with a semi-dry transfer system from Biometra on nylon membrane (Hybond C extra, Amersham Biosciences). The presence of tAE1 was detected by the antibodies Ab145 directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acids of the C-terminal part of tAE1 or Ab146 directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 15 amino acids of the N-terminal part of tAE1 (Neosystem, Strasbourg). Immunoglobulins Ab145 and Ab146 were purified from rabbit serum by precipitation with caprilic acid as described by Reik et al. (20Reik L.M. Maines S.L. Ryan D.E. Levin W. Bandiera S. Thomas P.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 100: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was a goat IgG-peroxidase (Sigma) that was detected by chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Pico, Pierce). Chemicals and reagents were from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Plasmid DNA preparations were done with Qiaquick Miniprep kit from Qiagen, and DNA purifications were done with Machery Nagel nucleospin extract kit. The presence of the endogenous NKCC co-transport in Xenopus oocyte plasma membrane was characterized by measuring a K+ influx that is Cl-- and Na+-dependent, and sensitive to micromolar concentrations of bumetanide (21Shetlar R.E. Schölermann B. Morisson A.I. Kinne R.K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Suvitayavat W. Palfrey H.C. Hass M. Dunham P.B. Kalmar F. Rao M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C284-C292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A illustrates the ouabain-insensitive K+ permeability in Xenopus oocytes between 1 and 5 days after oocyte collection in isosmotic or hyperosmotic media. As shown previously by others, this K+ permeability is largely Na+- and Cl--dependent because substitution of Na+ by N-methyl-d-glucamine or Cl- by NO3- abolished the Rb influx (Fig. 1B). Hyperosmotic stimulation of the NKCC co-transporter increased about 9× the Rb influx of control oocytes. There is no significant difference in the activation of NKCC co-transporter by hyperosmolarity as a function of time. The co-transporter is present and can be activated by hyperosmolarity in oocyte plasma membrane for 5 days after oocyte collection. Moreover, the Rb influx stimulated by hyperosmolarity is highly sensitive to bumetanide as expected (Fig. 1B). In the next experiments, it was observed that expression of the anion exchanger of trout erythrocyte, tAE1, stimulated a Cl--dependent Rb uptake in Xenopus oocyte that was inhibited by bumetanide, by a NO3- substitution of Cl-, and by substitution of Na+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine (Fig. 2A). This Rb influx is not additive with the Cl--dependent Rb uptake stimulated by hyperosmolarity (Fig. 2B); it has the features of the Rb influx mediated by the NKCC co-transporter. In previous work, it was shown that tAE1 is functionally expressed in oocyte plasma membrane where it increases by 6-fold Cl influx of control oocytes as early as 24 h after injection (12Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was observed that this Cl influx increase is proportional to the amount of tAE1-cRNA injected in oocytes, and therefore, it was considered as a relevant marker of tAE1 expression level in oocyte plasma membrane. To correlate activation of NKCC co-transporter to the presence of tAE1 in oocyte plasma membrane, Cl--dependent, bumetanide-sensitive Rb uptake was measured as a function of the amount of tAE1-cRNA injected in Xenopus oocyte (Fig. 3). This experiment shows a good correlation between NKCC activity and tAE1 expression level.Fig. 3tAE1 cRNA dose-dependent activation of NKCC cotransporter. Oocytes were injected with different amounts of tAE1-cRNA: 10, 100, and 1000 pg. In each case, Rb influx was measured 1 day after injection in MBS containing 10-4m ouabain and compared with control oocyte (non-injected). Means ± S.E., n = 8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It should be noticed that the activation of NKCC co-transporter was observed as early as 1 day after tAE1 injection in Xenopus oocyte; then, it persisted over time (Rb influx in tAE1-expressing oocyte was 252 ± 33 pmol per oocyte per h; n = 7, 4 days after injection). The anion exchanger of trout erythrocyte, tAE1, was shown to form an anion conductance permeable to taurine as well as to different organic and inorganic compounds when expressed in Xenopus oocyte (9Shigeru B.H.K. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 10Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). This large anion conductance imposes a resting potential that is close to the resting potential of Cl- (resting potential (Em) measured in tAE1-expressing oocyte 1 day after injection is -36.2 ± 1.9 mV, and the equilibrium potential for Cl (ECl) calculated from data Table I is -35.6 mV). This property is not shared by other members of the AE1 family such as human AE1 (hAE1), mouse AE1 (mAE1), or skate AE1 (skAE1). It should be noticed that skAE1 expressed in Xenopus oocyte has the same transport characteristics as mammalian AE1: it is unable to transport taurine and unable to form an anion conductance.2 Expression of these other AE1s did not induce any increase in the Cl--dependent and bumetanide-sensitive Rb influx (Fig. 4). However, these other AE1s induce a Cl exchange in oocyte that is similar to tAE1, suggesting that they are similarly expressed in plasma membrane (13Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).2 It could be assumed that activation of NKCC co-transporter is due to the anion conductive activity of tAE1. Classical inhibitors of tAE1 anion conductance such as NPPB or niflumic acid could not be used to distinguish tAE1 conductance and activation of the co-transporter because these two compounds also inhibit with high efficiency the NKCC co-transport stimulated by hyperosmolarity (5 × 10-4m of NPPB inhibited 100 ± 0.3% of the Cl-dependent Rb influx activated by hyperosmolarity (n = 8) and niflumic acid at 5 × 10-4m inhibited this Rb influx by 90 ± 3%, n = 8). So we used glybenclamide, inhibitor of the CFTR as well as other anion conductances (23Rabe A. Disseu J. Fromter E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Schultz B.D. DeRoos A.D.G. Venglarik C.J. Singh A.K. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271 (Pt 1): L192-L200PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 5A, glybenclamide strongly inhibits the anion-conductive activity of tAE1 without any significant effect on the tAE1-mediated activation of NKCC co-transport (Fig. 5B). Change in intracellular Cl- concentration is known to activate the NKCC co-transporter (25Robertson M. Foskett J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C146-C156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte ion concentrations were measured to check whether tAE1 expression induced any modification in Cl- concentration 1 day after injection, when activation of the co-transporter was measured. Table I shows that intracellular Na+, K+, and Cl- concentrations are equivalent between control oocytes and tAE1-expressing oocytes 1 day after injection. Thus, there is no variation of intracellular ion concentrations that could explain the activation of the co-transporter in tAE1-expressing oocytes when we did our measurements. In the absence of an obvious functional relationship between tAE1 expression and activation of the endogenous NKCC cotransporter in Xenopus oocytes, stimulation by protein-protein interaction was considered. To assess whether tAE1 is able to stimulate the NKCC co-transporter by protein-protein interactions, different chimeras were done between trout, mouse or skate AE1. Fig. 6A represents a diagram of the different constructions. All of these constructions are functionally expressed in Xenopus oocyte. Except for tAE1ΔN, they have the same Cl- transport features as does tAE1 (13Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); this finding suggests a similar amount of protein in oocyte plasma membrane. This possibility is confirmed by Western blot analyses of oocyte membrane proteins (Fig. 6B). In tAE1ΔN, 300 amino-acids in the putative cytoplasmic N-terminal domain (counting 400 amino-acids) were removed; the deletion of almost all of the cytoplasmic domain of the exchanger has an effect upon this protein expression at oocyte plasma membrane, as indicated by a 69% decrease of the Cl- exchange activity. However, despite a lower Cl- exchange activity, this deletion does not prevent stimulation of the NKCC co-transport, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Thus, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of tAE1 is not important for the stimulation of the co-transporter. In contrast, substitution of the last eight spans of tAE1 by their mouse AE1 counterparts, chimera TZM, abolished the Cl--dependent Rb uptake. The reverse chimera made with mAE1 and the last eight spans of tAE1 are not expressed in oocyte. Therefore, we used skAE1, the skate red cell anion exchanger (26Guizouarn H. Musch M.W. Goldstein L. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 193: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), to construct SZT. When the eight C-terminal helices of skAE1 are substituted by tAE1 corresponding domain, the SZT chimera thus obtained was able to transport Cl- as tAE1 or skAE1,2 and this chimera was also able to stimulate the NKCC activity (Fig. 7). These data strongly suggest that the C-terminal domain of tAE1 is responsible for the activation of the NKCC co-transporter in Xenopus oocyte. To evaluate precisely the size of the C-terminal domain of tAE1 involved in NKCC co-transporter activation, two other chimeras between trout and mouse AE1 were used: T-5M and T-4M. In these"
