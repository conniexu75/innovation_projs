https://openalex.org/W2099610218,"The presence of DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells is a danger signal that triggers host immune responses such as the production of type I interferons. Cytosolic DNA induces interferons through the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP-AMP, or cGAMP), which binds to and activates the adaptor protein STING. Through biochemical fractionation and quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified a cGAMP synthase (cGAS), which belongs to the nucleotidyltransferase family. Overexpression of cGAS activated the transcription factor IRF3 and induced interferon-β in a STING-dependent manner. Knockdown of cGAS inhibited IRF3 activation and interferon-β induction by DNA transfection or DNA virus infection. cGAS bound to DNA in the cytoplasm and catalyzed cGAMP synthesis. These results indicate that cGAS is a cytosolic DNA sensor that induces interferons by producing the second messenger cGAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2154171253,"Cytosolic DNA induces type I interferons and other cytokines that are important for antimicrobial defense but can also result in autoimmunity. This DNA signaling pathway requires the adaptor protein STING and the transcription factor IRF3, but the mechanism of DNA sensing is unclear. We found that mammalian cytosolic extracts synthesized cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP-AMP, or cGAMP) in vitro from adenosine triphosphate and guanosine triphosphate in the presence of DNA but not RNA. DNA transfection or DNA virus infection of mammalian cells also triggered cGAMP production. cGAMP bound to STING, leading to the activation of IRF3 and induction of interferon-β. Thus, cGAMP functions as an endogenous second messenger in metazoans and triggers interferon production in response to cytosolic DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1976182511,"The Gossypium genus is used to investigate emergent consequences of polyploidy in cotton species; comparative genomic analyses reveal a complex evolutionary history including interactions among subgenomes that result in genetic novelty in elite cottons and provide insight into the evolution of spinnable fibres. A phylogenetic and genomic study of plants of the cotton genus Gossypium provides insights into the role of polyploidy in the angiosperm evolution, and specifically, in the emergence of spinnable fibres in domesticated cottons. The authors show that an abrupt five- to sixfold ploidy increase about 60 million years ago, and allopolyploidy reuniting divergent genomes approximately 1–2 million years ago, conferred a roughly 30-fold duplication of ancestral flowering plant genes in the 'elite' cottons G. hirsutum and G. barbadense compared to their presumed progenitor G. raimondii. Polyploidy often confers emergent properties, such as the higher fibre productivity and quality of tetraploid cottons than diploid cottons bred for the same environments1. Here we show that an abrupt five- to sixfold ploidy increase approximately 60 million years (Myr) ago, and allopolyploidy reuniting divergent Gossypium genomes approximately 1–2 Myr ago2, conferred about 30–36-fold duplication of ancestral angiosperm (flowering plant) genes in elite cottons (Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense), genetic complexity equalled only by Brassica3 among sequenced angiosperms. Nascent fibre evolution, before allopolyploidy, is elucidated by comparison of spinnable-fibred Gossypium herbaceum A and non-spinnable Gossypium longicalyx F genomes to one another and the outgroup D genome of non-spinnable Gossypium raimondii. The sequence of a G. hirsutum AtDt (in which ‘t’ indicates tetraploid) cultivar reveals many non-reciprocal DNA exchanges between subgenomes that may have contributed to phenotypic innovation and/or other emergent properties such as ecological adaptation by polyploids. Most DNA-level novelty in G. hirsutum recombines alleles from the D-genome progenitor native to its New World habitat and the Old World A-genome progenitor in which spinnable fibre evolved. Coordinated expression changes in proximal groups of functionally distinct genes, including a nuclear mitochondrial DNA block, may account for clusters of cotton-fibre quantitative trait loci affecting diverse traits. Opportunities abound for dissecting emergent properties of other polyploids, particularly angiosperms, by comparison to diploid progenitors and outgroups."

https://openalex.org/W2015181400,"New physics can emerge in magnetic materials where quantum fluctuations are enhanced due to reduced dimensionality and strong frustration. One long sought example is the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state, where atomic magnetic moments are strongly correlated but do not order or freeze even in the limit of T -> 0. The RVB ground state does not break conventional symmetries, such as lattice translation or spin-rotation. The realization of such a quantum spin liquid in two-dimensions would represent a new state of matter. It is believed that spin liquid physics plays a role in the phenomenon of high-Tc superconductivity, and the topological properties of the spin liquid state may have applications in the field of quantum information. We present neutron scattering measurements of the spin excitations on single crystal samples of the spin-1/2 kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnet ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 (also called herbertsmithite). Our observation of a spinon continuum in a two-dimensional magnet is remarkable first. The results serve as a key fingerprint of the quantum spin liquid state in herbertsmithite."
https://openalex.org/W2092756750,"Whence Species Variation? Vertebrates have widely varying phenotypes that are at odds with their much more limited proteincoding genotypes and conserved messenger RNA expression patterns. Genes with multiple exons and introns can undergo alternative splicing, potentially resulting in multiple protein isoforms (see the Perspective by Papasaikas and Valcárcel ). Barbosa-Morais et al. (p. 1587 ) and Merkin et al. (p. 1593 ) analyzed alternative splicing across the genomes of a variety of vertebrates, including human, primates, rodents, opossum, platypus, chicken, lizard, and frog. The findings suggest that the evolution of alternative splicing has for the most part been very rapid and that alternative splicing patterns of most organs more strongly reflect the identity of the species rather than the organ type. Species-classifying alternative splicing can affect key regulators, often in disordered regions of proteins that may influence protein-protein interactions, or in regions involved in protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2052612308,"While universal quantum computers ideally solve problems such as factoring integers exponentially more efficiently than classical machines, the formidable challenges in building such devices motivate the demonstration of simpler, problem-specific algorithms that still promise a quantum speedup. We construct a quantum boson sampling machine (QBSM) to sample the output distribution resulting from the nonclassical interference of photons in an integrated photonic circuit, a problem thought to be exponentially hard to solve classically. Unlike universal quantum computation, boson sampling merely requires indistinguishable photons, linear state evolution, and detectors. We benchmark our QBSM with three and four photons and analyze sources of sampling inaccuracy. Our studies pave the way to larger devices that could offer the first definitive quantum-enhanced computation."
https://openalex.org/W2078531329,"Putting a C in Cytochrome Cytochrome P450 enzymes oxidize hydrocarbons using a highly reactive iron oxo intermediate. Much research has focused on tuning the protein structure to broaden the range of hydrocarbons that can be functionalized. Coelho et al. (p. 307 , published online 20 December; see the Perspective by Narayan and Sherman ) substituted a carbene source for the oxygen to make a P450 mutant a cyclopropanation catalyst whereby a carbon fragment is transferred in place of oxygen. Though carbene activation by iron is chemically analogous to the native oxygen activation pathway, the overall reaction is completely different from any known enzymatic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2084371989,"Quantum computers are unnecessary for exponentially-efficient computation or simulation if the Extended Church-Turing thesis---a foundational tenet of computer science---is correct. The thesis would be directly contradicted by a physical device that efficiently performs a task believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a task is BosonSampling: obtaining a distribution of n bosons scattered by some linear-optical unitary process. Here we test the central premise of BosonSampling, experimentally verifying that the amplitudes of 3-photon scattering processes are given by the permanents of submatrices generated from a unitary describing a 6-mode integrated optical circuit. We find the protocol to be robust, working even with the unavoidable effects of photon loss, non-ideal sources, and imperfect detection. Strong evidence against the Extended Church-Turing thesis will come from scaling to large numbers of photons, which is a much simpler task than building a universal quantum computer."
https://openalex.org/W2093737252,"Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are bulk-gapped quantum phases with symmetries, which have gapless or degenerate boundary states as long as the symmetries are not broken. The SPT phases in free fermion systems, such as topological insulators, can be classified; however, it is not known what SPT phases exist in general interacting systems. We present a systematic way to construct SPT phases in interacting bosonic systems. Just as group theory allows us to construct 230 crystal structures in three-dimensional space, we use group cohomology theory to systematically construct different interacting bosonic SPT phases in any dimension and with any symmetry, leading to the discovery of bosonic topological insulators and superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2101097180,"Neurotransmitter release depends critically on Munc18-1, Munc13, the Ca(2+) sensor synaptotagmin-1, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein (SNAP) receptors (SNAREs) syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25. In vitro reconstitutions have shown that syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 liposomes fuse efficiently with synaptobrevin liposomes in the presence of synaptotagmin-1-Ca(2+), but neurotransmitter release also requires Munc18-1 and Munc13 in vivo. We found that Munc18-1 could displace SNAP-25 from syntaxin-1 and that fusion of syntaxin-1-Munc18-1 liposomes with synaptobrevin liposomes required Munc13, in addition to SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin-1-Ca(2+). Moreover, when starting with syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 liposomes, NSF-α-SNAP disassembled the syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 heterodimers and abrogated fusion, which then required Munc18-1 and Munc13. We propose that fusion does not proceed through syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 heterodimers but starts with the syntaxin-1-Munc18-1 complex; Munc18-1 and Munc13 then orchestrate membrane fusion together with the SNAREs and synaptotagmin-1-Ca(2+) in an NSF- and SNAP-resistant manner."

https://openalex.org/W2089077570,"The Josephson effect represents perhaps the prototype of macroscopic phase coherence and is at the basis of the most widespread interferometer, i.e., the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Yet, in analogy to electric interference, Maki and Griffin predicted in 1965 that thermal current flowing through a temperature-biased Josephson tunnel junction is a stationary periodic function of the quantum phase difference between the superconductors. The interplay between quasiparticles and Cooper pairs condensate is at the origin of such phase-dependent heat current, and is unique to Josephson junctions. In this scenario, a temperature-biased SQUID would allow heat currents to interfere thus implementing the thermal version of the electric Josephson interferometer. The dissipative character of heat flux makes this coherent phenomenon not less extraordinary than its electric (non-dissipative) counterpart. Albeit weird, this striking effect has never been demonstrated so far. Here we report the first experimental realization of a heat interferometer. We investigate heat exchange between two normal metal electrodes kept at different temperatures and tunnel-coupled to each other through a thermal `modulator' in the form of a DC-SQUID. Heat transport in the system is found to be phase dependent, in agreement with the original prediction. With our design the Josephson heat interferometer yields magnetic-flux-dependent temperature oscillations of amplitude up to ~21 mK, and provides a flux-to-temperature transfer coefficient exceeding ~ 60mK/Phi_0 at 235 mK [Phi_0 2* 10^(-15) Wb is the flux quantum]. Besides offering remarkable insight into thermal transport in Josephson junctions, our results represent a significant step toward phase-coherent mastering of heat in solid-state nanocircuits, and pave the way to the design of novel-concept coherent caloritronic devices."

The recovered meteorites survived a record high-speed entry of 28.6 kilometers per second from an orbit close to that of Jupiter-family comets (Tisserand's parameter = 2.8 ± 0.3). Sutter's Mill is a regolith breccia composed of CM (Mighei)-type carbonaceous chondrite and highly reduced xenolithic materials. It exhibits considerable diversity of mineralogy, petrography, and isotope and organic chemistry, resulting from a complex formation history of the parent body surface. That diversity is quickly masked by alteration once in the terrestrial environment but will need to be considered when samples returned by missions to C-class asteroids are interpreted."
https://openalex.org/W2060345210,"Globular star clusters that formed at the same cosmic time may have evolved rather differently from a dynamical point of view (because that evolution depends on the internal environment) through a variety of processes that tend progressively to segregate stars more massive than the average towards the cluster centre. Therefore clusters with the same chronological age may have reached quite different stages of their dynamical history (that is, they may have different dynamical ages). Blue straggler stars have masses greater than those at the turn-off point on the main sequence and therefore must be the result of either a collision or a mass-transfer event. Because they are among the most massive and luminous objects in old clusters, they can be used as test particles with which to probe dynamical evolution. Here we report that globular clusters can be grouped into a few distinct families on the basis of the radial distribution of blue stragglers. This grouping corresponds well to an effective ranking of the dynamical stage reached by stellar systems, thereby permitting a direct measure of the cluster dynamical age purely from observed properties."
https://openalex.org/W2212018740,"Evaporative cooling of molecules has not been achieved so far, owing to unfavourable collision properties and trap losses; microwave-forced evaporative cooling of hydroxyl molecules loaded in a magnetic quadrupole trap is now reported. Evaporative cooling is the process that makes a cup of steaming hot coffee grow cold: the temperature of a substance is decreased by the removal of particles with energies much greater than the average total energy per particle. In the form of forced evaporative cooling of magnetically trapped atoms, it is used to produce Bose–Einstein condensates and other ultracold states of matter in which the quantum regime rules. Ultracold quantum gases of molecules—as opposed to atoms—may have even richer physics, but evaporative cooling of molecules has not been achieved so far because of unfavourable collision properties and trap losses. The paper reports microwave-forced evaporative cooling of hydroxyl (OH) molecules loaded in a magnetic quadrupole trap. This unexpected result occurs because of a long-range, repulsive interaction in the OH system that prevents short-range inelastic losses. Much colder temperatures are expected to be reachable, which may enable a large number of molecular species—including chemically interesting ones—to enter the quantum regime. Atomic physics was revolutionized by the development of forced evaporative cooling, which led directly to the observation of Bose–Einstein condensation1,2, quantum-degenerate Fermi gases3 and ultracold optical lattice simulations of condensed-matter phenomena4. More recently, substantial progress has been made in the production of cold molecular gases5. Their permanent electric dipole moment is expected to generate systems with varied and controllable phases6,7,8, dynamics9,10,11 and chemistry12,13,14. However, although advances have been made15 in both direct cooling and cold-association techniques, evaporative cooling has not been achieved so far. This is due to unfavourable ratios of elastic to inelastic scattering13 and impractically slow thermalization rates in the available trapped species. Here we report the observation of microwave-forced evaporative cooling of neutral hydroxyl (OH•) molecules loaded from a Stark-decelerated beam into an extremely high-gradient magnetic quadrupole trap. We demonstrate cooling by at least one order of magnitude in temperature, and a corresponding increase in phase-space density by three orders of magnitude, limited only by the low-temperature sensitivity of our spectroscopic thermometry technique. With evaporative cooling and a sufficiently large initial population, much colder temperatures are possible; even a quantum-degenerate gas of this dipolar radical (or anything else it can sympathetically cool) may be within reach."
https://openalex.org/W2113809608,"The quantum theory of antiferromagnetism in metals is necessary for our understanding of numerous intermetallic compounds of widespread interest. In these systems, a quantum critical point emerges as external parameters (such as chemical doping) are varied. Because of the strong coupling nature of this critical point, and the ""sign problem"" plaguing numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, its theoretical understanding is still incomplete. Here, we show that the universal low-energy theory for the onset of antiferromagnetism in a metal can be realized in lattice models, which are free from the sign problem and hence can be simulated efficiently with QMC. Our simulations show Fermi surface reconstruction and unconventional spin-singlet superconductivity across the critical point."
https://openalex.org/W2047724556,"The importance of E3 ubiquitin ligases, involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins or promotion of protein-protein interaction, is increasingly recognized in neurodegeneration. TDP-43 is a predominantly nuclear protein, which regulates the transcription of thousands of genes and binds to mRNA of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to regulate its expression. Wild type and mutated TDP-43 are detected in ubiquitinated forms within the cytosol in several neurodegenerative diseases. We elucidated the mechanisms of TDP-43 interaction with Parkin using transgenic A315T mutant TDP-43 (TDP43-Tg) mice, lentiviral wild type TDP-43, and Parkin gene transfer rat models. TDP-43 expression increased Parkin mRNA and protein levels. Lentiviral TDP-43 increased the levels of nuclear and cytosolic protein, whereas Parkin co-expression mediated Lys-48 and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin to TDP-43 and led to cytosolic co-localization of Parkin with ubiquitinated TDP-43. Parkin and TDP-43 formed a multiprotein complex with HDAC6, perhaps to mediate TDP-43 translocation. In conclusion, Parkin ubiquitinates TDP-43 and facilitates its cytosolic accumulation through a multiprotein complex with HDAC6."

https://openalex.org/W2162659200,"Nearly 50 years ago, theoretical physicists proposed that a field permeates the universe and gives energy to the vacuum. This field was required to explain why some, but not all, fundamental particles have mass. Numerous precision measurements during recent decades have provided indirect support for the existence of this field, but one crucial prediction of this theory has remained unconfirmed despite 30 years of experimental searches: the existence of a massive particle, the standard model Higgs boson. The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN has now observed the production of a new particle with a mass of 126 giga–electron volts and decay signatures consistent with those expected for the Higgs particle. This result is strong support for the standard model of particle physics, including the presence of this vacuum field. The existence and properties of the newly discovered particle may also have consequences beyond the standard model itself."

https://openalex.org/W2052027903,"P21-activated kinases (Paks) are major effectors downstream of the small Rho family of GTPases. Among the six isoforms, Pak1 is the most ubiquitous and the best characterized member. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of Pak6, which is predominantly present in the prostate compared with other tissues, inhibits prostate tumor growth in vivo. Even though Pak1 has been identified in normal prostatic epithelial cells and cancer cells, its specific role in the development of prostate cancer remains unclear. We report here that highly invasive prostate cancer cells express significantly higher levels of Pak1 protein compared with non-invasive prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, prostate tumor tissues and prostate cancer metastasized to lungs showed a higher expression of Pak1 compared with normal tissues. Interestingly, Pak6 protein expression levels did not change with the invasive/metastatic potential of the cancer cells or tumors. Although inhibition of Pak1, and not Pak6, resulted in impaired PC3 cell migration, the effects of Pak1 knockdown on transendothelial migration (microinvasion), tumor growth, and tumor angiogenesis was higher compared with Pak6 knockdown. Finally, gene array data revealed reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 with the ablation of either Pak1 or Pak6 gene expression in PC3 cells, whereas protein levels of TGFβ was elevated significantly with specific modulation of Pak1 activity or ablation of the Pak1 gene. Our observations suggest that although some level of functional redundancy exists between Pak1 and Pak6 in prostate cancer cells, targeting Pak1 is a potential option for the management of prostate tumor growth, microinvasion, and metastasis."

Given our recent work in which we showed that mitochondrial JNK signaling initiates physiological changes in HeLa cells stressed with anisomycin resulting in amplification of ROS (6Chambers J.W. LoGrasso P.V. Mitochondrial c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling initiates physiological changes resulting in amplification of reactive oxygen species generation.J. Biol.

Cherry L. Laughlin J.D. Figuera-Losada M. Lograsso P.V. Selective inhibition of mitochondrial JNK signaling achieved using peptide mimicry of the Sab kinase-interacting motif-1 (KIM1).ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we decided to see whether these effects could be generated in cardiomyocyte-like H9c2 cells and during I/R in vivo. In 2002 Wiltshire et al. (15Wiltshire C. Matsushita M. Tsukada S. Gillespie D.A. May G.H. A new c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein, Sab (SH3BP5), associates with mitochondria.Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) established the mitochondrial membrane protein Sab (SH3BP5) as the JNK-interacting binding partner for JNK mitochondrial association. Thus, we designed a retro-inverso peptide containing the HIV-Tat sequence along with 20 residues from the Sab KIM1 domain (Tat-SabKIM1), which could be used for in vivo purposes (14Chambers J.W. Cherry L. Laughlin J.D. Figuera-Losada M. Lograsso P.V. Selective inhibition of mitochondrial JNK signaling achieved using peptide mimicry of the Sab kinase-interacting motif-1 (KIM1).ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The current study was designed to test whether blocking JNK translocation to the mitochondria would prevent oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte death in vitro or I/R-induced cardiomyocyte death in vivo. To do this we utilized rat H9c2 cardiomyocyte-like cells and the I/R model in rats and monitored ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and cell death in vitro, as well as protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatine kinase (CK-MB) activity, apoptosis, and infarct volume in vivo. The major findings showed that oxidative and I/R-stress induced JNK translocation to the mitochondria and that blocking this translocation with Tat-SabKIM1 peptide reduced ROS generation, increased MMP, and reduced cell death in vitro while decreasing I/R-induced protein carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation levels and decreasing infarct volumes and apoptosis in vivo. Moreover, our results showed that blocking JNK translocation to the mitochondria was similarly as effective at reducing all of the in vitro endpoints as well as reducing infarct volumes as was inhibiting the catalytic activity of JNK. These results suggest that inhibition of JNK mitochondrial signaling may be a new mechanism and molecular target for treating I/R injury. Tat-Scramble (LPSVFGDVGAPSRLPEVSLSPPRRRQRRKKRG-NH2) and Tat-SabKIM1 (GFESLSVPSPLDLSGPRVVAPPRRRQRRKKRG-NH2) peptides were purchased from NeoPeptide. H9c2 cells and primary human cardiomyocytes (from ATCC) were grown under normal cell culture conditions (37 °C and 5% CO2) in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. To assure that the cells were actively growing, only cells at ∼80% confluency and between passages 5 and 15 were used in our experiments. H9c2 cells and primary human cardiomyocytes were exposed to 500 nm SR-3306, 500 nm SR-3562, 0.01% DMSO vehicle control, 10 μm Tat-SabKIM1, and 10 μm Tat-scramble for 30 min prior to the addition of stress. To induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in H9c2 cells and primary human cardiomyocytes, we added 100 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/FeSO4 or 100 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/FeSO4 directly to the media of the cells. The cells were exposed to H2O2/FeSO4 for the times indicated in the experiments. Mitochondria were isolated similarly to the method described by Palloti and Lenaz (16Pallotti F. Lenaz G. Isolation and subfractionation of mitochondria from animal cells and tissue culture lines.Methods Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 3-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and as we previously described (6Chambers J.W. LoGrasso P.V. Mitochondrial c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling initiates physiological changes resulting in amplification of reactive oxygen species generation.J. Biol.

Biol. 2011; 6: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 108 H9c2 cells were grown to ∼75% confluency in 150-mm cell culture dishes. H9c2 cells were washed with PBS three times at room temperature. The cells were lifted from the surface in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and washed twice with PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g for 15 min) at room temperature. Cells were suspended in 6 times the pellet volume with homogenization buffer (150 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7). Cells were incubated in the solution on ice for 2 min. H9c2 cells were homogenized with a glass homogenizer using 10 up-down strokes, and cellular disruption was confirmed by microscopy. Homogenization buffer supplemented with 0.25 m sucrose was added at one-third the homogenate volume. The homegenate was mixed thoroughly with gently inversion. The homogenate was separated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to dissociate the nuclear fraction from the homogenate. That supernatant was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in ice-cold sucrose-magnesium buffer (150 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7), and it was disrupted with an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer (three strokes). The pellet homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then suspended in lysis buffer for either Western blot analysis or immunoprecipitation. All buffers contained both phosphatase and protease inhibitors to protect signaling components. The outer mitochondrial membrane preparation was obtained by methods described in Schnaitman et al. (17Schnaitman C. Erwin V.G. Greenawalt J.W. The submitochondrial localization of monoamine oxidase. An enzymatic marker for the outer membrane of rat liver mitochondria.J.

Mitochondrial superoxide production was monitored by utilizing the mitochondria-selective dye MitoSOX-Red (Invitrogen) (18Mukhopadhyay P. Rajesh M. Haskó G. Hawkins B.J. Madesh M. Pacher P. Simultaneous detection of apoptosis and mitochondrial superoxide production in live cells by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2295-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored using the JC-1 dye kit (Cayman Chemical). Cells were seeded in a 96-well black-walled, clear-bottomed plate as described for MitoSOX staining above. The cells were then stained with 5 μm JC-1 for 20 min as indicated in the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution and covered in prewarmed Hanks' balanced salt solution for fluorescence measurements. The green JC-1 species were detected by excitation at 460 nm and monitoring emission at 488 nm. JC-1 aggregate staining was normalized to JC-1 monomer staining. Cell viability of H9c2 cells and primary human cardiomyocytes was monitored by MTT assay (Cayman Chemical). Cells (H9c2 and primary human cardiomyocytes, 20,000 cells/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate (clear bottom) and treated as described below in the text. At the culmination of each treatment, the cells were treated with the MTT reagent. Absorbance was monitored in a SpectraMax e5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). A minimum of four biological replicates was considered for all cell-based studies. For mitochondrial enrichments, a minimum of three biological replicates was used. Biochemical assays, fluorometric detection of superoxide, and other cellular measures were done with a minimum of five experimental replicates. To determine statistical significance, Student's paired t test was employed. Statistical significance is indicated by an asterisk in figures in which the p value is less than 0.05. Western blot analysis was performed as described (6Chambers J.W. LoGrasso P.V.

The antibodies used for Western blot analysis were: phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog No. 9255), JNK (Cell Signaling Technology, No. 9258), phospho-c-Jun (Cell Signaling Technology, No. 3270), c-Jun (Cell Signaling Technology, No. 2315), α-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, No. 2125), MKK4 (Cell Signaling Technology, No. 9152), Sab (Novus Biologicals, H00009467-M01), COX-IV (Cell Signaling Technology, No. 4850), enolase (Cell Signaling Technology, No. 3810), calnexin (Cell Signaling Technology, No. 2679), and histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology, No. 4499). Mitochondrial lysates were produced by adding Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors to mitochondrially enriched pellets. After thorough mixing, immunoprecipitations were performed using the Pierce co-immunoprecipitation kit protocol. Briefly, protein-anti-Sab antibody (Novus Biologicals, H00009467-M01) was coupled to the coupling resin included in the kit. The antibody resin was next incubated with 85 μg of mitochondrial lysate overnight at 4 °C. The antibody resin and accompanying complexes were acquired by centrifugation followed by the removal of the protein complex by SDS-induced dissociation. Following another centrifugation, the immunoprecipitated components were identified by Western blot analysis. H9c2 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates containing an 18 × 18-mm German glass coverslip in each well bottom. Cells were grown to 80% confluency and then treated with H2O2/FeSO4, Tat-scramble, and Tat-SabKIM1 as described earlier. Following 20 min of stress, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with PBS and stored at 4 °C until use. Coverslips were quenched in 100 mm glycine for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then cells were blocked in PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA. Next, cells were incubated with primary antibodies recognizing active JNK (Phospho-JNK, 1:200) and Sab (1:150) for 2.5 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 566 and donkey anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 secondary antibodies for 1.5 h at room temperature. After each antibody incubation, the cells were washed in PBS. Coverslips were mounted using Vectasheild/DAPI on slides. Fluorescence microscopy was conducted using 100× magnification on an Olympus microscope. Exposure times for each channel were as follows: DAPI, 0.05 ms; FITC, 0.34 ms; and TRITC, 0.52 ms. The gain was sent at 4.3. Images were cropped in Microsoft Powerpoint without any prior alteration in a graphics suite. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–350 g were used. A left thoracotomy was made between the fourth and the fifth ribs and a 6–0 vicryl suture was passed under the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) just below the left atrium. To occlude the artery, a snare was formed by threading the suture ends through a hole made in a 0.4-mm piece of polyethylene tubing. The snare was tightened against the artery until blanching of the apex was evident and then secured tightly with a micro-clamp. The LAD was occluded for 30 min and then released. The chest cavity was closed and the animal was gradually weaned from the respirator. Sham-operated rats served as surgical controls and were subjected to the same surgical procedures as the experimental rats, with the exception that the LAD was not occluded in the sham-operated rats. To measure phospho-c-Jun and phospho-JNK, animals were euthanized after 30 min and 1, 2, 6, and 24 h of reperfusion. Hearts were transcardially perfused with cold PBS, pH 7.4, and the myocardial tissue of the left ventricle was collected quickly and frozen in liquid nitrogen. To measure the efficacy of a JNK inhibitor, SR-3306 (5 mg/kg) was administered as an intravenous bolus (1.5 mg/kg, ∼0.4 ml) 5 min before the end of ischemia followed by continuous intravenous infusion via a Harvard 22 syringe pump (18 μg/kg/min) for 18 h following reperfusion. The control group received DMSO/Tween 80/H20 (10/10/80), and the positive control group received 3-aminobenzamide (9 mg/ml). 18 h later, the rats were euthanized. The heart was removed and five to six biventricular sections of similar thickness were made perpendicular to the long axis of the heart and incubated in 1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were stored in 10% formalin. To measure the efficacy of a SR-3306, each heart section stained with TTC was photographed on both sides for each group (SR-3306, vehicle, 3-aminobenzamide; n = 8). The infarct size was delineated and calculated for both sides using Adobe Photoshop CS3 software. Infarct size was expressed as the ratio of the infarct area to the total area of the left ventricle. The cumulative area for all sections of each heart was used for comparisons. All results are expressed as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test was used to compare differences in relative infarct size. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Direct injections (five 5-μl injections, 2 mg/kg) were delivered 5 min before reperfusion into the left ventricle wall in areas below the occlusion site of the LAD (four injections) and in the apex of the heart (one injection). Injections were made with a 30-gauge needle (45° bevel) and a 10-μl Hamilton syringe. Control groups subjected to the same I/R procedure included a saline injection (I/R + saline), Tat-scramble peptide injection (I/R + Tat-scramble), and a sham group without LAD occlusion. Following 24 h of reperfusion, the rats were euthanized, and hearts were perfused transcardially with cold PBS. The hearts were removed, and five to six biventricular sections of similar thickness, made perpendicular to the long axis of the heart, were incubated in 1% TTC in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were stored in 10% formalin. To measure the protective effects of Tat-Sab peptide, each heart section stained with TTC was photographed on both sides for each group (sham, I/R + saline, I/R + Tat-scramble, and I/R + Tat-Sab; n = 4, 8, 7, and 8, respectively). The total area of the left ventricle, the total area of the apex, and infarct size were delineated and calculated for both sides using Adobe Photoshop CS3 software. The infarct area was calculated as the risk area, which became necrotic as distinguished by TTC staining. Infarct size was expressed as the ratio of infarct area to both the total area of the left ventricle and the total area of the apex. All results are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test was used to compare differences in relative infarct size. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Blood samples were collected via the lateral tail vein in EDTA tubes for CPK and CK-MB analysis at 2 h post-reperfusion from rats receiving 5 mg/kg SR-3306 (n = 4) and vehicle (DMSO/Tween/H20; n = 3). Blood samples were also collected from naive rats (n = 4) that did not undergo any procedure. Quantification of apoptosis was measured using the Roche in situ cell death detection kit, fluorescein (catalog No. 11684795910). Assay procedures were followed for paraffin-embedded tissues sections. Following TUNEL and DAPI staining, 30 random sections within the apex and midsection of the left ventricle were imaged for each group (SR-3306, vehicle, and sham; n = 8, 8, and 5, respectively). The apoptotic index, defined as the number of TUNEL positive nuclei (green) divided by the total number of nuclei (blue), was determined by averaging the counts from 30 random images from each heart. Left ventricles were lysed on dry ice in M-PER (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Left ventricle fragments were crushed to powder using a cold mortar and pestle, and the powder was placed in M-PER and vortexed vigorously. Samples were stored on dry ice for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove tissue debris. The protein in the homogenate was quantitated using the Peirce BCA assay kit protocol. 4-HNE was measured using the Cell BioLabs 4-HNE ELISA kit. The protein carbonyls detection kit and aconitase assay kit were purchased from Cayman Chemicals. Left ventricle lysates were monitored for these oxidative stress markers according to the manufacturers' protocols. To demonstrate that the JNK pathway was activated under H2O2/FeSO4 stress conditions in H9c2 cardiomyocyte-like cells, we analyzed the time course for JNK and c-Jun activation by Western analysis. Fig. 1A shows the immunoreactivity of the approximate 55- and 46-kDa isoforms of JNK. The levels of JNK immunoreactivity did not change with treatment of H2O2/FeSO4 over an 8-h time course as expected. In contrast, there was only a faint p-JNK signal at t = 0 h (for the 55-kDa isoform) with a time-dependent increase in p-JNK signal beginning at 1 h and showing a maximum at 6 and 8 h after H2O2/FeSO4 treatment (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with a robust time-dependent activation of JNK in H9c2 cardiomyocyte-like cells after oxidative stress imposed by H2O2/FeSO4. Fig. 1C presents the time course for c-Jun immunoreactivity in H9c2 cells treated wit"
https://openalex.org/W2007360321,"1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a neurotoxic side product formed in the chemical synthesis of desmethylprodine opioid analgesic, which induces Parkinson disease. Monoamine oxidase B, present in the mitochondrial outer membrane of glial cells, catalyzes the oxidation of MPTP to the toxic 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+)), which then targets the dopaminergic neurons causing neuronal death. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrion-targeted human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), supported by mitochondrial adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, can efficiently catalyze the metabolism of MPTP to MPP(+), as shown with purified enzymes and also in cells expressing mitochondrial CYP2D6. Neuro-2A cells stably expressing predominantly mitochondrion-targeted CYP2D6 were more sensitive to MPTP-mediated mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and complex I inhibition than cells expressing predominantly endoplasmic reticulum-targeted CYP2D6. Mitochondrial CYP2D6 expressing Neuro-2A cells produced higher levels of reactive oxygen species and showed abnormal mitochondrial structures. MPTP treatment also induced mitochondrial translocation of an autophagic marker, Parkin, and a mitochondrial fission marker, Drp1, in differentiated neurons expressing mitochondrial CYP2D6. MPTP-mediated toxicity in primary dopaminergic neurons was attenuated by CYP2D6 inhibitor, quinidine, and also partly by monoamine oxidase B inhibitors deprenyl and pargyline. These studies show for the first time that dopaminergic neurons expressing mitochondrial CYP2D6 are fully capable of activating the pro-neurotoxin MPTP and inducing neuronal damage, which is effectively prevented by the CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine."
https://openalex.org/W1972255011,"Adiponectin binds to two widely expressed receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) that contain seven transmembrane domains but, unlike G-protein coupled receptors, present an extracellular C terminus and a cytosolic N terminus. Recently, AdipoR1 was found to associate in high order complexes. However, it is still unknown whether AdipoR2 may also form homomers or heteromers with AdipoR1 or if such interactions may be functionally relevant. Herein, we have analyzed the oligomerization pattern of AdipoRs by FRET and immunoprecipitation and evaluated both the internalization of AdipoRs in response to various adiponectin isoforms and the effect of adiponectin binding to different AdipoR combinations on AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α activation. Transfection of HEK293AD cells with AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 showed that both receptors colocalize at both the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum. Co-transfection with the different AdipoR pairs yielded high FRET efficiencies in non-stimulated cells, which indicates that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 form homo- and heteromeric complexes under resting conditions. Live FRET imaging suggested that both homo- and heteromeric AdipoR complexes dissociate in response to adiponectin, but heteromers separate faster than homomers. Finally, phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase in response to adiponectin was delayed in cells wherein heteromer formation was favored. In sum, our findings indicate that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 form homo- and heteromers that present unique interaction behaviors and signaling properties. This raises the possibility that the pleiotropic, tissue-dependent functions of adiponectin depend on the expression levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 and, therefore, on the steady-state proportion of homo- and heteromeric complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1992940294,"The choroid plexus (CP) forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier and protects the brain from circulating metabolites, drugs, and toxins. The plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT, SLC29A4) is a new polyspecific organic cation transporter that transports a wide variety of organic cations including biogenic amines, cationic drugs, and neurotoxins. PMAT is known to be expressed in the CP, but its specific role in CP transport of organic cations has not been clearly defined. Here we showed that PMAT transcript is highly expressed in human and mouse CPs, whereas transcripts of other functionally related transporters are minimally expressed in the CPs. Immunofluorescence staining further revealed that PMAT protein is localized to the apical (CSF-facing) membrane of the CP epithelium, consistent with a role of transporting organic cations from the CSF into CP epithelial cells. To further evaluate the role of PMAT in the CP, mice with targeted deletion of the Slc29a4 gene were generated and validated. Although Pmat−/− mice showed no overt abnormalities, the uptake of monoamines and the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium was significantly reduced in CP tissues isolated from the knock-out mice. Together, our data demonstrated that PMAT is a major transporter for CP uptake of bioactive amines and xenobiotic cations. By removing its substrates from the CSF, PMAT may play an important role in protecting the brain from cationic neurotoxins and other potentially toxic organic cations.Background: Some CNS active compounds are transported into or out of the brain by transporters in the choroid plexus (CP).Results: PMAT is a major CP transporter for bioactive amines and xenobiotic cations.Conclusion: PMAT transports organic cations from the cerebrospinal fluid into the CP.Significance: PMAT may be an important determinant of brain exposure to cationic neurotoxins and bioactive amines. The choroid plexus (CP) forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier and protects the brain from circulating metabolites, drugs, and toxins. The plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT, SLC29A4) is a new polyspecific organic cation transporter that transports a wide variety of organic cations including biogenic amines, cationic drugs, and neurotoxins. PMAT is known to be expressed in the CP, but its specific role in CP transport of organic cations has not been clearly defined. Here we showed that PMAT transcript is highly expressed in human and mouse CPs, whereas transcripts of other functionally related transporters are minimally expressed in the CPs. Immunofluorescence staining further revealed that PMAT protein is localized to the apical (CSF-facing) membrane of the CP epithelium, consistent with a role of transporting organic cations from the CSF into CP epithelial cells. To further evaluate the role of PMAT in the CP, mice with targeted deletion of the Slc29a4 gene were generated and validated. Although Pmat−/− mice showed no overt abnormalities, the uptake of monoamines and the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium was significantly reduced in CP tissues isolated from the knock-out mice. Together, our data demonstrated that PMAT is a major transporter for CP uptake of bioactive amines and xenobiotic cations. By removing its substrates from the CSF, PMAT may play an important role in protecting the brain from cationic neurotoxins and other potentially toxic organic cations. Background: Some CNS active compounds are transported into or out of the brain by transporters in the choroid plexus (CP).

https://openalex.org/W2079471715,"Chemoresistance is a major obstacle in cancer treatment. Our previous studies have shown that miR-125b plays an important role in chemoresistance. Here we report a novel mechanism that up-regulation of miR-125b through Wnt signaling by Snail enriches cancer stem cells. Overexpression of Snail dramatically increases the expression of miR-125b through the Snail-activated Wnt/β-catenin/TCF4 axis. Snail confers chemoresistance by repressing Bak1 through up-regulation of miR-125b. Restoring the expression of Bak1 or depleting miR-125b re-sensitizes Snail-expressing cancer cells to Taxol, indicating that miR-125b is critical in Snail-induced chemoresistance. Moreover, overexpression of miR-125b significantly increases the cancer stem cell population (CD24-CD44+), while depletion of miR-125b or rescue of the expression of Bak1 increases the non-stem cell population (CD24+CD44+) in Snail-overexpressing cells. These findings strongly support that miR-125b functions as a key mediator in Snail-induced cancer stem cell enrichment and chemoresistance. This novel mechanism for Snail-induced stem cell propagation and chemoresistance may have important implications in the development of strategies for overcoming cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W1998028743,"Plants produce a huge array of specialized metabolites that have important functions in defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. Many of these compounds are glycosylated by family 1 glycosyltransferases (GTs). Oats (Avena spp.) make root-derived antimicrobial triterpenes (avenacins) that provide protection against soil-borne diseases. The ability to synthesize avenacins has evolved since the divergence of oats from other cereals and grasses. The major avenacin, A-1, is acylated with N-methylanthranilic acid. Previously, we have cloned and characterized three genes for avenacin synthesis (for the triterpene synthase SAD1, a triterpene-modifying cytochrome P450 SAD2, and the serine carboxypeptidase-like acyl transferase SAD7), which form part of a biosynthetic gene cluster. Here, we identify a fourth member of this gene cluster encoding a GT belonging to clade L of family 1 (UGT74H5), and show that this enzyme is an N-methylanthranilic acid O-glucosyltransferase implicated in the synthesis of avenacin A-1. Two other closely related family 1 GTs (UGT74H6 and UGT74H7) are also expressed in oat roots. One of these (UGT74H6) is able to glucosylate both N-methylanthranilic acid and benzoic acid, whereas the function of the other (UGT74H7) remains unknown. Our investigations indicate that UGT74H5 is likely to be key for the generation of the activated acyl donor used by SAD7 in the synthesis of the major avenacin, A-1, whereas UGT74H6 may contribute to the synthesis of other forms of avenacin that are acylated with benzoic acid."

Thus, the goal of this study was elucidate how eNOS redistributes to mitochondria and to identify the nitrated protein responsible for this event. Our data indicate that exposure of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells to ADMA enhanced eNOS phosphorylation at the Akt1-dependent phosphorylation sites Ser617 and Ser1179. Mutation of these serine residues to alanine (S617A and S1179A) inhibited nitration-mediated eNOS translocation to the mitochondria, whereas the phosphormimic mutations (S617D and S1179D) exhibited increased mitochondrial redistribution in the absence of ADMA. The overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt1 also attenuated ADMA-mediated eNOS mitochondrial translocation. Furthermore, ADMA enhanced Akt1 nitration and increased its activity. Mass spectrometry identified a single nitration site in Akt1 located at the tyrosine residue (Tyr350) located within the client-binding domain. Replacement of Tyr350 with phenylalanine abolished peroxynitrite-mediated eNOS translocation to mitochondria. We also found that in the absence of ADMA, eNOS translocation decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and superoxide production without altering cellular ATP level. This suggests that under physiologic conditions, eNOS translocation enhances mitochondria coupling. In conclusion, we have identified a new mechanism by which eNOS translocation to mitochondria is regulated by the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser617 and Ser1179 by Akt1 and that this is enhanced when Akt1 becomes nitrated at Tyr350.

https://openalex.org/W1994370876,"Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) forms a major component of the postsynaptic density where its functions in synaptic plasticity are well established, but its presynaptic actions are poorly defined. Here we show that CaMKII binds directly to the C-terminal domain of Ca(V)2.1 channels. Binding is enhanced by autophosphorylation, and the kinase-channel signaling complex persists after dephosphorylation and removal of the Ca(2+)/CaM stimulus. Autophosphorylated CaMKII can bind the Ca(V)2.1 channel and synapsin-1 simultaneously. CaMKII binding to Ca(V)2.1 channels induces Ca(2+)-independent activity of the kinase, which phosphorylates the enzyme itself as well as the neuronal substrate synapsin-1. Facilitation and inactivation of Ca(V)2.1 channels by binding of Ca(2+)/CaM mediates short term synaptic plasticity in transfected superior cervical ganglion neurons, and these regulatory effects are prevented by a competing peptide and the endogenous brain inhibitor CaMKIIN, which blocks binding of CaMKII to Ca(V)2.1 channels. These results define the functional properties of a signaling complex of CaMKII and Ca(V)2.1 channels in which both binding partners are persistently activated by their association, and they further suggest that this complex is important in presynaptic terminals in regulating protein phosphorylation and short term synaptic plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2029370462,"In experimental membranous nephropathy, complement C5b-9-induces glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) injury and proteinuria. The effects of C5b-9 are mediated via signaling pathways, including calcium-independent phospholipase A(2)γ (iPLA(2)γ), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. The iPLA(2)γ pathway is cytoprotective. This study addresses the mechanisms of iPLA(2)γ activation. iPLA(2)γ activity was monitored by quantifying prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production. In GECs, iPLA(2)γ localized at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Complement-mediated production of PGE(2) was amplified in GECs that overexpress iPLA(2)γ, compared with control cells, and was blocked by the iPLA(2)γ inhibitor bromoenol lactone in both iPLA(2)γ-overexpressing and control GECs. In GECs that overexpress iPLA(2)γ, complement-mediated PGE(2) production was reduced by inhibitors of MAP/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) and p38 but not JNK. In COS-1 cells that overexpress iPLA(2)γ and cyclooxygenase-1, PGE(2) production was induced by co-expression of constitutively active MEK1 or MAPK-interacting kinase 1 (MNK1) as well as by stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) + ionomycin. Complement- and EGF + ionomycin-stimulated iPLA(2)γ activity was attenuated by the S511A/S515A double mutation. Moreover, complement and EGF + ionomycin enhanced phosphorylation of Ser-511. Thus, complement-mediated activation of iPLA(2)γ is mediated via ERK and p38 pathways, and phosphorylation of Ser-511 and/or Ser-515 plays a key role in the catalytic activity and signaling of iPLA(2)γ. Defining the mechanisms by which complement activates iPLA(2)γ provides opportunities for development of novel therapeutic approaches to GEC injury and proteinuria."

Carbon dioxide is chemically stable and unreactive and must be reduced to enable its incorporation into biological molecules. Autotrophic microorganisms are able to utilize carbon dioxide as their sole carbon source, and a variety of pathways are known to activate and incorporate it into biomolecules essential for growth and replication. Recently, carbon dioxide fixation pathways have received interest for biotechnological applications, since this could provide biological routes for de novo generation of fuels and small organic molecules (1Hawkins A.

The corresponding gene products in M. sedula are Msed_1321 for the 4HB-CoA dehydratase and Msed_0656 for the acetoacetyl-CoA β-ketothiolase.TABLE 1Enzymes in the 3HP/4HB cycle in M. sedulaCycle ref. no.ORFEnzymeRef.E1αMsed_0147Acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylaseNCE (11Hügler M.

Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) tested three different candidates for the 4HB-CoA synthetase, but they all failed to show activity on 4HB. In fact, the primary candidate suggested by the autotrophic transcriptome analysis (Msed_1422) showed no enzymatic activity on short chain linear unsubstituted or hydroxy acids, specifically acetate, propionate, 3HP, 3-hydroxybutyrate, 4HB, and crotonate. Two other candidates were selected, based on homology to 4HB-CoA synthetase from Thermoproteus neutrophilus (Tneu_0420) and 3HP-CoA synthetase from M. sedula: Msed_1353 and Msed_1291 were recombinantly produced and tested for ligase activity. Msed_1353 was active on propionate and acetate, but not on 4HB. Furthermore, Msed_1291 had no activity on any of the previously mentioned organic acids. Thus, although cycle function has been confirmed by metabolic flux analysis, and although 4HB-CoA synthetase activity has been measured in cell extracts of autotrophically grown M. sedula, the enzyme responsible for ligation of CoA to 4HB remains unclear. To identify the missing link in the 3HP/4HB cycle, new methods for semi-continuous cultivation of M. sedula in a gas-intensive fermentation system were developed to tease out differential transcriptional response of autotrophy-related genes. Strict carbon dioxide limitation was used to drive increased operational efficiency of the CO2 fixation enzymes, which hypothetically would increase transcriptional levels of genes encoding key enzymes to maximize carbon incorporation. Using these conditions for transcriptional analysis, a much clearer picture emerged concerning the global regulatory changes in M. sedula as its cellular metabolism switches from autotrophy to heterotrophy. This strategy produced new leads for the genes and corresponding enzymes responsible for the 4HB-CoA ligation step. The enzymes were recombinantly produced and shown to catalyze the ligation of CoA to 4HB. M. sedula (DSMZ 5348) was grown aerobically at 70 °C in a shaking oil bath (90 rpm) under autotrophic or heterotrophic conditions on DSMZ medium 88 at pH 2. Heterotrophically grown cells were supplemented with 0.1% tryptone. Cell growth was scaled up from 300 ml in sealed 1-liter bottles (see Ref. 8Auernik K.S. Kelly R.M. Physiological versatility of the extremely thermoacidophilic archaeon Metallosphaera sedula supported by transcriptomic analysis of heterotrophic, autotrophic, and mixotrophic growth.Appl. Environ.

Two separately regulated gas feeds were used such that flow rates were held constant for all conditions at 1 ml/min for the hydrogen/CO2 gas mixtures (composition varied) and 100 ml/min for air (composition: 78% N2, 21% O2, 0.03% CO2). For the autotrophic carbon-rich (ACR) condition, the gas feed contained H2 (80%) and CO2 (20%); for the autotrophic carbon-limited (ACL) condition, the feed was changed to H2 (80%) and N2 (20%); for the heterotrophic condition (HTR), the medium was supplemented with 0.1% tryptone, and the gas feed composition was N2 (80%) and CO2 (20%). Tandem fermentors were run simultaneously with the same inoculum to generate biological repeats (Fig. 2). Cells were harvested at mid-exponential phase by rapid cooling with dry ice and ethanol and then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. A spotted whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray, based on 2256 protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs), was used, as described previously (15Auernik K.S. Kelly R.M. Identification of components of electron transport chains in the extremely thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Metallosphaera sedula through iron and sulfur compound oxidation transcriptomes.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 7723-7732Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted and purified (RNeasy; Qiagen), reverse-transcribed (Superscript III; Invitrogen), re-purified, labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 dye (GE Healthcare), and hybridized to the microarray slides (Corning). Slides were scanned on a GenePix 4000B Microarray Scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and raw intensities were quantitated using GenePix Pro version 6.0. Normalization of data and statistical analysis were performed using JMP Genomics 5 (SAS, Cary, NC). In general, significant differential transcription was defined to be a relative change at or above 2 (where a log2 value of ±1 equals a 2-fold change) with significance values at or above the Bonferroni correction; for these data, this was 5.4 (equivalent to a p value of 4.0 × 106). Microarray data are available through the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE39944. Two assays were used to measure ligase activity, one spectrophotometric and one using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A discontinuous assay was used to measure substrate-dependent disappearance of CoA at 75 °C. The reaction mixture (600 μl) contained 100 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 0.15 mm CoA, and purified enzyme. At each time point, 80 μl of reaction mixture was added to 80 μl of cold 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). A time point (0 min) was taken before heating. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 min at 75 °C, followed by addition of substrate. Additional time points were taken at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 s after addition of substrate. Absorbance was measured at 412 nm to determine free CoA concentration, based on the concentration of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate dianion (ϵ412 = 14,150 m−1 cm−1) (1Hawkins A. Han Y. Lian H. Loder A.

Enzymes were kinetically characterized by varying the concentration of the acyl-CoA substrate from 0.05 to 12 mm, although the other substrate concentrations were held constant. Measurements for specific activity were taken under saturating substrate concentrations (10 mm). Formation of the CoA ester was also confirmed using HPLC (Waters). The reaction mixture (0.15 ml) contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CoA, 10 mm substrate, and purified enzyme. The reaction was incubated for 3 min at 75 °C, quenched with 15 μl of 1 m HCl, filtered with a 10-kDa spin column (Amicon YM-10) to remove the protein, and loaded onto a reversed-phase C18 silica-based column (Shodex C18–4E, 4.6 × 250 mm). The mobile phase was 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, with 2% methanol. M. sedula genes encoding acyl-CoA synthetases were amplified from genomic DNA using primers synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Msed_0394 and Msed_0406 were ligated into pET46-Ek/LIC, although Msed_1353 was ligated into pET21b using NdeI and XhoI restrictions sites. All constructs were designed to express with an N-terminal His6 tag. Plasmids containing gene inserts were cloned into NovaBlue GigaSingles E. coli competent cells and selected by growth on LB-agar supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA was extracted using a QIAprep spin miniprep kit. Sequences were confirmed by Eton Biosciences, Inc. (Durham, NC). For protein expression, the plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) cells and selected by growth on LB-agar, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml). Cells harboring the recombinant plasmid were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 0.1 mm) at A600 0.4–0.6 and cultured for 3 h before harvest. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell yields ranged from 1.6 to 3.8 g of cells/liter of LB medium (wet weight). Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) containing DNase and lysozyme at final concentrations of 10 and 100 μg/ml, respectively. Cells were lysed with a French press (two passes at 18,000 p.s.i.), and the lysate was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to removed insoluble material. Soluble, cell-free extract was heated to 65 °C for 20 min to precipitate mesophilic proteins. Streptomycin sulfate (1% w/v) was added to precipitate nucleic acids, followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. A final centrifugation was performed at 22,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to collect the soluble, heat-treated cell-free extract, which was sterile-filtered (0.22 μm) and purified using a 5 ml HisTrapTM nickel column (GE Healthcare). Proteins were bound to the HisTrapTM column using binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) and eluted using elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). SDS-PAGE was then performed on the immobilized metal affinity chromatography fractions to qualitatively determine the purity of the protein before further purification. Chromatography fractions containing the protein were concentrated, exchanged into phosphate buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) using an Amicon YM10 (Millipore) centrifugal filter membrane, and centrifuged at 4000 × g and 4 °C. To quantify the amount of protein, a Bradford assay was performed on the concentrated immobilized metal affinity chromatography fractions using known serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) by taking absorbance readings at 595 nm. Protein was further purified using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column. The proteins were eluted from the gel filtration column using elution buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). Proteins were dialyzed into 100 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.9) and either stored at 4 °C or mixed with glycerol to 20% and stored at −20 °C. Msed_1353 was mutated with the GENEART® site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen), using AccuPrimeTM Pfx polymerase. Mutagenesis primers were designed to change Trp424 to glycine (primer 1, 5′-CCCTTTGGTAGCACTTGGGGAATGACTGAAACTGG-3′; primer 2, reverse complement of primer 1). Plasmids with Msed_1353-G424 were cloned into NovaBlue GigaSingles E. coli competent cells and selected by growth on LB-agar supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Sequences were confirmed by Eton Biosciences Inc. (Durham, NC). Three-dimensional structural models for M. sedula acyl-CoA synthetases were made using the iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) on-line server (2Berg I.A.

https://openalex.org/W1969337900,"A single subunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase was identified and purified to apparent homogeneity from cyanophage Syn5 that infects the marine cyanobacteria Synechococcus. Syn5 is homologous to bacteriophage T7 that infects Escherichia coli. Using the purified enzyme its promoter has been identified by examining transcription of segments of Syn5 DNA and sequencing the 5'-termini of the transcripts. Only two Syn5 RNAP promoters, having the sequence 5'-ATTGGGCACCCGTAA-3', are found within the Syn5 genome. One promoter is located within the Syn5 RNA polymerase gene and the other is located close to the right genetic end of the genome. The purified enzyme and its promoter have enabled a determination of the requirements for transcription. Unlike the salt-sensitive bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, this marine RNA polymerase requires 160 mm potassium for maximal activity. The optimal temperature for Syn5 RNA polymerase is 24 °C, much lower than that for T7 RNA polymerase. Magnesium is required as a cofactor although some activity is observed with ferrous ions. Syn5 RNA polymerase is more efficient in utilizing low concentrations of ribonucleotides than T7 RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2056314284,"Insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular complications are common dysregulations of metabolic syndrome. Transplant patients treated with immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporine A (CsA), an inhibitor of calcineurin phosphatase, frequently develop similar metabolic complications. Although calcineurin is known to mediate insulin sensitivity by regulating β-cell growth and adipokine gene transcription, its role in lipid homeostasis is poorly understood. Here, we examined lipid homeostasis in mice lacking calcineurin Aβ (CnAβ(-/-)). We show that mice lacking calcineurin Aβ are hyperlipidemic and develop age-dependent insulin resistance. Hyperlipidemia found in CnAβ(-/-) mice is, in part, due to increased lipolysis in adipose tissues, a process mediated by β-adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. CnAβ(-/-) mice also exhibit additional pathophysiological phenotypes caused by the potentiated GPCR signaling pathways. A cell autonomous mechanism with sustained cAMP/PKA activation is found in CnAβ(-/-) mice or upon CsA treatment to inhibit calcineurin. Increased PKA activation and cAMP accumulation in CnAβ(-/-) mice, however, are sensitive to phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Indeed, we show that calcineurin regulates degradation of phosphodiesterase 3B, in addition to phosphodiesterase 4D. These results establish a role for calcineurin in lipid homeostasis. These data also indicate that potentiated cAMP signaling pathway may provide an alternative molecular pathogenesis for the metabolic complications elicited by CsA in transplant patients."

Protein synthesis proceeds with high fidelity to ensure optimal survival. This process requires a full set of aminoacyl-tRNAs that are accurately aminoacylated so that the identity of the tRNA anticodon corresponds to the amino acid attached to its acceptor stem.

In Thermus thermophilus, a thermophilic bacterium, formation of a stable complex called the Asn-transamidosome also promotes accuracy. This macromolecular complex requires tRNAAsn for assembly with AdT and AspRS2 (an archaeal-type ND-AspRS) (11Bailly M. Blaise M. Lorber B. Becker H.D. Kern D.

The Asn-transamidosome ensures the stability of the aminoacyl ester bond of Asp-tRNAAsn, promotes its efficient conversion to Asn-tRNAAsn, and isolates it from EF-Tu and the ribosome until it is converted to Asn-tRNAAsn. The crystal structure of the T. thermophilus Asn-transamidosome shows that it contains two tRNAs in scaffold positions and two positioned to act as substrates for both ND-AspRS and AdT (12Blaise M. Bailly M. Frechin M. Behrens M.A. Fischer F. Oliveira C.L. Becker H.D. Pedersen J.S. Thirup S. Kern D. Crystal structure of a transfer-ribonucleoprotein particle that promotes asparagine formation.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3118-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, this transamidosome is a tRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complex. Similarly, the thermophilic archaeon Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus assembles a Gln-transamidosome from ND-GluRS and GatDE. (GatDE is a heterodimeric homolog of AdT that is specific for Gln-tRNAGln biosynthesis (13Rampias T. Sheppard K. Söll D. The archaeal transamidosome for RNA-dependent glutamine biosynthesis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5774-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).) Assembly of this Gln-transamidosome does not require tRNAGln, but it is also less stable and more dynamic than the T. thermophilus Asn-transamidosome. Recently, pre-steady-state kinetic experiments and unsuccessful efforts to isolate the M. thermoautotrophicus Gln-transamidosome argue that Gln-transamidosome formation and substrate channeling are not essential or even favorable, at least in archaea (14Bhaskaran H. Perona J.J. Two-step aminoacylation of tRNA without channeling in archaea.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 411: 854-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Unlike T. thermophilus and M. thermoautotrophicus, many bacteria, including H. pylori, use the heterotrimeric AdT (GatCAB) to compensate for the absence of both asparaginyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases; it is unknown if or how this dual specificity impacts Asn- and/or Gln-transamidosome formation and function. We recently examined the formation of Asn- and Gln-transamidosomes from H. pylori components (e.g. ND-AspRS, tRNAAsn, and AdT or GluRS2, tRNAGln, and AdT, respectively). Stable assembly of a macromolecular transamidosome complex was not observed in either case. However, quantitative steady-state kinetic analyses argued for transient dynamic assembly of both transamidosome particles (15Fischer F. Huot J.L. Lorber B. Diss G. Hendrickson T.L. Becker H.D. Lapointe J. Kern D. The asparagine-transamidosome from Helicobacter pylori: a dual-kinetic mode in non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase safeguards the genetic code.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 4965-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Huot J.L.

These analyses left open the intriguing possibility that an additional mechanism to prevent translational errors remains undiscovered. Here, we examined the hypothesis that H. pylori uses other proteins or enzymes either to facilitate transamidosome assembly or to stabilize and deliver each aminoacyl-tRNA from the misacylating aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to AdT. A yeast two-hybrid interaction profile of the H. pylori proteome (17Rain J.C. Selig L. De Reuse H. Battaglia V. Reverdy C. Simon S. Lenzen G. Petel F. Wojcik J. Schächter V. Chemama Y. Labigne A. Legrain P. The protein-protein interaction map of Helicobacter pylori.Nature. 2001; 409: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) was used to identify a protein of unknown function called Hp0100. Hp0100 was selected for further studies based on its weak reported interactions with GatA (a subunit of AdT) and its stronger interactions with ND-AspRS. Here, we demonstrate that Hp0100 is a component of a new, stable, tRNA-independent transamidosome enzyme complex consisting of ND-AspRS, AdT, and Hp0100. The addition of Hp0100 also significantly accelerates the AdT-catalyzed rate of Asp-tRNAAsn transamidation. Consequently, Hp0100 simplifies the process of indirect tRNA aminoacylation by bringing all enzymatic players into proximity in a distinct Asn-transamidosome. H. pylori ND-AspRS and AdT were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (6Chuawong P. Hendrickson T.L.

To avoid possible contamination by E. coli tRNA, cell lysates were treated with USB® RNase A (6.25 μg/ml; Affymetrix Inc.) prior to affinity purification. H. pylori tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn were produced in vivo in E. coli MV1184. They were purified, and their concentrations were determined as described previously (6Chuawong P. Hendrickson T.L. The nondiscriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase from Helicobacter pylori: anticodon-binding domain mutations that impact tRNA specificity and heterologous toxicity.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8079-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Each tRNA was diluted to a stock solution of 150 μm prior to use. The hp0100 gene was amplified from H. pylori strain 26695 genomic DNA (American Type Culture Collection) and cloned into pQE-80L (Novagen) to encode the full-length protein with an N-terminal His6 tag (pPTC034). E. coli DH5α calcium chloride competent cells were transformed with the pPTC034 plasmid. Cultures were grown, beginning with single colonies, at 37 °C in LB medium. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) when the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6–1.0. After 1 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Hp0100 was first purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Purification of Hp0100 resulted in co-purification of a contaminant that was the same approximate size as E. coli discriminating AspRS (D-AspRS). The identity of this contaminant as D-AspRS was demonstrated by aminoacylation assays with tRNAAsp (supplemental Fig. S1). To avoid E. coli D-AspRS contamination, Hp0100 was purified by ion-exchange chromatography instead of nickel affinity. Harvested cells were homogenized in 3 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Na2PO4, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6.25 μg/ml RNase A, 15 μl/ml saturated PMSF, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme at pH 7.4) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was then sonicated six times at 38% for 10 s on a Branson Digital Sonifier® with 2-min recovery intervals on ice between each pulse. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The filtered lysate (1 ml) was loaded onto a UNO S ion-exchange column (12-ml column volume; Bio-Rad). Hp0100 eluted at ∼400 mm NaCl. After ion-exchange purification, Hp0100 did not contain detectable levels of contaminating E. coli D-AspRS (supplemental Fig. S1A) or tRNA (supplemental Fig. S2). The concentration of Hp0100 was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy (280 nm) using an extinction coefficient of ϵ = 30620 m−1 cm−1 as determined by the ExPASy Proteomics server (19Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Google Scholar). Aminoacylation assays were performed with tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn as described previously (6Chuawong P. Hendrickson T.L.

For titration experiments, each tRNA concentration was 10 μm, and ND-AspRS was used at 0.2 μm. The concentration of Hp0100 was varied from 0.2 to 4 μm as indicated. The CCA-adding enzyme was used to incorporate [α-32P]AMP into the 3′-end of H. pylori tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn by replacing the unlabeled 3′-AMP with [α-32P]AMP (from [α-32P]ATP; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) as described previously (4Sheppard K.

The assay buffer contained 5 μm 32P-labeled Asp-tRNAAsn (specific activity of ∼4.5 Ci/mmol), 50 mm HEPES-OH (pH 7.5), 4 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 1 mm Gln with 10 nm AdT. Where indicated, Hp0100 was preincubated with AdT for 10 min at 4 °C at final concentrations that ranged from 25 to 500 nm. Aliquots (5 μl) were quenched at each time point, digested with P1 nuclease, and processed as described previously (4Sheppard K. Akochy P.M. Salazar J.C. Söll D.

Reaction progress was monitored by developing each time point on a 20 × 20 cm PEI-cellulose TLC plate (EMD Millipore) in a freshly prepared 100-ml solution of 10 mm ammonium chloride and 5% glacial acetic acid. For better resolution, the TLC plates were pretreated with water for 15 min and then dried prior to use. Plates were phosphorimaged after ∼16 h of screen exposure. Asn-tRNAAsn production was normalized against Asp-tRNAAsn to eliminate errors arising from differences in sample spotting. For this reason, Asn-tRNAAsn production is reported as a percentage relative to Asp-tRNAAsn. Macromolecular complex formation between AdT, ND-AspRS, and Hp0100 was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. AdT (0.5 μm), ND-AspRS (0.5 μm), Hp0100 (2.5 μm), and tRNAAsn (5 μm) were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the indicated combinations. Complexes were examined on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (330 × 430 × 1.5 mm3) in Tris/glycine buffer (25 mm Tris and 200 mm glycine at pH 8.3). After electrophoresis at 20 V for 16 h at 4 °C, bands were visualized by Western blotting using anti-His6 antibody (AnaSpec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hp0100 and ND-AspRS both contain single N-terminal His6 tags. However, His6-Hp0100 was not detectable with anti-His6 antibody under native gel conditions (supplemental Fig. S3). His6-Hp0100 was readily visualized by Western blotting under denaturing conditions (data not shown). For AdT, both the GatC and GatB subunits contain His6 tags. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses of ND-AspRS, AdT, Hp0100, and various binary and ternary complexes were performed at 25 °C in a Zetasizer Nano S instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, United Kingdom). Protein samples were diluted in buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl (refractive index = 1.34) to prepare the required concentrations; 40-μl samples were used for analyses. For particles that are smaller than the wavelength of incident light (λ), the intensity of light scattered (I) is related to the diameter of the particle (d) by the Rayleigh equation (I∞d6/λ4). We used the Mie theory within the Nano S software to convert the intensity (I) versus size (d in nanometers) distribution data to volume versus size (d) distribution (supplemental Fig. S4). Mie theory provides a more realistic view of the importance of the observed peak/s. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to characterize the binary interactions between Hp0100 and each of its possible binding partners (ND-AspRS, AdT, and tRNAAsn). Hp0100 was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, and increasing concentrations of analyte (either protein or tRNA) were delivered to the chip. Dissociation constants (Kd) for each pair of interactions were determined either by fitting the SPR data directly to a Langmuir model using BIAevaluation version 4.0.1 or by plotting the equilibrium response units versus analyte concentration and fitting the resulting curve to the following equation: H-A = [A0]·Rmax/(Kd + [A0]) (using KaleidaGraph version 4.0), where H-A represents the complex between Hp0100 (H) and the analyte (A) and is given in SPR equilibrium response units, [A0] is the initial concentration of the analyte in solution, and Rmax represents the theoretical response units that would be observed upon 100% complex formation. In contrast to the stable, tRNA-dependent Asn-transamidosome from T. thermophilus, an analogous H. pylori Asn-transamidosome could not be isolated (15Fischer F. Huot J.L. Lorber B. Diss G. Hendrickson T.L. Becker H.D. Lapointe J. Kern D. The asparagine-transamidosome from Helicobacter pylori: a dual-kinetic mode in non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase safeguards the genetic code.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 4965-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that a protein of unknown function is needed to promote assembly of a more stable complex. By mining published results of a protein-protein interaction map of the H. pylori proteome (17Rain J.C. Selig L. De Reuse H. Battaglia V. Reverdy C. Simon S. Lenzen G. Petel F. Wojcik J. Schächter V. Chemama Y. Labigne A. Legrain P. The protein-protein interaction map of Helicobacter pylori.Nature. 2001; 409: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), we identified Hp0100 as a possible candidate because it showed yeast two-hybrid interactions with both AdT and ND-AspRS, the two enzymes in the T. thermophilus Asn-transamidosome. Hp0100 is a 368-amino acid protein that is conserved throughout the ϵ-proteobacteria; many bacterial genomes outside of this clade contain genes encoding the N-terminal half of Hp0100. The primary sequence of Hp0100 is not related to any protein of known function. However, sequence analyses suggest that its N terminus contains an ATP-binding motif that belongs to the adenine nucleotide α-hydrolase superfamily (AANH-like superfamily) (22Marchler-Bauer A. Lu S. Anderson J.B. Chitsaz F. Derbyshire M.K. DeWeese-Scott C. Fong J.H. Geer L.Y. Geer R.C. Gonzales N.R. Gwadz M. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. Ke Z. Lanczycki C.J. Lu F. Marchler G.H. Mullokandov M.

CDD: a Conserved Domain Database for the functional annotation of proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D225-D229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). Building on the observation that Hp0100 interacts with both ND-AspRS and AdT by yeast two-hybrid screening, we hypothesized that this protein is a component of a novel bacterial-type transamidosome. We cloned the hp0100 gene and expressed Hp0100 in E. coli with an N-terminal His6 tag. Nickel affinity chromatography led to the purification of Hp0100 with a single co-purifying contaminant that was approximately the same size as E. coli discriminating D-AspRS (supplemental Fig. S1A). Aminoacylation assays with tRNAAsp confirmed that the mixture of Hp0100 and this protein contaminant produced Asp-tRNAAsp, supporting our presumption that this contaminant is E. coli D-AspRS (supplemental Fig. S1B). These results offered the first in vivo and in vitro evidence for a relevant noncovalent interaction between Hp0100 and AspRS. (E. coli does not have a full-length ortholog of Hp0100.) Hp0100 was subsequently purified by ion-exchange chromatography to >95% purity with complete removal of the contaminating D-AspRS (supplemental Fig. S1A) (4Sheppard K. Akochy P.M. Salazar J.C.

H. pylori ND-AspRS, tRNAAsn, and AdT do not assemble into a stable T. thermophilus-like Asn-transamidosome in gel-shift experiments (Fig. 1C, lane 5) (15Fischer F. Huot J.L. Lorber B. Diss G.

We recently showed that the H. pylori Asn-transamidosome is dynamic and unstable (15Fischer F. Huot J.L. Lorber B. Diss G. Hendrickson T.L. Becker H.D. Lapointe J. Kern D.

We proposed a kinetic mechanism for translational fidelity wherein Asp-tRNAAsn would not dissociate from ND-AspRS prior to uptake by AdT (15Fischer F. Huot J.L. Lorber B. Diss G. Hendrickson T.L.

This mechanism was consistent with the data available at that time, but it was dissatisfyingly complex. Alternatively, another unknown protein factor such as Hp0100 could induce stable transamidosome assembly, offering additional protection above that provided by a kinetic mechanism. To accurately assess the role of Hp0100 in the absence of tRNA, all enzymes used in experiments herein were pretreated with RNase A. RNA gel evaluation in comparison with tRNA standards confirmed that each enzyme contained <0.1% tRNA contamination (supplemental Fig. S2). Where indicated, tRNAAsn was added. To determine whether or not Hp0100 participates in stable Asn-transamidosome formation, we first sought to recapitulate the observed yeast two-hybrid interactions between Hp0100 and AdT and between Hp0100 and ND-AspRS. Native gel electrophoresis showed upward shifts when Hp0100 was combined with ND-AspRS (Fig. 1A) and with AdT (Fig. 1B), demonstr"

A number of ligands are able to activate the RyR channel, but whether these structurally diverse ligands induce the same or different conformational changes in the channel is largely unknown. Here we constructed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based probe by inserting a CFP after residue Ser-2367 and a YFP after residue Tyr-2801 in the cardiac RyR (RyR2) to yield a CFP- and YFP-dual labeled RyR2 (RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP).

A fundamental unresolved question is how this large array of ligands with diverse structures activates the RyR channel. It is thought that RyR contains ligand-specific binding sites and that ligand binding to these sites induces conformational changes in the channel that consequently lead to the opening of the channel gate and Ca2+ release (12Ohkusa T.

Considerable efforts over the past decades have been focused on the understanding of ligand-induced conformational changes in RyR. Ikemoto and co-workers (12Ohkusa T. Kang J.J. Morii M. Ikemoto N.

Consistent with these biochemical studies, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle image analysis also revealed major structural rearrangements in the three-dimensional structure of RyR upon binding of ryanodine and Ca2+ or binding of a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP, AMP-PCP, and Ca2+ to the channel (14Orlova E.V.

Particularly, large conformational changes were observed in the transmembrane domain and in the four corners of the square-shaped cytoplasmic assembly, also known as clamp regions, in the three-dimensional architecture of RyR. Substantial structural rearrangements in the clamp region, the central cytoplasmic region, and the transmembrane domain were also detected when RyR was activated by another channel ligand, PCB 95 (17Samsó M. Feng W. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Coordinated movement of cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of RyR1 upon gating.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e85Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Hence, these studies clearly demonstrate that conformational changes occur in RyR upon ligand binding. An increasing body of evidence suggests that the clamp region consists of several key structural domains that are crucial for channel regulation and gating. It has recently been proposed that the clamp region contains the phosphorylation domain of RyR (20Yuchi Z. Lau K. Van Petegem F. Disease mutations in the ryanodine receptor central region. Crystal structures of a phosphorylation hot spot domain.Structure. 2012; 20: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with this prediction, residue Tyr-2801 in the cardiac RyR (RyR2), close to the Ser-2808 phosphorylation site, has been mapped to the clamp region (21Meng X. Xiao B. Cai S. Huang X. Li F. Bolstad J. Trujillo R. Airey J. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. Liu Z. Three-dimensional localization of serine 2808, a phosphorylation site in cardiac ryanodine receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25929-25939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The central disease-causing mutation hotspot and one of the divergent regions (DR2) have also been localized to this region (22Liu Z. Zhang J. Wang R. Wayne Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T.

Based on the spacing of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) arrangement in tetrads and that of the homotetrameric RyR, the clamp region has also been implicated in the activation of RyRs by DHPRs during excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle (15Serysheva I.I.

Biol. 2004; 342: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The clamp region also harbors the binding sites for the chloride intracellular channel 2 (CLIC2) and the natrin toxin, a cysteine-rich secretory protein isolated from snake venom, both of which have been shown to modulate the activity of RyR (27Zhou Q. Wang Q.L. Meng X. Shu Y. Jiang T. Wagenknecht T. Yin C.C. Sui S.F. Liu Z. Structural and functional characterization of ryanodine receptor-natrin toxin interaction.Biophys.

Thus, studying conformational changes in the clamp region is likely to yield important insights into the mechanism of ligand-dependent gating of RyR. Although cryo-EM studies revealed ligand-induced structural rearrangements in the clamp region, little is known about the ligand dependence of these conformational changes and their correlation with function. In this study we employed the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach to determining conformational changes in the clamp region of RyR2 upon binding with various ligands in live cells. The ligand-induced conformational changes were then correlated with the extent of Ca2+ release induced by the same ligand. To monitor conformational changes in the clamp region, we constructed a FRET probe in the clamp region by inserting a CFP after residue Ser-2367 and a YFP after residue Tyr-2801; both of these insertion sites have been previously mapped to the clamp region by cryo-EM (21Meng X.

Using this novel FRET probe, we found that caffeine, ATP, and ryanodine induced conformational changes in the clamp region and Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells, whereas Ca2+ and 4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC) induced Ca2+ release but caused no detectable conformational changes in the clamp region. Our results indicate that conformational changes in the clamp region are ligand-dependent and that RyR can be activated by different mechanisms associated with different conformational changes in the channel structure. The cloning and construction of the 15-kb full-length cDNA encoding the mouse cardiac RyR2 has been described previously (29Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R.

The RyR2 Ser-2367-CFP and RyR2Tyr-2801-YFP cDNAs were constructed according to the previously described procedures (21Meng X. Xiao B. Cai S. Huang X. Li F. Bolstad J. Trujillo R. Airey J. Chen S.R.

To generate the cDNA construct of RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP, the full-length RyR2 cDNA containing Ser-2367-CFP in pcDNA3 was released by the NheI-NotI restriction digestion and subcloned to the pBluescript vector. A cDNA fragment containing Tyr-2801-YFP was introduced into RyR2Ser-2367-CFP via the SphI restriction sites to form the full-length RyR2 containing both Ser-2367-CFP and Tyr-2801-YFP. The full-length RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP construct was then transferred from pBluescript to pcDNA3 or pcDNA5 for transient transfection or generation of stable cell lines. The truncated RyR2, RyR2-(1–4770), was generated as described previously (30Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R. Localization of the 12.6-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12.6) binding site to the NH2-terminal domain of the cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor).J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The BsiWI (8864)-NotI (vector) DNA fragment from the RyR2-(1–4770) construct was used to replace the corresponding fragment in the full-length RyR2(wt)Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP cDNA to yield the RyR2-(1–4770)Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP construct. The sequences and the orientation of the inserted CFP or YFP cDNA were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (31Chen S.R. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. Functional characterization of the recombinant type 3 Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor) expressed in HEK293 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 18–20 h after subculture were transfected with 12 μg of RyR2(wt) or RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP using calcium phosphate precipitation. Measurements of free cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in the transfected HEK293 cells using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo 3-AM were carried out as described previously (32Li P. Chen S.R. Molecular basis of Ca2+ activation of the mouse cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor).J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells grown for 18–20 h after transfection were washed 4 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 2.7 mm KCl) and incubated in Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer (KRH; 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 6 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) without MgCl2 and CaCl2 at room temperature for 40 min and then at 37 °C for 40 min. After being detached from culture dishes by pipetting, cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 2 min in a Beckman TH-4 rotor. Cell pellets were washed twice with KRH buffer and loaded with 10 μm Fluo 3-AM in KRH buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 250 μm sulfinpyrazone at room temperature for 60 min followed by washing with KRH buffer 3 times and resuspended in 150 μl of KRH buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 250 μm sulfinpyrazone. The Fluo-3 loaded cells were added to 2 ml (final volume) of KRH buffer and challenged with various concentrations of caffeine in a cuvette. Fluorescence intensity of Fluo-3 at 530 nm was measured in an SLM-Aminco series 2 luminescence spectrometer with 480-nm excitation at 25 °C (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Stable, inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing RyR2(wt) or RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP were generated using the Flp-In T-REx Core kit from Invitrogen. Briefly, Flp-In T-REx-293 cells were co-transfected with the inducible expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO containing the mutant cDNAs and the pOG44 vector encoding the Flp recombinase in 1:5 ratios using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The transfected cells were washed with PBS 24 h after transfection followed by a change into fresh media for 24 h. The cells were then washed again with PBS, harvested, and plated onto new dishes. After the cells had attached (∼4 h), the growth medium was replaced with a selection medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). The selection medium was changed every 3–4 days until the desired number of cells was grown. The hygromycin-resistant cells were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. These positive cells are believed to be isogenic because the integration of RyR2 cDNA is mediated by the Flp recombinase at a single FRT site. Luminal Ca2+ levels in HEK293 cells expressing RyR2(wt) or RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP were measured using single cell Ca2+ imaging and the FRET-based ER luminal Ca2+-sensitive cameleon protein D1ER as described previously (33Jones P.P. Jiang D. Bolstad J. Hunt D.J. Zhang L. Demaurex N. Chen S.R. Endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ measurements reveal that the cardiac ryanodine receptor mutations linked to cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death alter the threshold for store overload-induced Ca2+ release.Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to 95% confluence in a 75 cm2 flask, split with PBS, and plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes at ∼10% confluence 18∼20 h before transfection with D1ER cDNA. After transfection for 24 h, the growth medium was then changed to an induction medium containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). After being induced for ∼22 h, in intact cell studies, the cells were perfused continuously with KRH buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and caffeine at various concentrations (1, 3, 5, and 10 mm), aminophylline (10 mm), or theophylline (10 mm) at room temperature (22 °C). In permeabilized cells studies, the cells were first permeabilized by 50 μg/ml saponin in an incomplete intracellular-like medium (incomplete ICM containing 125 mm KCl, 19 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with KOH) for 3–4 min. The cells were then switched to a complete ICM (incomplete ICM plus 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.05 mm EGTA, and 200 nm free Ca2+, pH 7.4, with KOH) for 5–6 min to remove the saponin in the buffer. The permeabilized cells were then challenged with caffeine (10 mm), 4-CmC (1 mm), ATP (5 mm), Ca2+ (1 μm), or ryanodine (100 μm) plus caffeine (10 mm). Images were captured by a QuantEM 512SC camera every 2 s using the NIS-Elements AR software. The cells were excited at 430 nm, and the emission was split into 465- and 535-nm beams by a dual view device (Photometrics) placed in a Nikon eclipse Ti microscope equipped with the QuantEM 512SC camera. D1ER signals were determined from the ratios of the emissions at 535 ± 30 nm (YFP) and 465 ± 30 nm (CFP). FRET signals from the Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP FRET pair were measured using two approaches. In the first approach we determined the acceptor-donor emission ratio, i.e. the emission ratio of YFP and CFP fluorescence after CFP excitation only in intact or permeabilized HEK293 cells expressing RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP as described above for measuring ER luminal Ca2+ using D1ER. To increase the expression level of RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP and thus the fluorescence signals, HEK293 cells were induced by 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 2 days. In the second approach, HEK293 cells grown for 24–48 h after transfection with RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP were washed 3 times with KRH buffer without MgCl2 or CaCl2 and examined on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope with a 63×/NA1.4 oil-immersion objective lens (34Liu Z.

Cells were kept at 37 °C using a water-heated stage incubator. To test the impact of RyR2 ligands on FRET, buffer in the cultured dishes was exchanged by peristaltic pumps. We utilized the acceptor photobleaching method to detect and measure FRET signals in the live cells. Briefly, CFP and YFP were excited with separate laser channels of 458 and 514 nm, respectively. Emission fluorescence intensity data were obtained at 465–495 nm (CFP) and 520–550 nm (YFP). We used a 700-Hz line frequency scan speed with bidirectional scan mode in combination with an image format of 1024 × 1024 pixels, which can record one image every 754 ms. Repeated scans (30–60) with maximum laser intensity at 514 nm were used to photobleach YFP, which lasted about 23–45 s, and the FRET efficiency was calculated according to the equation, E=(ICFPpost−ICFPpreICFPpost)×100%(Eq. 1) where ICFPpre and ICFPpost are the respective background-corrected CFP fluorescence intensities before and after photobleaching YFP (35Papadopoulos S.

The photobleaching, fluorescence intensity measurements and FRET efficiency calculation were controlled automatically by the software Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (LAS AF). HEK293 cells expressing RyR2Ser-2367-CFP/Tyr-2801-YFP for 2 days were collected in a 50-ml tube and permeabilized by 50 μg/ml saponin in an incomplete ICM buffer for 3 min. After saponin was washed off, the cells were apportioned equally into two 50-ml tubes.

https://openalex.org/W1975139790,"γ-Herpesviruses express proteins that modulate B lymphocyte signaling to achieve persistent latent infections. One such protein is the M2 latency-associated protein encoded by the murid herpesvirus-4. M2 has two closely spaced tyrosine residues, Tyr(120) and Tyr(129), which are phosphorylated by Src family tyrosine kinases. Here we used mass spectrometry to identify the binding partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated M2. Each M2 phosphomotif is shown to bind directly and selectively to SH2-containing signaling molecules. Specifically, Src family kinases, NCK1 and Vav1, bound to the Tyr(P)(120) site, PLCγ2 and the SHP2 phosphatase bound to the Tyr(P)(129) motif, and the p85α subunit of PI3K associated with either motif. Consistent with these data, we show that M2 coordinates the formation of multiprotein complexes with these proteins. The effect of those interactions is functionally bivalent, because it can result in either the phosphorylation of a subset of binding proteins (Vav1 and PLCγ2) or in the inactivation of downstream targets (AKT). Finally, we show that translocation to the plasma membrane and subsequent M2 tyrosine phosphorylation relies on the integrity of a C-terminal proline-rich SH3 binding region of M2 and its interaction with Src family kinases. Unlike other γ-herpesviruses, that encode transmembrane proteins that mimic the activation of ITAMs, murid herpesvirus-4 perturbs B cell signaling using a cytoplasmic/membrane shuttling factor that nucleates the assembly of signaling complexes using a bilayered mechanism of phosphotyrosine and proline-rich anchoring motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2028271767,"The GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange of Arf1 is catalyzed by nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), such as Arno, which act through their catalytic Sec7 domain. This exchange is a complex mechanism that undergoes conformational changes and intermediate complex species involving several allosteric partners such as nucleotides, Mg(2+), and Sec7 domains. Using a surface plasmon resonance approach, we characterized the kinetic binding parameters for various intermediate complexes. We first confirmed that both GDP and GTP counteract equivalently to the free-nucleotide binary Arf1-Arno complex stability and revealed that Mg(2+) potentiates by a factor of 2 the allosteric effect of GDP. Then we explored the uncompetitive inhibitory mechanism of brefeldin A (BFA) that conducts to an abortive pentameric Arf1-Mg(2+)-GDP-BFA-Sec7 complex. With BFA, the association rate of the abortive complex is drastically reduced by a factor of 42, and by contrast, the 15-fold decrease of the dissociation rate concurs to stabilize the pentameric complex. These specific kinetic signatures have allowed distinguishing the level and nature as well as the fate in real time of formed complexes according to experimental conditions. Thus, we showed that in the presence of GDP, the BFA-resistant Sec7 domain of Arno can also associate to form a pentameric complex, which suggests that the uncompetitive inhibition by BFA and the nucleotide allosteric effect combine to stabilize such abortive complex."
