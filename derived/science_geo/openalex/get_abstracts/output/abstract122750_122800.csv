https://openalex.org/W1985063313,"p300/CBP is a transcriptional adaptor that integrates signals from many sequence-specific activators via direct interactions. Various cellular and viral factors target p300/CBP to modulate transcription and/or cell cycle progression. One such factor, the cellular p300/CBP associated factor (PCAF), possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity. Here, we demonstrate that p300/CBP is not only a transcriptional adaptor but also a histone acetyltransferase. p300/CBP represents a novel class of acetyltransferases in that it does not have the conserved motif found among various other acetyltransferases. p300/CBP acetylates all four core histones in nucleosomes. These observations suggest that p300/CBP acetylates nucleosomes in concert with PCAF."
https://openalex.org/W2051686420,"Two cyclooxygenase isozymes catalyze conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2: constitutive COX-1 and inducible COX-2. To assess the role of COX-2 in colorectal tumorigenisis, we determined the effects of COX-2 gene (Ptgs2) knockouts and a novel COX-2 inhibitor on Apc delta716 knockout mice, a model of human familial adenomatous polyposis. A Ptgs2 null mutation reduced the number and size of the intestinal polyps dramatically. Furthermore, treating Apc delta716 mice with a novel COX-2 inhibitor reduced the polyp number more significantly than with sulindac, which inhibits both isoenzymes. These results provide direct genetic evidence that COX-2 plays a key role in tumorigenesis and indicate that COX-2-selective inhibitors can be a novel class of therapeutic agents for colorectal polyposis and cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2099057503,"The disease non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose resulting from a relative deficiency of insulin. It affects about 2% of the world's population and treatment of diabetes and its complications are an increasing health-care burden. Genetic factors are important in the aetiology of NIDDM, and linkage studies are starting to localize some of the genes that influence the development of this disorder. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a single-gene disorder responsible for 2-5% of NIDDM, is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and an age of onset of 25 years or younger. MODY genes have been localized to chromosomes 7, 12 and 20 (refs 5, 7, 8) and clinical studies indicate that mutations in these genes are associated with abnormal patterns of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The gene on chromosome 7 (MODY2) encodes the glycolytic enzyme glucokinases which plays a key role in generating the metabolic signal for insulin secretion and in integrating hepatic glucose uptake. Here we show that subjects with the MODY3-form of NIDDM have mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha, which is encoded by the gene TCF1). HNF-1alpha is a transcription factor that helps in the tissue-specific regulation of the expression of several liver genes and also functions as a weak transactivator of the rat insulin-I gene."

https://openalex.org/W2007589425,"Human L1 elements are highly abundant poly(A) (non-LTR) retrotransposons whose second open reading frame (ORF2) encodes a reverse transcriptase (RT). We have identified an endonuclease (EN) domain at the L1 ORF2 N-terminus that is highly conserved among poly(A) retrotransposons and resembles the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases. Purified L1 EN protein (L1 ENp) makes 5'-PO4, 3'-OH nicks in supercoiled plasmids, shows no preference for AP sites, and preferentially cleaves sequences resembling L1 in vivo target sequences. Mutations in conserved amino acid residues of L1 EN abolish its nicking activity and eliminate L1 retrotransposition. We propose that L1 EN cleaves the target site for L1 insertion and primes reverse transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2064629259,"We previously isolated two human L1 elements (L1.2 and LRE2) as the progenitors of disease-producing insertions. Here, we show these elements can actively retrotranspose in cultured mammalian cells. When stably expressed from an episome in HeLa cells, both elements retrotransposed into a variety of chromosomal locations at a high frequency. The retrotransposed products resembled endogenous L1 insertions, since they were variably 5′ truncated, ended in poly(A) tracts, and were flanked by target-site duplications or short deletions. Point mutations in conserved domains of the L1.2-encoded proteins reduced retrotransposition by 100- to 1000-fold. Remarkably, L1.2 also retrotransposed in a mouse cell line, suggesting a potential role for L1-based vectors in random insertional mutagenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2137530456,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic joint disease characterized by leukocyte invasion and synoviocyte activation followed by cartilage and bone destruction. Its etiology and pathogenesis are poorly understood. We describe a spontaneous mouse model of this syndrome, generated fortuitously by crossing a T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic line with the NOD strain. All offspring develop a joint disease highly reminiscent of RA in man. The trigger for the murine disorder is chance recognition of a NOD-derived major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule by the transgenic TCR; progression to arthritis involves CD4+ T, B, and probably myeloid cells. Thus, a joint-specific disease need not arise from response to a joint-specific antigen but can be precipitated by a breakdown in general mechanisms of self-tolerance resulting in systemic self-reactivity. We suggest that human RA develops by an analogous mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2029307548,"Wingless (Wg), a founding member of the Wingless/Int-1 (Wnt) family of secreted proteins, acts as a short-range inducer and as a long-range organizer during Drosophila development. Here, we determine the consequences of ectopically expressing (i) a wild-type form of Wg, (ii) a membrane-tethered form of Wg, and (iii) a constitutively active form of the cytosolic protein Armadillo (Arm), which normally acts to transduce Wg, and we compare them with the effects of removing endogenous Wg or Arm activity. Our results indicate that wild-type Wg acts at long range, up-regulating the transcription of particular target genes as a function of concentration and distance from secreting cells. In contrast, tethered Wg and Arm have only short-range or autonomous effects, respectively, on the transcription of these genes. We interpret these findings as evidence that Wg can act directly and at long range as a gradient morphogen during normal development."

https://openalex.org/W2065477683,"Structurally related serine/threonine kinases recognize similar phosphoacceptor peptides in vitro yet in vivo, they phosphorylate distinct substrates. To understand the basis for this specificity, we studied the interaction between the Jun kinases (JNKs) and Jun proteins. JNKs phosphorylate c-Jun very efficiently, JunD less efficiently, but they do not phosphorylate JunB. Effective JNK substrates require a separate docking site and specificity-conferring residues flanking the phosphoacceptor. The docking site increases the efficiency and specificity of the phosphorylation reaction. JunB has a functional JNK docking site but lacks specificity-conferring residues. Insertion of such residues brings JunB under JNK control. JunD, by contrast, lacks a JNK docking site, but its phosphoacceptor peptide is identical to that of c-Jun. Substrates such as JunD can be phosphorylated by JNK through heterodimerization with docking competent partners. Therefore, heterodimerization can affect the recognition of transcription factors by signal-regulated protein kinases."

https://openalex.org/W2027784918,"The switch from membrane-bound to secreted-form IgM that occurs during differentiation of B lymphocytes has long been known to involve regulated processing of the heavy chain pre-mRNA. Here, we show that accumulation of one subunit of an essential polyadenylation factor (CstF-64) is specifically repressed in mouse primary B cells and that overexpression of CstF-64 is sufficient to switch heavy chain expression from membrane-bound (μm) to secreted form (μs). We further show that CstF-64 is limiting for formation of intact CstF, that CstF has a higher affinity for the μm poly(A) site than for the μs site, and that the μm site is stronger in a reconstituted in vitro processing reaction. Our results indicate that CstF-64 plays a key role in regulating IgM heavy chain expression during B cell differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2028468783,"Cell cycle regulation is critical for maintenance of genome integrity. A prominent factor that guarantees genomic stability of cells is p53 (ref. 1). The P53 gene encodes a transcription factor that has a role as a tumour suppressor. Identification of p53-target genes should provide greater insight into the molecular mechanisms that mediate the tumour suppressor activities of p53. The rodent Pc3/Tis21 gene was initially described as an immediate early gene induced by tumour promoters and growth factors in PC12 and Swiss 3T3 cells. It is expressed in a variety of cell and tissue types and encodes a remarkably labile protein. Pc3/Tis21 has a strong sequence similarity to the human antiproliferative BTG1 gene cloned from a chromosomal translocation of a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. This similarity led us to speculate that BTG1 and the putative human homologue of Pc3/Tis21 (named BTG2) were members of a new family of genes involved in growth control and/or differentiation. This hypothesis was recently strengthened by the identification of a new antiproliferative protein, named TOB, which shares sequence similarity with BTG1 and PC3/TIS21 (ref. 7). Here, we cloned and localized the human BTG2 gene. We show that BTG2 expression is induced through a p53-dependent mechanism and that BTG2 function may be relevant to cell cycle control and cellular response to DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W2097471575,"Viral envelope (Env)–receptor interactions have been implicated in the cell death associated with infection by subgroups B and D avian leukosis–sarcoma viruses (ALVs). A chicken protein, CAR1, was identified that permitted infection of mammalian cells by these viral subgroups. CAR1 bound to a viral Env fusion protein, comprising an ALV-B surface Env protein and the Fc region of an immunoglobulin, indicating that it is a specific viral receptor. CAR1 contains two extracellular cysteine-rich domains characteristic of the TNFR family and a cytoplasmic region strikingly similar to the death domain of TNFR1 and Fas, implicating this receptor in cell killing. Chicken embryo fibroblasts susceptible to ALV-B infection and transfected quail QT6 cells expressing CAR1 underwent apoptosis in response to the Env–Ig fusion protein, demonstrating that this cytopathic ALV receptor can mediate cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2094592032,"Inwardly rectifying potassium channels have an important role in determining the resting potential of the cell. They are tetrameric proteins with two transmembrane segments (M1 and M2), a pore-forming loop (H5), a cytoplasmic N-terminal, and longer C-terminal domain. We have used biochemical and electrophysiological methods to identify regions required for homotypic interactions and those responsible for the incompatibility between IRK1 and two other members of the same subfamily (IRK2 and IRK3) and two members from other subfamilies (ROMK1 and 6.1 uK(ATP)). The data indicate that, in contrast to the voltage-gated class of potassium channel, the proximal C-terminus and the transmembrane segment M2 determine homo-and heteromultimerization and that heteromultimerization between members of the same or different subfamilies is case specific."

https://openalex.org/W1990119837,"ran1+ (pat1+) kinase inhibits exit from the mitotic cell cycle and entry into meiosis. Inactivation of ran1+ by mei3+ is sufficient to precipitate the entire meiotic developmental program. Here, we show that the ste11+ transcription factor is a substrate for ran1+ in vitro and that this reaction is directly inhibited by mei3+. Sequence comparison reveals that ste11+ contains two domains homologous to each other and to a domain of mei3+. Mutagenesis studies reveal that the regions of homology contain substrate specificity determinants. These results identify sequences critical for phosphorylation of ste11+ by ran1+ and suggest that mei3+ employs a pseudosubstrate mechanism for its inhibitory function."
https://openalex.org/W2040358767,"In embryos of X. laevis, and many other species, early development requires targeted movements of molecules and molecular aggregates within the oocyte or egg cytoplasm. One well-known example in Xenopus is the aggregation of germ plasm, a group of cytoplasmic islands that become distributed during the first few cell cycles to cells that will give rise to the germ line. Nothing is known about the cytoskeletal motor proteins that may drive these movements. We show here that a recently identified Xenopus kinesin-like protein, Xklp1, is required for the aggregation of germ plasm in early Xenopus embryos, thus assigning this protein a role in a developmentally important cytoplasmic localization."

https://openalex.org/W1999407496,"Transcripts encoded by the cis-acting antitermination sites (put sites) of lambdoid phage HK022 promote readthrough of downstream transcription terminators. Proper conformation of the transcripts is essential for activity, since put mutations that prevent the formation of predicted RNA stems prevented antitermination, and suppressor mutations that restore the stems restored antitermination. Antitermination does not appear to require proteins other than RNA polymerase, since put-dependent readthrough of multiple sequential terminators was observed in a purified transcription system consisting of template, polymerase, substrates, and buffer. Transcription of put also increased the elongation rate of polymerase, very likely by suppressing pausing. A mutation that alters the zinc-finger region of the beta' subunit of polymerase specifically prevented the put-dependent increases in terminator readthrough and elongation rate. The simplicity of HK022 antitermination contrasts with that of other known antitermination pathways. We propose that the central effector is a transcript that directly alters the elongation properties of RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2011751676,"Termination of DNA replication at a sequence-specific replication terminus is potentiated by the binding of the replication terminator protein (RTP) to the terminus sequence, causing polar arrest of the replicative helicase (contrahelicase activity). Two alternative models have been proposed to explain the mechanism of replication fork arrest. In the first model, the RTP-terminus DNA interaction simply imposes a polar barrier to helicase movement without involving any specific interaction between the helicase and the terminator proteins. The second model proposes that there is a specific interaction between the two proteins, and that the DNA-protein interaction both restricts the fork arrest to the replication terminus and determines the polarity of the process. The evidence presented in this paper strongly supports the second model."
