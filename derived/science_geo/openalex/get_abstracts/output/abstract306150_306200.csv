https://openalex.org/W1994596677,"Field emission of electrons from individually mounted carbon nanotubes has been found to be dramatically enhanced when the nanotube tips are opened by laser evaporation or oxidative etching. Emission currents of 0.1 to 1 microampere were readily obtained at room temperature with bias voltages of less than 80 volts. The emitting structures are concluded to be linear chains of carbon atoms, Cn, (n = 10 to 100), pulled out from the open edges of the graphene wall layers of the nanotube by the force of the electric field, in a process that resembles unraveling the sleeve of a sweater."
https://openalex.org/W2045562132,"The heterofullerene ion C(59)N(+) is formed efficiently in the gas phase during fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy of a cluster-opened N-MEM (N-methoxyethoxy methyl) ketolactam. This transformation is shown to occur also in solution in the presence of strong acid, affording biazafullerenyl (C(59)N)(2) in good yield. It is proposed that the azafullerene dimer is formed upon in situ reduction of the highly reactive azafulleronium ion. The isolation and characterization of biazafullerenyl opens a viable route for the preparation of other heterofullerenes in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2008867603,"Organic field-effect transistors have been developed that function as either n-channel or p-channel devices, depending on the gate bias. The two active materials are alpha-hexathienylene (alpha-6T) and C(60). The characteristics of these devices depend mainly on the molecular orbital energy levels and transport properties of alpha-6T and C(60). The observed effects are not unique to the two materials chosen and can be quite universal provided certain conditions are met. The device can be used as a building block to form low-cost, low-power complementary integrated circuits."

The last glaciation ended with massive collapse of ice lobes close to 14,000(14)C yr B.P., accompanied by an influx of North Patagonian Rain Forest species. In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, additional glacial maxima are registered at 17,720(14)C yr B.P., and at the beginning of the Younger Dryas at 11,050 (14)C yr B. P. These glacial maxima in mid-latitude mountains rimming the South Pacific were coeval with ice-rafting pulses in the North Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, the last termination began suddenly and simultaneously in both polar hemispheres before the resumption of the modern mode of deep-water production in the Nordic Seas. Such interhemispheric coupling implies a global atmospheric signal rather than regional climatic changes caused by North Atlantic thermohaline switches or Laurentide ice surges."
https://openalex.org/W2081807782,"A stable high-index surface of silicon, Si(5 5 12), is described. This surface forms a 2 × 1 reconstruction with one of the largest unit cells ever observed, 7.7 angstroms by 53.5 angstroms. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveals that the 68 surface atoms per 2 × 1 unit cell are reconstructed only on a local scale. A complete structural model for the surface is proposed, incorporating a variety of features known to exist on other stable silicon surfaces. Simulated STM images based on this model have been computed by first-principles electronic-structure methods and show excellent agreement with experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2069102366,"One of the most impressive manifestations of spontaneous pattern generation in natural materials is iris agate, which contains submicrometer concentric striations that may cycle several thousand times within an individual specimen. Analysis by secondary ion mass spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy identified the iris texture as alternating layers of fine-grained, highly defective chalcedony and coarse-grained low-defect quartz. This oscillatory zonation in defect concentration may be ascribed to Ostwald-Liesegang crystallization cycles from silica-rich fluids that are variably polymeric and monomeric. Periodic changes in defect concentration and grain size also are observed with wavelengths of hundreds of micrometers and of centimeters, so that agates reveal textural self-similarity over three length scales."
https://openalex.org/W2014993097,"A hydrogen isotope time series obtained from an analysis of organic matter extracted from a lake core in Kalamazoo, southwestern Michigan, reveals four distinct isotope stages within the last 12,000 years that can be interpreted in terms of oscillations between cold and warm, dry climates. The most dramatic are a cold phase between 12,000 and 9000 years before present (B.P.), a warm, dry period between 8500 and 2000 years B.P., a cold period between 2000 and 1000 years B.P., and a warming trend since 1000 years B.P. The warming trend of the last 1000 years is comparable in magnitude to the mid-Holocene warm phase."

https://openalex.org/W2062262090,"'There exists an additive function of state S, called the entropy, and a set of additive functions of state, called components of content, such ,that, for any states a and b, a -b if, and only if S(a) :s;;S(b), and Q(a) = Q(b) for every component of content Q. Somehow this does not sound familiar. In fact, this is the fundamental theorem of a thermodynamics of Giles (1). Only three primitive concepts are necessary: that of a !>tate, tha.t of addition (+), and that of the relation beween two states a and obsuch that there exists a natural process leading from a to b (a --4 b). By using only these th ee notions, a coherent structure of c!assical thermodynamics has been constructed; the results are equivalent to those obtained by other, more complicated approach<. This was done some years ago. Yet, relatively very little aHention has been paid to Giles's construction. This is surprising, as users of thermodynamics are a multitude. Many of these, however, act under a mistaken assumption, that the scope and contents of thermodynamics are time-independent. Thermodynamics is relatively old, compared"

https://openalex.org/W2063334405,"String theorists have broken an impasse and may be on their way to converting this mathematical structure-physicists` best hope for unifying gravity and quantum theory-into a single, coherent theory. In an ordinary year, the idyllic setting might be the one thing buoying the spirits of string theorists gathered here at the Aspen Center for Physics to discuss the state of their arcane field. But this summer, at a month-long workshop on string theory, a mood of uncharacteristic optimism and exhilaration prevailed. For more than a decade, these theorists have been struggling to make sense of a mathematical framework that may constitute a unified theory of particles and forces, of gravity and quantum physics-a.k.a., a theory of everything. But they have made little headway. Now, after a quick succession of breakthroughs, this collection of equations, which had seemed to describe many different universes, none clearly related to our own, is showing signs of turning into a coherent theory."

https://openalex.org/W2080577575,"Reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy was a bread-and -butter issue for the Republicans who took over Congress in January. And the Department of Energy`s (DOE`s) $6 billion network of national laboratories seemed like a tempting morsel. But 9 months later, congressional plates are loaded down with competing plans to reform the DOE labs, and the issue is giving majority members a case of indigestion. Their discomfort seems likely to delay adoption of any reform plans until at least next year. This article discusses the broad alternatives and possibilities for the future."
