https://openalex.org/W1981185465,"Coupling the specificity of CRISPR-Cas nucleases and bacteriophage delivery enables exquisitely precise bacterial killing. Antibiotics target conserved bacterial cellular pathways or growth functions and therefore cannot selectively kill specific members of a complex microbial population. Here, we develop programmable, sequence-specific antimicrobials using the RNA-guided nuclease Cas9 (refs.1,2) delivered by a bacteriophage. We show that Cas9, reprogrammed to target virulence genes, kills virulent, but not avirulent, Staphylococcus aureus. Reprogramming the nuclease to target antibiotic resistance genes destroys staphylococcal plasmids that harbor antibiotic resistance genes3,4 and immunizes avirulent staphylococci to prevent the spread of plasmid-borne resistance genes. We also show that CRISPR-Cas9 antimicrobials function in vivo to kill S. aureus in a mouse skin colonization model. This technology creates opportunities to manipulate complex bacterial populations in a sequence-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2015329065,"Osteogenesis during bone modeling and remodeling is coupled with angiogenesis. A recent study showed that a specific vessel subtype, strongly positive for CD31 and endomucin (CD31(hi)Emcn(hi)), couples angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Here, we found that platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) secreted by preosteoclasts induces CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) vessel formation during bone modeling and remodeling. Mice with depletion of PDGF-BB in the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cell lineage show significantly lower trabecular and cortical bone mass, serum and bone marrow PDGF-BB concentrations, and fewer CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) vessels compared to wild-type mice. In the ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mouse model, serum and bone marrow levels of PDGF-BB and numbers of CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) vessels are significantly lower compared to sham-operated controls. Treatment with exogenous PDGF-BB or inhibition of cathepsin K to increase the number of preosteoclasts, and thus the endogenous levels of PDGF-BB, increases CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) vessel number and stimulates bone formation in OVX mice. Thus, pharmacotherapies that increase PDGF-BB secretion from preosteoclasts offer a new therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis by promoting angiogenesis and thus bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2098036797,"People find it easier to learn about topics that interest them, but little is known about the mechanisms by which intrinsic motivational states affect learning. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how curiosity (intrinsic motivation to learn) influences memory. In both immediate and one-day-delayed memory tests, participants showed improved memory for information that they were curious about and for incidental material learned during states of high curiosity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results revealed that activity in the midbrain and the nucleus accumbens was enhanced during states of high curiosity. Importantly, individual variability in curiosity-driven memory benefits for incidental material was supported by anticipatory activity in the midbrain and hippocampus and by functional connectivity between these regions. These findings suggest a link between the mechanisms supporting extrinsic reward motivation and intrinsic curiosity and highlight the importance of stimulating curiosity to create more effective learning experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2141158722,"To study how microbes establish themselves in a mammalian gut environment, we colonized germ-free mice with microbial communities from human, zebrafish, and termite guts, human skin and tongue, soil, and estuarine microbial mats. Bacteria from these foreign environments colonized and persisted in the mouse gut; their capacity to metabolize dietary and host carbohydrates and bile acids correlated with colonization success. Cohousing mice harboring these xenomicrobiota or a mouse cecal microbiota, along with germ-free ""bystanders,"" revealed the success of particular bacterial taxa in invading guts with established communities and empty gut habitats. Unanticipated patterns of ecological succession were observed; for example, a soil-derived bacterium dominated even in the presence of bacteria from other gut communities (zebrafish and termite), and human-derived bacteria colonized germ-free bystander mice before mouse-derived organisms. This approach can be generalized to address a variety of mechanistic questions about succession, including succession in the context of microbiota-directed therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2009953822,"The vasculature is a prominent component of the subventricular zone neural stem cell niche. Although quiescent neural stem cells physically contact blood vessels at specialized endfeet, the significance of this interaction is not understood. In contrast, it is well established that vasculature-secreted soluble factors promote lineage progression of committed progenitors. Here we specifically investigated the role of cell-cell contact-dependent signalling in the vascular niche. Unexpectedly, we find that direct cell-cell interactions with endothelial cells enforce quiescence and promote stem cell identity. Mechanistically, endothelial ephrinB2 and Jagged1 mediate these effects by suppressing cell-cycle entry downstream of mitogens and inducing stemness genes to jointly inhibit differentiation. In vivo, endothelial-specific ablation of either of the genes which encode these proteins, Efnb2 and Jag1 respectively, aberrantly activates quiescent stem cells, resulting in depletion. Thus, we identify the vasculature as a critical niche compartment for stem cell maintenance, furthering our understanding of how anchorage to the niche maintains stem cells within a pro-differentiative microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W1985819704,"By acting as a mild mitochondrial uncoupler, a derivative of the approved drug niclosamide may offer a new approach to treat diabetes. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached an epidemic level globally. Most current treatments ameliorate the hyperglycemic symptom of the disease but are not effective in correcting its underlying cause. One important causal factor of T2D is ectopic accumulation of lipids in metabolically sensitive organs such as liver and muscle. Mitochondrial uncoupling, which reduces cellular energy efficiency and increases lipid oxidation, is an appealing therapeutic strategy. The challenge, however, is to discover safe mitochondrial uncouplers for practical use. Niclosamide is an anthelmintic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that uncouples the mitochondria of parasitic worms. Here we show that niclosamide ethanolamine salt (NEN) uncouples mammalian mitochondria at upper nanomolar concentrations. Oral NEN increases energy expenditure and lipid metabolism in mice. It is also efficacious in preventing and treating hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. Moreover, it improves glycemic control and delays disease progression in db/db mice. Given the well-documented safety profile of NEN, our study provides a potentially new and practical pharmacological approach for treating T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2082940604,"The neural systems that code for location and facing direction during spatial navigation have been investigated extensively; however, the mechanisms by which these quantities are referenced to external features of the world are not well understood. To address this issue, we examined behavioral priming and functional magnetic resonance imaging activity patterns while human subjects recalled spatial views from a recently learned virtual environment. Behavioral results indicated that imagined location and facing direction were represented during this task, and multivoxel pattern analyses indicated that the retrosplenial complex (RSC) was the anatomical locus of these spatial codes. Critically, in both cases, location and direction were defined on the basis of fixed elements of the local environment and generalized across geometrically similar local environments. These results suggest that RSC anchors internal spatial representations to local topographical features, thus allowing us to stay oriented while we navigate and retrieve from memory the experience of being in a particular place."
https://openalex.org/W1995906064,"This study uses fMRI in humans to find that prediction errors about pain are encoded in the periaqueductal gray. Modeling inter-area connectivity suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the putamen pass on a value-related signal to this midbrain structure, which then conveys predictor error signals to prefrontal regions that regulate behavior. Pain is a primary driver of learning and motivated action. It is also a target of learning, as nociceptive brain responses are shaped by learning processes. We combined an instrumental pain avoidance task with an axiomatic approach to assessing fMRI signals related to prediction errors (PEs), which drive reinforcement-based learning. We found that pain PEs were encoded in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a structure important for pain control and learning in animal models. Axiomatic tests combined with dynamic causal modeling suggested that ventromedial prefrontal cortex, supported by putamen, provides an expected value–related input to the PAG, which then conveys PE signals to prefrontal regions important for behavioral regulation, including orbitofrontal, anterior mid-cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices. Thus, pain-related learning involves distinct neural circuitry, with implications for behavior and pain dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2111323820,"With the exception of imprinted genes and certain repeats, DNA methylation is globally erased during preimplantation development. Recent studies have suggested that Tet3-mediated oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and DNA replication-dependent dilution both contribute to global paternal DNA demethylation, but demethylation of the maternal genome occurs via replication. Here we present genome-scale DNA methylation maps for both the paternal and maternal genomes of Tet3-depleted and/or DNA replication-inhibited zygotes. In both genomes, we found that inhibition of DNA replication blocks DNA demethylation independently from Tet3 function and that Tet3 facilitates DNA demethylation largely by coupling with DNA replication. For both genomes, our data indicate that replication-dependent dilution is the major contributor to demethylation, but Tet3 plays an important role, particularly at certain loci. Our study thus defines the respective functions of Tet3 and DNA replication in paternal DNA demethylation and reveals an unexpected contribution of Tet3 to demethylation of the maternal genome."
https://openalex.org/W2071754840,"The FLT3-ITD mutation is frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with poor prognosis. In such patients, FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are only partially effective and do not eliminate the leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that are assumed to be the source of treatment failure. Here, we show that the NAD-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase is selectively overexpressed in primary human FLT3-ITD AML LSCs. This SIRT1 overexpression is related to enhanced expression of the USP22 deubiquitinase induced by c-MYC, leading to reduced SIRT1 ubiquitination and enhanced stability. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression or activity reduced the growth of FLT3-ITD AML LSCs and significantly enhanced TKI-mediated killing of the cells. Therefore, these results identify a c-MYC-related network that enhances SIRT1 protein expression in human FLT3-ITD AML LSCs and contributes to their maintenance. Inhibition of this oncogenic network could be an attractive approach for targeting FLT3-ITD AML LSCs to improve treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1974812715,"Metastatic progression, including extravasation and micrometastatic outgrowth, is the main cause of cancer patient death. Recent studies suggest that cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to support increased proliferation through increased glycolysis and biosynthetic activities, including lipogenesis pathways. However, metabolic changes during metastatic progression, including alterations in regulatory gene expression, remain undefined. We show that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1)-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is accompanied by coordinately reduced enzyme expression required to convert glucose into fatty acids, and concomitant enhanced respiration. Overexpressed Snail1, a transcription factor mediating TGFβ1-induced EMT, was sufficient to suppress carbohydrate-responsive-element-binding protein (ChREBP, a master lipogenic regulator), and fatty acid synthase (FASN), its effector lipogenic gene. Stable FASN knockdown was sufficient to induce EMT, stimulate migration and extravasation in vitro. FASN silencing enhanced lung metastasis and death in vivo. These data suggest that a metabolic transition that suppresses lipogenesis and favors energy production is an essential component of TGFβ1-induced EMT and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2080566879,"Neuronal production in the mammalian cortex depends on extensive mitoses of radial glial progenitors (RGPs) residing in the ventricular zone (VZ). We examined the function of centrioles in RGPs during cortical neurogenesis in mice by conditional removal of SAS-4, a protein that is required for centriole biogenesis. SAS-4 deletion led to a progressive loss of centrioles, accompanied by RGP detachment from the VZ. Delocalized RGPs did not become outer subventricular zone RGPs (oRGs). Although they remained proliferative, ectopic RGPs, as well as those in the VZ, with a centrosomal deficit exhibited prolonged mitosis, p53 upregulation and apoptosis, resulting in neuronal loss and microcephaly. Simultaneous removal of p53 fully rescued RGP death and microcephaly, but not RGP delocalization and randomized mitotic spindle orientation. Our findings define the functions of centrioles in anchoring RGPs in the VZ and ensuring their efficient mitoses, and reveal the robust adaptability of RGPs in the developing cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1993933334,"Molecular diversity of surface receptors has been hypothesized to provide a mechanism for selective synaptic connectivity. Neurexins are highly diversified receptors that drive the morphological and functional differentiation of synapses. Using a single cDNA sequencing approach, we detected 1,364 unique neurexin-α and 37 neurexin-β mRNAs produced by alternative splicing of neurexin pre-mRNAs. This molecular diversity results from near-exhaustive combinatorial use of alternative splice insertions in Nrxn1α and Nrxn2α. By contrast, Nrxn3α exhibits several highly stereotyped exon selections that incorporate novel elements for posttranscriptional regulation of a subset of transcripts. Complexity of Nrxn1α repertoires correlates with the cellular complexity of neuronal tissues, and a specific subset of isoforms is enriched in a purified cell type. Our analysis defines the molecular diversity of a critical synaptic receptor and provides evidence that neurexin diversity is linked to cellular diversity in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2055736811,"In the thymus, high-affinity, self-reactive thymocytes are eliminated from the pool of developing T cells, generating central tolerance. Here, we investigate how developing T cells measure self-antigen affinity. We show that very few CD4 or CD8 coreceptor molecules are coupled with the signal-initiating kinase, Lck. To initiate signaling, an antigen-engaged T cell receptor (TCR) scans multiple coreceptor molecules to find one that is coupled to Lck; this is the first and rate-limiting step in a kinetic proofreading chain of events that eventually leads to TCR triggering and negative selection. MHCII-restricted TCRs require a shorter antigen dwell time (0.2 s) to initiate negative selection compared to MHCI-restricted TCRs (0.9 s) because more CD4 coreceptors are Lck-loaded compared to CD8. We generated a model (Lck come&stay/signal duration) that accurately predicts the observed differences in antigen dwell-time thresholds used by MHCI- and MHCII-restricted thymocytes to initiate negative selection and generate self-tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2022167776,"We have previously demonstrated that Stat3 regulates lysosomal-mediated programmed cell death (LM-PCD) during mouse mammary gland involution in vivo. However, the mechanism that controls the release of lysosomal cathepsins to initiate cell death in this context has not been elucidated. We show here that Stat3 regulates the formation of large lysosomal vacuoles that contain triglyceride. Furthermore, we demonstrate that milk fat globules (MFGs) are toxic to epithelial cells and that, when applied to purified lysosomes, the MFG hydrolysate oleic acid potently induces lysosomal leakiness. Additionally, uptake of secreted MFGs coated in butyrophilin 1A1 is diminished in Stat3-ablated mammary glands and loss of the phagocytosis bridging molecule MFG-E8 results in reduced leakage of cathepsins in vivo. We propose that Stat3 regulates LM-PCD in mouse mammary gland by switching cellular function from secretion to uptake of MFGs. Thereafter, perturbation of lysosomal vesicle membranes by high levels of free fatty acids results in controlled leakage of cathepsins culminating in cell death. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization releases cathepsins to promote cell death and mammary gland involution. Sargeant et al. report that Stat3-driven phagocytic uptake of fatty acids in milk triglycerides permeabilizes lysosomes to induce cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2024355391,"Conventional embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from primates resemble mouse epiblast stem cells, raising an intriguing question regarding whether the naive pluripotent state resembling mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) exists in primates and how to capture it in vitro. Here we identified several specific signaling modulators that are sufficient to generate rhesus monkey fibroblast-derived iPSCs with the features of naive pluripotency in terms of growth properties, gene expression profiles, self-renewal signaling, X-reactivation, and the potential to generate cross-species chimeric embryos. Interestingly, together with recent reports of naive human pluripotent stem cells, our findings suggest several conserved signaling pathways shared with rodents and specific to primates, providing significant insights for acquiring naive pluripotency from other species. In addition, the derivation of rhesus monkey naive iPSCs also provides a valuable cell source for use in preclinical research and disease modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2038344374,"The oncoprotein c-Myc is frequently overexpressed in many cancers and is essential for cancer cell proliferation. Ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation is one of the main ways in which cells control c-Myc abundance at a post-translational level. However, the underlying mechanism by which c-Myc is directly deubiquitinated is not fully understood. In this study, by screening ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) that may regulate c-Myc stability, we identified USP37 as a novel deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that stabilizes c-Myc via direct binding. The overexpression of USP37 markedly increases c-Myc abundance by blocking its degradation, whereas the depletion of USP37 promotes c-Myc degradation and reduces c-Myc levels. Further studies indicate that USP37 directly interacts with c-Myc and deubiquitinates c-Myc in a DUB activity-dependent manner. Functionally, USP37 regulates cell proliferation and the Warburg effect by regulating c-Myc levels. Clinically, USP37 is significantly upregulated in human lung cancer tissues, where its expression is positively correlated with c-Myc protein expression. Thus, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for USP37 in the regulation of c-Myc stability in lung cancer and suggest that USP37 might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2155882728,"Amyloidogenic proteins generally form intermolecularly hydrogen-bonded β-sheet aggregates, including parallel, in-register β-sheets (recognized by antiserum OC) or antiparallel β-sheets, β-solenoids, β-barrels, and β-cylindrins (recognized by antiserum A11). Although these groups share many common properties, some amyloid sequences have been reported to form polymorphic structural variants or strains. We investigated the humoral immune response to Aβ42 fibrils and produced 23 OC-type monoclonal antibodies recognizing distinct epitopes differentially associated with polymorphic structural variants. These mOC antibodies define at least 18 different immunological profiles represented in aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ). All of the antibodies strongly prefer amyloid aggregates over monomer, indicating that they recognize conformational epitopes. Most of the antibodies react with N-terminal linear segments of Aβ, although many recognize a discontinuous epitope consisting of an N-terminal domain and a central domain. Several of the antibodies that recognize linear Aβ segments also react with fibrils formed from unrelated amyloid sequences, indicating that reactivity with linear segments of Aβ does not mean the antibody is sequence-specific. The antibodies display strikingly different patterns of immunoreactivity in Alzheimer disease and transgenic mouse brain and identify spatially and temporally unique amyloid deposits. Our results indicate that the immune response to Aβ42 fibrils is diverse and reflects the structural polymorphisms in fibrillar amyloid structures. These polymorphisms may contribute to differences in toxicity and consequent effects on pathological processes. Thus, a single therapeutic monoclonal antibody may not be able to target all of the pathological aggregates necessary to make an impact on the overall disease process."
https://openalex.org/W2075458118,"Gregor Andelfinger and colleagues identify mutations in SGOL1 that cause a novel cohesinopathy characterized by chronic atrial and intestinal dysrhythmia, termed CAID syndrome. SGOL1 encodes a component of the cohesin complex, suggesting that cardiac and gut rhythm are regulated by this complex. The pacemaking activity of specialized tissues in the heart and gut results in lifelong rhythmic contractions. Here we describe a new syndrome characterized by Chronic Atrial and Intestinal Dysrhythmia, termed CAID syndrome, in 16 French Canadians and 1 Swede. We show that a single shared homozygous founder mutation in SGOL1, a component of the cohesin complex, causes CAID syndrome. Cultured dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals showed accelerated cell cycle progression, a higher rate of senescence and enhanced activation of TGF-β signaling. Karyotypes showed the typical railroad appearance of a centromeric cohesion defect. Tissues derived from affected individuals displayed pathological changes in both the enteric nervous system and smooth muscle. Morpholino-induced knockdown of sgol1 in zebrafish recapitulated the abnormalities seen in humans with CAID syndrome. Our findings identify CAID syndrome as a novel generalized dysrhythmia, suggesting a new role for SGOL1 and the cohesin complex in mediating the integrity of human cardiac and gut rhythm."

https://openalex.org/W2082174343,"Mammalian sensory circuits become refined over development in an activity-dependent manner. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons from each eye first map to their target in the geniculate and then segregate into eye-specific layers by the removal and addition of axon branches. Once segregation is complete, robust functional remodeling continues as the number of afferent inputs to each geniculate neuron decreases from many to a few. It is widely assumed that large-scale axon retraction underlies this later phase of circuit refinement. On the contrary, RGC axons remain stable during functional pruning. Instead, presynaptic boutons grow in size and cluster during this process. Moreover, they exhibit dynamic spatial reorganization in response to sensory experience. Surprisingly, axon complexity decreases only after the completion of the thalamic critical period. Therefore, dynamic bouton redistribution along a broad axon backbone represents an unappreciated form of plasticity underlying developmental wiring and rewiring in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1979629373,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) promotes cancer cell survival, migration, growth and proliferation by generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. PIP3 recruits pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins to the membrane to activate oncogenic signaling cascades. Anticancer therapeutics targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway are in clinical development. In a mass spectrometric screen to identify PIP3-regulated proteins in breast cancer cells, levels of the Rac activator PIP3-dependent Rac exchange factor-1 (P-REX1) increased in response to PI3K inhibition, and decreased upon loss of the PI3K antagonist phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). P-REX1 mRNA and protein levels were positively correlated with ER expression, and inversely correlated with PI3K pathway activation in breast tumors as assessed by gene expression and phosphoproteomic analyses. P-REX1 increased activation of Rac1, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling in a PTEN-independent manner, and promoted cell and tumor viability. Loss of P-REX1 or inhibition of Rac suppressed PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK, and decreased viability. P-REX1 also promoted insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor activation, suggesting that P-REX1 provides positive feedback to activators upstream of PI3K. In support of a model where PIP3-driven P-REX1 promotes both PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling, high levels of P-REX1 mRNA (but not phospho-AKT or a transcriptomic signature of PI3K activation) were predictive of sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors among breast cancer cell lines. P-REX1 expression was highest in estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors compared with many other cancer subtypes, suggesting that neutralizing the P-REX1/Rac axis may provide a novel therapeutic approach to selectively abrogate oncogenic signaling in breast cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2012232590,"Global change is expected to modify the frequency and magnitude of defoliating insect outbreaks in forest ecosystems. Bats are increasingly acknowledged as effective biocontrol agents for pest insect populations. However, a better understanding is required of whether and how bat communities contribute to the resilience of forests to man- and climate-driven biotic disturbances. We studied the responses of forest insectivorous bats to a major pine defoliator, the pine processionary moth pityocampa, which is currently expanding its range in response to global warming. We used pheromone traps and ultrasound bat recorders to estimate the abundance and activity of moths and predatory bats along the edge of infested pine stands. We used synthetic pheromone to evaluate the effects of experimentally increased moth availability on bat foraging activity. We also evaluated the top-down regulation of moth population by estimating T. pityocampa larval colonies abundance on the same edges the following winter. We observed a close spatio-temporal matching between emergent moths and foraging bats, with bat activity significantly increasing with moth abundance. The foraging activity of some bat species was significantly higher near pheromone lures, i.e. in areas of expected increased prey availability. Furthermore moth reproductive success significantly decreased with increasing bat activity during the flight period of adult moths. These findings suggest that bats, at least in condition of low prey density, exhibit numerical and functional responses to a specific and abundant prey, which may ultimately result in an effective top-down regulation of the population of the prey. These observations are consistent with bats being useful agents for the biocontrol of insect pest populations in plantation forests."
https://openalex.org/W2063799663,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is linked to multiple cancers, including pulmonary adenocarcinoma. However, the role of STAT3 in lung cancer pathogenesis has not been determined. Using lung epithelial-specific inducible knockout strategies, we demonstrate that STAT3 has contrasting roles in the initiation and growth of both chemically and genetically induced lung cancers. Selective deletion of lung epithelial STAT3 in mice before cancer induction by the smoke carcinogen, urethane, resulted in increased lung tissue damage and inflammation, K-Ras oncogenic mutations and tumorigenesis. Deletion of lung epithelial STAT3 after establishment of lung cancer inhibited cancer cell proliferation. Simultaneous deletion of STAT3 and expression of oncogenic K-Ras in mouse lung elevated pulmonary injury, inflammation and tumorigenesis, but reduced tumor growth. These studies indicate that STAT3 prevents lung cancer initiation by maintaining pulmonary homeostasis under oncogenic stress, whereas it facilitates lung cancer progression by promoting cancer cell growth. These studies also provide a mechanistic basis for targeting STAT3 to lung cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2143614476,"P2X7 receptors are nonselective cation channels gated by high extracellular ATP, but with sustained activation, receptor sensitization occurs, whereby the intrinsic pore dilates, making the cell permeable to large organic cations, which eventually leads to cell death. P2X7 receptors associate with cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, but it is unclear how this affects the properties of the receptor channel. Here we show that pore-forming properties of human and rodent P2X7 receptors are sensitive to perturbations of cholesterol levels. Acute depletion of cholesterol with 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) caused a substantial increase in the rate of agonist-evoked pore formation, as measured by the uptake of ethidium dye, whereas cholesterol loading inhibited this process. Patch clamp analysis of P2X7 receptor currents carried by Na(+) and N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG(+)) showed enhanced activation and current facilitation following cholesterol depletion. This contrasts with the inhibitory effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin reported for other P2X subtypes. Mutational analysis suggests the involvement of an N-terminal region and a proximal C-terminal region that comprises multiple cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) motifs, in the cholesterol sensitivity of channel gating. These results reveal cholesterol as a negative regulator of P2X7 receptor pore formation, protecting cells from P2X7-mediated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1996515325,"Objective To determine whether the presence of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and reduction of lung function parameters were predictors of mortality in a cohort. Materials/Patients and Methods Population based cohorts were followed in Montevideo, Santiago and Sao Paulo during 5, 6 and 9 years, respectively. Outcomes included all-cause, cardiovascular, respiratory and cancer mortality; exposures were COPD, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Cox regression was used for analyses. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, receiver operator characteristics curves and Youden's index were calculated. Results Main causes of death were cardiovascular, respiratory and cancer. Baseline COPD was associated with overall mortality (HR = 1.43 for FEV1/FVC<LLN; 2.01 for GOLD 2-4; 1.46 for GOLD 1-4; 1.50 for FEV1/FEV6 <LLN). For cardiovascular mortality, significant associations were found with GOLD 2-4 (HR = 2.68) and with GOLD 1-4 (HR = 1.78) for both genders together (not among women). Low FEV1 was risk for overall and respiratory mortality (both genders combined). FVC was not associated with overall mortality. For most COPD criteria sensitivity was low and specificity high. The area under the curve for FEV1 was greater than for FVC for overall and cardiovascular mortality. Answer to the Question COPD and low FEV1 are important predictors for overall and cardiovascular mortality in Latin America."
https://openalex.org/W2040774362,"Although previous studies suggest that myeloid zinc-finger 1 (MZF-1) is a multifaceted transcription factor that may function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, the molecular bases determining its different traits remain elusive. Increasing evidence suggests that disorders in iron metabolism affect tumorigenesis and tumor behaviors, and that excess tumor iron stimulates tumor progression through various mechanisms such as enhancing DNA replication and energy metabolism. Ferroportin (FPN) is the only known iron exporter in mammalian cells, and it determines global iron egress out of cells. FPN reduction leads to decreased iron efflux and increased intracellular iron that consequentially aggravates the oncogenic effects of iron. MZF-1 was recently identified as a transcription factor that regulates FPN expression. Thus far, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the MZF-1–FPN signaling in cancers are largely unknown. Here, we found a significant reduction of FPN levels in prostate tumors relative to adjacent tissues, and demonstrated a crucial role of FPN in tumor growth through controlling tumor iron concentration. Inhibition of MZF-1 expression led to reduced FPN concentration, coupled with resultant intracellular iron retention, increased iron-related cellular activities and enhanced tumor cell growth. In contrast, increase of MZF-1 expression restrained tumor cell growth by promoting FPN-driven iron egress. Importantly, we demonstrated that AP4 and c-Myb jointly modulated MZF-1 transcription, and that miR-492 was also directly involved in regulating MZF-1 concentration through binding to the 3′ untranslated regions of its mRNA. These results correlate with reduced AP4 and c-Myb expression and elevated miR-492 expression found in prostate tumors as compared with adjacent tissues that resulted in diminished MZF-1 and FPN. Moreover, we demonstrated that alterations of AP4, c-Myb and miR-492 levels significantly affected tumor cell growth. Targeting molecules within the MZF-1–FPN signaling thus appears to be a promising approach to restrain prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2087325786,"A substantial increase in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) among children exposed to the radioiodine fallout has been one of the main consequences of the Chernobyl reactor accident. Recently, the investigation of PTCs from a cohort of young patients exposed to the post-Chernobyl radioiodine fallout at very young age and a matched nonexposed control group revealed a radiation-specific DNA copy number gain on chromosomal band 7q11.23 and the radiation-associated mRNA overexpression of CLIP2. In this study, we investigated the potential role of CLIP2 as a radiation marker to be used for the individual classification of PTCs into CLIP2-positive and -negative cases—a prerequisite for the integration of CLIP2 into epidemiological modelling of the risk of radiation-induced PTC. We were able to validate the radiation-associated CLIP2 overexpression at the protein level by immunohistochemistry (IHC) followed by relative quantification using digital image analysis software (P=0.0149). Furthermore, we developed a standardized workflow for the determination of CLIP2-positive and -negative cases that combines visual CLIP2 IHC scoring and CLIP2 genomic copy number status. In addition to the discovery cohort (n=33), two independent validation cohorts of PTCs (n=115) were investigated. High sensitivity and specificity rates for all three investigated cohorts were obtained, demonstrating robustness of the developed workflow. To analyse the function of CLIP2 in radiation-associated PTC, the CLIP2 gene regulatory network was reconstructed using global mRNA expression data from PTC patient samples. The genes comprising the first neighbourhood of CLIP2 (BAG2, CHST3, KIF3C, NEURL1, PPIL3 and RGS4) suggest the involvement of CLIP2 in the fundamental carcinogenic processes including apoptosis, mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling and genomic instability. In our study, we successfully developed and independently validated a workflow for the typing of PTC clinical samples into CLIP2-positive and CLIP2-negative and provided first insights into the CLIP2 interactome in the context of radiation-associated PTC."
https://openalex.org/W2027404133,"The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that causes infections ranging from acute otitis media to life-threatening invasive disease. Pneumococci have evolved several strategies to circumvent the host immune response, in particular the complement attack. The pneumococcal glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is both secreted and bound to the bacterial surface and simultaneously binds plasminogen and its tissue plasminogen activator tPA. In the present study we demonstrate that PGK has an additional role in modulating the complement attack. PGK interacted with the membrane attack complex (MAC) components C5, C7, and C9, thereby blocking the assembly and membrane insertion of MAC resulting in significant inhibition of the hemolytic activity of human serum. Recombinant PGK interacted in a dose-dependent manner with these terminal pathway proteins, and the interactions were ionic in nature. In addition, PGK inhibited C9 polymerization both in the fluid phase and on the surface of sheep erythrocytes. Interestingly, PGK bound several MAC proteins simultaneously. Although C5 and C7 had partially overlapping binding sites on PGK, C9 did not compete with either one for PGK binding. Moreover, PGK significantly inhibited MAC deposition via both the classical and alternative pathway at the pneumococcal surface. Additionally, upon activation plasmin(ogen) bound to PGK cleaved the central complement protein C3b thereby further modifying the complement attack. In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge a novel pneumococcal inhibitor of the terminal complement cascade aiding complement evasion by this important pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1999848774,"Two recent studies (Newton-Cheh, C. et al. (2009) Common variants at ten loci influence QT interval duration in the QTGEN Study. Nat. Genet. 41, 399-406 and Pfeufer, A. et al. (2009) Common variants at ten loci modulate the QT interval duration in the QTSCD Study. Nat. Genet. 41, 407-414) identified an association, with genome-wide significance, between a single nucleotide polymorphism within the gene encoding RING finger protein 207 (RNF207) and the QT interval. We sought to determine the role of RNF207 in cardiac electrophysiology. Morpholino knockdown of RNF207 in zebrafish embryos resulted in action potential duration prolongation, occasionally a 2:1 atrioventricular block, and slowing of conduction velocity. Conversely, neonatal rabbit cardiomyocytes infected with RNF207-expressing adenovirus exhibited shortened action potential duration. Using transfections of U-2 OS and HEK293 cells, Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry data demonstrate that RNF207 and the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel interact and colocalize. Furthermore, RNF207 overexpression significantly elevated total and membrane HERG protein and HERG-encoded current density by ∼30-50%, which was dependent on the intact N-terminal RING domain of RNF207. Finally, coexpression of RNF207 and HSP70 increased HERG expression compared with HSP70 alone. This effect was dependent on the C terminus of RNF207. Taken together, the evidence is strong that RNF207 is an important regulator of action potential duration, likely via effects on HERG trafficking and localization in a heat shock protein-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1999851481,"Pathogen host shifts represent a major source of new infectious diseases. There are several examples of cross-genus host jumps that have caused catastrophic epidemics in animal and plant species worldwide. Cross-kingdom jumps are rare, and are often associated with nosocomial infections. Here we provide an example of human-mediated cross-kingdom jumping of Exserohilum rostratum isolated from a patient who had received a corticosteroid injection and died of fungal meningitis in a Florida hospital in 2012. The clinical isolate of E. rostratum was compared with two plant pathogenic isolates of E. rostratum and an isolate of the closely related genus Bipolaris in terms of morphology, phylogeny, and pathogenicity on one C3 grass, Gulf annual rye grass (Lolium multiflorum), and two C4 grasses, Japanese stilt grass (Microstegium vimineum) and bahia grass (Paspalum notatum). Colony growth and color, as well as conidia shape and size were the same for the clinical and plant isolates of E. rostratum, while these characteristics differed slightly for the Bipolaris sp. isolate. The plant pathogenic and clinical isolates of E. rostratum were indistinguishable based on morphology and ITS and 28S rDNA sequence analysis. The clinical isolate was as pathogenic to all grass species tested as the plant pathogenic strains that were originally isolated from plant hosts. The clinical isolate induced more severe symptoms on stilt grass than on rye grass, while this was the reverse for the plant isolates of E. rostratum. The phylogenetic similarity between the clinical and plant-associated E. rostratum isolates and the ability of the clinical isolate to infect plants suggests that a plant pathogenic strain of E. rostratum contaminated the corticosteroid injection fluid and was able to cause systemic disease in the affected patient. This is the first proof that a clinical isolate of E. rostratum is also an effective plant pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2045138020,"Cellular transformation is associated with altered glutamine (Gln) metabolism. Tumor cells utilize Gln in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to maintain sufficient pools of biosynthetic precursors to support rapid growth and proliferation. However, Gln metabolism also generates NADPH, and Gln-derived glutamate is used for synthesis of glutathione (GSH). As both NADPH and GSH are antioxidants, Gln may also contribute to redox balance in transformed cells. The Hace1 E3 ligase is a tumor suppressor inactivated in diverse human cancers. Hace1 targets the Rac1 GTPase for degradation at Rac1-dependent NADPH oxidase complexes, blocking superoxide generation by the latter. Consequently, loss of Hace1 increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in vitro and in vivo. Given the link between Hace1 loss and increased ROS, we investigated whether genetic inactivation of Hace1 alters Gln metabolism. We demonstrate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Hace1−/− mice are highly sensitive to Gln withdrawal, leading to enhanced cell death compared with wild-type (wt) MEFs, and Gln depletion or chemical inhibition of Gln uptake blocks soft agar colony formation by Hace1−/− MEFs. Hace1−/− MEFs exhibit increased Gln uptake and ammonia secretion, and metabolic labeling using 13C-Gln revealed that Hace1 loss increases incorporation of Gln carbons into the TCA cycle intermediates. Gln starvation markedly increases ROS levels in Hace1−/− but not in wt MEFs, and treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine or the TCA cycle intermediate oxaloacetate efficiently rescues Gln starvation-induced ROS elevation and cell death in Hace1−/− MEFs. Finally, Gln starvation increases superoxide levels in Hace1−/− MEFs, and NADPH oxidase inhibitors block the induction of superoxide and cell death by Gln starvation. Together, these results suggest that increased ROS production due to Hace1 loss leads to Gln addiction as a mechanism to cope with increased ROS-induced oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2047932287,"Breast cancer resistance to endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors is a significant clinical problem. Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), a coregulatory protein of the oestrogen receptor (ER), has previously been shown to have a significant role in the progression of breast cancer. The chromatin protein high mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) was identified as an SRC-1 interacting protein in the endocrine-resistant setting. We investigated the expression of HMGB2 in a cohort of 1068 breast cancer patients and found an association with increased disease-free survival time in patients treated with endocrine therapy. However, it was also verified that HMGB2 expression could be switched on in endocrine-resistant tumours from breast cancer patients. To explore the function of this poorly characterized protein, we performed HMGB2 ChIPseq and found distinct binding patterns between the two contexts. In the resistant setting, the HMGB2, SRC-1 and ER complex are enriched at promoter regions of target genes, with bioinformatic analysis indicating a switch in binding partners between the sensitive and resistant phenotypes. Integration of binding and gene expression data reveals a concise set of target genes of this complex including the RNA helicase DDX18. Modulation of DDX18 directly affects growth of tamoxifen-resistant cells, suggesting that it may be a critical downstream effector of the HMGB2:ER complex. This study defines HMGB2 interactions with the ER complex at specific target genes in the tamoxifen-resistant setting."

Like psoriasis, sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder with Th1/Th17-driven inflammation. Therefore, we investigated the risk of sarcoidosis in patients with psoriasis compared to the background population in a nationwide cohort.The study included the entire Danish population aged ≥10 years followed from 1st January 1997 until diagnosis of sarcoidosis, death or 31st December 2011. Patients with a history of psoriasis and/or sarcoidosis at baseline were excluded. Information on comorbidity and concomitant medication was identified by individual-level linkage of administrative registers. Incidence rates of sarcoidosis were calculated and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity, medications and socioeconomic status.A total of 6,043,518 subjects were eligible for analysis. In the study period 70,125 patients with new-onset psoriasis, including 11,834 patients with severe psoriasis, were identified. The overall incidence rates of sarcoidosis were 1.18, 2.22, and 4.06 per 10,000 person-years for the reference population (9,717 cases), mild psoriasis (78 cases) and severe psoriasis (22 cases), respectively. Compared to the reference population, the age- and gender-adjusted HRs for sarcoidosis were increased in patients with psoriasis with HR 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.87) and HR 2.51 (CI 1.64-3.85) for those with mild and severe disease, respectively.In this nationwide cohort, psoriasis was associated with a disease severity-dependent increased risk of sarcoidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2049380489,"Purpose To examine whether GNAQ and GNA11 somatic mutations previously identified in uveal melanomas of Caucasians are associated with uveal melanomas in Chinese patients. Methods Uveal melanomas treated by primary enucleation in Chinese patients underwent a mutation analysis of GNAQ and GNA11 with sequencing of exon 5 and exon 4. Results The study included 50 patients with uveal melanoma and with a mean age of 47.6±13.0 years. During the follow-up of at least 3 years, 20 (40%) patients developed extraocular metastases. The frequencies of GNAQ and GNA11 somatic mutations in uveal melanoma were 18% (9/50) and 20% (10/50), respectively. The mutations occurred exclusively in codon 209 of exon 5. No mutations were detected in exon 4. Mutations affecting codon 209 in GNAQ were c.626A>C(Q209P) (78%) and c.626A>T(Q209L) (22%). Mutations affecting codon 209 in GNA11 were exclusively c.626A>T(Q209L) (100%). In none of the tumors, mutations of BRAF and NRAS were detected. GNAQ/11 mutations were marginally (P = 0.045) associated with optic disc involvement. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, metastasis-free survival was not significantly (P = 0.94) associated with GNAQ/11 mutations. Conclusions Mutations of GNAQ and GNA11 can be found in Chinese patients as in Caucasian patients with uveal melanoma, with a higher frequency reported for Caucasian patients."
https://openalex.org/W2028328350,"There have been increasing concerns about the challenge of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to climate change, especially in developing countries including China. Health professionals play a significant role in the battle to control and prevent infectious diseases. This study therefore aims to investigate the perceptions and attitudes of health professionals at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in different levels in China, and to consider adaptation measures to deal with the challenge of climate change. In 2013, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was undertaken among 314 staff in CDCs in Shanxi Province, China, whose routine work involves disease control and prevention. Data were analyzed using descriptive methods and logistic regression. A majority of the CDC staff were aware of the health risks from climate change, especially its impacts on infectious disease transmission in their jurisdictions, and believed climate change might bring about both temporal and spatial change in transmission patterns. It was thought that adaptation measures should be established including: strengthening/improving currently existing disease surveillance systems and vector monitoring; building CDC capacity in terms of infrastructure and in-house health professional training; development and refinement of relevant legislation, policies and guidelines; better coordination among various government departments; the involvement of the community in infectious disease interventions; and collaborative research with other institutions. This study provides a snapshot of the understanding of CDC staff regarding climate change risks relevant to infectious diseases and adaptation in China. Results may help inform future efforts to develop adaptation measures to minimize infectious disease risks due to climate change."

A unique feature of Eph signaling is that the ligands, ephrins, are membrane bound and that signaling preferentially occurs at cell-cell contacts. The Eph-ephrin interaction generates a bidirectional signal both into the Eph-expressing cell through receptor autophosphorylation as well into the ephrin-expressing cell. Ephs and ephrins are divided into A and B classes on the basis of receptor-ligand affinities, where five EphB receptors (EphB1–4, EphB6) bind three B-class transmembrane ephrins (ephrin-B1–3), whereas nine EphA receptors (EphA1–8, EphA10) bind five GPI-anchored ephrin-A ligands (ephrin-A1–5). Interactions between Ephs and ephrins typically occur in large multimeric clusters assembled at the cell surface, where the relative abundances of receptors and ligands determine the outcome of the interaction (1Janes P.W. Nievergall E. Lackmann M. Concepts and consequences of Eph receptor clustering.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 23: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).

In this article we addressed the involvement of RTKs in TF/FVIIa signaling, and guided by antibody-based RTK signaling arrays we identified Eph receptors as new targets of TF/FVIIa proteolytic activity. We report that EphB2 and EphA2 were cleaved near the N terminus in response to FVIIa, and the cleavage site was identified by N-terminal Edman sequencing and LC-MS/MS analysis to occur after a conserved arginine residue in the ligand-binding domain.

Total cell lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells were subjected to deglycosylation by N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 0.4% SDS was added to 10 μg of protein, and samples were boiled to denature proteins. 2 Units of N-glycosidase F and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 were added and samples were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C and analyzed by Western blot. The in situ PLA assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, using reagents supplied by the manufacturer (Olink Bioscience). In brief, MDA-MB-231 cells and U251 cells were cultured on chamber slides, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Slides were then blocked and incubated with primary antibodies toward TF (10H10, 1:200) and EphB2 (N terminus, 1:200). TF and EphB2 antibodies in close proximity were visualized with secondary antibodies connected to oligos that served as templates for rolling circle amplification. The rolling circle amplification products were hybridized to fluorescently labeled probes and cells were then counterstained with DAPI and images captured at ×40 with a fluorescence microscope. The PLA signals were quantified using the Duolink image tool (Olink Bioscience). EphA2 was purified by immunoprecipitation from FVIIa-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot.

The proteins were digested either by trypsin (Roche Applied Science) or chymotrypsin (Wako Chemicals USA) at 12.5 ng/μl overnight. The peptides were extracted by sonication in 60% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid. Finally, the samples were dried in a SpeedVac system (Eppendorf, Concentrator Plus) and resolved in 0.1% formic acid. The enzymatic peptides were separated in reversed phase on a 10-cm long C18-A2 column, inner diameter 75 μm (Thermo Scientific), using mobile phase A = 0.1% formic acid and B = 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile. The gradient used was 4–50% B in 60 min. The peptides were electrosprayed on-line to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro ETD mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Tandem mass spectrometry was performed applying collision-induced dissociation. Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific) was applied to compare detected peptides to in silico digested protein sequences of EphA2 obtained from Swiss-Prot. For tryptic and chymotryptic peptides, 2 and 6 missed cleavage sites were allowed, respectively. Fluoroblok Transwell inserts in 24-well format with 8-μm pore size were purchased from BD Biosciences. Both sides of the inserts were coated with 10 μg/ml of collagen IV in PBS at 4 °C overnight. MDA-MB-231 cells (50,000 per well) in basal RPMI medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA were added to the inserts and cells were allowed to migrate for 5 h at 37 °C. The inserts were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 5 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Merck Millipore) to visualize cell nuclei. Images of the undersides of the inserts from 3 randomly selected fields per well were generated using an Axiovert 40 CFL inverted fluorescence microscope using a ×20/0.30 objective and Axiovision 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss). Cells that had migrated through the membrane were counted with the Cell Profiler image analysis software, with settings that excluded cells within pores. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with scrambled or EphB2 siRNA (catalog number S102224789, Qiagen) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were re-transfected after 48 h and subjected to the Transwell cell migration assay 72 h after the initial transfection. A fraction of the cells were lysed and analyzed for EphB2 protein expression by Western blot. Results were tested for statistical significance by the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. p values equal to or below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results are expressed as means with error bars indicating the S.D. To generate a global view of RTK activity downstream of TF/FVIIa signaling we used antibody-based array analysis to examine expression of phosphorylated RTKs in MDA-MB-231 cells and primary human fibroblasts. In both cell types, we observed that FVIIa stimulation reduced the phosphotyrosine signal compared with untreated cells for members of the EphB RTK family, with the largest effects seen for EphB1 (53.2 ± 1.9% of control in MDA cells, 54.9 ± 1.5% in fibroblasts) and EphB3 (66.5 ± 3.0% in MDA cells, 62.8 ± 0.4% in fibroblasts), whereas the EphB4 signal was mildly decreased (83.2 ± 9.6 in MDA cells, 77.8 ± 31.4% in fibroblasts), implying a change in Eph RTK activity induced by FVIIa (Table 1). Of the three receptors of the EphA subfamily present on the array, the EphA2 signal was similarly reduced by FVIIa (74.2 ± 1.2% in MDA cells, 60.0 ± 14.1% in fibroblasts), whereas the EphA1 and EphA3 values were either unaffected or slightly reduced by FVIIa. Stimulation with a PAR2-agonist peptide (PAR2-AP) did not result in any consistent changes in the Eph phosphotyrosine signal except for a slight reduction in EphA1 values, indicating that FVIIa alters Eph activity independently of PAR2. The array results prompted us to further investigate how TF/FVIIa might regulate the function and expression of Eph receptors, and we used MDA-MB-231 cells to study expression levels of a selected number of Eph receptors based on the antibody array screening. Cells were stimulated with FVIIa for different time points, and expression levels of EphB2, EphB3, EphB4, and EphA2 were analyzed by Western blot. Unfortunately EphB1 had to be excluded from further analysis because we could not find a specific antibody. Instead, the other EphB family member EphB2 was included for further studies. Western blotting experiments revealed that stimulation with 10 nm FVIIa markedly reduced the expression of full-length EphB2 and lead to the rapid appearance of a reduced molecular mass isoform of EphB2, migrating around 110 kDa compared with 125 kDa for full-length EphB2 (Fig. 1A). A short EphA2 isoform of similar size as short EphB2 was readily detected after 1 and 6 h, whereas a weak EphB4 band of reduced size was seen on high exposure blots after 6 h but not 1 h. No additional EphB3 isoforms were detected after FVIIa stimulation. Time and concentration curves revealed that the short EphB2 isoform was formed within 10 min of exposure to 10 nm FVIIa, and was detectable after 6 h treatment with a subnanomolar concentration of FVIIa (Fig. 1B). The short EphA2 isoform was evident on high exposure Western blots after 30 min of FVIIa stimulation, but concentration curves revealed that higher concentrations (5 nm) were needed than for EphB2, and only a fraction of the total receptor population migrated at the reduced molecular weight even after prolonged FVIIa stimulation. These results indicated that FVIIa was very potent in generating the short EphB2 isoform, but because MDA-MB-231 cells express very high levels of TF we also sought to verify these results in cells with physiological TF levels. We could detect the short EphB2 isoform following FVIIa stimulation in both primary human fibroblasts (Fig. 1C) and U251 glioblastoma cells (Fig. 1D), both of which express roughly 10 times less TF compared with MDA-MB-231 cells as measured by flow cytometry (data not shown). 0.5 nm FVIIa produced detectable levels of the short isoform in both cell types, and saturation seemed to be reached around 1 nm FVIIa. We next performed a series of experiments in MDA-MB-231 cells to further characterize the short EphB2 isoform induced by FVIIa. We observed that it was insensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or inhibitors of intracellular degradation, and Western blots of deglycosylated samples showed that both full-length and short EphB2 exhibited a shift in gel motility (Fig. 2, A–C). These results indicated a change in the primary structure of EphB2 and a proteolytical cleavage at the cell surface as the mechanism behind the gel shift. We next aimed to detect the cleaved EphB2 fragment in cell culture supernatants, and because the EphB2 antibody was of polyclonal origin and directed toward the entire extracellular domain a fraction of the antiserum could possibly react with the released peptide. Indeed, Western blot on supernatants from MDA-MB-231 cells revealed that the antibody reacted with a fragment migrating at 15 kDa in the supernatant from FVIIa-treated cells, which corresponded well in size with the reduction in molecular weight of the short isoform and was absent in control supernatants (Fig. 2D). An EphB2 antibody toward an epitope in the intracellular domain detected both cell-bound isoforms, but did not react with the N-terminal fragment in the supernatant. Taken together, these results demonstrate that EphB2 is cleaved near the N terminus in response to FVIIa. We continued by investigating the mechanisms by which FVIIa causes EphB2 cleavage, and to verify the specificity and TF dependence of our findings we used three previously characterized clones of TF-blocking antibodies (20Morrissey J.H. Fair D.S. Edgington T.S. Monoclonal antibody analysis of purified and cell-associated tissue factor.Thromb. Res. 1988; 52: 247-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Ruf W. Edgington T.S. An anti-tissue factor monoclonal antibody which inhibits TF·VIIa complex is a potent anticoagulant in plasma.Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 66: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and active site inhibited FVII (FFR-FVII). Although mAbs 5G9 and 5B7 blocked the effects of FVIIa (Fig. 3A), mAb10H10, which selectively blocks PAR2 activation by TF/FVIIa (22Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Kerver M. Chen V.M. Mueller B.M. Hogg P.J. Ruf W. Disulfide isomerization switches tissue factor from coagulation to cell signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13932-13937Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), did not prevent EphB2 cleavage. Furthermore, blocking experiments with FFR-FVII corroborated a specific mechanism and demonstrated the requirement for FVIIa proteolytic activity (Fig. 3B). The prototypic TF/FVIIa signaling mechanism is PAR2 activation, but in agreement with the inability of mAb10H10 to interfere with EphB2 cleavage, experiments with a blocking antibody that binds to the cleavage site in PAR2 demonstrated that PAR2 is not mediating this effect of FVIIa (Fig. 3C). We also verified our mAb10H10 batch and found that it effectively prevented FVIIa-induced IL8 mRNA as previously reported (data not shown). We instead reasoned that either EphB2 was cleaved directly by TF/FVIIa or by downstream coagulation proteases generated by TF/FVIIa. However, neither the ternary TF/FVIIa/FXa complex, active thrombin, nor agonists to the PAR1/2 receptors that coagulation proteases act upon induced EphB2 cleavage (Fig. 3, D and E), demonstrating that EphB2 cleavage is uncoupled from TF/FVIIa procoagulant activity. Last, although no such mechanism is known, we also considered it a theoretical possibility that FVIIa activated a second unknown protease, which in turn cleaved EphB2. We screened through a set of broad-spectrum protease inhibitors and solely leupeptin, an inhibitor of serine and cysteine proteases and to a lesser extent aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor reported to have low activity toward FVIIa (23Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Alteration of the substrate and inhibitor specificities of blood coagulation factor VIIa: importance of amino acid residue K192.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8701-8707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), reduced EphB2 cleavage (Fig. 3F). Concentration curves with leupeptin showed that FVIIa-induced ERK phosphorylation, known to occur through PAR2 cleavage (12Versteeg H.H. Schaffner F. Kerver M. Petersen H.H. Ahamed J. Felding-Habermann B. Takada Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Inhibition of tissue factor signaling suppresses tumor growth.Blood. 2008; 111: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) was dose dependently inhibited by leupeptin at the same concentrations as EphB2 cleavage suggesting that leupeptin acted directly on FVIIa (Fig. 3F). In further support of a direct cleavage we found that TF and EphB2 co-localized constitutively in MDA-MB-231 cells by the in situ proximity ligation method (24Söderberg O. Leuchowius K.-J. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Weibrecht I. Larsson L.-G. Landegren U. Characterizing proteins and their interactions in cells and tissues using the in situ proximity ligation assay.Methods. 2008; 45: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3G). The number of detectable TF-EphB2 complexes in U251 cells was considerably lower, in agreement with a reduced level of EphB2 cleavage and a slower onset. Altogether, these results clearly indicate that cleavage occurs directly by TF/FVIIa. To identify the cleavage site we used N-terminal Edman sequencing and LC-MS/MS analysis, and because MDA-MB-231 cells express moderate levels of EphB2 but high levels of EphA2, the short EphA2 isoform was used for these analyses. N-terminal sequencing of cleaved EphA2 determined the amino acid sequence of residues 2–5 to be VKLN, whereas the most N-terminal residue could not be determined and Ser, Gly, His, Arg, or Met were compatible with the sequencing data. Of these possible amino acid sequences, 160HVKLN165 mapped to the ligand-binding domain of EphA2 and was preceded by an arginine residue, indicating a cleavage site at the Arg159-His160 bond (Fig. 4A). The results were verified by LC-MS/MS analysis, which confirmed that cleaved EphA2 was N terminally truncated. Upon analysis of the chymotryptic digest of cleaved EphA2 two peptides containing the non-chymotryptic 160HVKLN165 end were detected (HVKLNVEERSVGPL and HVKLNVEERSVGPLTRKGF). These peptides were evidence of a unique N terminus and confirmed the N terminus determined by Edman sequencing. In addition, LC-MS/MS analysis revealed the presence of at least one additional truncated EphA2 variant as peptides mapping N terminally to the Arg159-His160 cleavage site were detected. The most N-terminal detected peptides were a chymotryptic peptide starting at tyrosine 123 and a tryptic peptide starting at leucine 138. Although we fail"

Although heterochromatin is thought to be largely non-coding, it is clear that it plays an important role in chromosome structure and gene regulation. Despite a growing awareness of its functional significance, the repetitive sequences underlying some heterochromatin remain relatively uncharacterized. We have developed a real-time quantitative PCR-based method for quantifying simple repetitive satellite sequences and have used this technique to characterize the heterochromatic Y chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. In this report, we validate the approach, identify previously unknown satellite sequence copy number polymorphisms in Y chromosomes from different geographic sources, and show that a defect in heterochromatin formation can induce similar copy number polymorphisms in a laboratory strain. These findings provide a simple method to investigate the dynamic nature of repetitive sequences and characterize conditions which might give rise to long-lasting alterations in DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2010877707,"Differentiation of preadipocyte, also called adipogenesis, leads to the phenotype of mature adipocyte. Excessive adipogenesis, however, is largely linked to the development of obesity. Herein we investigated a library of 53 novel chemicals, generated from a number of polyphenolic natural compounds, on adipogenesis. Strikingly, among the chemicals tested, KMU-3, a derivative of gallic acid, strongly suppressed lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. On mechanistic levels, KMU-3 inhibited expressions of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBP-α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) during adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, KMU-3 reduced expressions of adipokines, including retinol binding protein-4 (RBP-4), leptin, and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) during adipocyte differentiation. Of further note, KMU-3 rapidly blocked the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) during the early stage of adipogenesis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition studies revealed that AG490, a JAK-2/STAT-3 inhibitor suppressed adipogenesis and STAT-3 phosphorylation, implying that early blockage of STAT-3 activity is crucial for the KMU-3-mediated anti-adipogenesis. These findings demonstrate firstly that KMU-3 inhibits adipogenesis by down-regulating STAT-3, PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, and FAS. This work shows that KMU-3 is an inhibitor of adipogenesis and thus may have therapeutic potential against obesity."

Dietary factors, genetic polymorphisms, and the combination of both may influence circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 serum concentrations. Methods From September 2011 to July 2012, we collected demographic, reproductive and dietary data on 143 women (≥40 years). We genotyped IGF-1 rs1520220 and IGFBP-3 rs2854744 and measured circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels in serum. Covariance analyses were used to estimate the associations of serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, and the molar ratio of IGF-1to IGFBP-3 with IGF-1 rs1520220 and IGFBP-3 rs2854744 genotypes. We subsequently assessed the combined influence of genetics and diet (daily intake of protein, fat and soy isoflavones) on IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels. Results Among women aged less than 50 years, circulating IGF-1 serum levels were significantly lower for those with CC genotype for IGF-1 rs1520220 than levels for those with the GC or GG genotypes (in recessive model: P = 0.007).In gene-diet analyses among these women, we found carrying CC genotype for IGF-1 rs1520220 and high soy isoflavone intake tend to be associated with lower circulating IGF-1 levels synthetically (P = 0.002). Women with GG or GC genotypes for IGF-1 rs1520220 and with low intake of soy isoflavones had the highest levels of circulating IGF-1 (geometric mean [95% CI]: 195 [37, 1021] µg/L). Comparatively, women with both the CC genotype and high soy intake had the lowest levels of circulating IGF-1 (geometric mean [95% CI]: 120 [38,378] µg/L). Conclusions IGF-1 serum levels are significantly lower among women with the CC genotype for IGF-1-rs1520220. High soy isoflavone intake may interact with carrying CC genotype for IGF-1-rs1520220 to lower women's serum IGF-1 levels more."
https://openalex.org/W1970659269,"The abilities to predict future rewards and assess the value of reward delivery are crucial aspects of adaptive behavior. While the mesolimbic system, including dopaminergic midbrain, ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex have long been associated with reward processing, recent studies also indicate a prominent role of early visual brain regions. However, the precise underlying neural mechanisms still remain unclear. To address this issue, we presented participants with visual cues predicting rewards of high and low magnitudes and probability (2×2 factorial design), while neural activity was scanned using magnetoencephalography. Importantly, one group of participants received 150 mg of the dopamine precursor levodopa prior to the experiment, while another group received a placebo. For the placebo group, neural signals of reward probability (but not magnitude) emerged at ∼100 ms after cue presentation at occipital sensors in the event-related magnetic fields. Importantly, these probability signals were absent in the levodopa group indicating a close link. Moreover, levodopa administration reduced oscillatory power in the high (20–30 Hz) and low (13–20 Hz) beta band during both reward anticipation and delivery. Taken together, our findings indicate that visual brain regions are involved in coding prospective reward probability but not magnitude and that these effects are modulated by dopamine."

Numerous lines of evidence suggest that amyloid-β (Aβ), a neurotoxic peptide, initiates a cascade that results in synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and eventually cognitive deficits. Aβ is generated by the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and alterations to this processing can result in Alzheimer disease. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we identified cyclopamine as a novel regulator of γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP. We demonstrate that cyclopamine decreases Aβ generation by altering APP retrograde trafficking. Specifically, cyclopamine treatment reduced APP-C-terminal fragment (CTF) delivery to the trans-Golgi network where γ-secretase cleavage occurs. Instead, cyclopamine redirects APP-CTFs to the lysosome. These data demonstrate that cyclopamine treatment decreases γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP. In addition, cyclopamine treatment decreases the rate of APP-CTF degradation. Together, our data demonstrate that cyclopamine alters APP processing and Aβ generation by inducing changes in APP subcellular trafficking and APP-CTF degradation.

In this study, we developed a semi-nested-PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) strategy to determine the presence and genotypic diversity of myxobacteria in soil. After two rounds of PCR with myxobacteria-specific primers, an 194 bp fragment of mglA, a key gene involved in gliding motility, suitable for DGGE was obtained. A large number of bands were observed in DGGE patterns, indicating diverse myxobacteria inhabiting in soils. Furthermore, sequencing and BLAST revealed that most of the bands belonged to the myxobacteria-group, and only three of the twenty-eight bands belonged to other group, i.e., Deinococcus maricopensis. The results verified that myxobacterial strains with discrepant sequence compositions of gene mglA could be discriminated by DGGE with myxobacteria-specific primers. Collectively, the developed semi-nested-PCR-DGGE strategy is a useful tool for studying the diversity of myxobacteria."

Upon clearing away redundant complementary ssDNA and possibly mismatched double strand DNA by using S1 nuclease, the fluorescent signal-to-noise ratio could be increased dramatically. It enabled the method to be adaptable to three different types of DNA fluorescent dyes and the ability to detect target ssDNA in complex, multicomponent samples, like tissue homogenate. The method can distinguish a two-base mismatch from avian influenza A (H1N1) virus. Also, it can detect the appearance of 50 pM target ssDNA in 0.5 µg · mL(-1) Lambda DNA, and 50 nM target ssDNA in 5 µg · mL(-1) Lambda DNA or in tissue homogenate.

https://openalex.org/W1964450560,"The serotonergic synapse is dynamically regulated by serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) with elevated levels leading to the down-regulation of the serotonin transporter and a variety of 5-HT receptors, including the 5-HT type-3 (5-HT3) receptors. We report that recombinantly expressed 5-HT3 receptor binding sites are reduced by chronic exposure to 5-HT (IC50 of 154.0 ± 45.7 µm, t½ = 28.6 min). This is confirmed for 5-HT3 receptor-induced contractions in the guinea pig ileum, which are down-regulated after chronic, but not acute, exposure to 5-HT.

As discussed, elevated levels of 5-HT may alter serotonergic signaling by disrupting the function or inducing the internalization of many components of serotonergic neurotransmission. A number of pathophysiological disorders are characterized by elevated 5-HT levels, such as diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, chemo/radiotherapy, coronary artery disease (25.Vikenes K. Farstad M. Nordrehaug J.E. Serotonin is associated with coronary artery disease and cardiac events.Circulation. 1999; 100: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and complex regional pain syndrome (26.Wesseldijk F. Fekkes D. Huygen F.J. Bogaerts-Taal E. Zijlstra F.J. Increased plasma serotonin in complex regional pain syndrome type 1.Anesth. Analg. 2008; 106: 1862-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similarly, the therapeutic use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or a Western-style high fat/calorie diet are also characterized by elevated 5-HT (27.Bertrand R.L. Senadheera S. Markus I.

A Western diet increases serotonin availability in rat small intestine.Endocrinology. 2011; 152: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We, therefore, sought to characterize how 5-HT3 receptors are regulated by chronic exposure to 5-HT. In keeping with the previous studies (17.Freeman S.L. Glatzle J. Robin C.S. Valdellon M.

Lett. 2012; 522: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we find that the chronic exposure to high concentrations of 5-HT decreases the number of available 5-HT3 receptor binding sites without altering surface receptor levels and is not blocked by inhibitors of endocytosis, indicating that receptor internalization is not required for agonist-induced down-regulation as observed for antagonist-induced down-regulation (22.Hothersall J.D.

The 5-HT-induced down-regulation is potentiated (67-fold) by SERT, highlighting a role for the intracellular transport of 5-HT. Sequestered 5-HT is released slowly from both COS-7 cells and guinea pig ileum. In support of a role for the slow 5-HT release, the resensitization of 5-HT3 receptor-mediated contractions in the intact guinea pig ileum is inhibited by low (5 µm) 5-HT. 5-Hydroxytryptamine hydrochloride (5-HT, serotonin), nystatin, dynasore hydrate, brefeldin A, filipin, TX-114, digitonin anti-HA/myc antibodies (Sigma), 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine hydrochloride (Tocris, Bristol, UK), [3H]BRL-43964 ([3H]granisetron), and 5-[3H]HT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell culture reagents, Amplex UltraRed, and Alexa Fluor 488/568 conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen). Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare). Simian COS-7 cells (ACC CRL 1651) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Exponentially growing cells were transfected by electroporation (400 V, ∞Ω, 125 microfarads; Bio-Rad Gene Electropulser II). 10 µg of DNA was used per transfection (2 × 106 cells). Cells were analyzed 24–48 h after transfection. Human 5-HT3A-myc was expressed from the mammalian expression vector PRK5JD (28.Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Robertson L.A. Vardy A. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Assembly and cell surface expression of homomeric and heteromeric 5-HT3 receptors: the role of oligomerization and chaperone proteins.Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Human SERT in pcDNA3.1 was a kind gift from Beate Niesler (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany) and subcloned into PRK5JD. [3H]Granisetron (specific binding = 83.1 Ci/mmol) binding was performed on intact COS-7 cells cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates. These methods selectively measure cell surface 5-HT3 receptor binding sites (22.Hothersall J.D. Moffat C. Connolly C.N. Prolonged inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors by palonosetron results from surface receptor inhibition rather than inducing receptor internalization.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 169: 1252-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mock-transfected cells were used to determine the background. Cells were incubated in serum-free media (Opti-MEM) ± test drugs for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with warm binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated in binding buffer at 37 °C for 10 min to remove excess drug. Cells were washed with ice-cold binding buffer and incubated in 3 nm [3H]granisetron (in binding buffer) for 120 min on ice. Excess radioligand was removed by washing with ice-cold binding buffer. Receptor-bound radioligand was then eluted by the addition of acidic saline (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.5) for 30 min, added to scintillation mixture, and counted. Background (mock) binding was subtracted, and specific binding was expressed as a percentage of untreated cells. Methods were as previously described (22.Hothersall J.D. Moffat C. Connolly C.N. Prolonged inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors by palonosetron results from surface receptor inhibition rather than inducing receptor internalization.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 169: 1252-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates. Cells were incubated in Opti-MEM ± 5-HT at the indicated concentrations for 60 min at 37 °C. All subsequent solutions were made in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2PO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) unless stated otherwise. After experimental treatment, cells were fixed in ice-cold 3% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min and then washed with PBS. To reduce background signal, cells were incubated in 0.1 m glycine for 60 min, washed, and then incubated in 3% H2O2 (to quench endogenous peroxidase activity) for 5 min, washed again, and then blocked for 60 min (5% FBS and 1% BSA in PBS). Primary antibody (anti-HA; 12CA5) was incubated for 60 min and then washed 3 times with block. Secondary antibody (sheep anti-mouse HRP) diluted to 400 µg/ml in block) was incubated for 60 min and subsequently washed 3 times in PBS. Cells were then incubated with Amplex UltraRed (3 µm) and H2O2 (740 µm) for 60 min in the dark, and the plate was read at excitation/emission wavelengths of 530/590 nm. Background (mock) values were subtracted, and surface expression levels were presented as percentage of untreated cells. COS7 cells were prelabeled with mouse anti-HA antibodies (Sigma) (60 min, on ice), washed, and incubated in the absence or presence of 5-HT (300 µm) for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) and washed twice in 50 mm NH4Cl (in PBS) and blocked (10% FBS, 0.5% BSA in PBS) for 30 min. Subsequent washes and antibody dilutions were performed in PBS containing 10% FBS and 0.5% BSA. Surface receptors were detected using anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). Cells were then permeabilized by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 (10 min), and the immunofluorescence protocol was repeated from the NH4Cl step using anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 to detect internalized receptors. Cells were examined using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera mounted on a DM-IRB inverted microscope using Volocity software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). COS-7 cells transfected with human SERT or mock-transfected cells were grown on 24-well plates. Cells were washed with uptake buffer (10 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 100 µm ascorbic acid, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) then incubated with 5-[3H]HT (as indicted) for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold buffer, solubilized with 1% TX-100, then added to scintillation mixture and counted. Transfected COS-7 cells were grown in 24-well plates. Cells were incubated with Opti-MEM containing 10 µm 5-HT (1:10 ratio 5-[3H]HT:cold 5-HT) for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed (3 times) to remove surface receptor-bound 5-HT. Cells were then solubilized with 1% TX-114 (5 min on ice). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), the post-nuclear supernatant was warmed (5 min, 37 °C) to precipitate the detergent fraction-containing membranes and centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 5 min, 20 °C), and the soluble fraction (cytosol) was removed and counted in scintillation fluid. The membrane fraction was washed (1% TX-114) on ice to re-solubilize the detergent/membrane fraction. This process was repeated twice to wash the membrane fraction before being counted. All intermediate washes (soluble fraction) were pooled and counted. Background counts (scintillation fluid only) were subtracted. Transfected COS-7 cells were grown in 24-well plates. Cells were incubated with Opti-MEM containing 10 µm 5-HT (1:10 ratio 5-[3H]HT:cold 5-HT) for 60 min at 37 °C. To remove surface receptor-bound 5-HT, cells were washed with warm binding buffer and then once with ice-cold buffer. Cells were incubated with 100 µg/ml digitonin (diluted in binding buffer) for 5 min, and the buffer was removed to count 5-[3H]HT associated with the cytoplasmic (released) contents. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer (and each wash counted) and then solubilized with 1% TX-100 to count radioactivity remaining within the cells. Male or female Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (500–1000 g) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The ileum was removed, and sections of tissue 15–25 mm in length were suspended in organ baths containing 10 ml of air-bubbled Tyrode buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 28 mm glucose, pH 7.4) maintained at 37 °C. Isotonic responses were measured using a force transducer, and a resting tension of 1 g was applied. Responses to a maximal concentration (50 µm) of the 5-HT3 receptor agonist, 2-methyl 5-hydroxytrypamine (2-ME) were measured to determine the basal 5HT3-mediated contraction of each tissue. Before receptor desensitization, tissue was washed and allowed to recover (10 min, to ensure receptor resensitization) before further stimulation. For chronic exposure, 100 µm 5-HT was applied for 60 min and washed out (10 min), and subsequent 2-ME responses were measured. To determine the specificity of the responses, contractions evoked by acetylcholine (ACh) (1 µm) were monitored. In acute 5-HT exposure experiments, guinea pig ileum tissue was exposed to 100 µm 5-HT until receptors desensitized (contractile response returned to base line) before recover experiments. Recovery after 10 min (±5 µm 5-HT) was tested using 2-ME (50 µm). All drugs (apart from the experimental chronic 5HT treatment) were washed out immediately after peak responses were observed. The peak response to each drug addition was expressed as a percentage of the peak response at the beginning of the experiment. Cos-7 cells were plated onto polylysine-coated 96-well plates and grown for 24–48 h. Cells were treated with 100 µl of 300 µm 5-HT (0.1% 5-[3H]HT, specific activity = 27.7 Ci/mmol) for 1 h at 37 °C in Opti-MEM and washed twice with 100 µl of warm Opti-MEM and left at 37 °C for the times indicated. Samples (100 µl) were placed into a scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was counted. Segments of adult guinea pig ileum were treated with 100 µm 5-HT (0.1% 5-[3H]HT) for 1 h in air-bubbled Tyrode buffer. After treatment segments were briefly washed and stored in Tyrode buffer (1.5 ml) for the indicated times, and samples (100 µl) were placed into a scintillation mixture for counting. The effect of chronic exposure of 5-HT3 receptors to 5-HT was investigated in COS-7 cells expressing human 5-HT3A receptors. Cells were incubated with 5-HT (300 µm, 60 min, 37 °C, followed by 10 min washout), and the remaining 5-HT3 receptor binding sites were quantified by [3H]granisetron binding (3 nm, 120 min, 4 °C). Under these experimental conditions we measured only cell surface receptor binding sites (22.Hothersall J.D. Moffat C. Connolly C.N. Prolonged inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors by palonosetron results from surface receptor inhibition rather than inducing receptor internalization.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 169: 1252-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that the chronic exposure to 5-HT causes a significant decrease in receptor binding (p < 0.001; paired t test; n = 5) to 20.5 ± 4.0% of untreated cells (Fig. 1A). A potential mechanism for 5-HT-mediated 5-HT3 loss of function is the promotion of receptor internalization (17.Freeman S.L. Glatzle J. Robin C.S. Valdellon M. Sternini C. Sharp J.W. Raybould H.E. Ligand-induced 5-HT3 receptor internalization in enteric neurons in rat ileum.Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18.Ilegems E. Pick H.M. Deluz C. Kellenberger S. Vogel H. Noninvasive imaging of 5-HT3 receptor trafficking in live cells: from biosynthesis to endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53346-53352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To investigate this we used inhibitors of clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis. 5-HT3A-expressing cells were preincubated (60 min, 37 °C) with either dynasore (80 µm) a clathrin inhibitor, nystatin (21 µm), a caveolin inhibitor, or both together. Cells were then exposed to 5-HT (300 µm) in the presence of the inhibitors (60 min, 37 °C). Subsequent binding sites were then measured using [3H]granisetron and expressed as the percentage of binding in control cells (exposed to the inhibitors but not 5-HT). Neither dynasore, nystatin, nor both together block the loss of function caused by prolonged exposure to 5-HT (p > 0.05; ANOVA; Fig. 1B), suggesting that neither clathrin- nor caveolin-mediated endocytosis is required for the reduction in binding sites observed. To confirm a lack of involvement of receptor internalization, we monitored cell surface receptor levels using an extracellular epitope (HA) tag and whole cell ELISA. 5-HT3A-HA receptor-expressing cells were incubated in the presence/absence of 5-HT (60 min, 37 °C) and fixed (3% paraformaldehyde) to prevent further membrane trafficking, and the remaining surface receptors were quantified by ELISA. Exposure to 5-HT (100 µm or 1 mm) had no effect on cell surface receptor levels (112.6 ± 12.4 and 107.7 ± 11.8%) compared with untreated cells (100 ± 15.5%), respectively (p > 0.05; ANOVA, n = 3; Fig. 1C). Clearly, the cell surface 5-HT3 receptor levels remained stable during chronic exposure to high levels of 5-HT despite the presence of a robust loss of surface binding sites (Fig. 1A). To further demonstrate that receptor internalization does not occur, we performed a fluorescence endocytosis assay to track surface receptors. Cell surface receptors were labeled with an anti-HA antibody (on ice) and then incubated (60 min, 37 °C) in the presence of absence of 5-HT (300 µm, 60 min). Receptors remaining on the cell surface were identified using an Alexa 488-tagged secondary antibody (− det), cells were then permeabilized and reprobed using an Alexa 568 tagged secondary antibody (+ det) to identify internalized receptors (Fig. 1D). In support of the ELISA and use of endocytosis inhibitors, no receptor internalization was observed. A number of signaling events mediated by intracellular 5-HT have been identified previously. These include serotonylation (transglutaminase-mediated attachment of 5-HT to target proteins) (29.Liu Y. Wei L. Laskin D.L. Fanburg B.L.

Pharmacol. 2011; 11: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the formation of reactive oxygen species accompanied by ERK1/2 MAPK and tyrosine kinase activation (31.Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Finlay G.A. Fanburg B.L. Serotonin stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase activity through the formation of superoxide anion.Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L282-L291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the regulation of nitric oxide signaling (32.Chanrion B. Mannoury la Cour C. Bertaso F. Lerner-Natoli M. Freissmuth M. Millan M.J. Bockaert J. Marin P. Physical interaction between the serotonin transporter and neuronal nitric oxide synthase underlies reciprocal modulation of their activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8119-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To investigate potential roles for these events in the regulation of 5-HT3 receptors, a range of inhibitors was used. 5-HT3A-expressing cells were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C with each inhibitor, and 5-HT (300 µm) induced down-regulation monitored and related to inhibitor only (no 5-HT) controls. The transglutaminase inhibitors cysteamine (CTA, 500 µm) or dansylcadaverine (DAN, 200 µm), the antioxidants (used to inhibit reactive oxygen species) vitamin C (VTC, 50 µm) or tiron (TRN, 5 mm), the ERK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 (10 µm) or UO126 (10 µm), the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A (2 µm), or the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME (NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, LNM, 1 mm) were without effect on the ability of 5-HT to down-regulate 5-HT3 binding sites (Fig. 1E; p > 0.05, ANOVA, n = 4). These findings indicate that intracellular 5-HT signaling via previously identified pathways is not required for 5-HT3 receptor loss of function. As high levels of 5-HT are observed within the gut, we investigated whether chronic exposure to 5-HT led to a ligand-induced down-regulation of receptor function in the intact guinea pig ileum"
https://openalex.org/W1968631841,"Developmental biology relies heavily on the use of conventional antibodies, but their production and maintenance involves significant effort. Here we use an expression cloning approach to identify variable regions of llama single domain antibodies (known as nanobodies), which recognize specific embryonic antigens. A nanobody cDNA library was prepared from lymphocytes of a llama immunized with Xenopus embryo lysates. Pools of bacterially expressed cDNAs were sib-selected for the ability to produce specific staining patterns in gastrula embryos. Three different nanobodies were isolated: NbP1 and NbP3 stained yolk granules, while the reactivity of NbP7 was predominantly restricted to the cytoplasm and the cortex. The isolated nanobodies recognized specific protein bands in immunoblot analysis. A reverse proteomic approach identified NbP1 target antigen as EP45/Seryp, a serine protease inhibitor. Given the unique stability of nanobodies and the ease of their expression in diverse systems, we propose that nanobody cDNA libraries represent a promising resource for molecular markers for developmental biology."
