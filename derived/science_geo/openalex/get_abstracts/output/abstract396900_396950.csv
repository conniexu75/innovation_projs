https://openalex.org/W2115944543,"Metabolomics studies hold promise for the discovery of pathways linked to disease processes. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. Here we used a metabolomics approach to generate unbiased small-molecule metabolic profiles in plasma that predict risk for CVD. Three metabolites of the dietary lipid phosphatidylcholine--choline, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and betaine--were identified and then shown to predict risk for CVD in an independent large clinical cohort. Dietary supplementation of mice with choline, TMAO or betaine promoted upregulation of multiple macrophage scavenger receptors linked to atherosclerosis, and supplementation with choline or TMAO promoted atherosclerosis. Studies using germ-free mice confirmed a critical role for dietary choline and gut flora in TMAO production, augmented macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation. Suppression of intestinal microflora in atherosclerosis-prone mice inhibited dietary-choline-enhanced atherosclerosis. Genetic variations controlling expression of flavin monooxygenases, an enzymatic source of TMAO, segregated with atherosclerosis in hyperlipidaemic mice. Discovery of a relationship between gut-flora-dependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine and CVD pathogenesis provides opportunities for the development of new diagnostic tests and therapeutic approaches for atherosclerotic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2078646756,"The type I interferon response protects cells against invading viral pathogens. The cellular factors that mediate this defence are the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system."

https://openalex.org/W2121077787,"A plethora of cellular processes, including apoptosis, depend on regulated changes in mitochondrial shape and ultrastructure. The role of mitochondria and of their morphology during autophagy, a bulk degradation and recycling process of eukaryotic cells' constituents, is not well understood. Here we show that mitochondrial morphology determines the cellular response to macroautophagy. When autophagy is triggered, mitochondria elongate in vitro and in vivo. During starvation, cellular cyclic AMP levels increase and protein kinase A (PKA) is activated. PKA in turn phosphorylates the pro-fission dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), which is therefore retained in the cytoplasm, leading to unopposed mitochondrial fusion. Elongated mitochondria are spared from autophagic degradation, possess more cristae, increased levels of dimerization and activity of ATP synthase, and maintain ATP production. Conversely, when elongation is genetically or pharmacologically blocked, mitochondria consume ATP, precipitating starvation-induced death. Thus, regulated changes in mitochondrial morphology determine the fate of the cell during autophagy."

However, it remains unclear whether these networks functionally interact and, if so, what factors mediate such interactions. Here, we show that WD repeat domain 5 (Wdr5), a core member of the mammalian Trithorax (trxG) complex, positively correlates with the undifferentiated state and is a regulator of ES cell self-renewal. We demonstrate that Wdr5, an “effector” of H3K4 methylation, interacts with the pluripotency transcription factor Oct4. Genome-wide protein localization and transcriptome analyses demonstrate overlapping gene regulatory functions between Oct4 and Wdr5. The Oct4-Sox2-Nanog circuitry and trxG cooperate in activating transcription of key self-renewal regulators, and furthermore, Wdr5 expression is required for the efficient formation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.

These factors participate in auto- and cross-regulatory interactions to increase their own expression and that of other self-renewal-associated genes while repressing genes that promote differentiation. Perturbation of these factors collapses the self-renewal circuitry and triggers specific or mixed lineage differentiation (Ivanova et al., 2006Ivanova N. Dobrin R. Lu R. Kotenko I. Levorse J.

In contrast to the numerous transcription factors, only a handful of chromatin regulators that are important for self-renewal have been characterized (Loh et al., 2007Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X.

Smarcc1/Baf155 couples self-renewal gene repression with changes in chromatin structure in mouse embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2979-2991PubMed Google Scholar). ES cells harbor an open, transcriptionally permissive chromatin that allows for efficient epigenomic remodeling during lineage commitment (Efroni et al., 2008Efroni S. Duttagupta R. Cheng J. Dehghani H. Hoeppner D.J. Dash C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Le Grice S. McKay R.D.

However, factors regulating this “hyperdynamic” epigenetic configuration remain poorly understood. ES cells also contain “bivalent domains” where nucleosomes are marked by trimethylation at histone3-lysine27 (H3K27me3) and histone3-lysine4 (H3K4me3) (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3739) Google Scholar). The Polycomb group (PcG) complex mediates H3K27me3, correlated with gene repression (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. et al.Polycomb complexes repress developmental regulators in murine embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Trithorax group (trxG) complex mediates H3K4me3, generally correlated with gene activation (Ringrose and Paro, 2004Ringrose L. Paro R. Epigenetic regulation of cellular memory by the Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Although PcG has been extensively investigated in the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal, pluripotency, and somatic cell reprogramming, there exists little complementary information for trxG-associated members. This imbalance of knowledge represents a significant shortcoming in the understanding of the roles played by trimethylated H3K4 and H3K27 in regulating the ES cell identity. Moreover, it remains to be shown whether the well-established transcriptional network can functionally interact with epigenetic regulators to maintain pluripotency and, more importantly, which factors mediate such interactions. An unresolved question in chromatin biology is the manner by which generic histone modification complexes, like PcG and trxG, become targeted to specific genomic loci to direct specific gene regulatory functions (Schuettengruber et al., 2007Schuettengruber B. Chourrout D. Vervoort M. Leblanc B. Cavalli G. Genome regulation by polycomb and trithorax proteins.Cell. 2007; 128: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). This is especially intriguing in the context of ES cells. For example, Chd1, a chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein that is not specific to ES cells, was recently described to be essential for pluripotency and reprogramming (Gaspar-Maia et al., 2009Gaspar-Maia A. Alajem A. Polesso F. Sridharan R. Mason M.J. Heidersbach A. Ramalho-Santos J. McManus M.T. Plath K. Meshorer E. Ramalho-Santos M. Chd1 regulates open chromatin and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2009; 460: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The factor(s) or mechanism(s) conferring such functional specificity to epigenetic regulators remains unknown. Moreover, it is unclear how ectopic expression of four transcription factors—Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM)—can reprogram somatic cells to iPS cells with epigenomes that are largely indistinguishable from ES cells (Carvajal-Vergara et al., 2010Carvajal-Vergara X. Sevilla A. D'Souza S.L. Ang Y.S. Schaniel C. Lee D.F. Yang L. Kaplan A.D. Adler E.D. Rozov R. et al.Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived models of LEOPARD syndrome.Nature. 2010; 465: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, Tsai et al., 2010Tsai S.Y. Clavel C. Kim S. Ang Y.S. Grisanti L. Lee D.F. Kelley K. Rendl M. Oct4 and klf4 reprogram dermal papilla cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 221-228PubMed Google Scholar). This is especially pertinent to the re-establishment of the bivalent signature. Interestingly, although the OSKM-iPS methodology has been replaced by various combinations of factors or small molecules, Oct4 remains the sole factor that, until recently, could not be substituted/omitted (Heng et al., 2010Heng J.C. Feng B. Han J. Jiang J. Kraus P. Ng J.H. Orlov Y.L. Huss M. Yang L. Lufkin T. et al.The nuclear receptor Nr5a2 can replace Oct4 in the reprogramming of murine somatic cells to pluripotent cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reasoned that the resetting of the somatic epigenome must be achieved through the activity of Oct4-interacting proteins and/or Oct4 target genes. Protein complexes of the Set/MLL histone methyltransferase (HMT) family are mammalian homologs of trxG that function as conserved, multisubunit ensembles to catalyze the methylation of H3K4. The human MLL gene, which contains a SET domain, was first identified based on translocations that are commonly associated with the pathogenesis of multiple forms of hematological malignancies (Shilatifard, 2006Shilatifard A. Chromatin modifications by methylation and ubiquitination: implications in the regulation of gene expression.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Notably, Set/MLL proteins alone are catalytically inactive but require core subunits—Wdr5, Ash2l and Rbbp5—that are related to components of the yeast Set1 complex (Dou et al., 2006Dou Y. Milne T.A. Ruthenburg A.J. Lee S. Lee J.W. Verdine G.L. Allis C.D. Roeder R.G. Regulation of MLL1 H3K4 methyltransferase activity by its core components.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The Rbbp5 and Ash2l heterodimer directly participates in HMT activity of the MLL1 complex (Cao et al., 2010Cao F. Chen Y. Cierpicki T. Liu Y. Basrur V. Lei M. Dou Y. An Ash2L/RbBP5 heterodimer stimulates the MLL1 methyltransferase activity through coordinated substrate interactions with the MLL1 SET domain.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ash2l is required for mouse embryogenesis (Taylor et al., 2010Taylor M.D. Sadhukhan S. Kottangada P. Ramgopal A. Sarkar K. D'Silva S. Selvakumar A. Candotti F. Vyas Y.M.

Med. 2010; 2: 37ra44Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and proper X-inactivation (Pullirsch et al., 2010Pullirsch D. Härtel R. Kishimoto H. Leeb M. Steiner G. Wutz A. The Trithorax group protein Ash2l and Saf-A are recruited to the inactive X chromosome at the onset of stable X inactivation.Development. 2010; 137: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas diminished recruitment of Rbbp5 is found in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (Stoller et al., 2010Stoller J.Z. Huang L. Tan C.C. Huang F. Zhou D.D. Yang J. Gelb B.D. Epstein J.A. Ash2l interacts with Tbx1 and is required during early embryogenesis.Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2010; 235: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Other trxG-associated cofactors such as Menin, Hcf1, and Cxxc1 have been implicated in processes like pancreatic β cell growth (Karnik et al., 2007Karnik S.K. Chen H. McLean G.W. Heit J.J. Gu X. Zhang A.Y. Fontaine M. Yen M.H. Kim S.K.

E2F1 mediates DNA damage and apoptosis through HCF-1 and the MLL family of histone methyltransferases.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and euchromatin formation (Thomson et al., 2010Thomson J.P. Skene P.J. Selfridge J. Clouaire T. Guy J. Webb S. Kerr A.R. Deaton A. Andrews R. James K.D. et al.CpG islands influence chromatin structure via the CpG-binding protein Cfp1.Nature. 2010; 464: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In particular, Wdr5 is a key component of trxG acting as a “presenter” of the H3K4 residue and is indispensible for Set/MLL complex assembly and effective HMT activity (Dou et al., 2006Dou Y. Milne T.A. Ruthenburg A.J. Lee S. Lee J.W. Verdine G.L. Allis C.D. Roeder R.G. Regulation of MLL1 H3K4 methyltransferase activity by its core components.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). It was shown that Wdr5 interacts with H3K4me2 and mediates transition to the trimethylated state (Wysocka et al., 2005Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D. WDR5 associates with histone H3 methylated at K4 and is essential for H3 K4 methylation and vertebrate development.Cell. 2005; 121: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, it was also shown that Wdr5 is unable to distinguish between different H3K4 methylation states (Couture et al., 2006Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Molecular recognition of histone H3 by the WD40 protein WDR5.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although Wdr5 function is required for vertebrate development (Wysocka et al., 2005Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D.

Demay M.B. Gori F. Wdr5 is essential for osteoblast differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7361-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), its role in ES or iPS cells remains to be determined. We sought to functionally characterize specific chromatin regulators in the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal, with a particular focus on trxG-associated members. For this, we mined our previous microarray data (Ivanova et al., 2006Ivanova N. Dobrin R. Lu R. Kotenko I. Levorse J. DeCoste C. Schafer X. Lun Y. Lemischka I.R. Dissecting self-renewal in stem cells with RNA interference.Nature. 2006; 442: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) and published iPS cell data sets for expressions of trxG complex members. Wdr5 emerged as an obvious candidate, as its expression was downregulated upon differentiation (Figure 1A ) and upregulated during iPS cell formation (Figure S1A ), unlike other members whose expression levels were incoherent among the data sets. Interestingly, the upregulation of Wdr5 in iPS cells was independent of the somatic cell types chosen for reprogramming. We also observed higher Wdr5 and H3K4me3 levels in ES cells than in somatic cells and tissues (Figures S1B and S1C), suggesting specific Wdr5 functions in ES and iPS cell maintenance.Figure S1Elevated Wdr5 Expression in Pluripotent ES and iPS Cells, Related to Figure 1 and Figure 2Show full caption(A) Heatmaps showing trxG-associated member expressions extracted from 4 separate iPS related studies showed consistent Wdr5 upregulation upon iPS formation from MEFs, NSC and B cells.(B) Immunoblot analyses of chromatin extracts from ES, dermal papilla (DP), dermal fibroblast (DF) and embryonic fibroblast (MEF).

All data normalized to actin and shown relative to Vector or GFP shRNA. Data represented as mean ± SD, n = 3. We next validated our microarray data and observed a marked Wdr5 reduction, similar to Oct4 and Nanog, with concomitant decreases in global H3K4me3 (Figure 1B). Wdr5 diminution in embryoid body (EB) assays indicated that this was not specific to retinoid acid (RA) induction but was generally representative of differentiation (Figure 1C). Additionally, when we depleted Oct4 or Nanog using short hairpin RNA (shRNA), we also observed a reduction in Wdr5 (Figure 1D). This effect was not unique to the shRNAs, as Wdr5 decreases were also observed using the Nanog-inducible and Oct4-repressible ES cell lines (Figure 1E). Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) confirmed Oct4 and Nanog occupancy in intron 1 of Wdr5 (Figure 1F). These data indicate that Wdr5 expression correlates positively with the undifferentiated state and that the Wdr5 gene is a downstream target of Oct4 and Nanog. We next designed shRNAs targeting Wdr5 to determine whether it is required for self-renewal. Wdr5 shRNA-2 and -4 effectively depleted Wdr5 mRNA and protein levels, but not those encoding other WD repeat proteins (Figure 2A and Figure S1D). Wdr5 knockdown induced changes in cell morphology and decreased alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, indicative of differentiation (Figure 2B). In ES cell competition assays, Wdr5 depletion resulted in loss of self-renewal similar to depletion of LIF receptor (LIFR) or Nanog (Figure 2C). Furthermore, depletion of Wdr5 diminished secondary ES colony formation (Figure 2D) and reduced self-renewal gene expression while increasing ectodermal and trophectodermal gene expressions (Figure S1E). Importantly, Wdr5 depletion induced the collapse of the extended ES cell transcriptional network (Figure 2E). To rule out shRNA off-target effects, we built complementation “rescue” ES cell lines (Wdr5R) where endogenous Wdr5 was constitutively repressed by Wdr5-shRNA and rescued by a Doxycycline-inducible (Dox) shRNA-immune Wdr5 (Figure 2F). Removal of Dox resulted in loss of self-renewal gene expression in two independent clones, whereas, in the presence of Dox, expression remained at normal levels (Figure 2F, right). This was also evident from AP staining (Figure S2A ). Global gene expression profiling and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) demonstrated that Wdr5 depletion repressed self-renewal and enhanced primarily ectoderm differentiation (Figure 2G and Figure S2B). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed enrichment in categories like developmental processes, mesoderm and skeletal development, and others (Figure S2C). Arguing against induced apoptosis or a general loss of proliferative potential, Wdr5 depletion in ES cells resulted in no change in apoptotic gene expressions, whereas cell-cycle analysis showed only a marginal impediment (Figures S2D and S2E). Indeed, sporadic clusters of viable cells expressing lineage-specific markers, nestin and smooth muscle actin, were detectable after extended periods of Wdr5 knockdown (Figure S2F). In addition, Wdr5 depletion in fibroblasts and myoblasts induced no significant changes in cell cycle, suggesting that Wdr5 has specific roles in maintenance of ES cell self-renewal (Figure S2G–S2I). We next asked whether Wdr5 overexpression was sufficient to block differentiation in EB assays using the Wdr5R (Figure S2J). Wdr5 overexpression (+Dox) delayed trophectoderm and mesoderm differentiation (Figures S2K and S2L) and enhanced endoderm differentiation (Figure S2N) but failed to prevent loss of self-renewal genes (Figure S2O). Conversely, Wdr5 repression enhanced commitment to trophectoderm and endoderm yet accelerated the loss of self-renewal markers (Figures S2K, S2N, and S2O). The enhanced differentiation following knockdown of Wdr5 also argues against a general loss of cell viability. Finally, transient overexpression of Wdr5 under self-renewing conditions resulted in no change in ES cell identity (data not shown). Collectively, these results show that Wdr5 plays specific roles in maintaining an intact ES cell transcriptional network and, consequently, a self-renewal phenotype but is insufficient to block differentiation. We further pursued the mechanism by which Wdr5 regulates self-renewal. Wdr5 is known to be required for H3K4me3 modification and HOX gene activation (Wysocka et al., 2005Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D. WDR5 associates with histone H3 methylated at K4 and is essential for H3 K4 methylation and vertebrate development.Cell. 2005; 121: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). As expected, Wdr5 knockdown reduced the amount of Wdr5 in chromatin and global H3K4me3 levels (Figure 3A ). Moreover, we observed that the reduction in H3K4me3 precedes downregulation of Oct4, Nanog, or SSEA1 markers (Figure 2F, left). At 2 days after Wdr5 depletion, whereas no change in Oct4 or Nanog levels was detectable, H3K4me3 levels were evidently reduced by more than 50%. This diminution continued and became more marked at day 4. We reason that H3K4me3 reduction is even more significant at day 4, after the initiation of Oct4 downregulation, because Wdr5 is a downstream target gene of Oct4. Thus, depletion of Oct4 could further attenuate the transcription of Wdr5 and, consequently, expression levels of global H3K4me3. Additionally, a significant SSEA1 decrease was only detected after day 3 (Figure S3A ).These data indicate that loss of H3K4me3 is a direct result of Wdr5 depletion and not an indirect result of the loss of pluripotency factors such as Oct4 or Nanog.Figure S3Wdr5 Regulates H3K4 Trimethylation and Transcriptional Activation, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) FACS analysis of SSEA1 positive cells upon Dox withdrawal over 7 days in Wdr5R#4.(B) ChIP-qPCR analysis of H3K4me3 localization at bivalent loci (Pax6, Hoxa11, Sox17) and other loci (Bub3, Gnl3, Adfp, Dph5) upon Wdr5 knockdown.

H3K4me3 reduction also occurred at pluripotency-associated gene promoters where we had shown decreased expression levels (Figure 3C), as well as at “bivalent” promoters and at other promoters (Figure S3B). In line with the role of H3K4me3 in RNA polymerase II (RNAP-II) recruitment (Wang et al., 2009Wang P. Lin C. Smith E.R. Guo H. Sanderson B.W. Wu M. Gogol M. Alexander T. Seidel C. Wiedemann L.M. et al.Global analysis of H3K4 methylation defines MLL family member targets and points to a role for MLL1-mediated H3K4 methylation in the regulation of transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 6074-6085Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), Wdr5 loss reduced RNAP-II occupancy at Nanog, Sox2, Fbx15, and Myc genes (Figure 3D). Moreover, using a Nanog-reporter line (Schaniel et al., 2009Schaniel C. Ang Y.S. Ratnakumar K. Cormier C. James T. Bernstein E. Lemischka I.R. Paddison P.J. Smarcc1/Baf155 couples self-renewal gene repression with changes in chromatin structure in mouse embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2979-2991PubMed Google Scholar), Wdr5 depletion reduced Nanog promoter activity (Figure S3C). Knockdowns of two other trxG-associated members Ash2l and Menin (Shilatifard, 2006Shilatifard A. Chromatin modifications by methylation and ubiquitination: implications in the regulation of gene expression.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) also induced ES cell differentiation (Figure S3D). This strongly suggested that the maintenance of self-renewal requires elevated H3K4me3 expression. Collectively, these data indicate that Wdr5 is critical for the maintenance of global and localized H3K4me3 and for transcriptional activation in ES cells. The indispensible role of Wdr5 in self-renewal suggested probable physical interactions with components of the core transcriptional network. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) using an Oct4 antibody demonstrated an interaction with Wdr5 (Figure 4A ). To confirm the Wdr5-Oct4 interaction, we derived ES cell lines in which Wdr5 was tagged with Flag or Myc epitopes and selected for clones that had minimum Wdr5 overexpression (Figure S4A ). Additionally, we measured self-renewal and differentiation markers to pick clones that were statistically indistinguishable from the control line (Figures S4B and S4C). A resultant Wdr5_FL2 line had typical growth rates and morphology and was capable of in vitro and in vivo differentiation (Figures S4D–S4F), demonstrating bona fide pluripotency. Using this line, we successfully co-IPed Wdr5 with Oct4 (Figure 4A), as well as Nanog and Sox2 (data not shown). Co-IP of other trxG-associated members, Rbbp5 and Menin, suggested that these factors exist in functionally active protein complexes. We next performed a gel filtration experiment to ask"

https://openalex.org/W2063153781,"Type 2 diabetes and obesity have emerged as global public health crises. Adipose tissue expansion in obesity promotes accumulation of classically activated macrophages that perpetuate chronic inflammation and sustain insulin resistance. Acute inflammation normally resolves in an actively orchestrated series of molecular and cellular events that ensures return to homeostasis after an inflammatory insult, a process regulated in part by endogenous lipid mediators such as the resolvins. In this study, we sought to determine whether stimulating resolution with resolvin D1 (RvD1) improves insulin sensitivity by resolving chronic inflammation associated with obesity. In male leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice, treatment with RvD1 (2 μg/kg) improved glucose tolerance, decreased fasting blood glucose, and increased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in adipose tissue relative to vehicle-treated mice. Treatment with RvD1 increased adiponectin production, while expression of IL-6 in adipose tissue was decreased. The formation of crown-like structures rich in inflammatory F4/80(+)CD11c(+) macrophages was reduced by >50% in adipose tissue by RvD1 and was associated with an increased percentage of F4/80(+) cells expressing macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin 1 (MGL-1), a marker of alternatively activated macrophages. These results suggest that stimulating resolution with the endogenous proresolving mediator RvD1 could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating obesity-induced diabetes."

In this study, we describe the generation of a panel of 38 nanobodies, small HER2-binding fragments that are derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies raised in an immunized dromedary. In search of a lead compound, a subset of nanobodies was biochemically characterized in depth and preclinically tested for use as tracers for imaging of xenografted tumors. The selected compound, 2Rs15d, was found to be stable and to interact specifically with HER2 recombinant protein and HER2-expressing cells in ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry, and radioligand binding studies with low nanomolar affinities, and did not compete with anti-HER2 therapeutic antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging quantification and biodistribution analyses showed that (99m)Tc-labeled 2Rs15d has a high tumor uptake in 2 HER2(+) tumor models, fast blood clearance, low accumulation in nontarget organs except kidneys, and high concomitant tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios at 1 h after intravenous injection.

https://openalex.org/W2063292930,"Meiotic crossover formation between homologous chromosomes (homologues) entails DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, homology search using DSB ends, and synaptonemal-complex formation coupled with DSB repair. Meiotic progression must be prevented until DSB repair and homologue alignment are completed, to avoid the formation of aneuploid gametes. Here we show that mouse HORMAD1 ensures that sufficient numbers of processed DSBs are available for successful homology search. HORMAD1 is needed for normal synaptonemal-complex formation and for the efficient recruitment of ATR checkpoint kinase activity to unsynapsed chromatin. The latter phenomenon was proposed to be important in meiotic prophase checkpoints in both sexes. Consistent with this hypothesis, HORMAD1 is essential for the elimination of synaptonemal-complex-defective oocytes. Synaptonemal-complex formation results in HORMAD1 depletion from chromosome axes. Thus, we propose that the synaptonemal complex and HORMAD1 are key components of a negative feedback loop that coordinates meiotic progression with homologue alignment: HORMAD1 promotes homologue alignment and synaptonemal-complex formation, and synaptonemal complexes downregulate HORMAD1 function, thereby permitting progression past meiotic prophase checkpoints."
https://openalex.org/W2065538503,"Cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation controls germ cell development, neuronal synaptic plasticity and cellular senescence, a tumour-suppressor mechanism that limits the replicative lifespan of cells. The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) promotes polyadenylation by nucleating a group of factors including defective in germline development 2 (Gld2), a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, on specific messenger RNA (mRNA) 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Because CPEB regulation of p53 mRNA polyadenylation/translation is necessary for cellular senescence in primary human diploid fibroblasts, we surmised that Gld2 would be the enzyme responsible for poly(A) addition. Here we show that depletion of Gld2 surprisingly promotes rather than inhibits p53 mRNA polyadenylation/translation, induces premature senescence and enhances the stability of CPEB mRNA. The CPEB 3' UTR contains two miR-122 binding sites, which when deleted, elevate mRNA translation, as does an antagomir of miR-122. Although miR-122 is thought to be liver specific, it is present in primary fibroblasts and destabilized by Gld2 depletion. Gld4, a second non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, was found to regulate p53 mRNA polyadenylation/translation in a CPEB-dependent manner. Thus, translational regulation of p53 mRNA and cellular senescence is coordinated by Gld2/miR-122/CPEB/Gld4."
https://openalex.org/W2144487953,"Export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum in COPII-coated vesicles occurs at defined sites that contain the scaffolding protein Sec16. We identify TFG-1, a new conserved regulator of protein secretion that interacts directly with SEC-16 and controls the export of cargoes from the endoplasmic reticulum in Caenorhabditis elegans. Hydrodynamic studies indicate that TFG-1 forms hexamers that facilitate the co-assembly of SEC-16 with COPII subunits. Consistent with these findings, TFG-1 depletion leads to a marked decline in both SEC-16 and COPII levels at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites. The sequence encoding the amino terminus of human TFG has been previously identified in chromosome translocation events involving two protein kinases, which created a pair of oncogenes. We propose that fusion of these kinases to TFG relocalizes their activities to endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, where they prematurely phosphorylate substrates during endoplasmic reticulum export. Our findings provide a mechanism by which translocations involving TFG can result in cellular transformation and oncogenesis."

These events are triggered by the formation of a complex between M1 and fibrinogen that, unlike M1 or fibrinogen alone, leads to neutrophil activation. Here we provide a structural explanation for the pathological properties of the complex formed between streptococcal M1 and human fibrinogen. A conformationally dynamic coiled-coil dimer of M1 was found to organize four fibrinogen molecules into a specific cross-like pattern. This pattern supported the construction of a supramolecular network that was required for neutrophil activation but was distinct from a fibrin clot. Disruption of this network into other supramolecular assemblies was not tolerated. These results have bearing on the pathophysiology of streptococcal toxic shock."

We recently reported that resistin is expressed in diabetic hearts and promotes cardiac hypertrophy; however, the mechanisms underlying this process are currently unknown. Therefore, we wanted to elucidate the mechanisms associated with resistin-induced cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial insulin resistance. Overexpression of resistin using adenoviral vector in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes was associated with inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, activation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and increased cell size, [3H]leucine incorporation (i.e. protein synthesis) and mRNA expression of the hypertrophic marker genes, atrial natriuretic factor, brain natriuretic peptide, and β-myosin heavy chain. Activation of AMPK with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carbozamide-1-β-d-ribifuranoside or inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or mTOR siRNA attenuated these resistin-induced changes. Furthermore, resistin increased serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS1) through the activation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway, a module known to stimulate insulin resistance. Inhibition of JNK (with JNK inhibitor SP600125 or using dominant-negative JNK) reduced serine 307 phosphorylation of IRS1.

Although studies to date indicate multiple sites of impaired insulin signaling in various animal models, data support the efficacy of inhibition of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) serine-threonine kinases in the amelioration of insulin resistance. Stress-activated JNK is elevated in tissues of obese subjects, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in obesity and insulin resistance (13Bennett B.L. Satoh Y. Lewis A.J. Curr. Opin.

Cardiomyocytes were infected with Ad.rRetn or Ad.βGal for 24–36 h (MOI 100). After virus infection, cells were treated with various reagents for the indicated time as described in the figure legends. Protein samples were prepared from adult rat hearts or NRVM using a lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Cell lysates were matched for protein concentration, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-resistin (Biovision), phospho-specific antibodies to AMPKα, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), Tuberin/TSC2, mTOR, p70S6K, ASK1, JNK, and IRS1 (Ser-636/Ser-639 or Ser-307), or their respective total antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). The membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, and signal intensities were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Total protein contents of the corresponding proteins were analyzed after stripping the phospho-blots to verify protein loading. Films from at least three independent experiments were scanned, and densities of the immunoreactive bands were evaluated using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software. Densitometric values of phospho-protein bands were normalized against the corresponding total protein values (densitometric values are reported as arbitrary units (AU)). GAPDH was used as an internal control. Protein synthesis rates in NRVM were determined using [3H]leucine (n = 6 per group) as described previously (24Kim M. Oh J.K. Sakata S. Liang I. Park W. Hajjar R.J. Lebeche D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2008; 45: 270-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was normalized to total protein content measured by Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Cell surface area was measured as we described previously (24Kim M. Oh J.K. Sakata S. Liang I. Park W. Hajjar R.J. Lebeche D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2008; 45: 270-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The expression of ANF, BNP, β-MHC, and 18s rRNA genes was quantified using real-time qRT-PCR (Applied Biosystems). The primers used are as follows: ANF, 5′-ACC TGC TAG ACC ACC TGG AGG AG-3′ and 5′-CCT TGG CTG TTA TCT TCG GTA CCG-3′; BNP, 5′-GCT GCT TTG GGC ACA AGA TAG-3′ and 5′-GGT CTT CCT ACA ACA ACT TCA-3′; β-MHC 5′-TTG GCA CGG ACT GCG TCA TC-3′ and 5′-GAG CCT CCA GAG TTT GCT GAA GGA-3′; and 18s rRNA, 5′-TCA AGA ACG AAA GTC GGA GG-3′ and 5′-GGA CAT CTA AGG GCA TCA C-3′. Fold changes in gene expression were determined using the relative comparison method with normalization to 18s rRNA. Cardiomyocytes were transfected with 50 nm mTOR siRNA (I and II) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Signal-SilenceControl siRNA was used as a control. After culturing for 48 h in serum-free medium, myocytes were then infected with Ad.rRetn or Ad.βGal and further cultured for 48 h in serum-free DMEM/F-12 Ham before harvesting. Where appropriate, the data were expressed as mean ± S.E., and comparisons of the group means were made with a Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We first determined whether hypertrophic hearts express higher levels of resistin. We examined resistin expression in rat hearts subject to pressure overload because of thoracic aortic banding (25Del Monte F. Butler K. Boecker W. Gwathmey J.K. Hajjar R.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 9: 49-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypertrophy in this model was assessed by determining the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight (LVW/BW). Aortic banded hearts showed significant increase in LVW/BW ratio (2.74 ± 0.20 mg/g, n = 5) compared with sham group (1.66 ± 0.11 mg/g, n = 3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). Evaluation of resistin expression showed significant up-regulation of resistin protein levels in the hypertrophic hearts (Fig. 1B). For comparison, we also show resistin expression in diabetic hearts, which is also significantly elevated (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, in the rat model of hypertrophy, pressure overload stress seemed to affect the expression of resistin not only in the heart but also in other tissues, such as liver and lungs, which demonstrated increased resistin expression following aortic banding (supplemental figure). This finding, coupled with our earlier studies demonstrating resistin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and contractile abnormalities (24Kim M. Oh J.K. Sakata S. Liang I. Park W. Hajjar R.J. Lebeche D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2008; 45: 270-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), prompted us to examine the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the promotion of cardiac hypertrophy of resistin. In initial preliminary experiments, we observed diminished AMPK activity by resistin, and because AMPK has been postulated to play a key role in cardiac hypertrophy, we sought to evaluate the role of resistin in modulating cardiac hypertrophy through the regulation of AMPK. NRVM were cultured and infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing the rat resistin gene (Ad.rRetn) or the β-galactosidase gene (Ad.βGal) as a control. Myocytes infected with Ad.rRetn displayed a sizable decrease in the level of AMPKα phosphorylated at Thr-172 compared with myocytes treated with Ad.βGal (Fig. 2). To confirm the inactivation of AMPKα, we also determined the phosphorylation state of ACC and TSC2, known downstream targets of AMPK. Phosphorylation of ACC at Ser-79 and TSC2 at Thr-1462 was markedly decreased in NRVM expressing resistin, paralleling the reduction of AMPK activity (Fig. 2). In addition, cardiac myocytes expressing resistin displayed significant increases in the level of mTOR phosphorylated at Ser-2448, indicating increased mTOR activity. p70S6K, a downstream effector of mTOR, was also significantly phosphorylated in cells expressing resistin (Fig. 2). Activated mTOR phosphorylates p70S6K at Thr-389 and promotes protein synthesis. AMPKα can modulate protein synthesis by inhibiting this pathway (10Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that resistin inhibits AMPK and activates mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes. To better understand the role of resistin in regulating the function of AMPK during hypertrophic growth, NRVM were treated with the pharmacological AMPK activator AICAR. Lysates from NRVM treated with Ad.rRetn or Ad.βGal in the presence or absence of 1 mm AICAR were analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody against the α subunit of AMPK (AMPKα), phosphorylated at Thr-172. Treatment with Ad.rRetn showed decreased phosphorylation of AMPKα, ACC, and TSC2; however, in the presence of AICAR, resistin-suppressed AMPKα phosphorylation was clearly preserved (Retn, 0.109 ± 0.009 AU versus Retn+ AICAR, 0.244 ± 0.024 AU; p <0.001) (Fig. 3A). Pharmacological and genetic activation of AMPK in myocytes can inhibit hypertrophy markers associated with the hypertrophic response (26Chan A.Y. Soltys C.L. Young M.E. Proud C.G. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32771-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 27Noga A.A. Soltys C.L. Barr A.J. Kovacic S. Lopaschuk G.D. Dyck J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H1460-H1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Li H.L. Yin R. Chen D. Liu D. Wang D. Yang Q. Dong Y.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether the decrease in AMPKα activity, by resistin, can influence cell size, protein synthesis, and expression of hypertrophic marker genes. Ad.rRetn increased cell size by about 53% compared with Ad.βGal as assessed by measuring the surface area of infected NRVM (Fig. 3B, p < 0.01); however, in the presence of AICAR, the resistin-induced increase in cell size was reduced significantly (Fig. 3B; p < 0.05). The effect of resistin on cell surface area was similar to that evoked by the potent hypertrophy agonist phenylephrine (PE) (Fig. 3B). Likewise, resistin induced a significant increase (1.75-fold, p < 0.001) in leucine incorporation over Ad.βGal treatment, but this effect was markedly reduced by AICAR addition (Fig. 3C, p < 0.01). In the presence of AICAR, AMPKα is activated 2- to 3-fold, which correlates with a 40–60% reduction in protein synthesis. Because resistin-induced protein synthesis was not completely inhibited by AICAR, this suggests that other regulatory pathways, independent of AMPK, may also contribute to resistin-induced protein synthesis. Furthermore, NRVM treated with Ad.rRetn showed a significant increase in mRNA expression of the hypertrophic marker genes ANF (3.48-fold), BNP (2.97-fold), and β-MHC (4.00-fold) (Fig. 3D). However, in the presence of AICAR, the resistin-induced gene expression was reduced significantly to basal levels (Fig. 3D). To further dissect the role of AMPK during hypertrophic growth, cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-mTOR and anti-phospho-p70S6K antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, elevated levels of phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylated p70S6K were observed in NRVM treated with Ad.rRetn, indicating increased protein synthesis. However, treatment of NRVM with AICAR resulted in a considerable reduction in the phosphorylation states of mTOR and p70S6K (Fig. 3A), consistent with the observation that activation of AMPK inhibits the mTOR/p70S6K pathway. Because phosphorylation of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway results in an increase in mTOR and p70S6K activity and activation of protein synthesis, its inactivation seen in response to AICAR may, at least in part, explain the decrease in protein synthesis observed in Fig. 3C. To further study mTOR signaling in resistin-induced cardiac hypertrophy, lysates from NRVM treated with Ad.rRetn in the presence or absence of rapamycin (100 nm) were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody against mTOR phosphorylated at Ser-2448 or IRS1 phosphorylated at Ser-636/Ser-639 (a known p70S6K phosphorylation site). Ad.rRetn stimulated the phosphorylation of mTOR and IRS1; however, in the presence of rapamycin, resistin-induced mTOR and IRS1 phosphorylation was diminished (mTOR, 0.408 ± 0.033 AU versus 0.087 ± 0.005 AU; IRS1, 0.316 ± 0.015 AU versus 0.060 ± 0.011 AU; p < 0.001 for both) (Fig. 4A). Treatment of NRVM with Ad.rRetn induced an increase in cell surface area by about 53% compared with Ad.βGal (Fig. 4B, p < 0.01); however, in the presence of rapamycin, resistin-induced increase in cell size was blunted significantly (Fig. 4B, p < 0.01). Similarly, resistin evoked a large increase in leucine incorporation (1.72-fold, p < 0.001) compared with control cells; however, in the presence of rapamycin, resistin-induced protein synthesis was reduced slightly but significantly (Fig. 4C). In addition, resistin induced a significant increase in mRNA expression of ANF (2.22-fold), BNP (2.75-fold), and β-MHC (1.98-fold); however, rapamycin significantly abrogated the observed effect of resistin (Fig. 4D). To further verify the involvement of the mTOR pathway in resistin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, we inhibited mTOR activity using siRNA targeted against mTOR. Like rapamycin, mTOR siRNA potently inhibited mTOR expression (0.585 ± 0.042 AU versus 0.019 ± 0.003 AU with siRNA II, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4E) and significantly decreased the expression of β-MHC, a marker of hypertrophy (-54%, p < 0.01, F). Although mTOR is a downstream target of AMPK signaling, as we showed in Fig. 3, it can also be regulated by other pathways (e.g. PI3K/Akt and MAPK) (29Tzatsos A. Kandror K.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 35McGaffin K.R. Witham W.G. Yester K.A. Romano L.C. O'Doherty R.M. McTiernan C.F. O'Donnell C.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 89: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Hence, resistin-induced hypertrophic response is likely to be an AMPK-dependent (Fig. 3) and an AMPK-independent (Fig. 4) process. To further elucidate the involvement of other mechanisms in the action of resistin on cardiac hypertrophy and insulin resistance, we investigated the activation of JNK in NRVM infected with Ad.rRetn or Ad.βGal. Resistin-transduced myocytes displayed elevated levels of JNK phosphorylation at Thr-183/Tyr-185 compared with myocytes treated with Ad.βGal (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the dephosphorylation (i.e. activation) of ASK1, a known JNK kinase, was substantially induced by resistin (Fig. 5A), paralleling the observed increase in phosphorylation of JNK at Thr-183/Tyr-185. IRS1 serine phosphorylation is known to contribute to insulin resistance. Because JNK is known to phosphorylate serine residues of IRS1, thus promoting the insulin-mitogenic pathway and inducing insulin resistance, we also determined whether JNK activity, increased by resistin in cardiomyocytes, results in an increase in IRS1 serine phosphorylation at its primary activation site, Ser-307. Indeed, NRVM transduced with Ad.rRetn displayed increased phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser-307 as well as increased JNK activity (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated IRS1 at Ser-636/Ser-639 was also performed to investigate other serine phosphorylation of IRS1. Concomitant with increased IRS1 phosphorylation at Ser-307 in cells expressing resistin, phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser-636/Ser-639 was also increased (Fig. 5A). These data confirm that increased activity of p70S6K is able to phosphorylate the serine residues of its downstream IRS1 target; thus, p70S6K can contribute to the induction of insulin resistance as well as increase protein synthesis. To further assess the signaling mechanism by which the JNK/IRS1 pathway regulates insulin signaling during hypertrophic growth, NRVM were treated with Ad.rRetn in the presence or absence of SP600125 (10 μm), a known selective JNK inhibitor, or infected with a dominant-negative JNK1 adenoviral construct (Ad.dnJNK1). Immunoblot analysis using phospho-JNK and phospho-IRS1 (Ser-307) antibodies showed increased phosphorylation of JNK and of IRS1 at Ser-307 in cardiomyocytes expressing Ad.rRetn (Fig. 5, B and C). However, treatment with SP600125 (Fig. 5B) or Ad.dnJNK1 (C) almost completely reversed the resistin-induced phosphorylation of JNK and IRS1 back to basal level (phospho-JNK, 0.452 ± 0.027 AU versus 0.072 ± 0.006 AU, p < 0.001; phospho-IRS1, 1.302 ± 0.09 AU versus 0.598 ± 0.026 AU, p < 0.001 using dnJNK1; Fig. 5C). Altogether, these data demonstrate that resistin may contribute to the onset of myocardial insulin resistance and further support the idea that resistin is involved in the induction of insulin resistance in general. We then wanted to know whether the above in vitro signaling pathways involved in resistin modulation of the hypertrophic response were also operative in vivo in ventricular tissues from adult rats overexpressing resistin. We have shown in preliminary findings that cardiac-targeted overexpression of resistin in vivo displayed features of diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, increased cardiac apoptosis, and hypertrophy (30Chemaly E.R. Kim M. Hadri L. Hajjar R.J. Lebeche D. Circulation. 2008; 118: S487-S488Google Scholar). Proteins, isolated from left ventricular tissues from control animals or adult rats transduced with adenovirus-associated virus serotype 9-encoding rat resistin (AAV9.rRetn) for 10 weeks, were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against AMPK phosphorylated at Thr-172, TSC2 phosphorylated at Thr-1462, p70S6K phosphorylated at Thr-389, JNK phosphorylated at Thr-183/Tyr-185, and IRS1 phosphorylated at Ser-307 and Ser-636/Ser-639. Interestingly, compared with control hearts, reduced phosphorylation of AMPK and increased phosphorylation of p70S6K, JNK, and IRS1 was observed in AAV9.rRetn hearts (Fig. 6). Therefore, resistin overexpression in ventricular tissues is associated with altered activities of the AMPK/p70S6K and JNK/IRS1 pathways, consistent with our findings in vitro. We have previously examined the role of resistin in modulating cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte physiology. We showed that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of rat resistin in cultured NRVM significantly increased sarcomere organization and cell size, enhanced protein synthesis, and increased the expression of ANF and β-MHC. Furthermore, overexpression of resistin in NRVM was associated with activation of MAPKs as well as increased serine phosphorylation of IRS1. Overexpression of resistin in adult cultured cardiomyocytes negatively altered myocyte mechanics and impaired cytoplasmic Ca2+ clearing (24Kim M. Oh J.K. Sakata S. Liang I. Park W. Hajjar R.J. Lebeche D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2008; 45: 270-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The data we obtained showed that resistin confers to primary cardiomyocytes all the features of the hypertrophic phenotype. In addition, we show in this study that resistin expression is elevated in hypertrophic hearts subjected to chronic pressure overload. Although these findings suggest, for the first time, that resistin may be involved in the induction of cardiac hypertrophy, the mechanisms underlying this effect are currently unknown. Therefore, we were interested in investigating the mechanisms underlying the actions of resistin in the setting of cardiac hypertrophy. Here we present evidence that resistin promotes cardiac hypertrophy through the modulation of the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K and ASK1/JNK/IRS1 pathways in cardiomyocytes as we proposed in Fig. 7. Interestingly, these signaling pathways are also observed in vivo in adult hearts overexpressing resistin. The participation of AMPK pathway in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy has emerged recently (31Dyck J.R. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Physiol. 2006; 574: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Some observations have shown that the activity of AMPK is elevated in hypertrophic hearts subjected to chronic pressure overload, and this increase in AMPK activity was associated with enhanced glucose uptake, thus implicating AMPK activation as a cause of cardiac hypertrophy (32Tian R. Musi N. D'Agostino J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1664-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, substantial recent evidence indicates that AMPK, on the contrary, is involved in the attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy. The development of Akt1-induced hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes is associated with inactivation of AMPK, which may be permissive for cardiac growth (26Chan A.Y. Soltys C.L. Young M.E. Proud C.G. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32771-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In agreement with this study, adiponectin has been shown to attenuate hypertrophic growth via activation of AMPK and an AMPK-dependent signaling mechanism (33Shibata R. Ouchi N. Ito M. Kihara S. Shiojima I. Pimentel D.R. Kumada M. Sato K. Schiekofer S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Colucci W.S. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Further support of AMPK as a negative regulator of cardiac growth has been provided by other studies, showing that AMPK signaling is decreased or impaired in hearts from adiponectin or leptin deficient mice. This decrease in AMPK activity exacerbated hypertrophic growth and heart failure following transverse aortic constriction (34Liao Y. Takashima S. Maeda N. Ouchi N. Komamura K. Shimomura I. Hori M. Matsuzawa Y. Funahashi T. Kitakaze M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or myocardial infarction (35McGaffin K.R. Witham W.G. Yester K.A. Romano L.C. O'Doherty R.M. McTiernan C.F. O'Donnell C.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 89: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of AMPK inhibits protein synthesis associated with cardiac hypertrophy via two independent signaling pathways that are known to mediate protein synthesis in the heart, the mTOR-p70S6K-40S ribosomal protein S6 and the eEF2 kinase-eEF2 pathways (26Chan A.Y. Soltys C.L. Young M.E. Proud C.G. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32771-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This implies that AMPK activation can inhibit protein synthesis associated with cardiac hypertrophy and may be able to prevent the development of pathological hypertrophy. We showed that resistin decreases the activity of AMPK in cardiomyocytes (Figs. 2, 3, and 6). Whether resistin exacerbates the hypertrophic response through depressing the activity of AMPK remains to be determined. We hypothesize that restoring the activity of AMPK using pharmacological activators (such as AICAR or metformin) or through gene transfer might provide a beneficial mechanism to prevent or attenuate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with diabetes and obesity in subjects with hyperresistinemia. The concept that AMPK may link adipokine (such as resistin) signaling and the regulation of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathies associated with diabetes/obesity is an exciting avenue of research that deserves further investigation. It is unclear how resistin alters the phosphorylation of AMPK; this is in part due to the fact that resistin receptors are yet to be identified. However, it is likely that the ability of resistin to decrease AMPK phosphorylation may be mediated by altering the activity of upstream kinases or phosphatases involved in deactivating AMPK, such as LKB1 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase. Whether resistin regulates the activities of LKB1 and/or calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase is undetermined at the moment, although we observed in preliminary experiments that resistin dephosphorylates LKB1 (not shown). In addition, we found that resistin increases the phosphorylation of the p70S6K (Figs. 2, 3, and 6). The phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K leads to an increase in protein synthesis and cell growth, which can induce hypertrophy, and in a negative feedback mechanism with mTOR, inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling by promoting reduction in IRS1 stability and transcription, leading to its disassociation from PI3K. In addition, activation of p70S6K can phosphorylate IRS1 on multiple inhibitory sites, promoting its degradation, thus inducing insulin resistance (36Harrington L.S. Findlay G.M. Lamb R.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that some of the hypertrophic response observed in subjects with type 2 diabetes may be ascribed to shunting insulin signaling away from the PI3K/Akt metabolic pathway and toward the mitogenic pathway (i.e. insulin resistance). Negative regulation of insulin signaling occurs mainly at the level of the proximal tyrosine kinase substrates of the insulin receptor, namely IRS proteins, a family of adaptor proteins that are essential for insulin effects. When insulin binds to its receptor, IRS1 is activated via tyrosine phosphorylation to initiate downstream signaling pathways such as Akt (37Virkamäki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IRS1 contains more than 50 potential serine phosphorylation sites; serine phosphorylation of IRS1 or its degradation decreases its interaction with the insulin receptor, leading to a reduction in IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and a disturbance of insulin signaling (38Greene M.W. Garofalo R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7082-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Among the various IRS1 serine phosphorylation sites, Ser-307 is phosphorylated by JNK (14Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Görgün C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar, 15Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.

J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), whereas Ser-636/Ser-639 is phosphorylated by the mTOR/p70S6K module (17Khamzina L. Veilleux A. Bergeron S. Marette A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 40Ozes O.N. Akca H. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4640-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that resistin induced higher phosphorylation of JNK and of the Ser 307 residue of IRS1 (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Anisomycin, a pharmacological activator of JNK, has been shown to inhibit insulin signal transduction by interrupting IRS1 binding to the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase following increased JNK phosphorylation (41Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). JNK has been shown to bind directly to IRS1 and to phosphorylate it on Ser-307, whereas phosphorylation of Ser-307 is reduced in cells lacking JNK1/2 (42Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In addition, serine phosphorylation of IRS1 is demonstrated to be associated with decreased IRS1 protein stability. Mutation of Ser-312 to Ala in human IRS1 (equivalent to the Ser-307 site in rat IRS1) is partially resistant to insulin-induced degradation compared with wild-type IRS1, indicating that phosphorylation of this site might direct an increase in proteasomal degradation of IRS1 (43Greene M.W. Sakaue H. Wang L. Alessi D.R. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8199-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of mTOR/p70S6K by resistin and the subsequent induction of IRS1 Ser-636/Ser-639 phosphorylation also suggest that these pathways are involved in controlling IRS1 signaling mechanisms (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). As stated earlier, mTOR, through the activation of p70S6K, inhibits insulin signal transduction by promoting reduction of IRS1 stability and transcription and enhancing its degradation. Therefore, nonspecific or regulated degradation of elements in the insulin signaling pathway might cause insulin resistance. Our observation that resistin stimulates serine phosphorylation of IRS1 through activation of JNK and or mTOR/p70S6K may provide a rational mechanism to explain, at least in part, the myocardial insulin resistance that occurs in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, a direct effect of resistin on IRS1 protein stability and degradation remains to be determined. Our study further supports a role for resistin in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial insulin resistance. The actions of resistin in the setting of cardiac hypertrophy and insulin resistance are attributed to the modulation of intracellular growth signals in cardiac cells involving the AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K and JNK/IRS1 signaling pathways.

Yet the physiological function of PrP has remained elusive and has created controversies in the literature. We found a downstream alternative translation initiation AUG codon surrounded by an optimal Kozak sequence in the +3 reading frame of PRNP. The corresponding alternative open reading frame encodes a polypeptide termed alternative prion protein (AltPrP) with a completely different amino acid sequence from PrP. We introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in frame with AltPrP in PrP cDNAs from different species to test the expression of this novel polypeptide using anti-HA antibodies. AltPrP is constitutively coexpressed with human, bovine, sheep, and deer PrP. AltPrP is localized at the mitochondria and is up-regulated by endoplasmic reticulum stress and proteasomal inhibition. Generation of anti-AltPrP antibodies allowed us to test for endogenous expression of AltPrP in wild-type human cells expressing PrP. By transfecting cells with siRNA against PrP mRNA, we repressed expression of both PrP and AltPrP, confirming endogenous expression of AltPrP from PRNP. AltPrP was also detected in human brain homogenate, primary neurons, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results demonstrate an unexpected function for PRNP, which, in addition to plasma membrane-anchored PrP, also encodes a second polypeptide termed AltPrP."
https://openalex.org/W1978316781,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) is an endothelial cell protein that transports lipoprotein lipase (LPL) from the subendothelial spaces to the capillary lumen. GPIHBP1 contains two main structural motifs, an amino-terminal acidic domain enriched in aspartates and glutamates and a lymphocyte antigen 6 (Ly6) motif containing 10 cysteines. All of the cysteines in the Ly6 domain are disulfide-bonded, causing the protein to assume a three-fingered structure. The acidic domain of GPIHBP1 is known to be important for LPL binding, but the involvement of the Ly6 domain in LPL binding requires further study. To assess the importance of the Ly6 domain, we created a series of GPIHBP1 mutants in which each residue of the Ly6 domain was changed to alanine. The mutant proteins were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and their expression level on the cell surface and their ability to bind LPL were assessed with an immunofluorescence microscopy assay and a Western blot assay. We identified 12 amino acids within GPIHBP1, aside from the conserved cysteines, that are important for LPL binding; nine of those were clustered in finger 2 of the GPIHBP1 three-fingered motif. The defective GPIHBP1 proteins also lacked the ability to transport LPL from the basolateral to the apical surface of endothelial cells. Our studies demonstrate that the Ly6 domain of GPIHBP1 is important for the ability of GPIHBP1 to bind and transport LPL."

In this study, we compare the detailed kinetic and functional characterization of naturally occurring transcript variants of the motor domain of human nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (NMHC)-2C. NMHC-2C is alternatively spliced both in loop-1 and loop-2. Isoform 2C0 contains no inserts in either of the loops and represents the shortest isoform. An 8-amino acid extension in the loop-1 region is present in isoforms 2C1 and 2C1C2. Isoform 2C1C2 additionally displays a 33-amino acid extension in the loop-2 region. Transient kinetic experiments indicate increased rate constants for F-actin binding by isoform 2C1C2 in the absence and presence of nucleotide, which can be attributed to the loop-2 extension. ADP binding shows only minor differences for the three transcript variants. In contrast, larger differences are observed for the rates of ADP release both in the absence and presence of F-actin. The largest differences are observed between isoforms 2C0 and 2C1C2. In the absence and presence of F-actin, isoform 2C1C2 displays a 5–7-fold increase in ADP affinity. Moreover, our results indicate that the ADP release kinetics of all three isoforms are modulated by changes in the concentration of free Mg2+ ions. The greatest responsiveness of the NMHC-2C isoforms is observed in the physiological range from 0.2 to 1.5 mm free Mg2+ ions, affecting their duty ratio, velocity, and tension-bearing properties.

https://openalex.org/W2107443257,"We have recently shown that antibody-induced blockade of C5a, C5a receptors, or IL-17A greatly reduced the harmful outcomes of sepsis. In the current study, normal cardiomyocytes from young (300 g) male Sprague-Dawley rats responded in vitro to C5a (ED(50)=55 nM) with release of IL-6 and TNFα, peaking between 2 to 8 h. Neutralizing antibodies to mouse C5a or IL-17A (ED(50)=40 μg for each, based on improved survival) reduced spontaneous in vitro release of cardiosuppressive cytokines and chemokines in cardiomyocytes obtained from mice with polymicrobial sepsis. A non-neutralizing C5a antibody had no such effects. Cardiomyocytes from septic mice (C57Bl/6) showed increased mRNA for TNFR1, IL-6 (gp80), and C5aR at 6 h after sepsis. Cardiomyocytes from septic C5aR(-/-) or C5L2(-/-) mice did not show spontaneous in vitro release of cytokines and chemokines. These data suggest that cardiomyocytes from septic mice release suppressive cytokines in a C5a-, C5aR-, and IL-17A-dependent manner, followed by mediator reactivity with receptors on cardiomyocytes, resulting in defective contractility and relaxation. These data may be relevant to a strategy for the treatment of heart dysfunction developing during sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2112101592,"CD157, a member of the CD38 gene family, is an NAD-metabolizing ectoenzyme and a signaling molecule whose role in polarization, migration, and diapedesis of human granulocytes has been documented; however, the molecular events underpinning this role remain to be elucidated. This study focused on the role exerted by CD157 in monocyte migration across the endothelial lining and adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. The results demonstrated that anti-CD157 antibodies block monocyte transmigration and adhesion to fibronectin and fibrinogen but that CD157 cross-linking is sufficient to overcome the block, suggesting an active signaling role for the molecule. Consistent with this is the observation that CD157 is prevalently located within the detergent-resistant membrane microdomains to which, upon clustering, it promotes the recruitment of β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> integrin, which, in turn, leads to the formation of a multimolecular complex favoring signal transduction. This functional cross-talk with integrins allows CD157 to act as a receptor despite its intrinsic structural inability to do so on its own. Intracellular signals mediated by CD157 rely on the integrin/Src/FAK (focal adhesion kinase) pathway, resulting in increased activity of the MAPK/ERK1/2 and the PI3K/Akt downstream signaling pathways, which are crucial in the control of monocyte transendothelial migration. Collectively, these findings indicate that CD157 acts as a molecular organizer of signaling-competent membrane microdomains and that it forms part of a larger molecular machine ruled by integrins. The CD157-integrin partnership provides optimal adhesion and transmigration of human monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2065031817,"We have previously shown that the cell death-promoting protein Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) is ubiquitinated and degraded following a neuroprotection-conferring episode of brief ischemia (preconditioning). Here, we identify the E3 ligase that ubiquitinates Bim in this model, using a proteomics approach. Using phosphorylated GST-Bim as bait, we precipitated and identified by mass spectrometry tripartite motif protein 2 (TRIM2), a RING (really interesting new gene) domain-containing protein. The reaction between TRIM2 and Bim was confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. We show that TRIM2 binds to Bim when it is phosphorylated by p42/p44 MAPK but does not interact with a nonphosphorylatable Bim mutant (3ABim). 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate activation of p42/p44 MAPK drives Bim ubiquitination in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and is associated with an increased interaction between TRIM2 and Bim. One hour following preconditioning ischemia, the binding of Bim to TRIM2 increased, consistent with the time window of enhanced Bim degradation. Blocking p42/p44 MAPK activation following preconditioning ischemia with U0126 or using the nonphosphorylatable 3ABim reduced the binding between Bim and TRIM2. Immunodepletion of TRIM2 from cell lysates prepared from preconditioned cells reduced Bim ubiquitination. Finally, suppression of TRIM2 expression, using lentivirus transduction of shRNAmir, stabilized Bim protein levels and blocked neuroprotection observed in rapid ischemic tolerance. Taken together, these data support a role for TRIM2 in mediating the p42/p44 MAPK-dependent ubiquitination of Bim in rapid ischemic tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1987687491,"The gap junction channel is formed by proper docking of two hemichannels. Depending on the connexin(s) in the hemichannels, homotypic and heterotypic gap junction channels can be formed. Previous studies suggest that the extracellular loop 2 (E2) is an important molecular domain for heterotypic compatibility. Based on the crystal structure of the Cx26 gap junction channel and homology models of heterotypic channels, we analyzed docking selectivity for several hemichannel pairs and found that the hydrogen bonds between E2 domains are conserved in a group of heterotypically compatible hemichannels, including Cx26 and Cx32 hemichannels. According to our model analysis, Cx32N175Y mutant destroys three hydrogen bonds in the E2-E2 interactions due to steric hindrance at the heterotypic docking interface, which makes it unlikely to dock with the Cx26 hemichannel properly. Our experimental data showed that Cx26-red fluorescent protein (RFP) and Cx32-GFP were able to traffic to cell-cell interfaces forming gap junction plaques and functional channels in transfected HeLa/N2A cells. However, Cx32N175Y-GFP exhibited mostly intracellular distribution and was occasionally observed in cell-cell junctions. Double patch clamp analysis demonstrated that Cx32N175Y did not form functional homotypic channels, and dye uptake assay indicated that Cx32N175Y could form hemichannels on the cell surface similar to wild-type Cx32. When Cx32N175Y-GFP- and Cx26-RFP-transfected cells were co-cultured, no colocalization was found at the cell-cell junctions between Cx32N175Y-GFP- and Cx26-RFP-expressing cells; also, no functional Cx32N175Y-GFP/Cx26-RFP heterotypic channels were identified. Both our modeling and experimental data suggest that Asn(175) of Cx32 is a critical residue for heterotypic docking and functional gap junction channel formation between the Cx32 and Cx26 hemichannels."

In addition to hymenoptera venom-allergic patients, CCD-specific IgE antibodies are notoriously present in the sera of pollen-sensitized individuals and patients with plant food allergies. By contrast to IgG, occurrence of IgE antibodies indicates allergic sensitization.

Notably, N-glycans of HRP are a mixture of M3XF (MMXF), M4XF, M3F (MMF), M3 (MM), M2X (MUX; Fig. 1), and an unusual Fuc(1,3)GlcNac modification (21Wuhrer M. Balog C.I. Koeleman C.A. Deelder A.M.

Although used synonymously during the past decades, CCD epitopes of commonly used marker glycoproteins seem to be differentially recognized by sera of varying sources. Previously, van Ree et al.

(31Bencúrová M. Hemmer W. Focke-Tejkl M. Wilson I.B. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) concluded that bromelain is not useful for detection of xylose-specific antibodies because of an absence of α1,3-mannose from M2X (MUX). Previous studies identified hgl1 as one of several salt-sensitive Arabidopsis mutants that are defective in producing normal complex N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus (6Kang J.S. Frank J. Kang C.H.

Unlike other salt-sensitive N-glycosylation mutants lacking xylose and/or core fucose, hgl1 mutant alleles produce hybrid N-glycans that still contain these residues. Because we found that hybrid N-glycans of hgl1 mutants are barely recognized by complex glycan-specific antibodies, this study aimed at elucidating the basis for altered surface properties of cellular glycoproteins in Arabidopsis hgl1 mutants. We investigated the influence of the presence versus absence of individual N-glycan residues concerning antibody binding (by rabbit IgG and human IgE) and in planta functionality with respect to salt sensitivity, whole glycan profiles, and surface accessibility. Altogether, the obtained data implicate that hgl1 N-glycans are hypoallergenic. For leaf material Arabidopsis thaliana var. Columbia plants were grown in soil under short day regime (8 h of light). Root growth responses to NaCl were analyzed as described by Kang et al. (6Kang J.S. Frank J. Kang C.H. Kajiura H. Vikram M. Ueda A. Kim S. Bahk J.D. Triplett B. Fujiyama K. Lee S.Y. von Schaewen A.

In general, seedlings were kept 5 days on normal medium and 5 days on salt medium and verified by genomic PRC using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers listed in Table S1. Arabidopsis mutants have been described earlier (1Koiwa H. Li F. McCully M.G. Mendoza I. Koizumi N. Manabe Y. Nakagawa Y. Zhu J. Rus A. Pardo J.M. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M.

Preparation of pyridylaminated sugar chains from Arabidopsis wild type (Col-0) and T-DNA mutant lines was described previously (32Kajiura H. Seki T. Fujiyama K. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 736-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Molecular masses of pyridylaminated sugar chains as well as number and structure of their sugar moieties were estimated by liquid chromatography-tandem MS analyses using Agilent Technologies 1200 series (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with HCT plus (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The structures of M7A, M7B, and of other N-glycan isoforms were deduced from their elution positions compared with glucose-oligomer units in reverse phase HPLC (33Tomiya N. Lee Y.C. Yoshida T. Wada Y. Awaya J. Kurono M. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because the intensities of product ions derived from the precursor ion detected in liquid chromatography-tandem MS were specific for each structure, we compared intensity patterns of the precursor ion with the in-house tandem MS library of authentic pyridylaminated sugar chains. These two parameters enabled us to distinguish and determine N-glycan isoforms, namely structures of molecules with the same m/z ratios. Arabidopsis leaf extracts were prepared with protein-extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm sodium bisulfite, 1 mm Pefabloc SC). Total protein contents were determined with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and BSA as reference protein. Equal amounts were separated by 10–12% SDS-PAGE (reducing conditions) and blotted to nitrocellulose prior to reversible Ponceau S staining (0.3% (w/v) in 3% TCA). After blocking with 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), the blots were incubated with crude polyclonal rabbit antisera raised either against PHA-L (α-PHA-L) (26Faye L. Chrispeels M.J. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 245-256Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34Wenderoth I. von Schaewen A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4168-4172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), diluted 1:10,000 in TBST or 1:20,000 in 2× TBST, respectively, including 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk as described previously (8Frank J. Kaulfürst-Soboll H. Rips S. Koiwa H. von Schaewen A. Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1354-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or with affinity-selected fractions thereof. For IgE detection, blot membranes were blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and incubated either with diluted patient sera (1:10 in TBST, 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) for 2 h or with undiluted patient sera supplemented with 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk overnight at room temperature. After three wash steps with TBST, blots were incubated with affinity-purified peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human IgE(∈) antibodies (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST for 1 h, followed again by wash steps. Concanavalin A affinoblotting was conducted as described by Faye and Chrispeels (35Faye L. Chrispeels M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescent signals were developed with the ECL advance Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare) and recorded digitally (GeneGnome; Syngene, Cambridge, UK). The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee, and all of the patients enrolled gave their informed consent. CCD patient sera PT-06, PT-02, and BW-69 were preselected within another study among potato/tomato (PT)-allergic and bee/wasp (BW)-allergic patients (36Kaulfürst-Soboll H. Mertens M. Brehler R. von Schaewen A. PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17800Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fucose- and xylose-specific antibody fractions were purified from crude complex glycan antisera. Total soluble protein was extracted from leaves of Arabidopsis cgl1, xylT (β1,2-xylosyltransferase), and fucTa fucTb mutants as described above. About 1 mg of each protein extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and used as follows. First, HRP antiserum (Sigma) was diluted 1:2,000 in 2× TBST and incubated overnight with blotted cgl1 extract at 4 °C (to reduce complex glycan-unrelated binding). In this way depleted antiserum was incubated with blotted xylT extract for 3 h at room temperature (for selection of fucose-specific antibodies) and again with blotted fucTa fucTb extract (for selection of xylose-specific antibodies). Blot-bound antibodies were washed extensively and eluted by pH shift as described by Frank et al. (8Frank J. Kaulfürst-Soboll H. Rips S. Koiwa H. von Schaewen A. Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1354-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sodium azide (0.02% w/v) was added as preservative. Prior to use, affinity-selected antibody fractions (α-FucHRP or α-XylHRP) were diluted 1:5 in 2× TBST. A xylose-specific antibody fraction of the PHA-L antiserum was obtained basically as described for the HRP antiserum. Prior to incubation with blotted fucTa fucTb extract, the crude PHA-L serum was diluted 1:500 in TBST. The affinity-selected α-XylPHA-L fraction was diluted 1:2.5 in TBST before use. N-Glycan modeling was done as described previously (8Frank J. Kaulfürst-Soboll H. Rips S. Koiwa H. von Schaewen A. Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1354-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using GlyProt for in silico analyses of glycoproteins. Pure PHA-L glycoprotein (8 μg, obtained from Sigma) was incubated with 6.4 units of recombinant α1,3-specific mannosidase (exoenzyme, obtained from New England Biolabs) in provided buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. Plant extracts (20 or 40 μg of protein each) were incubated with purified, recombinant Drosophila Golgi α-mannosidase II (Ref. 37Shah N. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9570-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and references cited therein) in 40 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, overnight at 37 °C, followed by incubation with (or without) 4–8 units recombinant β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (specific hexosaminidase; New England Biolabs) in provided buffer for 4 h at 37 °C. Treated glycoprotein samples and plant extracts were subjected to immunoblot analyses. Arabidopsis hgl1 mutants are salt-sensitive (6Kang J.S. Frank J. Kang C.H. Kajiura H. Vikram M. Ueda A. Kim S. Bahk J.D. Triplett B. Fujiyama K. Lee S.Y. von Schaewen A. Koiwa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5933-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) despite the fact that their hybrid N-glycans are decorated with xylose and core fucose residues (13Strasser R. Schoberer J. Jin C. Glössl J. Mach L. Steinkellner H. Plant J. 2006; 45: 789-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This implied that during the stress response, xylose and/or fucose are biologically dysfunctional or inaccessible in hgl1 N-glycans. We hypothesized that if both residues are functional in hgl1, combination of xylT or fucTa fucTb (further referred to as fucTab) mutations with hgl1 should show synergistic effects during the salt stress response. Double hgl1 xylT and triple hgl1 fucTa fucTb (further referred to as hgl1 fucTab) mutants were prepared by crossing previously established lines (6Kang J.S. Frank J. Kang C.H. Kajiura H. Vikram M. Ueda A. Kim S. Bahk J.D. Triplett B. Fujiyama K. Lee S.Y. von Schaewen A. Koiwa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5933-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and selected by PCR screening of the F2 populations (supplemental Fig. S1). Root and shoot morphology of hgl1 xylT and hgl1 fucTab plants appeared unaffected under normal growth conditions (not shown). Immunoblot analyses combined with peptide:N-Glycosidase F digests revealed that extracts of the two newly generated hgl1 mutant combinations are less well recognized by complex glycan-specific antibodies and confirmed that core fucosylation is missing in hgl1 fucTab (supplemental Fig. S2). Interestingly, whereas salt sensitivity of hgl1 fucTab was increased at 90 mm NaCl, root growth of the hgl1 xylT line was similar to hgl1. At 120 mm NaCl, which was strongly inhibitory to hgl1 single mutants, differences between hgl1 and the mutant combinations were less clear (Fig. 2). Together, these observations underscore that in hgl1 mutants, xylose residues are less functional or inaccessible at the glycoprotein surface, whereas core fucose function is not significantly compromised in planta. N-Glycan analyses verified that Arabidopsis wild type (Col-0) contains oligomannosidic and plant-specific complex N-glycans (Table 1; for details on N-glycan structure and MS profiles, see supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). Oligomannosidic and complex N-glycans lacking xylose or core fucose were found in parental xylT and fucTab, respectively. Although core fucose levels in xylT were slightly diminished, xylose amounts in fucTab were slightly elevated compared with wild type. For hgl1-1 and hgl1-2 alleles, similar N-glycan profiles with major M5XF and GnM5XF structures were found (40–45% of total N-glycans). Concerning N-glycans with both xylose and fucose residues, this fraction was similar to M3XF and Gn(2)M3XF structures of wild type (amounting to 40%). Slightly diminished core fucose levels in"
https://openalex.org/W2093447693,"Satellite cells are well known as a postnatal skeletal muscle stem cell reservoir that under injury conditions participate in repair. However, mechanisms controlling satellite cell quiescence and activation are the topic of ongoing inquiry by many laboratories. In this study, we investigated whether loss of the cell cycle regulatory factor, pRb, is associated with the re-entry of quiescent satellite cells into replication and subsequent stem cell expansion. By ablation of Rb1 using a Pax7CreER,Rb1 conditional mouse line, satellite cell number was increased 5-fold over 6 months. Furthermore, myoblasts originating from satellite cells lacking Rb1 were also increased 3-fold over 6 months, while terminal differentiation was greatly diminished. Similarly, Pax7CreER,Rb1 mice exhibited muscle fiber hypotrophy in vivo under steady state conditions as well as a delay of muscle regeneration following cardiotoxin-mediated injury. These results suggest that cell cycle re-entry of quiescent satellite cells is accelerated by lack of Rb1, resulting in the expansion of both satellite cells and their progeny in adolescent muscle. Conversely, that sustained Rb1 loss in the satellite cell lineage causes a deficit of muscle fiber formation. However, we also show that pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 activity, which will result in pRb inactivation accelerates satellite cell activation and/or expansion in a transient manner. Together, our results raise the possibility that reversible pRb inactivation in satellite cells and inhibition of protein phosphorylation may provide a new therapeutic tool for muscle atrophy by short term expansion of the muscle stem cells and myoblast pool."
https://openalex.org/W2126553213,"Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is detoxified by catalase, are implicated in fetal death and birth defects. However, embryonic levels of catalase are only ~5% of adult activity, and its protective role is not understood completely. Herein, we used mutant catalasedeficient mice [acatalasemic (aCat)] and transgenic mice expressing human catalase (hCat), which, respectively, exhibited 40-50% reductions and 2-fold elevations in the activities of embryonic and fetal brain catalase, to show that embryonic catalase protects the embryo from both physiological oxidative stress and the ROS-initiating anti-epileptic drug phenytoin. Compared to wild-type (WT) catalase-normal controls, both untreated and phenytoinexposed aCat mice exhibited a 30% increase in embryonic DNA oxidation and a >2-fold increase in embryopathies, both of which were completely blocked by protein therapy with exogenous catalase. Conversely, compared to WT controls, untreated and, to a lesser extent, phenytoinexposed hCat mice were protected, with untreated hCat embryos exhibiting a 40% decrease in embryonic DNA oxidation and up to a 67% decrease in embryopathies. Embryonic catalase accordingly plays an important protective role, and both physiological and phenytoin-enhanced oxidative stress can be embryopathic.—Abramov, J. P., Wells, P. G.

https://openalex.org/W1968149077,"Stress responses are cellular processes essential for maintenance of cellular integrity and defense against environmental and intracellular insults. Neurodegenerative conditions are linked with inadequate stress responses. Several stress-responsive genes encoding neuroprotective proteins have been identified, and among them, the heat shock proteins comprise an important group of molecular chaperones that have neuroprotective functions. However, evidence for other critical stress-responsive genes is lacking. Recent studies on the NAD synthesis enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) have uncovered a novel neuronal maintenance and protective function against activity-, injury-, or misfolded protein-induced degeneration in Drosophila and in mammalian neurons. Here, we show that NMNAT is also a novel stress response protein required for thermotolerance and mitigation of oxidative stress-induced shortened lifespan. NMNAT is transcriptionally regulated during various stress conditions including heat shock and hypoxia through heat shock factor (HSF) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α in vivo. HSF binds to nmnat promoter and induces NMNAT expression under heat shock. In contrast, under hypoxia, HIF1α up-regulates NMNAT indirectly through the induction of HSF. Our studies provide an in vivo mechanism for transcriptional regulation of NMNAT under stress and establish an essential role for this neuroprotective factor in cellular stress response.

When faced with abnormal conditions, such as heat, oxidative stress, hypoxia, or accumulation of aberrant proteins, cells implement a stress response program to protect themselves and ensure survival. Stress conditions can cause protein unfolding, misfolding, or aggregation, and the consequent inadequate response to stress can lead to developmental defects, shortened lifespan, and neurodegenerative conditions (for review, see Ref. 2Powers E.T.

It is thought that elevated expression of HSPs is sufficient to protect cells from a wide range of cytotoxic conditions (1Morimoto R.I. Santoro M.G. Nat.

However, it is unclear whether the stress response network includes essential genes other than HSPs. Although a few metabolic enzymes have been found to be up-regulated upon stress (5Cramer C.T.

Heat shock factors (HSFs) are the master stress transcription factors of heat shock response, with one HSF in invertebrates and multiple HSFs in plants and vertebrates (7Akerfelt M. Trouillet D.

Through their roles in mediating transcriptional activation of HSP genes, HSFs function in maintaining protein homeostasis and integrating cellular response to stress and development (10Akerfelt M.

Up-regulation of HSPs by HSF1 is triggered by a variety of acute and chronic stress conditions and disease states (11Ali Y.O. Kitay B.M. Zhai R.G.

The neuroprotective function of NMNAT is in part mediated through its chaperone activity independent of its NAD synthesis function (15Zhai R.G. Zhang F. Hiesinger P.R. Cao Y. Haueter C.M. Bellen H.J. Nature. 2008; 452: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although the neuronal maintenance and protective effects of NMNAT have been demonstrated, it is unclear how the nmnat gene is regulated in vivo. Interestingly, it has been observed that when human Ataxin-1 with an 82 polyglutamine expansion (hATX1[82Q]) was expressed in Drosophila brain, endogenous NMNAT protein was up-regulated and recruited to the hATX1[82Q] aggregates (15Zhai R.G. Zhang F. Hiesinger P.R. Cao Y. Haueter C.M. Bellen H.J. Nature. 2008; 452: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), indicating that the nmnat gene may respond to proteotoxic stress. Understanding the stress response of NMNAT and the regulatory mechanisms of nmnat gene expression will be important for the design of neuroprotective strategies. In this study, we investigate the role of NMNAT in stress, show that NMNAT is a stress protein that is transcriptionally up-regulated upon various stress conditions including heat shock and hypoxia, and further characterize the transcriptional circuits involved in the regulation of neuroprotective NMNAT upon induction of stress. Our studies provide an in vivo mechanism for transcriptional regulation of NMNAT under stress and extend the stress response network to include a metabolic enzyme that is critical for neuronal maintenance and protection. The following Drosophila lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center: hsf4, P{hsf+t8}1/TM3,Sb1Ser1, Hsf3/CyO, Tubulin-GAL4, GMR-GAL4, bbg-GAL4, UAS-HSF-RNAi, Df(3R)Hsp70ADf(3R)Hsp70B/Tm6, and UAS-CD8GFP. The UAS-HSF-eGFP line was a gift from Dr. J. T. Lis (Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Cornell University). The UAS-Sima and Sima/TM3 lines were gifts from Dr. P. Wappner (Instituto Leloir and FCEyN, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina). The flies were maintained on a cornmeal-molasses-yeast medium and at room temperature (22 °C) with 60–65% humidity. Antibodies against the following proteins were used in this study: NMNAT (immunofluorescence, 1:1,000; Western blotting, 1:8,000) (14Zhai R.G. Cao Y. Hiesinger P.R. Zhou Y. Mehta S.Q. Schulze K.L. Verstreken P. Bellen H.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e416Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Hsp70 (immunofluorescence, 1:250, Western blotting, 1:1,000; Stressgen), Actin (Western blotting, 1:1,000; Sigma), HSF (immunofluorescence, 1:250; kindly provided by J. T. Lis). Adult flies collected and sexed 24–48 h post-eclosion were subjected to two 1-h heat shocks at 37 °C with a 45-min room temperature period of acclimatization between shocks (21Chomyn A. Moller G. Hitchell H.K. Dev. Genet. 1979; 1: 77-79Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Following shock, the flies were collected at various time points (0–24 h after heat shock). Fly extracts were prepared to examine the induction of NMNAT at both the mRNA level (quantitative real time PCR) and protein level (by Western blotting). Adult flies collected and sexed 24–48 h post-eclosion were fed Paraquat-containing medium. Multiple concentrations of Paraquat (0, 5, 10, and 20 mm) in 1% agar, 5% sucrose medium were used in this study. Approximately 100 male or female flies were used at each drug concentration. Adult flies collected and sexed 24–48 h post-eclosion were treated for 0–24 h in 5% O2 using a calibration mixture (4.94% CO2 and N2 balance) (Airgas South Inc., Kennesaw, GA). Proteins were extracted from fly heads with a homogenizing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed with infrared dye-conjugated secondary antibodies, IR700 and IR800 (LI-COR Biosciences); the blots were imaged and processed on an Odyssey infrared imaging system. The IR700 and IR800 signals appear in green and red, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from fly heads by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each extraction, RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and 2 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription reaction with a SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Quantification of nmnat and hsp70 mRNA was performed using an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) and TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). A housekeeping gene, rp49, was used as an internal control to standardize mRNA expression. The amplification mix (25 μl) contained 100 ng of cDNA template, 12.5 μl of TaqMan universal PCR master mix, and 1 μl of gene-specific TaqMan probe-primer set. The samples were amplified by a PCR program of 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The CT value was defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescence to exceed the detection threshold, and the data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCt method to quantitatively the assess relative changes in gene expression (22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116365) Google Scholar). A thermotolerance assay was carried out as described (23Gong W.J. Golic K.G. Genetics. 2006; 172: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2-day-old flies were sexed and put into empty vials in groups of 20. The flies were given a mild heat shock in a 35 °C water bath for 30 min and immediately transferred to a 39 °C water bath. Starting from this time, the flies were examined at 10-min intervals under a light microscope, the number of paralyzed flies was counted, and then quickly returned to the 39 °C water bath. Flies were considered paralyzed if they did not move any parts of their bodies, even after the vials were tapped. The incubation at 39 °C continued until all of the flies were paralyzed. Adult flies of various genotypes were collected and sexed 24–48 h after eclosion. Cohorts of 200–300 flies were placed in groups of 25 individuals. Each group was placed in vials with no drug or with 2 mm Paraquat-supplemented food. Every day, the number of dead flies in each vial was recorded, and every third day, the flies were transferred to new vials containing fresh food with or without drug. This process was followed until all of the flies died, and the percentage of flies alive at each time point was graphed (24Greene J.C. Whitworth A.J. Kuo I. Andrews L.A. Feany M.B. Pallanck L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4078-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The results were statistically tested with the Kaplan-Meier analysis with a semiparametric log-rank test (25Walker D.W. Hájek P. Muffat J. Knoepfle D. Cornelison S. Attardi G. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16382-16387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel. L3 larval eye or wing imaginal discs were fixed in PBS with 3.5% formaldehyde for 15 min and washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.4% Triton X-100. The antibody dilutions used were: NMNAT, 1:1000; Hsp70, 1:250 (Stressgen); and secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa555 or Alexa647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 1:250. All of the antibody incubations were performed at 4 °C overnight in the presence of 5% normal goat serum. Images from fluorescently labeled specimens were taken on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope and processed using FluoView10-ASW (Olympus) and Adobe Photoshop CS3. Drosophila S2 cells were transfected using Cellfectin Reagent (Invitrogen) with pGL4-Renilla Luciferase and one of the following plasmids: pGL4-CMV-Luciferase, pGL4-nmnatPro-Luciferase, pGL4-HRE-Luciferase, pGL4-HRE+mHSEs-Luciferase, pGL4-HSEp+d-Luciferase, pGL4-mHSEp+d-Luciferase, pGL4-mHSEp-Luciferase, pGL4-mHSEd-Luciferase, or pGL4-vegfHRE-Luciferase (gift of Dr. K. Webster). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were either heat-shocked for 15 min (for heat shock element (HSE)) or treated with 100 μm DFO (hypoxia response element (HRE)) and 12 h later were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Glo luciferase system (Promega), by means of luminescence measurements using a BMG plate reader. ChIP assay was performed on chromatin obtained from S2 cells using an EZCHIP kit (Upstate), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For HSE binding ChIP, S2 cells were heat-shocked at 37 °C for 15 min. For HRE binding ChIP, S2 cells were transfected with HA-Sima and HA-Tango (Gift of Dr. Pablo Wappner) and 48 h later were treated with 100 μm DFO overnight (26Romero N.M. Irisarri M. Roth P. Cauerhff A. Samakovlis C. Wappner P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3410-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Following cross-linking, the chromatin was sheared using a Branson Sonifier 150, with seven 20-s bursts at high setting (5Cramer C.T. Cooke S. Ginsberg L.C. Kletzien R.F. Stapleton S.R. Ulrich R.G. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1995; 10: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with a 1-min hold in ice after shearing. Immunoprecipitation was followed with antibodies for either anti-HA (Millipore), anti-HSF (a gift of Dr. J. T. Lis), anti-RNA PolII (Upstate), and mouse IgG (Upstate). Reverse cross-linking and elution were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR of the ChIP DNA was performed using the Failsafe PCR kit (EpiCenter Technologies) using the following primers: DmNMNAT HSEp forward, 5′ CGGCGAAGAAAACAAAAACAAGC-3′; DmNMNAT HSEp reverse, 5′-TTCGACGTTCAACGTTCGGCGTG-3′; DmNMNAT HSEd forward, 5′-CTCTAGCCAGGCGGTTCTCT-3′; DmNMNAT HSEd reverse, 5′-AACATTGCTTTCGCTTGC-3′; DmNMNAT HRE forward, 5′-AAAAGGGTCACAAGTTCG-3′; DmNMNAT HRE reverse, 5′-TACCGCTTGTTTTTGTTTTCTTCG-3′; Dm Hsp70 HSE forward, 5′-TGCCAGAAAGAAAACTCGAGAAA-3′; Dm Hsp70 HSE reverse, 5′-GACAGAGTGAGAGAGCAATAGTACAGAGA-3′; RP49 promoter forward, 5′-CCCTGATAAGGATTGATGCTG-3′; RP49 promoter reverse, 5′-CAGACCATTGCGGTCTTTCT-3′.

To test whether the housekeeping enzyme NMNAT is a stress protein, we first examined the effects of various stress conditions on NMNAT expression in wild-type flies. We used three stress paradigms: heat shock, oxidative stress, and hypoxic stress. For heat shock stress, wild-type adult flies of 2–3 days of age were subjected to two 1-h heat shocks at 37 °C, with a 45-min room temperature period of acclimatization between shocks (21Chomyn A. Moller G. Hitchell H.K. Dev. Genet. 1979; 1: 77-79Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress was induced by feeding flies with the free radical-producing agent 1,1′ dimethyl-4–4′-bipyridynium dichloride (Paraquat). Paraquat is a quaternary nitrogen herbicide, a very toxic substance leading to acute poisoning and death (27Sittipunt C. Respir. Care. 2005; 50: 383-385PubMed Google Scholar). The toxicity of Paraquat has been attributed to the generation of the superoxide anion leading to the synthesis of more toxic reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide (28Suntres Z.E. Toxicology. 2002; 180: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In our experiments, 2-day-old flies were fed media containing 5, 10, or 20 mm Paraquat. Hypoxic stress was induced by exposing adult flies to 5% O2 for various durations. To monitor the induction of stress, we used heat shock protein Hsp70 as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1, heat shock, oxidative stress and acute hypoxia up-regulated Hsp70 at both the protein (Fig. 1A) and the mRNA transcript level (Fig. 1C), whereas the level of actin stayed constant during stress (Fig. 1A). Hsp70 is a heat shock protein that is not expressed under normal conditions (29Kabani M. Martineau C.N. Curr. Genomics. 2008; 9: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); however, we detected low protein signals at prestress conditions (Fig. 1A). This is likely because of antibody cross-reactivity to Hsc70 protein, a constitutively expressed protein (29Kabani M. Martineau C.N. Curr. Genomics. 2008; 9: 338-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To test the specificity of the Hsp70 antibody, we probed brain lysates from nonstressed hsp70 null flies (Df(3R)Hsp70A, Df(3R)Hsp70B) that lack all 12 copies of the Hsp70 gene, and detected a low signal at 70 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting the antibody has slight cross-reactivity to Hsc70 and the low level signals we detected at prestress conditions correspond to Hsc70. The level of NMNAT expression was determined both at the protein level by quantitative Western blotting using a NMNAT-specific antibody (14Zhai R.G. Cao Y. Hiesinger P.R. Zhou Y. Mehta S.Q. Schulze K.L. Verstreken P. Bellen H.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e416Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and at the transcript level by quantitative real time PCR using TaqMan probes. Interestingly, NMNAT protein (Fig. 1A) and mRNA (Fig. 1B) showed a similar trend of up-regulation, as did Hsp70 under stress conditions. Specifically, heat shock at 37 °C induced a 3-fold increase in protein level between 8 ant 12 h post-heat shock (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2) and a 3-fold increase in NMNAT transcript level at 3 h post-heat shock (Fig. 1B). Oxidative stress induced by Paraquat also caused a dose-dependent induction in NMNAT transcript and a protein level where a 3.3-fold increase was seen in flies fed with 20 mm Paraquat for 72 h (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2). Acute exposure to hypoxia (5% O2) for 3 h resulted in a 3.1-fold up-regulation in NMNAT transcript level (Fig. 1B). Note that additional protein bands above the NMNAT band (29 kDa, arrowhead in Fig. 1A) were detected in protein samples from heat shock- and hypoxia-treated groups (Fig. 1A). Because the antibody has been shown to specifically recognize NMNAT (29 kDa) (14Zhai R.G. Cao Y. Hiesinger P.R. Zhou Y. Mehta S.Q. Schulze K.L. Verstreken P. Bellen H.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e416Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and the nature of these additional bands was unclear, we included only the specific 29-kDa NMNAT band in the quantification (supplemental Fig. S2). Collectively, these results show that NMNAT was up-regulated under heat stress, hypoxia, or oxidative stress in a time- or dose-dependent manner similar to the stress protein Hsp70 (Fig. 1) as reported previously (6Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 30Banerji S.S. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29857-29863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that NMNAT may be transcriptionally up-regulated under a variety of stress conditions. To understand the transcriptional regulation of nmnat gene under stress, we analyzed the promoter region of the Drosophila nmnat gene to locate transcription factor-binding sites using the bioinformatics program MatInspector (32Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar) and identified several consensus binding elements for transcription factors HSF and HIF1α (see below and Fig. 5A), suggesting possible regulation of NMNAT via transcription factors implicated in stress. To examine whether Drosophila HSF directly regulates the transcription of nmnat upon heat shock, we measured the expression and induction of nmnat upon heat shock in HSF gain- or loss-of-function flies. For HSF gain-of-function, we used the pan-neuronal driver elav-GAL4 to overexpress UAS-HSF in the nervous system. For HSF loss-of-function, we used a temperature-sensitive mutant allele hsf4, where HSF is inactivated at 37 °C and unable to mediate transcriptional activation upon heat shock (33Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, in HSF-overexpressing flies (HSF OE), NMNAT protein was induced to a higher level in the brain upon heat shock, and both NMNAT and Hsp70 proteins were present at a moderate level prior to heat shock (Fig. 2A, middle column with red color heading, and supplemental Fig. S3A), whereas in HSF loss-of-function flies (hsf4), the induction of both Hsp70 and NMNAT upon heat shock was diminished (Fig. 2A, right column with green color heading, and supplemental Fig. S3A). Note that the Hsp70 antibody detects a faint band of 70 kDa in hsf4 flies and in wild-type flies under no stress condition (Fig. 2A), which is likely due to antibody cross-reactivity to Hsc70 protein (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 2HSF and Sima are required for the up-regulation of NMNAT. A, NMNAT levels in wild type (yw), HSF mutant, or overexpressing flies upon heat shock. HSF overexpression using elav-GAL4 induced a stronger induction of both Hsp70 and NMNAT upon heat shock. Loss of HSF in hsf4 mutant flies diminished the induction of both Hsp70 and NMNAT upon heat shock. B, NMNAT levels in wild-type (yw), Sima mutant, or overexpressing flies upon hypoxia. Sima overexpression in the nervous system enhanced up-regulation of both NMNAT and Hsp70 upon hypoxia. The loss of one copy of Sima failed to up-regulate NMNAT or Hsp70 upon hypoxia. However, the heat shock pathway was intact in Sima+/− mutant flies, because both NMNAT and Hsp70 were up-regulated after heat shock. C, changes in nmnat mRNA levels in wild-type (yw), HSF mutant, and overexpressing flies upon heat shock, normalized to rp49. HSF overexpression enhanced the up-regulation of nmnat transcript, whereas the loss of HSF diminished up-regulation post-heat shock. D, changes in nmnat transcription during hypoxia in wild-type (yw), Sima heterozygous, or overexpressing flies, normalized to rp49. Sima overexpression strongly induced nmnat transcription compared with wild-type flies, whereas the loss of one copy of Sima abolished transcriptional up-regulation of nmnat upon hypoxia. The values are expressed as the means ± S.E. (n ≥ 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of HSF on nmnat expression was also evident at the transcript level, as measured by quantitative real time PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C, nmnat was transcriptionally up-regulated upon heat shock in wild-type (yw) flies, and this up-regulation upon heat shock was enhanced in HSF-overexpressing (HSF OE) flies and was diminished in loss-of-HSF (hsf4) flies. These results suggest that heat shock transcription factor HSF is both required and sufficient for the up-regulation of NMNAT under heat shock. In addition to heat shock, we have shown that hypoxic stress also induced nmnat gene expression in wild-type flies (Fig. 1). We next examined the requirement for HIF1α for the up-regulation of NMNAT under hypoxic stress. We measured the expression and induction of nmnat upon hypoxia (5% O2) in HIF1α gain- or loss-of-function flies. For loss of function, we used a mutant allele of Sima (34Lavista-Llanos S. Centanin L. Irisarri M. Russo D.M. Gleadle J.M. Bocca S.N. Muzzopappa M. Ratcliffe P.J. Wappner P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6842-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the Drosophila homologue of HIF1α (35Bacon N.C. Wappner P. O'Rourke J.F. Bartlett S.M. Shilo B. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For gain of function, we used elav-GAL4 driver to overexpress UAS-Sima in the nervous system. When Sima was overexpressed, we observed moderate levels of NMNAT and Hsp70 protein and mRNA levels in fly brain extracts prior to hypoxia and enhanced up-regulation of NMNAT upon hypoxic stress (Fig. 2, B and D, and supplemental Fig. S3B). In contrast, flies heterozygous for Sima+/− failed to up-regulate NMNAT or Hsp70 upon hypoxia. The diminished up-regulation is specific for the hypoxic stress pathway, because both NMNAT and Hsp70 were up-regulated in Sima+/− mutant flies following heat shock stress, suggesting that the heat shock pathway was intact in these flies (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S3C). These results suggest that hypoxia transcription factor HIF1α is required to induce NMNAT under hypoxia. To assess stress responses at the cellular level, we used mosaic analyses to examine the effects of HSF or Sima on NMNAT expression. Using a photoreceptor-specific driver GMR-Gal4 (36Hay B.A. Maile R. Rubin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 5195-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we overexpressed HSF or Sima together with GFP specifically in the posterior half of the eye primordium in third instar (L3) larval eye imaginal discs. As shown in Fig. 3, in the eye primordium cells demarcated by GFP where either HSF or Sima was overexpressed, a greater induction of NMNAT was observed when L3 larvae were subjected to either heat shock or hypoxia, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2054919268,"Myotubularin is a 3-phosphoinositide phosphatase that is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy, a severe neonatal disorder in which skeletal muscle development and/or regeneration is impaired. In this report we provide evidence that siRNA-mediated silencing of myotubularin expression markedly inhibits growth factor-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, leading to activation of caspase-dependent pro-apoptotic signaling in HeLa cells and primary human skeletal muscle myotubes. Myotubularin silencing also inhibits Akt-dependent signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 as assessed by p70 S6-kinase and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Similarly, phosphorylation of FoxO transcription factors is also significantly reduced in myotubularin-deficient cells. Our data further suggest that inhibition of Akt activation and downstream survival signaling in myotubularin-deficient cells is caused by accumulation of the MTMR substrate lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate generated from the type II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PIK3C2B. Our findings are significant because they suggest that myotubularin regulates Akt activation via a cellular pool of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate that is distinct from that generated by the type III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hVps34. Because impaired Akt signaling has been tightly linked to skeletal muscle atrophy, we hypothesize that loss of Akt-dependent growth/survival cues due to impaired myotubularin function may be a critical factor underlying the severe skeletal muscle atrophy characteristic of muscle fibers in patients with X-linked myotubular myopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2082271368,"RNA folding landscapes have been described alternately as simple and as complex. The limited diversity of RNA residues and the ability of RNA to form stable secondary structures prior to adoption of a tertiary structure would appear to simplify folding relative to proteins. Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence for long-lived misfolded RNA states, and these observations have suggested rugged energy landscapes. Recently, single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies have exposed heterogeneity in many RNAs, consistent with deeply furrowed rugged landscapes. We turned to an RNA of intermediate complexity, the P4-P6 domain from the Tetrahymena group I intron, to address basic questions in RNA folding. P4-P6 exhibited long-lived heterogeneity in smFRET experiments, but the inability to observe exchange in the behavior of individual molecules led us to probe whether there was a non-conformational origin to this heterogeneity. We determined that routine protocols in RNA preparation and purification, including UV shadowing and heat annealing, cause covalent modifications that alter folding behavior. By taking measures to avoid these treatments and by purifying away damaged P4-P6 molecules, we obtained a population of P4-P6 that gave near-uniform behavior in single molecule studies. Thus, the folding landscape of P4-P6 lacks multiple deep furrows that would trap different P4-P6 molecules in different conformations and contrasts with the molecular heterogeneity that has been seen in many smFRET studies of structured RNAs. The simplicity of P4-P6 allowed us to reliably determine the thermodynamic and kinetic effects of metal ions on folding and to now begin to build more detailed models for RNA folding behavior.

https://openalex.org/W1978331805,"Generation of a diverse and self-tolerant T-cell repertoire requires appropriate interpretation of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signals by CD4(+ ) CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes. Thymocyte cell fate is dictated by the nature of TCR-major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC)-peptide interactions, with signals of higher strength leading to death (negative selection) and signals of intermediate strength leading to differentiation (positive selection). Molecules that regulate T-cell development by modulating TCR signal strength have been described but components that specifically define the boundaries between positive and negative selection remain unknown. Here we show in mice that repression of TCR-induced death pathways is critical for proper interpretation of positive selecting signals in vivo, and identify schnurri-2 (Shn2; also known as Hivep2) as a crucial death dampener. Our results indicate that Shn2(-/-) double-positive thymocytes inappropriately undergo negative selection in response to positive selecting signals, thus leading to disrupted T-cell development. Shn2(-/-) double-positive thymocytes are more sensitive to TCR-induced death in vitro and die in response to positive selection interactions in vivo. However, Shn2-deficient thymocytes can be positively selected when TCR-induced death is genetically ablated. Shn2 levels increase after TCR stimulation, indicating that integration of multiple TCR-MHC-peptide interactions may fine-tune the death threshold. Mechanistically, Shn2 functions downstream of TCR proximal signalling compenents to dampen Bax activation and the mitochondrial death pathway. Our findings uncover a critical regulator of T-cell development that controls the balance between death and differentiation."

In the current study SCGB3A2 was found to inhibit TGFβ-induced differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, a hallmark of the fibrogenic process, using pulmonary fibroblasts isolated from adult mice. This induction was through increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of SMAD7 and decreased phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3. To demonstrate the effect of SCGB3A2 on the TGFβ signaling in vivo, a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was used. Mice were administered bleomycin intratracheally followed by intravenous injection of recombinant SCGB3A2. Histological examination in conjunction with inflammatory cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids demonstrated that SCGB3A2 suppressed bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Microarray analysis was carried out using RNAs from lungs of bleomycin-treated mice with or without SCGB3A2 and normal mice treated with SCGB3A2. The results demonstrated that SCGB3A2 affects TGFβ signaling and reduces the expression of genes involved in fibrosis. This study suggests the potential utility of SCGB3A2 for targeting TGFβ signaling in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis."

In this study, we showed that ibulocydine (an isobutyrate prodrug of the specific Cdk inhibitor, BMK-Y101) is a candidate anti-cancer drug for HCC. Ibulocydine has high activity against Cdk7/cyclin H/Mat1 and Cdk9/cyclin T. Ibulocydine inhibited the growth of HCC cells more effectively than other Cdk inhibitors, including olomoucine and roscovitine, whereas ibulocydine as well as the other Cdk inhibitors and BMK-Y101 minimally influenced the growth of normal hepatocyte cells. Ibulocydine induced apoptosis in HCC cells, most likely by inhibiting Cdk7 and Cdk9. In vitro treatment of HCC cells with ibulocydine rapidly blocked phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, a process mediated by Cdk7/9. Anti-apoptotic gene products such as Mcl-1, survivin, and X-linked IAP (XIAP) are crucial for the survival of many cell types, including HCC. Following the inhibition of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, ibulocydine caused rapid down-regulation of Mcl-1, survivin, and XIAP, thus inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, ibulocydine effectively induced apoptosis in HCC xenografts with no toxic side effects. These results suggest that ibulocydine is a strong candidate anti-cancer drug for the treatment of HCC.

https://openalex.org/W2071262709,"The strictly conserved arginine residue proximal to the active site tyrosine of type IA topoisomerases is required for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA and was hypothesized to be required for positioning of the scissile phosphate for DNA cleavage to take place. Mutants of recombinant Yersinia pestis topoisomerase I with hydrophobic substitutions at this position were found in genetic screening to exhibit a dominant lethal phenotype, resulting in drastic loss in Escherichia coli viability when overexpressed. In depth biochemical analysis of E. coli topoisomerase I with the corresponding Arg-321 mutation showed that DNA cleavage can still take place in the absence of this arginine function if Mg(2+) is present to enhance the interaction of the enzyme with the scissile phosphate. However, DNA rejoining is inhibited in the absence of this conserved arginine, resulting in accumulation of the cleaved covalent intermediate and loss of relaxation activity. These new experimental results demonstrate that catalysis of DNA rejoining by type IA topoisomerases has a more stringent requirement than DNA cleavage. In addition to the divalent metal ions, the side chain of this arginine residue is required for the precise positioning of the phosphotyrosine linkage for nucleophilic attack by the 3'-OH end to result in DNA rejoining. Small molecules that can interfere or distort the enzyme-DNA interactions required for DNA rejoining by bacterial type IA topoisomerases could be developed into novel antibacterial drugs."

We previously identified MM-1α/PFD5 as a novel c-Myc-binding protein and found that MM-1α suppresses transformation activity of c-Myc.

Archaea prefoldin possesses only two subunits, prefoldin α and β, and builds up a α2β4 hexamer (11Leroux M.R. Fändrich M. Klunker D. Siegers K. Lupas A.N. Brown J.R. Schiebel E. Dobson C.M.

In both archaea and eukaryotes, prefoldin α subunits contain two β hairpins in connecting regions at both terminals, and the β subunits contain one β hairpin to assemble the prefoldin hexamer (9Siegert R.

Most of the PFD subunits have also been identified as transcriptional factors or as components of protein complexes other than chaperones, suggesting that PFD subunits are multifunctional proteins. We previously identified MM-1α/PFD5 as a novel protein that binds to the Myc box II located in the N-proximal region of c-Myc to suppress transcription and transformation activities of c-Myc (12Mori K.

We have also shown that MM-1α recruits the HDAC complex to c-Myc via TIF-1β, a corepressor, and that the c-fms gene is a target gene for this pathway (14Satou A. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H.

MM-1α also inhibits promoter activity of the human wnt4 gene, resulting in down-regulation of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway (16Yoshida T. Kitaura H. Hagio Y. Sato T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that MM-1α is a transcription-modulating factor. In addition to PFD5/MM-1α, PFD3 has been identified as a binding protein of a von Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) (17Tsuchiya H. Iseda T. Hino O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2881-2885PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been reported that PFD3 enhances NFκB activity with hepatitis B virus X protein (18Kim S.Y. Kim J.C. Kim J.K. Kim H.J. Lee H.M.

Results of studies by us and other groups regarding PFD subunits, however, raised the question of how individual PFD subunits distinguish two roles in cells. How does MM-1α, for instance, distinguish roles as a transcription-modulating factor in the nucleus and as a component of prefoldin in the cytoplasm? It has been reported that L5, L11, and L23, subunits of the 60 S ribosome, change their roles from components of ribosome to roles specific to each subunit under certain conditions: When the formation of ribosome is attenuated, L5, L11, and L23 bind to MDMs, resulting in inhibition of p53 ubiquitination (20Marechal V.

If the same situation occurs in the case of the prefoldin complex, prefoldin subunits would have roles different from those as subunits of prefoldin. In this study, to explore this possibility, cells were transfected with siRNA targeting one subunit and expression levels of prefoldin and its subunits were examined. The results showed that once the expression of one subunit was knocked down, expression levels of other subunits were also reduced and that there were specific combinations that reduced expression levels between the subunits, suggesting mutual regulation of protein levels among PFD subunits. Protease inhibitors MG132, lactacystin, and epoxomicin were purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Inhibitors for vacuolar-type H+-ATPase bafilomycin and for protein synthesis cycloheximide were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Expression vectors for PFD1, PFD2, PFD3, PFD4, MM-1α, and PFD6 were constructed by inserting corresponding cDNAs into EcoRI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3-FLAG or pcDNA3-T7. Nucleotide sequences of siRNAs targeting PFD1, PFD2, PFD3, PFD4, MM-1α, PFD6, and luciferase genes were as follows: 5′-GGAGCGAAGCGUUAAGGAAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUCCUUAACGCUUCGCUCCAG-3′ (antisense) for human PFD1, 5′-GCCUAGUGAUCGAUACACUGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGUGUAUCGAUCACUAGGCUG-3′ (antisense) for human PFD2, 5′-CCUCCUACCGAUAAAGUGUGU-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACACUUUAUCGGUAGGAGGAA-3′ (antisense) for human PFD3, 5′-CGGGAGCAACAUAAACCUUGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGGUUUAUGUUGCUCCCGAA-3′ (antisense) for human PFD4, 5′-GUCUGAACGUGCUGAACAAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUGUUCAGCACGUUCAGACAG-3′ (antisense) for human MM-1α, 5′-GUCCGGUGCUAGUCAAACAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-UGUUUGACUAGCACCGGACCC-3′ (antisense) for human PFD6, 5′-GGAGCGGACUGUCAAAGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUCUUUGACAGUCCGCUCC-3′ (antisense) for mouse PFD2, 5′-CAACGAGGGAAAAGAAUUACU-3′ (sense) and 5′-UAAUUCUUUUCCCUCGUUGCU-3′ (antisense) for mouse MM-1α, and 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGTT-3′ (antisense) for luciferase. HeLa, H1299, HepG2, HEK293T, Neuro-2a, and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) immortalized with SV40 large T antigen were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of plasmid DNAs into HEK293T and H1299 cells was carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation method and by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively. Knockdown of the expression of respective genes was carried out by transfection of 200 pmol of siRNA into cells in a 6-cm dish using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Proteins were extracted from cells with a buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Total protein concentration was measured using a BCA assay kit (Pierce), and proteins were separated on a 15.0% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blotting with respective antibodies. Proteins were then reacted with an IRDye800- (Rockland, Philadelphia, PA) or Alexa680-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and visualized by using an infrared imaging system (Odyssey, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Antibodies used were anti-PFD1 (HPA006499, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-PFD3 (K-13, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California, CA), anti-PFD5 (A01, Abnova, Taipei, TW), anti-PFD6 (AP2836a, Abgent, San Diego, CA), anti-β-actin (C4, Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-FLAG (F7425, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-T7 (Novagen, Madison, WI), anti-GFP (JL-8, Clontech, California, CA), anti-Multi ubiquitin (FK2, MBL, Nagoya, Japan) and anti-c-Myc (N-262 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Rabbit anti-PFD2 and anti-PFD4 antibodies were established after rabbits had been immunized by GST-PFD2 and GST-PFD4 and then antibodies were affinity-purified using PFD2 and PFD4-coupled affinity resins. Nucleotide sequences of the sense and antisense primers were as follows: FLAG (sense): 5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGA-3′; FLAG (antisense): 5′-CTCGAGCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTC-3′; T7 (sense): 5′-ATCGATGACAGGTGGCCAA-3′, PFD1 (sense): 5′-CAGAACGAAAAAGCATGCAC-3′; PFD1 (antisense): 5′-CTTCGTGCCATCAGCATCT-3′; PFD2 (sense): 5′-TGGAGTTGAATGAGCACAGC-3′; PFD2 (antisense): 5′-TTCTTTTCCCTTTGCCTGAA-3′; PFD3 (sense): 5′-CACCAACTCAATGGAGACCA-3′; PFD3 (antisense): 5′-AGGTCTTCCTCCAGGGAATC-3′; PFD4 (sense): 5′-GCTTGCAGATGATGATTGCTT-3′; PFD4 (antisense): 5′-TCAGCTTCAAGGTTTATGTTGC-3′; MM-1α (sense): 5′-GTTAAGTCGGCCTTCCCAAC-3′; MM-1α (antisense): 5′-CATCATTTCCATGACGGCC-3′; PFD6 (sense): 5′-GGAGGCAGAAACTTGAAGCA-3′; PFD6 (antisense): 5′-CCAGCCTCTTCCCTACTGTG-3′; GAPDH (sense): 5′-GAAATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAGG-3′; and GAPDH (antisense): 5′-CAGTAGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′. Total RNAs were prepared from cells by the acid guanidine thiocynate-phenol-chloroform method, and 1 μg of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using an oligo dT primer and BcaBEST polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) according to the supplier's protocol. The first strand of cDNA products was amplified with primers for the first 1 min at 98 °C and then 20–28 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and 30 s at 72 °C using Extaq polymerase (Takara). Amplified products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged MM-1α or an empty vector were treated with DMSO or with protease inhibitors for 4 h. Proteins were then extracted with a buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and a mixture of protease inhibitors and were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG affinity gel (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h. Precipitated proteins were washed four times with the buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and subjected to Western blotting. Proteins were extracted from HEK293T cells with a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. 600 μg of proteins was then applied to the top of a 10 ml solution with 5–15% (v/v) linear glycerol gradient in the same buffer as that described above, centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C using an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Brea), and fractionated by 0.5 ml each. Proteins in each fraction were mixed with 2 volumes of acetone, stored at −20 °C for more than 12 h to precipitate proteins, and subjected to Western blotting. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) followed by unpaired Student's t test.

Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To examine the behavior of MM-1α when PFD complex formation is inhibited, siRNAs targeting PFD2 (siPFD2), MM-1a/PFD5 (siMM-1α) as a positive control or luciferase (siLuc) as a negative control were transfected into human HeLa, H1299 and HepG2 cells and into mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), Neuro-2a and NIH3T3 cells, and the protein levels of MM-1α and PFD2 were examined by Western blotting with respective antibodies. The results showed that transfection of siPFD2 decreased expression levels of both PFD2 and MM-1α to 7–52 and 22–57%, respectively, of those in cells transfected with siLuc in all of the cell lines (Fig. 1A). siMM-1α also reduced levels of MM-1α and PFD2 to 7–38% and 16–71%, respectively, of levels in cells transfected with siLuc. Although the efficiency of knock-down in cells varied, the results suggest that siRNA targeting one gene decreased the expression levels of both MM-1α and PFD2. Next, siRNAs targeting PFD1, PFD2, PFD3, PFD4, MM-1a/PFD5, and PFD6 genes were transfected into H1299 cells. It was first confirmed that each siRNA reduced the expression level of its targeting mRNA but not the expression levels of other mRNAs (supplemental Fig. S1). Protein levels of PFD subunits were then examined by Western blotting with respective antibodies. While siLuc did not affect expression levels of PFD subunits, a siRNA reduced the expression levels of the other five PFD subunits as well as that of its targeting protein (Fig. 1B). It should, however, be noted that neither siPFD1 nor siPFD4 decreased levels of subunits other than PFD1 and PFD4, respectively, compared with other siRNAs. The PFD3 level was, for instance, reduced to 64 and 34% by siPFD1 and siPFD2, respectively. These results suggest that there is a cooperative mechanism that mutually regulates the protein level of each PFD subunit in mammalian cells. Because siRNA targeting one PFD subunit also decreased the expression level of other subunits, it is thought that the expression of each PFD subunit is mutually regulated by unknown mechanisms. To address this issue, an expression vector for T7-tagged MM-1α was transfected into H1299 cells with expression vectors for five subunits other than MM-1α or with an empty vector, and the expression level of MM-1α was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-T7 antibody. An expression vector for green fluorescence protein (GFP) was also transfected into cells to check the transfection efficiency, and the expression level of β-actin (ACTB) was examined as a loading control. As shown in Fig. 2A, the expression level of T7-MM-1α in cells was increased by 4.1-fold compared with that in cells that had been transfected with the empty vector. Because the level of GFP was not changed, the increased expression level of T7-MM-1α was not due to different transfection efficiencies. Next, to examine whether this phenomenon also occurs in other PFD subunits, H1299 cells were transfected with one PFD subunit or with other subunits and the expression level of each subunit was examined. The results showed that the expression level of each subunit was increased by about 2.7–8.1 fold after co-transfection of other PFD subunits into cells compared with the expression levels in cells that had been transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the expression level of endogenous MM-1α was found to be slightly increased after transfection of the other 5 PDF subunits into cells (Fig. 2B). Because ectopically expressed T7-MM-1α and endogenously expressed MM-1α used CMV and MM-1α gene promoters, respectively, these results suggest that mutual regulation of expression levels of PFD subunits, at least in the case of MM-1α, occurs regardless of their promoters. The expression of PFD subunits was found to be regulated at the protein level, but not at the mRNA level. Because the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is a major protein degradation system, the possibility that the UPS degrades PFD subunits was examined. HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged MM-1α. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with various concentrations of MG132, an inhibitor of the UPS, and the expression level of transfected MM-1α was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody and intensity of bands was quantified. As shown in Fig. 3A (panel a), treatment of cells with 1–50 μm MG132 for 4 h increased the level of FLAG-MM-1α by about 2-fold compared with that in cells without MG132 treatment. Treatment of cells with 25 μm MG132 for 2–24 h, on the other hand, did not increase endogenously expressed MM-1α (Fig. 3A, panel b). To clarify the different sensitivity between endogenous MM-1α and transfected MM-1α toward MG132, the distribution of MM-1α in cells was analyzed by a glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The results showed that almost all of the endogenous MM-1α was positioned in fractions 5–9 corresponding to the PFD complex and that about 70 and 30% of transfected MM-1α was positioned in fractions 5–9 and 1–4 corresponding to the PFD complex and monomer MM-1α, respectively, (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, treatment of cells with MG132 increased the rate of MM-1α positioned in fractions 2–3 (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that while almost all of the endogenous MM-1α was incorporated as a subunit into the PFD complex, some of overexpressed MM-1α was also incorporated into the PFD complex and the rest of overexpressed MM-1α that had not been incorporated into the PFD complex was degraded by the UPS. To investigate this possibility, H1299 cells were transfected with siPFD2 and then treated with MG132, and expression levels of endogenous MM-1α, PFD2 and ubiquitinated proteins were examined by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The results showed that while ubiquitinated protein levels were increased, the decreased expression level of MM-1α by addition of siPFD2 was restored after cells had been treated with MG132 in a dose-dependent manner. Next, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with T7-tagged MM-1α together with five FLAG-tagged PDF subunits other than MM-1α and treated with MG132, and expression levels of proteins were examined. GFP was also co-transfected with PFD subunits as a control to examine transfection efficiency (Fig. 3C). Like the results shown in Fig. 3A (panel a), the level of T7-MM-1α was increased by addition of MG132 to cells that had been transfected with T7-MM-1α alone. In cells that had been co-transfected with T7-MM-1α and with the other five FLAG-PFD subunits, on the other hand, MG132 had no significant effect on the T7-MM-1α level. Distribution of T7-MM-1α was also analyzed by glycerol density gradient centrifugation, and the results showed that MG132 did not change the distribution of T7-MM-1α (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that T7-MM-1α formed a PFD complex with the other five co-transfected PFD subunits, resulting in stabilization of subunits.FIGURE 3The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates protein expression of prefoldin subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2118209037,"Rhythmic activity of cells and cellular networks plays an important role in physiology. In the nervous system oscillations of electrical activity and/or second messenger concentrations are important to synchronize neuronal activity. At the molecular level, rhythmic activity can be initiated by different routes. We have recently shown that an octopamine-activated G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR; DmOctα1Rb, CG3856) from Drosophila initiates Ca2+ oscillations. Here, we have unraveled the molecular basis of cellular Ca2+ signaling controlled by the DmOctα1Rb receptor using a combination of pharmacological intervention, site-directed mutagenesis, and functional cellular Ca2+ imaging on heterologously expressed receptors. Phosphorylation of a single amino acid residue in the third intracellular loop of the GPCR by PKC is necessary and sufficient to desensitize the receptor. From its desensitized state, DmOctα1Rb is resensitized by dephosphorylation, and a new Ca2+ signal occurs on octopamine stimulation. Our findings show that transient changes of the receptor's surface profile have a strong effect on its physiological signaling properties. We expect that the detailed knowledge of DmOctα1Rb-dependent signal transduction fosters the identification of specific drugs that can be used for GPCR-mediated pest control, since octopamine serves important physiological and behavioral functions in arthropods.—Hoff M., Balfanz, S., Ehling, P., Gensch, T., Baumann, A.

https://openalex.org/W1973550153,"The inhibitor of DNA binding 2, dominant negative helix-loop-helix protein, ID2, acts as an oncogene and elevated levels of ID2 have been reported in several malignancies. Whereas some inducers of the ID2 gene have been characterized, little is known regarding the proteins capable to repress its expression. We developed siRNA microarrays to perform a large scale loss-of-function screen in human adult keratinocytes engineered to express GFP under the control of the upstream region of ID2 gene. We screened the effect of siRNA-dependent inhibition of 220 cancer-associated genes on the expression of the ID2::GFP reporter construct. Three genes NBN, RAD21, and p63 lead to a repression of ID2 promoter activity. Strikingly NBN and RAD21 are playing on major role in cell cycle progression and mitosis arrest. These results underline the pregnant need to silence ID2 expression at transcript level to promote cell cycle exit. Central to this inhibitory mechanism we find p63, a key transcription factor in epithelial development and differentiation, which binds specific cis-acting sequence within the ID2 gene promoter both in vitro and in vivo. P63 would not suppress ID2 expression, but would rather prevent excessive expression of that protein to enable the onset of keratinocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2080206103,"It was previously demonstrated that sustained activation (30-60 min) of protein kinase C (PKC) results in translocation of PKC α and βII to the pericentrion, a dynamic subset of the recycling compartment whose formation is dependent on PKC and phospholipase D (PLD). Here we investigated whether the formation of the pericentrion modulates the ability of PKC to phosphorylate substrates, especially if it reduces substrate phosphorylation by sequestering PKC. Surprisingly, using an antibody that detects phosphosubstrates of classical PKCs, the results showed that the majority of PKC phosphosubstrates are phosphorylated with delayed kinetics, correlating with the time frame of PKC translocation to the pericentrion. Substrate phosphorylation was blocked by PLD inhibitors and was not observed in response to activation of a PKC βII mutant (F663D) that is defective in interaction with PLD and in internalization. Phosphorylation was also inhibited by blocking clathrin-dependent endocytosis, demonstrating a requirement for endocytosis for the PKC-dependent major phosphorylation effects. Serotonin receptor activation by serotonin showed a similar response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, implicating a potential role of delayed kinetics in G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Evaluation of candidate substrates revealed that the phosphorylation of the PKC substrate p70S6K kinase behaved in a similar manner. Gradient-based fractionation revealed that the majority of these PKC substrates reside within the pericentrion-enriched fractions and not in the plasma membrane. Finally, proteomic analysis of the pericentrion-enriched fractions revealed several proteins as known PKC substrates and/or proteins involved in endocytic trafficking. These results reveal an important role for PKC internalization and for the pericentrion as key determinants/amplifiers of PKC action."
