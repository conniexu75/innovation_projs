https://openalex.org/W2570401594,"Oesophageal cancers are prominent worldwide; however, there are few targeted therapies and survival rates for these cancers remain dismal. Here we performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of 164 carcinomas of the oesophagus derived from Western and Eastern populations. Beyond known histopathological and epidemiologic distinctions, molecular features differentiated oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas from oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas resembled squamous carcinomas of other organs more than they did oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Our analyses identified three molecular subclasses of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, but none showed evidence for an aetiological role of human papillomavirus. Squamous cell carcinomas showed frequent genomic amplifications of CCND1 and SOX2 and/or TP63, whereas ERBB2, VEGFA and GATA4 and GATA6 were more commonly amplified in adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal adenocarcinomas strongly resembled the chromosomally unstable variant of gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting that these cancers could be considered a single disease entity. However, some molecular features, including DNA hypermethylation, occurred disproportionally in oesophageal adenocarcinomas. These data provide a framework to facilitate more rational categorization of these tumours and a foundation for new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2571390534,"Aggregation of amyloid-β peptides into fibrils or other self-assembled states is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Fibrils formed in vitro by 40- and 42-residue amyloid-β peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) are polymorphic, with variations in molecular structure that depend on fibril growth conditions. Recent experiments suggest that variations in amyloid-β fibril structure in vivo may correlate with variations in Alzheimer's disease phenotype, in analogy to distinct prion strains that are associated with different clinical and pathological phenotypes. Here we investigate correlations between structural variation and Alzheimer's disease phenotype using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) measurements on Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils prepared by seeded growth from extracts of Alzheimer's disease brain cortex. We compared two atypical Alzheimer's disease clinical subtypes-the rapidly progressive form (r-AD) and the posterior cortical atrophy variant (PCA-AD)-with a typical prolonged-duration form (t-AD). On the basis of ssNMR data from 37 cortical tissue samples from 18 individuals, we find that a single Aβ40 fibril structure is most abundant in samples from patients with t-AD and PCA-AD, whereas Aβ40 fibrils from r-AD samples exhibit a significantly greater proportion of additional structures. Data for Aβ42 fibrils indicate structural heterogeneity in most samples from all patient categories, with at least two prevalent structures. These results demonstrate the existence of a specific predominant Aβ40 fibril structure in t-AD and PCA-AD, suggest that r-AD may relate to additional fibril structures and indicate that there is a qualitative difference between Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregates in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease."

The multistep process of the metastastic colonization of tumours is influenced by the tissue and systemic microenvironment. From a screen of mutant mouse lines to identify microenvironmental modulators, David Adams, Anneliese Speak and colleagues identify SPNS2 as an important mediator of lung colonization. Deletion of Spns2 promotes tumour cell killing by natural killer cells and effector T cells, reducing the metastatic burden in mouse cancer models. Metastasis is the leading cause of death for cancer patients. This multi-stage process requires tumour cells to survive in the circulation, extravasate at distant sites, then proliferate; it involves contributions from both the tumour cell and tumour microenvironment (‘host’, which includes stromal cells and the immune system1). Studies suggest the early steps of the metastatic process are relatively efficient, with the post-extravasation regulation of tumour growth (‘colonization’) being critical in determining metastatic outcome2. Here we show the results of screening 810 mutant mouse lines using an in vivo assay to identify microenvironmental regulators of metastatic colonization. We identify 23 genes that, when disrupted in mouse, modify the ability of tumour cells to establish metastatic foci, with 19 of these genes not previously demonstrated to play a role in host control of metastasis. The largest reduction in pulmonary metastasis was observed in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter spinster homologue 2 (Spns2)-deficient mice. We demonstrate a novel outcome of S1P-mediated regulation of lymphocyte trafficking, whereby deletion of Spns2, either globally or in a lymphatic endothelial-specific manner, creates a circulating lymphopenia and a higher percentage of effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells present in the lung. This allows for potent tumour cell killing, and an overall decreased metastatic burden."
https://openalex.org/W2568959080,"Despite the global prevalence of gastric disease, there are few adequate models in which to study the fundus epithelium of the human stomach. We differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into gastric organoids containing fundic epithelium by first identifying and then recapitulating key events in embryonic fundus development. We found that disruption of Wnt/β-catenin signalling in mouse embryos led to conversion of fundic to antral epithelium, and that β-catenin activation in hPSC-derived foregut progenitors promoted the development of human fundic-type gastric organoids (hFGOs). We then used hFGOs to identify temporally distinct roles for multiple signalling pathways in epithelial morphogenesis and differentiation of fundic cell types, including chief cells and functional parietal cells. hFGOs are a powerful model for studying the development of the human fundus and the molecular bases of human gastric physiology and pathophysiology, and also represent a new platform for drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2566338991,"Physical activity, both exercise and non-exercise, has far-reaching benefits to physical health. Although exercise has also been linked to psychological health (e.g., happiness), little research has examined physical activity more broadly, taking into account non-exercise activity as well as exercise. We examined the relationship between physical activity (measured broadly) and happiness using a smartphone application. This app has collected self-reports of happiness and physical activity from over ten thousand participants, while passively gathering information about physical activity from the accelerometers on users' phones. The findings reveal that individuals who are more physically active are happier. Further, individuals are happier in the moments when they are more physically active. These results emerged when assessing activity subjectively, via self-report, or objectively, via participants' smartphone accelerometers. Overall, this research suggests that not only exercise but also non-exercise physical activity is related to happiness. This research further demonstrates how smartphones can be used to collect large-scale data to examine psychological, behavioral, and health-related phenomena as they naturally occur in everyday life."
https://openalex.org/W2532265207,"Increasing energy expenditure through activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a critical approach to treating obesity and diabetes. In this study, rutin, a natural compound extracted from mulberry and a drug used as a capillary stabilizer clinically for many years without any side effects, regulated whole-body energy metabolism by enhancing BAT activity. Rutin treatment significantly reduced adiposity, increased energy expenditure, and improved glucose homeostasis in both genetically obese (Db/Db) and diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Rutin also induced brown-like adipocyte (beige) formation in subcutaneous adipose tissue in both obesity mouse models. Mechanistically, we found that rutin directly bound to and stabilized SIRT1, leading to hypoacetylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α protein, which stimulated Tfam transactivation and eventually augmented the number of mitochondria and UCP1 activity in BAT. These findings reveal that rutin is a novel small molecule that activates BAT and may provide a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of metabolic disorders.-Yuan, X., Wei, G., You, Y., Huang, Y., Lee, H.

https://openalex.org/W2562774211,"Most cases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are sporadic, but a small percentage of AD cases, called familial AD (FAD), are associated with mutations in presenilin 1, presenilin 2, or the amyloid precursor protein. Amyloid precursor protein mutations falling within the amyloid-β (Aβ) sequence lead to a wide range of disease phenotypes. There is increasing evidence that distinct amyloid structures distinguished by amyloid conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies have similarly distinct roles in pathology. It is possible that this phenotypic diversity of FAD associated with mutations within the Aβ sequence is due to differences in the conformations adopted by mutant Aβ peptides, but the effects of FAD mutations on aggregation kinetics and conformational and morphological changes of the Aβ peptide are poorly defined. To gain more insight into this possibility, we therefore investigated the effects of 11 FAD mutations on the aggregation kinetics of Aβ, as well as its ability to form distinct conformations recognized by a panel of amyloid conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. We found that most FAD mutations increased the rate of aggregation of Aβ. The FAD mutations also led to the adoption of alternative amyloid conformations distinguished by monoclonal antibodies and resulted in the formation of distinct aggregate morphologies as determined by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, several of the mutant peptides displayed a large reduction in thioflavin T fluorescence, despite forming abundant fibrils indicating that thioflavin T is a probe of conformational polymorphisms rather than a reliable indicator of fibrillization. Taken together, these results indicate that FAD mutations falling within the Aβ sequence lead to dramatic changes in aggregation kinetics and influence the ability of Aβ to form immunologically and morphologically distinct amyloid structures. Most cases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are sporadic, but a small percentage of AD cases, called familial AD (FAD), are associated with mutations in presenilin 1, presenilin 2, or the amyloid precursor protein.

Familial AD (FAD) is associated with mutations in presenilins 1 and 2 and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is sequentially cleaved by the enzymes β- and γ-secretase to yield the Aβ peptide (1Weggen S. Beher D. Molecular consequences of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin mutations causing autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimers Res. Ther. 2012; 4: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). APP mutations leading to FAD either fall within the Aβ(1–43) region of the protein or are adjacent to the N or C terminus of the Aβ sequence. Typically, the mutations adjacent to the N terminus of the Aβ sequence lead to an increased production of all Aβ species, whereas the ones near the C terminus lead to an increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (2Bertram L. Tanzi R.E. Thirty years of Alzheimer's disease genetics: the implications of systematic meta-analyses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 768-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 3Benilova I.

There are also several FAD mutations that occur within the Aβ region of APP that have been reported in the literature. These amino acid substitutions have been reported to increase the amount of Aβ produced, increase the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40, increase the aggregation potential of the mutant Aβ variant, or promote the formation of particularly toxic conformations of aggregates, such as oligomers (1Weggen S. Beher D. Molecular consequences of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin mutations causing autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimers Res. Ther. 2012; 4: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For example, the recessive A2V mutation is reported to increase Aβ production (4Di Fede G. Catania M. Morbin M. Rossi G. Suardi S.

The Osaka (E22Δ) mutation accelerates Aβ aggregation without affecting total Aβ levels (6Ovchinnikova O.Y. Finder V.H. Vodopivec I. Nitsch R.M. Glockshuber R.

Other Aβ FAD mutations, such as the Italian (E22K) and Arctic (E22G) mutations, are believed to exert their pathogenic effects by inducing the formation of stable oligomers and protofibrils (7Masuda Y.

One of the most interesting features of the FAD mutations within the Aβ sequence is that they lead to remarkable phenotypic diversity reminiscent of prion strain polymorphisms (1Weggen S. Beher D. Molecular consequences of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin mutations causing autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimers Res. Ther. 2012; 4: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Zhang-Nunes S.X. Maat-Schieman M.L. van Duinen S.G. Roos R.A. Frosch M.P. Greenberg S.M. The cerebral β-amyloid angiopathies: hereditary and sporadic.Brain Pathol. 2006; 16: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Some of the FAD mutations within the Aβ42 sequence lead to severe early-onset dementia and AD, whereas other FAD mutations that cluster at residues 21–23 lead to familial cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a disease distinct from AD characterized by microhemorrhages and often premature death (1Weggen S. Beher D. Molecular consequences of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin mutations causing autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimers Res.

Neurol. 2011; 7: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Not only do several FAD Aβ mutations lead to CAA, which distinguishes these mutations from others causing only Alzheimer’s dementia, but there is significant heterogeneity among these mutations in terms of pathological findings in patients (12Di Fede G. Giaccone G. Tagliavini F. Hereditary and sporadic β-amyloidoses.Front. Biosci. 2013; 18: 1202-1226Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 13Pezzini A. Del Zotto E. Volonghi I. Giossi A. Costa P.

For instance, although most of these FAD mutations lead to hemorrhagic strokes, strokes are relatively rare in patients suffering from FAD due to the Arctic (E22G) and Iowa (D23N) mutations (13Pezzini A. Del Zotto E. Volonghi I. Giossi A. Costa P. Padovani A. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: a common cause of cerebral hemorrhage.Curr. Med.

Neurol. 49, 691–693).: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The A21G mutation is unique among the CAA-causing FAD mutations in that it increases total Aβ production in addition to causing biochemical and structural alterations in Aβ (16Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J.P. Cho H.S. Greenberg S.M. Rebeck G.W. Pathogenic effects of D23N Iowa mutant amyloid β-protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Several CAA-associated mutations are associated with unique clinical findings. For instance, about half of the patients with CAA due to the Dutch (E22Q) mutation suffer from recurring seizures (17Luyendijk W. Bots G.T. Vegter-van der Vlis M. Went L.N. Frangione B. Hereditary cerebral haemorrhage caused by cortical amyloid angiopathy.J. Neurol. Sci. 1988; 85: 267-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similarly, patients with CAA of the Piedmont (L34V) type suffer from paresthesia and impaired movements not seen in cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to other FAD mutations (18Obici L. Demarchi A. de Rosa G. Bellotti V. Marciano S. Donadei S. Arbustini E. Palladini G. Diegoli M. Genovese E. Ferrari G. Coverlizza S. Merlini G. A novel AβPP mutation exclusively associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.Ann. Neurol. 2005; 58: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Dutch and Piedmont mutations differentially activate mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in endothelial and smooth muscle cells (19Fossati S. Cam J. Meyerson J. Mezhericher E. Romero I.A. Couraud P.O. Weksler B.B. Ghiso J. Rostagno A. Differential activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways by vasculotropic amyloid-β variants in cells composing the cerebral vessel walls.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Another example of a unique clinical feature associated with a particular FAD Aβ mutation is the distinctive presence of myoclonus and vocabulary and speech problems in patients suffering from CAA caused by the Iowa mutation (15Grabowski T.J. Cho H.S. Vonsattel J.P. Rebeck G.W. Greenberg S.M. Novel amyloid precursor protein mutation in an Iowa family with dementia and severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy.Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49 (Comment in (2001) Ann. Neurol. 49, 691–693).: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Although there is a large body of research on some of these FAD mutations, others have not been extensively studied, and there are conflicting reports regarding the effects of several FAD mutations (1Weggen S. Beher D. Molecular consequences of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin mutations causing autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimers Res. Ther. 2012; 4: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). There is an increasing understanding of the conformational diversity of amyloid Aβ oligomer and fibril structures both in vitro and in vivo that may underlie their pathological phenotypic diversity (20Glabe C.G. Structural classification of toxic amyloid oligomers.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29639-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 21Eisenberg D. Jucker M. The amyloid state of proteins in human diseases.Cell. 2012; 148: 1188-1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). This is of particular interest here because of the possibility that conformational variation may explain the phenotypic variation associated with FAD mutations within Aβ. Conformation-dependent aggregation-specific monoclonal antibodies can distinguish multiple conformations of amyloid that accumulate at specific times and in unique locations in human AD and transgenic mouse brains and in vitro (22Kayed R.

We have compared the effects of a comprehensive number of FAD amino acid substitutions in Aβ40 on the aggregation state and conformation of Aβ using a panel of amyloid conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies we have described previously (22Kayed R. Canto I. Breydo L. Rasool S. Lukacsovich T. Wu J. Albay 3rd, R. Pensalfini A. Yeung S. Head E. Marsh J.L. Glabe C.

Here, we report that most of the FAD mutations lead to a dramatic increase in the rate of aggregation, differences in maximum thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence intensity, and sizes of aggregates. These mutations also alter the conformational trajectory of Aβ to aggregate into specific conformations recognized by mOC antibodies. The different FAD mutations also result in differences in the ability of Aβ to form fibrils and in the morphology of the fibrils that are formed, as seen by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine such a large number of Aβ peptides containing FAD mutations as an ensemble and under carefully controlled aggregation conditions. As such, it allows for comparisons among the different peptides without the confounding differences in methodology or experimental technique that may arise from comparing results from smaller independent studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that single amino acid Aβ mutations associated with FAD lead to alterations in the structure of Aβ, which are associated with differential aggregation kinetics, morphologies, and immunological reactivity patterns. These conformational changes may underlie the pathological polymorphism of FAD. However, some mutations have no discernable effect on aggregation or conformation of the peptide and may exert their effects by causing the misfolding of APP and necessitating its degradation to prevent aggregation. The 11 mutations studied and their reported pathologic effects and disease phenotypes are summarized in Table 1. To study the aggregation kinetics of the different Aβ variants and to compare them with WT Aβ40, we began an aggregation reaction using condition A (resuspension in NaOH, followed by dilution in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), immediately transferred the reaction mixtures to a 96-well plate, and recorded ThT fluorescence measurements from the plate over a 40-h time course. Readings were obtained every 10 min, and the results are presented as the mean of triplicate absorbance values for each time point (Fig. 1). Most of the FAD mutations cause a decrease in the lag time and an increase in the rate of aggregation, including E22G, L34V, D7N, E22K, A2V, and H6R. This effect is not restricted to mutations falling within a specific region of the Aβ sequence, as the mutations leading to increases in the rate of aggregation may be N- or C-terminal, or fall within the mid-region of Aβ. The A21G and E22Q mutations exhibit longer lag times, whereas E22Δ rapidly aggregates into species with very low ThT binding (Fig. 1b). We can also divide the Aβ variants into two broad groups based on their maximum ThT fluorescence levels. Whereas the D7N, E22G, E22K, D23N, and L34V variants had higher maximum fluorescence values than those obtained with the WT peptide, the remaining FAD mutant Aβs (A2V, H6R, A21G, E22Δ, and E22Q) had maximum fluorescence values approximately the same as or lower than that obtained with WT Aβ (Fig. 1). Among the higher fluorescing group, the E22G variant has the shortest lag phase, followed by the L34V, E22K, D23N, and D7N variants (Fig. 1a). There was also some variation in the maximum ThT fluorescence within this highly specific fluorescence group, with the E22G and L34V mutants exhibiting higher ThT fluorescence values than the E22K, D23N, and D7N peptides. We observed biphasic aggregation courses for the WT, H6R, and D7N peptides, which may be associated with the initial formation of structures with weak ThT binding followed by a conformational conversion to structures with higher ThT binding. Alternatively, the biphasic aggregation courses may indicate the presence of kinetically stable oligomeric intermediates, followed by a secondary nucleation event. Although such biphasic ThT fluorescence curves are not uncommon, the fact that only three of the 11 Aβ peptides display this aggregation pattern indicates that FAD mutations lead to changes in the aggregation dynamics of Aβ. Our data are consistent with reports of ThT binding to distinct β-sheet-rich structures (28Groenning M. Olsen L. van de Weert M. Flink J.M. Frokjaer S. Jørgensen F.S. Study on the binding of thioflavin T to β-sheet-rich and non-β-sheet cavities.J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 158: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and suggest the formation of aggregates with differential conformations by the FAD mutant Aβ variants. The ThT fluorescence curve for the E22K variant was particularly interesting due to the fact that the fluorescence values for this peptide gradually decreased over the 40-h time course after reaching a maximum at 3 h. This particular trend may indicate the slow conformational conversion of the aggregates of this peptide into an alternative structure that displays lower ThT binding and fluorescence. The results obtained with the E22Δ mutant Aβ are particularly striking, as this peptide demonstrates very low ThT fluorescence in this assay and yet forms abundant fibrils, as observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 2). Our results are consistent with previous reports describing the rapid aggregation of this peptide into a unique fibril structure with very low specific ThT fluorescence (29Cloe A.L. Orgel J.P. Sachleben J.R. Tycko R. Meredith S.C.

The atypical nature of E22Δ Aβ aggregates is further demonstrated by the fact that brains of patients suffering from FAD associated with this mutation reveal little Pittsburgh compound B binding in positron emission tomography scans despite the tendency of the peptide to aggregate aggressively (31Shimada H.

Chandra D. Singh K.K. NADPH oxidase 4 is an oncoprotein localized to mitochondria.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2010; 10: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) where its interaction with complex I has been reported to inhibit the activity of this complex (30Kozieł R. Pircher H. Kratochwil M. Lener B. Hermann M. Dencher N.A. Jansen-Dürr P. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I is inactivated by NADPH oxidase Nox4.Biochem. J. 2013; 452: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Additionally, Nox4 has been suggested to regulate urine levels of the metabolite fumarate by controlling the activity of fumarate hydratase (31You Y.H. Quach T. Saito R. Pham J. Sharma K. Metabolomics reveals a key role for fumarate in mediating the effects of NADPH oxidase 4 in diabetic kidney disease.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27: 466-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); however, to date a knowledge gap remains regarding the role of Nox4 in controlling mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolism. Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that a redox imbalance underlies the persistence of lung fibrosis in response to airway injury in aged mice (32Hecker L. Logsdon N.J. Kurundkar D. Kurundkar A. Bernard K. Hock T. Meldrum E. Sanders Y.Y. Thannickal V.J. Reversal of persistent fibrosis in aging by targeting Nox4-Nrf2 redox imbalance.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 231ra47Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). An increase in Nox4 activity associated with deficient Nrf2-driven cytoprotective responses characterizes this redox imbalance. Nrf2 is an oxidative stress-sensitive transcription factor that controls the expression of genes involved in antioxidant defense and detoxification (33Kansanen E. Kuosmanen S.M. Leinonen H. Levonen A.L. The Keap1-Nrf2 pathway: mechanisms of activation and dysregulation in cancer.Redox Biol. 2013; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested a fundamental role of Nrf2 in regulating mitochondrial function (34Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Abramov A.Y. The emerging role of Nrf2 in mitochondrial function.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 88: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the role of Nox4 in mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics. We found that endogenously expressed Nox4 represses mitochondrial biogenesis. This effect of Nox4 is mediated downstream of PGC-1α via a mechanism that involves Nrf2. This study supports the essential and opposing roles of Nox4 and Nrf2 signaling in the control of mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics. To determine whether Nox4 modulates mitochondrial bioenergetics, we analyzed oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of lung fibroblasts isolated from Nox4+/+ or Nox4−/− mice. Nox4−/− lung fibroblasts demonstrated a marked increase in maximal respiration in response to carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) compared with controls (Nox4+/+ fibroblasts). The reserve capacity, which represents the bioenergetic capacity of cells in response to increased energy demands or oxidative stress, was also significantly increased in Nox4−/− lung fibroblasts compared with controls (Fig. 1, A and B). To investigate whether Nox4 deficiency mediates its effect on OCR by up-regulating the electron transport chain (ETC) activity, we measured the oxidation of complex I and II linked substrates. In this assay Nox4+/+ or Nox4−/− lung fibroblasts were permeabilized with plasma membrane permeabilizer (PMP, a mutant recombinant perfringolysin O) (35Divakaruni A.S. Rogers G.W. Murphy A.N. Measuring mitochondrial function in permeabilized cells using the seahorse XF analyzer or a clark-type oxygen electrode.Curr. Protoc. Toxicol. 2014; 60 (25.2.1–16)Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and OCR was measured in response to exogenous addition of complex I or II substrates (pyruvate/malate or succinate) and inhibitors of the ETC (rotenone or antimycin A) in the presence of ADP (36Salabei J.K. Gibb A.A. Hill B.G. Comprehensive measurement of respiratory activity in permeabilized cells using extracellular flux analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 421-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Complex I and II activity was significantly increased in Nox4−/− lung fibroblasts compared with controls (Fig. 1C). Together, these data suggest that Nox4 negatively regulates mitochondrial bioenergetics, including the capacity of mitochondria to respond to increased energetic demand. To confirm these observations, we next investigated whether the increase in OCR observed in Nox4-deficient cells results from the stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Normal human lung diploid fibroblasts (IMR-90) were transfected with non-targeting (NT) or Nox4-specific siRNA. Nox4 silencing was confirmed at the mRNA level by real-time PCR (Fig. 2A). The mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratio was quantified by real-time PCR. Nox4-silenced fibroblasts demonstrated a 3-fold increase (n = 18, p < 0.005) in mitochondrial DNA copy number compared with controls (Fig. 2B). We observed similar effects on the mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratio when Nox4 activity was blocked using the Nox1/Nox4 inhibitor GKT137831 (37Jiang J.X. Chen X. Serizawa N. Szyndralewiez C. Page P. Schröder K. Brandes R.P. Devaraj S. Török N.J. Liver fibrosis and hepatocyte apoptosis are attenuated by GKT137831, a novel NOX4/NOX1 inhibitor in vivo.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2012; 53: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), albeit to a lesser extent; a 1.8-fold increase compared with controls, n = 12, p < 0.005 (Fig. 2C). Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the up-regulation of TFAM, a transcription factor that ensures mitochondrial DNA replication during biogenesis. To determine whether Nox4 silencing mediates its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis via TFAM, we studied the effects of dual silencing of both Nox4 and TFAM on the mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratio. Human lung fibroblasts were transfected with NT, Nox4, TFAM, or Nox4 plus TFAM siRNA (equal amounts of siRNA were transfected in each experimental group). Mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratios were assessed for each experimental group by real-time PCR. As previously observed, Nox4 silencing led to an increase in mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratios; a 2-fold increase compared with controls, n = 9, p < 0.005 (Fig. 3A). As expected, TFAM silencing decreased the mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratio; additionally, dual silencing of Nox4 and TFAM failed to rescue the increase in the mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratio observed in Nox4-silenced cells. The silencing efficiency of Nox4 and/or TFAM was confirmed at the mRNA level by real time-PCR for each experimental group (Fig. 3, B, C, and D). These data suggest that Nox4 silencing stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis via TFAM. Next, we analyzed the protein expression of mitochondrial markers, TFAM, citrate synthase (38Larsen S. Nielsen J.

The protein levels of these mitochondrial markers were increased in Nox4 siRNA-treated cells compared with controls, an effect that was partially reversed by silencing of TFAM in Nox4-silenced cells (Fig. 3, E and F). Together, these data indicate that Nox4 silencing increases levels of mitochondrial proteins in human lung fibroblasts via TFAM up-regulation. Mitochondrial biogenesis has been reported to be induced by the phosphorylation of PGC-1α, a co-activator of transcription that binds to NRF-1 to activate the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (12Puigserver P.

Invited review: contractile activity-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle.J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 1137-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). To determine whether Nox4 silencing mediates its effect on mitochondrial biogenesis by activating the PGC-1α/NRF-1 axis for mitochondrial biogenesis signaling, we analyzed the expression of phosphorylated PGC-1α and TFAM in total cell lysates isolated from control or Nox4-silenced human lung fibroblasts. We observed that Nox4 silencing did not induce PGC-1α phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas it led to a 3-fold increase in TFAM protein levels compared with controls (n = 3, p < 0.005) (Fig. 4, A and C). These data suggest that Nox4 silencing stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing TFAM protein levels independently of PGC-1α activation. To determine whether Nox4 silencing increases TFAM protein levels through promoting TFAM transcription, we analyzed TFAM transcript levels by real-time PCR in control or Nox4-silenced cells. Nox4 silencing efficiency was assessed by real-time PCR. Nox4 silencing resulted in a 96% reduction of Nox4 mRNA level (data not shown). We observed a significant increase in TFAM transcript levels in Nox4-silenced compared with control cells (Fig. 5A). NRF-1, Nrf2, and c-Myc have been shown to activate TFAM transcription (20Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Tatro L.G. Piantadosi C.A. A new activating role for CO in cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis.J.

We analyzed the protein levels of these transcription factors in nuclear and cytosolic fractions isolated from control or Nox4-silenced cells. Although we did not observe any significant effect of Nox4 silencing on the levels of nuclear NRF-1 or c-Myc (n = 4), we observed a 2-fold increase (n = 4, p < 0.005) in nuclear Nrf2 levels in Nox4-deficient lung fibroblasts compared with controls (Fig. 5, B–E). These data suggest that Nox4 silencing might stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis by promoting TFAM transcription through an Nrf2-dependent mechanism in human lung fibroblasts. To determine whether Nox4 silencing induces mitochondrial biogenesis via Nrf2 activation, we analyzed the effect of silencing Nox4, Nrf2, or both Nox4 and Nrf2 on the levels of mitochondrial proteins in human lung fibroblasts. We analyzed the protein levels of TFAM, citrate synthase, and COX IV in total cell lysates and mitochondrial fractions isolated from NT, Nox4, Nrf2, or Nox4+Nrf2 siRNA-transfected lung fibroblasts (equal amounts of siRNA were transfected in each experimental group). Nox4 silencing increased the levels of TFAM, citrate synthase, and COX IV in both total cell lysates and mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 6, A–C). The silencing of Nrf2 in Nox4-deficient lung fibroblasts attenuated, in part, the increase in mitochondrial markers (Fig. 6, A–C). These data suggest that Nrf2 contributes to regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis induced by Nox4 deficiency. In addition, similar to a previous study (45Pendyala S. Moitra J. Kalari S. Kleeberger S.R. Zhao Y. Reddy S.P. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. Nrf2 regulates hyperoxia-induced Nox4 expression in human lung endothelium: identification of functional antioxidant response elements on the Nox4 promoter.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 50: 1749-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we found that Nrf2 silencing led to a decrease in Nox4 mRNA expression (Fig. 6D). A redox-dependent co-regulation of these proteins was further supported by the finding that Nox4 silencing increased the levels of Nrf2 mRNA (Fig. 6E), which is consistent with the effect of Nox4 silencing in increasing nuclear Nrf2 protein (Fig. 5, B and D). The analysis of Nrf2 protein levels in nuclear fractions isolated from NT, Nox4, Nrf2, or Nox4+Nrf2 siRNA-transfected fibroblasts confirmed its efficient silencing (Fig. 6F). NRF-1 and c-Myc protein levels remained similar between controls and Nrf2-deficient cells (Fig. 6F). Together, these data support the concept that de-repression of Nrf2 by Nox4 silencing contributes to TFAM expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in human lung fibroblasts. To confirm whether Nox4 modulates mitochondrial bioenergetics via a Nrf2-dependent mechanism, we investigated the effect of silencing Nox4 or Nox4+Nrf2 on OCR in human lung fibroblasts. Nox4-silenced cells exhibited a significant increase in basal, ATP-linked, maximum, and reserve OCR compared with controls (NT siRNA-transfected cells) (Fig. 7, A and B). This up-regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics in Nox4-deficient cells was abrogated in Nox4 and Nrf2 double-deficient cells. Additionally, CI and CII activity was significantly enhanced in Nox4-deficient lung fibroblasts compared with controls (Fig. 7C). This effect of Nox4 silencing on CI and CII activity was also abrogated when Nrf2 was co-silenced. Of note, the maximum mitochondrial respiration and reserve capacity were significantly reduced in Nrf2-deficient cells compared with controls (Fig. 7, A and B). This effect of Nrf2 silencing on maximum mitochondrial respiration and reserve capacity was abrogated in Nox4 and Nrf2 dually silenced cells. These data indicate that repression of mitochondrial bioenergetics by endogenous Nox4 in lung fibroblast is mediated via inhibition of an Nrf2-dependent mechanism. The regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics is a crucial adaptive response that allows organisms to survive stress or exercise (46Barbour J.A. Turner N. Mitochondrial stress signaling promotes cellular adaptations.Int. J. Cell Biol. 2014; 2014: 156020Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although a number of studies report changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and/or biogenesis to specific stimuli, mechanisms of the control of constitutive mitochondrial bioenergetics are unknown. Our study is the first to demonstrate that Nox4 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics. Our study also shows that this effect of Nox4 on mitochondrial bioenergetics and biogenesis is partly mediated by the control of endogenous Nrf2 and TFAM expression (Fig. 8). Our data suggest that Nox4 modulates the activity of enzymatic complexes within the ETC. Work of others has shown that Nox4 is localized to the mitochondria (29Graham K.A. Kulawiec M. Owens K.M.

However, in contrast to cholesterol functions, little is still known about the roles of sphingolipids and their metabolites. Perturbing the cholesterol/sphingomyelin balance was shown to induce narrow tubular plasma membrane invaginations enriched with sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), the enzyme that converts the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate, and suggested a role for sphingosine phosphorylation in endocytic membrane trafficking. Here we show that sphingosine and sphingosine-like SphK1 inhibitors induced rapid and massive formation of vesicles in diverse cell types that accumulated as dilated late endosomes. However, much smaller vesicles were formed in SphK1-deficient cells. Moreover, inhibition or deletion of SphK1 prolonged the lifetime of sphingosine-induced vesicles. Perturbing the plasma membrane cholesterol/sphingomyelin balance abrogated vesicle formation. This massive endosomal influx was accompanied by dramatic recruitment of the intracellular SphK1 and Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs domain-containing proteins endophilin-A2 and endophilin-B1 to enlarged endosomes and formation of highly dynamic filamentous networks containing endophilin-B1 and SphK1. Together, our results highlight the importance of sphingosine and its conversion to sphingosine-1-phosphate by SphK1 in endocytic membrane trafficking."

Methods and Results The study was conducted in reclaimed mining sites and metal uncontaminated areas. The limestone applications were performed over 35 years ago. Total microbial biomass was determined by Phospholipid fatty acids. Bacterial and fungal relative abundance and diversity were assessed using 454 pyrosequencing. There was a significant increase of total microbial biomass in limed sites (342 ng/g) compared to unlimed areas (149 ng/g). Chao1 estimates followed the same trend. But the total number of OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) in limed (463 OTUs) and unlimed (473 OTUs) soil samples for bacteria were similar. For fungi, OTUs were 96 and 81 for limed and unlimed soil samples, respectively. Likewise, Simpson and Shannon diversity indices revealed no significant differences between limed and unlimed sites. Bacterial and fungal groups specific to either limed or unlimed sites were identified. Five major bacterial phyla including Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were found. The latter was the most prevalent phylum in all the samples with a relative abundance of 50%. Bradyrhizobiaceae family with 12 genera including the nitrogen fixing Bradirhizobium genus was more abundant in limed sites compared to unlimed areas. For fungi, Ascomycota was the most predominant phylum in unlimed soils (46%) while Basidiomycota phylum represented 86% of all fungi in the limed areas. Conclusion Detailed analysis of the data revealed that although soil liming increases significantly the amount of microbial biomass, the level of species diversity remain statistically unchanged even though the microbial compositions of the damaged and restored sites are different. Significance and Impact of the study Soil liming still have a significant beneficial effects on soil microbial abundance and composition > 35 years after dolomitic limestone applications."
https://openalex.org/W2570081257,"Small felids influence ecosystem dynamics through prey and plant population changes. Although most of these species are threatened, they are accorded one of the lowest research efforts of all felids, and we lack basic information about them. Many felids occur in sympatry, where intraguild competition is frequent. Therefore, assessing the role of interspecific interactions along with the relative importance of landscape characteristics is necessary to understand how these species co-occur in space. Here, we selected three morphologically similar and closely related species of small Neotropical cats to evaluate the roles of interspecific interactions, geomorphometry, environmental, and anthropogenic landscape characteristics on their habitat use. We collected data with camera trapping and scat sampling in a large protected Atlantic forest remnant (35,000 ha). Throughout occupancy modeling we investigated whether these species occur together more or less frequently than would be expected by chance, while dealing with imperfect detection and incorporating possible habitat preferences into the models. We used occupancy as a measure of their habitat use. Although intraguild competition can be an important determinant of carnivore assemblages, in our system, we did not find evidence that one species affects the habitat use of the other. Evidence suggested that proximity to the nature reserve (a more protected area) was a more important driver of Neotropical spotted cats’ occurrence than interspecific interactions or geomorphometry and environmental landscape characteristics—even though our entire study area is under some type of protection. This suggests that small felids can be sensitive to the area protection status, emphasizing the importance of maintaining and creating reserves and other areas with elevated protection for the proper management and conservation of the group."

While sediment and organic detrital loads within the EAM might influence this interaction, the responses of functionally distinct fishes to changing sediment and organic loads have not been investigated. Aquarium based feeding trials were performed to assess how different sediment and organic loads affected feeding by the highly abundant surgeonfishes, Ctenochaetus striatus, a detritivore, and Acanthurus nigrofuscus, a herbivore. C. striatus were highly sensitive to even small increases in sediment loads (of just 75 g m-2), displaying a significant decline in feeding rates as sediment loads increased. Although C. striatus is a specialised detritivore, changing organic loads had no effect and suggests that selection of feeding surfaces is primarily mediated by total sediment loads rather than organic loads. By contrast, A. nigrofuscus displayed no changes to its feeding behaviour regardless of sediment or organic load. These findings highlight the complex, species-specific way that sediments may mediate key ecological processes on coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2571414125,"Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are recognized as the most toxic metal ions due to their detrimental effects not only to plants, but also to humans. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Cd and Pb treatments on seed germination, plant growth, and physiological response in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). We employed six treatments: CK (nutrient solution as control), T1 (1000 mg L-1 Pb), T2 (50 mg L-1 Cd), T3 (150 mg L-1 Cd), T4 (1000 mg L-1 Pb+50 mg L-1 Cd), T5 (1000 mg L-1 Pb+150 mg L-1 Cd). Antagonistic and synergistic actions were observed in tall fescue under Pb and Cd combined treatments. Under low Cd, plants exhibited higher relative germination rate, germ length, VSGR, catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities. Additionally, in the shoots, the gene expression level of Cu/Zn SOD, FeSOD, POD, GPX, translocation factors, MDA, EL, and soluble protein contents were reduced under Pb stress. Conversely, under high Cd level, there was a decline in NRT, Pb content in shoots, Pb translocation factors, CAT activity; and an increase in VSGR, Pb content in roots, gene expression level of Cu/ZnSOD and POD in tall fescue exposed to Pb2+ regimes. On the other hand, tall fescue plants treated with low Cd exhibited lower relative germination rate, germination index, germ length, NRT, Cd content in roots. On the other hand there was higher Cd content, Cd translocation factor, CAT and POD activities, and gene expression level of Cu/Zn SOD, FeSOD, POD, GPX under Pb treatment compared with single Cd2+ treatment in the shoots. However, after high Cd exposure, plants displayed lower NRT, Cd content, CAT activity, and exhibited higher Cd contents, Cd translocation factor, MDA content, gene expression level of Cu/ZnSOD and GPX with the presence of Pb2+ relative to single Cd2+ treatment. These findings lead to a conclusion that the presence of low Cd level impacted positively towards tall fescue growth under Pb stress, while high level of Cd impacted negatively. In summary, antioxidant enzymes responded to Cd and Pb interaction at an early stage of exposure, and their gene expression profiles provided more details of the activation of those systems."

While penitentes have been suggested as an explanation for anomalous radar data on Europa (Hobley et al. 2013), hitherto no penitentes have been identified conclusively on other planetary bodies. Regular ridges with spacing of 3000 m to 5000 m and a depth of $\sim500$ m with morphologies that resemble penitentes (Fig. 1) have been observed by the New Horizons spacecraft (Moore et al. 2016, Stern et al. 2015, Gladstone et al. 2016, Moore et al. 2017) in the Tartarus Dorsa (TD) region of Pluto (approximately 220-250$^\circ$ E, 0-20$^\circ$ N). Here we report simulations, based upon a recent model (Claudinet al. 2015) adapted to conditions on Pluto (Gladstone et al. 2016, Toigo et al. 2015), that reproduce both the tri-modal orientation and the spacing of these features by deepening penitentes. These penitentes deepen by of order 1 cm per orbital cycle in the present era and grow only during periods of relatively high atmospheric pressure, suggesting a formation timescale of several tens of millions of years, consistent with cratering ages and the current atmospheric loss rate of methane. This time scale, in turn, implies that the penitentes formed from initial topographic variations of no more than a few 10s of meters, consistent with Pluto's youngest terrains."

It was hypothesized that the A10S mutation altered the structure and function of TRMU, thereby causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we showed that the A10S mutation introduced the Ser10 dynamic electrostatic interaction with the Lys106 residue of helix 4 within the catalytic domain of TRMU. The Western blotting analysis displayed the reduced levels of TRMU in mutant cells carrying the A10S mutation. The thermal shift assay revealed the Tm value of mutant TRMU protein, lower than that of the wild-type counterpart. The A10S mutation caused marked decreases in 2-thiouridine modification of U34 of tRNALys, tRNAGlu and tRNAGln. However, the A10S mutation mildly increased the aminoacylated efficiency of tRNAs. The altered 2-thiouridine modification worsened the impairment of mitochondrial translation associated with the m.1555A→G mutation.

A novel insulin sensitizer drug candidate, BGP-15, has been shown to have protective effects in several oxidative stress-related diseases in animal and human studies. In this study, we investigated whether the protective effects of BGP-15 are predominantly via preserving mitochondrial integrity and reducing mitochondrial ROS production. BGP-15 was found to accumulate in the mitochondria, protect against ROS-induced mitochondrial depolarization and attenuate ROS-induced mitochondrial ROS production in a cell culture model, and also reduced ROS production predominantly at the complex I-III system in isolated mitochondria. At physiologically relevant concentrations, BGP-15 protected against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death by reducing both apoptosis and necrosis. Additionally, it attenuated bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production in LPS-sensitive U-251 glioma cells, suggesting that BGP-15 may have a protective role in inflammatory diseases. However, BGP-15 did not have any antioxidant effects as shown by in vitro chemical and cell culture systems.

Individuals with FASD may exhibit a characteristic facial appearance that has diagnostic utility. The mechanism by which alcohol disrupts craniofacial development is incompletely understood, as are the genetic factors that can modify individual alcohol vulnerability. Using an established avian model, we characterized the cranial transcriptome in response to alcohol to inform the mechanism underlying these cells’ vulnerability. Gallus gallus embryos having 3–6 somites were exposed to 52 mM alcohol and the cranial transcriptomes were sequenced thereafter. A total of 3422 genes had significantly differential expression. The KEGG pathways with the greatest enrichment of differentially expressed gene clusters were Ribosome (P = 1.2 x 10−17, 67 genes), Oxidative Phosphorylation (P = 4.8 x 10−12, 60 genes), RNA Polymerase (P = 2.2 x 10−3, 15 genes) and Spliceosome (P = 2.6 x 10−2, 39 genes). The preponderance of transcripts in these pathways were repressed in response to alcohol. These same gene clusters also had the greatest altered representation in our previous comparison of neural crest populations having differential vulnerability to alcohol-induced apoptosis. Comparison of differentially expressed genes in alcohol-exposed (3422) and untreated, alcohol-vulnerable (1201) transcriptomes identified 525 overlapping genes of which 257 have the same direction of transcriptional change. These included 36 ribosomal, 25 oxidative phosphorylation and 7 spliceosome genes. Using a functional approach in zebrafish, partial knockdown of ribosomal proteins zrpl11, zrpl5a, and zrps3a individually heightened vulnerability to alcohol-induced craniofacial deficits and increased apoptosis. In humans, haploinsufficiency of several of the identified ribosomal proteins are causative in craniofacial dysmorphologies such as Treacher Collins Syndrome and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia. This work suggests ribosome biogenesis may be a novel target mediating alcohol’s damage to developing neural crest. Our findings are consistent with observations that gene-environment interactions contribute to vulnerability in FASD."

Aluminum (Al), cadmium (Cd), and heat stresses are three important abiotic factors limiting soybean (Glycine max) production in southern China. To identify the suitable reference genes for normalizing the expression levels of target genes by qRT-PCR in soybean response to Al, Cd and heat stresses, we studied the expression stability of ten commonly used housekeeping genes in soybean roots and leaves under these three abiotic stresses, using five approaches, BestKeeper, Delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder. We found TUA4 is the most stable reference gene in soybean root tips under Al stress. Under Cd stress, Fbox and UKN2 are the most stable reference genes in roots and leaves, respectively, while 60S is the most suitable reference gene when analyzing both roots and leaves together. For heat stress, TUA4 and UKN2 are the most stable housekeeping genes in roots and leaves, respectively, and UKN2 is the best reference gene for analysis of roots and leaves together. To validate the reference genes, we quantified the relative expression levels of six target genes that were involved in soybean response to Al, Cd or heat stresses, respectively. The expression patterns of these target genes differed between using the most and least stable reference genes, suggesting the selection of a suitable reference gene is critical for gene expression studies."
https://openalex.org/W2567349123,"All vertebrate cell surfaces display a dense glycan layer often terminated with sialic acids, which have multiple functions due to their location and diverse modifications. The major sialic acids in most mammalian tissues are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), the latter being derived from Neu5Ac via addition of one oxygen atom at the sugar nucleotide level by CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (Cmah). Contrasting with other organs that express various ratios of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc depending on the variable expression of Cmah, Neu5Gc expression in the brain is extremely low in all vertebrates studied to date, suggesting that neural expression is detrimental to animals. However, physiological exploration of the reasons for this long term evolutionary selection has been lacking. To explore the consequences of forced expression of Neu5Gc in the brain, we have established brain-specific Cmah transgenic mice. Such Neu5Gc overexpression in the brain resulted in abnormal locomotor activity, impaired object recognition memory, and abnormal axon myelination. Brain-specific Cmah transgenic mice were also lethally sensitive to a Neu5Gc-preferring bacterial toxin, even though Neu5Gc was overexpressed only in the brain and other organs maintained endogenous Neu5Gc expression, as in wild-type mice. Therefore, the unusually strict evolutionary suppression of Neu5Gc expression in the vertebrate brain may be explained by evasion of negative effects on neural functions and by selection against pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2571126649,"The brain of diving mammals tolerates low oxygen conditions better than the brain of most terrestrial mammals. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the neurons in brain slices of the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) withstand hypoxia longer than those of mouse, and also tolerate reduced glucose supply and high lactate concentrations. This tolerance appears to be accompanied by a shift in the oxidative energy metabolism to the astrocytes in the seal while in terrestrial mammals the aerobic energy production mainly takes place in neurons. Here, we used RNA-Seq to compare the effect of hypoxia and reoxygenation in vitro on brain slices from the visual cortex of hooded seals. We saw no general reduction of gene expression, suggesting that the response to hypoxia and reoxygenation is an actively regulated process. The treatments caused the preferential upregulation of genes related to inflammation, as found before e.g. in stroke studies using mammalian models. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses showed a downregulation of genes involved in ion transport and other neuronal processes, indicative for a neuronal shutdown in response to a shortage of O2 supply. These differences may be interpreted in terms of an energy saving strategy in the seal's brain. We specifically analyzed the regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism. Hypoxia and reoxygenation caused a similar response, with upregulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism and downregulation of the components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. We also observed upregulation of the monocarboxylate transporter Mct4, suggesting increased lactate efflux. Together, these data indicate that the seal brain responds to the hypoxic challenge by a relative increase in the anaerobic energy metabolism."

In salmon, there is evidence that functional feeds can reduce the abundance of sea lice. This study aimed to determine if there were consistent changes in the skin mucus proteome that could serve as a biomarker for dietary yeast cell wall extract. The effect of dietary yeast cell wall extract on the skin mucus proteome of Atlantic salmon was examined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Forty-nine spots showed a statistically significant change in their normalised volumes between the control and yeast cell wall diets. Thirteen spots were successfully identified by peptide fragment fingerprinting and LC-MS/MS and these belonged to a variety of functions and pathways. To assess the validity of the results from the proteome approach, the gene expression of a selection of these proteins was studied in skin mRNA from two different independent feeding trials using yeast cell wall extracts. A calreticulin-like protein increased in abundance at both the protein and transcript level in response to dietary yeast cell wall extract. The calreticulin-like protein was identified as a possible biomarker for yeast-derived functional feeds since it showed the most consistent change in expression in both the mucus proteome and skin transcriptome. The discovery of such a biomarker is expected to quicken the pace of research in the application of yeast cell wall extracts."
https://openalex.org/W2564606182,"Replication is not as continuous as once thought, with DNA damage frequently stalling replication forks. Aberrant repair of stressed replication forks can result in cell death or genome instability and resulting transformation to malignancy. Stressed replication forks are most commonly repaired via homologous recombination (HR), which begins with 5′ end resection, mediated by exonuclease complexes, one of which contains Exo1. However, Exo1 requires free 5′-DNA ends upon which to act, and these are not commonly present in non-reversed stalled replication forks. To generate a free 5′ end, stalled replication forks must therefore be cleaved. Although several candidate endonucleases have been implicated in cleavage of stalled replication forks to permit end resection, the identity of such an endonuclease remains elusive. Here we show that the 5′-endonuclease EEPD1 cleaves replication forks at the junction between the lagging parental strand and the unreplicated DNA parental double strands. This cleavage creates the structure that Exo1 requires for 5′ end resection and HR initiation. We observed that EEPD1 and Exo1 interact constitutively, and Exo1 repairs stalled replication forks poorly without EEPD1. Thus, EEPD1 performs a gatekeeper function for replication fork repair by mediating the fork cleavage that permits initiation of HR-mediated repair and restart of stressed forks.

The replicating cell perpetually suffers from DNA damage from both endogenous and exogenous sources. This DNA damage creates barriers for the replication fork, and replication is not a smooth, continuous process, but rather one of intermittent stress, with forks stalling and restarting (1Costes A.

Timely, accurate fork restart is important for maintaining genome stability, and replication fork stress is a common precursor to genomic instability. This genomic instability often manifests as chromosome gain or loss, translocations, and mitotic catastrophe, with the cell dying, or worse, gaining tolerance of the chromosomal inequities, and transforming to a malignant phenotype (4Aguilera A.

Thus, 5′ end resection of stressed replication forks to initiate HR-mediated fork restart is essential to maintain the genome in its native state and to prevent transformation to malignancy. End resection appears to have two phases, an initial short resection, followed by more extensive end resection (23Truong L.N. Li Y. Shi L.Z. Hwang P.Y. He J. Wang H. Razavian N. Berns M.W. Wu X.

Mre11 and BRCA1/CtIP play roles in initiating short end resection, while two protein complexes regulate long range end resection, one that includes the Dna2 nuclease, and a second centered on Exo1.

EEPD1 also cleaves 5′ SS flap and pseudo-Y structures near the SS-DS DNA junction, but it did not cleave bubble or stem-loop structures (Fig. 1C), suggesting that it is unlikely to be involved in VDJ recombination (11Rass U.

We found that EEPD1 alone cleaves the lagging parental strand of a non-reversed replication fork structure at the bifurcation between parental and replicated strands (Fig. 2A). We then examined Exo1 exonuclease activity on parent and daughter leading and lagging strands of intact replication fork structures with and without EEPD1. We found that unless EEPD1 was present, Exo1 could not initiate 5′ end resection of the parental lagging strand (Fig. 2A). Indeed, Exo1 alone displayed little activity on the intact DS replication fork structure. We then tested the effect of EEPD1 and Exo1 on 5′ end resection of the leading daughter strands. We found that, as with the parental strand, EEPD1 promoted Exo1's exonucleolytic resection of the lagging daughter strand. In contrast, there was no effect of either nuclease, alone or in combination, on the leading daughter strand. When the D181A mutant of EEPD1, which has lost most of its endonuclease activity, replaced WT EEPD1, we found that the 5′-exonuclease activity of Exo1 on the parental lagging strand structure was markedly decreased (Fig. 2B). When the D173A mutant of Exo1, which has lost most of its nuclease activity, replaced WT Exo1, we discovered that the 5′ end resection of the parental lagging strand structure was also significantly decreased (Fig. 2C). Thus, the nuclease activities of both EEPD1 and Exo1 were necessary for proper 5′ end resection of the lagging strand of a replication fork structure. This also implies that the parental lagging DNA strand must be cleaved before Exo1 can initiate end resection at a replication fork structure, consistent with the Exo1 requirement for a free 5′ SS end (28Tsutakawa S.E. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Tainer J.A. The cutting edges in DNA repair, licensing, and fidelity: DNA and RNA repair nucleases sculpt DNA to measure twice, cut once.DNA Repair. 2014; 19: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When a truncation mutant of Exo1 that did not interact with EEPD1 was added to EEPD1, there was decreased 5′-exonucleolysis of the lagging parental strand structure (Fig. 2D). This implies that EEPD1 may assist in recruiting Exo1 to this replication fork structure and/or enhancing Exo1 nuclease activity. In addition, EEPD1 has little activity in cleavage of the leading parental strand of a replication fork structure (Fig. 2, E and F). Exo1 has a small amount of endonuclease activity on the leading parental strand (Fig. 2, E and F), likely due to its known weak 5′ flap nuclease activity (41Keijzers G. Bohr V.A. Rasmussen L.J.

https://openalex.org/W2569659233,"Background Infections with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are a global public health problem. Long-term consequences are the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Newly introduced direct acting antivirals, especially interferon-free regimens, have improved rates of sustained viral response above 90% in most patient groups and allow treating patients who were ineligible for treatment in the past. These new regimens have replaced former treatment and are recommended by current guidelines. However, there is an ongoing discussion on high pharmaceutical prices. Our aim was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of treating hepatitis C genotype 1 patients with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) treatment in Germany. Material and Methods We used a Markov cohort model to simulate disease progression and assess cost-effectiveness. The model calculates lifetime costs and outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) of SOF/LDV and other strategies. Patients were stratified by treatment status (treatment-naive and treatment-experienced) and absence/presence of cirrhosis. Different treatment strategies were compared to prior standard of care. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model robustness. Results Base-case analyses results show that in treatment-naive non-cirrhotic patients treatment with SOF/LDV dominates the prior standard of care (is more effective and less costly). In cirrhotic patients an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3,383 €/QALY was estimated. In treatment-experienced patients ICERs were 26,426 €/QALY and 1,397 €/QALY for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, respectively. Robustness of results was confirmed in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Our analysis shows that treatment with SOF/LDV is cost-effective compared to prior standard of care in all patient groups considering international costs per QALY thresholds."

Based on this, the aim of our study was to evaluate the ovarian microRNA (miRNA) profile in young and aged df/df and N mice. Ovarian tissue was collected at 5–6 months and at 21–22 months of age for miRNA sequencing. We detected a total of 404 miRNAs in the ovarian samples, from which the abundance of 22 and 33 miRNAs changed with age in N and df/df mice, respectively. Of these, only three miRNAs were commonly regulated with age between N and df/df mice, indicating a very divergent miRNA profile between genotypes. We also detected that 46 miRNAs were regulated between N and df/df mice, of which 23 were regulated exclusively in young mice, 12 exclusively in old mice and 12 commonly regulated at young and old ages. Many genes likely to be targeted by these miRNAs are involved in the FoxO, mTOR, PI3k/Akt and insulin signaling pathways. These results suggest that the aging process has a differential impact on the ovarian miRNA profile in df/df mice, and suggest that these miRNAs can be central players in the maintenance of a younger ovarian phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2567951715,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen that causes different invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD). The pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule is a main virulence factor. More than 94 capsule types have been described, but only a limited number of capsule types accounted for the majority of IPD cases before the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines. After the introduction of the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine PCV7, which covered the seven most frequent serotypes in IPD in the USA, an increase in IPD caused by non-vaccine serotypes was observed, and serotype 19A, which belongs to sequence type (ST) 199, was among the most prevalent STs. After the introduction of the extended vaccine PCV13, which includes serotype 19A, serogroup 15B/C increased in IPD. Therefore, whole genome sequences of 39 isolates of ST199 from Germany (collected between 1998 and 2011) with serotype 19A (n = 24) and serogroup 15B/C (n = 15) were obtained using an Illumina platform and were analysed to identify capsular switches within ST199. Two 19A to 15B/C serotype switch events were identified. Both events occurred before the introduction of PCV7, which indicates that a capsular switch from 19A to 15B among ST199 isolates is not unusual and is not directly linked to the vaccination. The observed serotype replacement appears to be the result of a vacant niche due to the displacement of vaccine serotypes that is now successfully occupied by ST199 clones."

Effective recovery strategies are needed for the treatment of low concentrated waste streams to prevent pollution and to stimulate recovery of this precious resource. The biological recovery of five common environmental Pt-complexes was studied under acidic conditions; the chloro-complexes PtCl42- and PtCl62-, the amine-complex Pt(NH3)4Cl2 and the pharmaceutical complexes cisplatin and carboplatin. Five bacterial species were screened on their platinum recovery potential; the Gram-negative species Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34, Geobacter metallireducens, and Pseudomonas stutzeri, and the Gram-positive species Bacillus toyonensis. Overall, PtCl42- and PtCl62- were completely recovered by all bacterial species while only S. oneidensis and C. metallidurans were able to recover cisplatin quantitatively (99%), all in the presence of H2 as electron donor at pH 2. Carboplatin was only partly recovered (max. 25% at pH 7), whereas no recovery was observed in the case of the Pt-tetraamine complex. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of both intra- and extracellular platinum particles. Flow cytometry based microbial viability assessment demonstrated the decrease in number of intact bacterial cells during platinum reduction and indicated C. metallidurans to be the most resistant species. This study showed the effective and complete biological recovery of three common Pt-complexes, and estimated the fate and transport of the Pt-complexes in wastewater treatment plants and the natural environment."
https://openalex.org/W2570107579,"Fin-angle feedback control is usually used in conventional fin stabilizers, and its actual anti-rolling effect is difficult to reach theoretical design requirements. Primarily, lift of control torque is a theoretical value calculated by static hydrodynamic characteristics of fin. However, hydrodynamic characteristics of fin are dynamic while fin is moving in waves. As a result, there is a large deviation between actual value and theoretical value of lift. Firstly, the reasons of deviation are analyzed theoretically, which could avoid a variety of interference factors and complex theoretical derivations. Secondly, a new device is designed for direct measurement of actual lift, which is composed of fin-shaft combined mechanism and sensors. This new device can make fin-shaft not only be the basic function of rotating fin, but also detect actual lift. Through analysis using stiffness matrix of Euler-Bernoulli beam, displacement of shaft-core end is measured instead of lift which is difficult to measure. Then quantitative relationship between lift and displacement is defined. Three main factors are analyzed with quantitative relationship. What is more, two installation modes of sensors and a removable shaft-end cover are proposed according to hydrodynamic characteristics of fin. Thus the new device contributes to maintenance and measurement. Lastly, the effectiveness and accuracy of device are verified by contrasting calculation and simulation on the basis of actual design parameters. And the new measuring lift method can be proved to be effective through experiments. The new device is achieved from conventional fin stabilizers. Accordingly, the reliability of original equipment is inherited. The alteration of fin stabilizers is minor, which is suitable for engineering application. In addition, the flexural properties of fin-shaft are digitized with analysis of stiffness matrix. This method provides theoretical support for engineering application by carrying out finite element analysis with computers."
https://openalex.org/W2563786814,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone involved in pivotal physiological functions in higher plants. Recently, ABA has been proven to be also secreted and active in mammals, where it stimulates the activity of innate immune cells, mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells, and insulin-releasing pancreatic β cells through a signaling pathway involving the second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). In addition to behaving like an animal hormone, ABA also holds promise as a nutraceutical plant-derived compound in humans. Many biological functions of ABA in mammals are mediated by its binding to the LANCL-2 receptor protein. A putative binding of ABA to GRP78, a key regulator of endoplasmic reticulum stress, has also been proposed. Here we investigated the role of exogenous ABA in modulating thrombopoiesis, the process of platelet generation. Our results demonstrate that expression of both LANCL-2 and GRP78 is up-regulated during hematopoietic stem cell differentiation into mature megakaryocytes (Mks). Functional ABA receptors exist in mature Mks because ABA induces an intracellular Ca2+ increase ([Ca2+] i ) through PKA activation and subsequent cADPR generation. In vitro exposure of human or murine hematopoietic progenitor cells to 10 μm ABA does not increase recombinant thrombopoietin (rTpo)-dependent Mk differentiation or platelet release. However, under conditions of cell stress induced by rTpo and serum deprivation, ABA stimulates, in a PKA- and cADPR-dependent fashion, the mitogen-activated kinase ERK 1/2, resulting in the modulation of lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members, increased Mk survival, and higher rates of platelet production. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ABA is a prosurvival factor for Mks in a Tpo-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2569046992,"The caterpillar fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis (previously called Cordyceps sinensis) has been used for centuries in Asia as a tonic to improve health and longevity. Recent studies show that O. sinensis produces a wide range of biological effects on cells, laboratory animals and humans, including anti-fatigue, anti-infection, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumor activities. In view of the rarity of O. sinensis fruiting bodies in nature, cultivation of its anamorph mycelium represents a useful alternative for large-scale production. However, O. sinensis fruiting bodies harvested in nature harbor several fungal contaminants, a phenomenon that led to the isolation and characterization of a large number of incorrect mycelium strains. We report here the isolation of a mycelium from a fruiting body of O. sinensis and we identify the isolate as O. sinensis' anamorph (also called Hirsutella sinensis) based on multi-locus sequence typing of several fungal genes (ITS, nrSSU, nrLSU, RPB1, RPB2, MCM7, β-tubulin, TEF-1α, and ATP6). The main characteristics of the isolated mycelium, including its optimal growth at low temperature (16°C) and its biochemical composition, are similar to that of O. sinensis fruiting bodies, indicating that the mycelium strain characterized here may be used as a substitute for the rare and expensive O. sinensis fruiting bodies found in nature."

To our knowledge, no studies have addressed, at the structural level, the mechanism of how decreased Ca2+ affinity in the D145E C-domain would lead to the paradox of increased affinity of the Ca2+-binding site II in the N-domain and its associated effects on the HCM phenotype. The structural consequences of HCM-causing mutations not specifically associated with alterations in the Ca2+ coordination sphere (i.e. A8V in the N-helix and A31S in the loop of the defunct Ca2+-binding site I) were explored for comparison. Among the main physiological changes associated with cardiomyopathies, the altered concentration of intracellular Ca2+ is a common feature, reflecting the fact that cTnC is one of the major Ca2+ buffers in the cardiomyocyte. A lower affinity of the C-domain for Ca2+ in the cTnC variant (D145E) compared with the WT protein has been reported (13Swindle N. Tikunova S.B. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutation D145E drastically alters calcium binding by the C-domain of cardiac troponin C.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4813-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, using an ensemble of thermodynamic and structural approaches including steady-state fluorescence, circular spectropolarimetry, NMR spectroscopy, and electron-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) we describe how altered Ca2+ binding to the C-domain of D145E impacts cTnC function in solution and in permeabilized fibers. Based on ESI-MS and nuclear spin relaxation data, the results suggest that D145E impairs both of the Ca2+-binding sites of the cTnC C-domain: site IV, due to a direct effect of the mutation at the coordination sphere, and site III as a side effect of the altered dynamics triggered by eliminating Ca2+ at site IV. Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill relaxation dispersion (CPMG-RD) measurements have captured a low populated protein-folding intermediate that is not present in the WT isoform and promotes tighter cTnC binding to permeabilized fibers. Based on our results and previous functional studies with D145E (4Landstrom A.P. Parvatiyar M.S. Pinto J.R. Marquardt M.L. Bos J.M. Tester D.J. Ommen S.R. Potter J.D. Ackerman M.J.

Our findings explain how the effects of an HCM mutation in the C-domain reflect up into the N-domain to cause an increase of Ca2+ affinity in site II, thus opening up new insights into the HCM phenotype. To examine the overall profile of Ca2+ binding, we performed Ca2+ titrations on WT cTnC and three HCM-related mutants (A8V, A31S, and D145E) using bis-ANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid) fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 1A, all curves except that for D145E were biphasic. Following an abrupt increase from pCa ∼7.0 to 5.5 or 5.0, there was a second transition from pCa ∼5.0 to 4.0. The magnitudes of these transitions were the same for WT and A8V (F/F0 = 1.69 and 1.73, respectively), showing that conformational changes associated with hydrophobic exposure during Ca2+ binding were similar (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the magnitude for A31S was much greater (F/F0 = 2.20), indicating higher hydrophobic exposure upon Ca2+ binding to the C-domain (Fig. 1A). The first transition for A31S was also greater than for the other proteins. Although the first transition was not observed for D145E, the fluorescence magnitude of the second transition was comparable to that for WT and A8V, showing that the hydrophobic exposure of the N-domain was not affected by the mutation (Fig. 1A). Evaluation of bis-ANS emission curves at pCa 9.0, the Ca2+-deficient form (apo), and 4.0, the Ca2+-saturated form (holo), revealed a greater hydrophobic exposure of D145E compared with WT at pCa 9.0, suggesting that the apo-D145E C-domain is already in an open conformation (Fig. 1B). A8V and A31S led to only modest exposure of hydrophobic patches at pCa 9.0 and 4.0 when compared with the WT. All curves except that for D145E were fit to two classes of binding sites to obtain K1 and K2 (Table 1).TABLE 1Affinity constants for Ca2+ binding to C-domain (K1) and N-domain (K2) of cTnCcTnCK1K2pCapCaWT6.27 ± 0.024.66 ± 0.14A8V6.55 ± 0.05ap < 0.05 compared with their respective WT values.4.62 ± 0.12A31S6.58 ± 0.03ap < 0.05 compared with their respective WT values.5.41 ± 0.07ap < 0.05 compared with their respective WT values.D145ENDbND, not determined.4.98 ± 0.05ap < 0.05 compared with their respective WT values.a p < 0.05 compared with their respective WT values.b ND, not determined.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutation D145E drastically alters calcium binding by the C-domain of cardiac troponin C.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4813-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), similar data obtained with bis-ANS binding to WT, A8V, and D145E proteins were interpreted as reporting first, Ca2+ binding to C-domain sites (lacking D145E), and second, nonspecific Ca2+ binding to weak Ca2+/Mg2+ sites (non-EF-hand) of the C-domain. None of the bis-ANS signal was assigned to the N-domain, and the question of whether the D145E mutation inactivates site IV was left open (13Swindle N. Tikunova S.B. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutation D145E drastically alters calcium binding by the C-domain of cardiac troponin C.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4813-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To answer this question, we first analyzed the chemical shift perturbations (CSP) obtained by comparing pCa 2.5 against pCa 7.0 (N-domain sensitivity) and pCa 6.0 against pCa 7.0 (C-domain sensitivity) through 1H-15N peak assignments (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). CSP plots for WT and D145E revealed differences in perturbed residues in both proteins (Fig. 4A). At low Ca2+ concentration (pCa 6.0–7.0) CSP values that differed by ≥1 S.D. from the average across all evaluated residues were mapped onto the cTnC structure. There were several differences in the C-domain between WT and D145E (Fig. 4B), distinguishing the two isoforms and pinpointing structural changes triggered by Ca2+ binding. Of note, the N-domain response was also different. For the Ca2+ range of high-affinity sites (pCa 6.0–7.0), residues Lys-17, Leu-48, Gln-58, Asp-75, and Met-80 are mapped onto the WT N-domain, whereas Ala-23, Phe-27, and Glu-66 are shown at right for the mutant (Fig. 4B). It is evident that structural changes in the N-domain due to Ca2+ in the WT C-domain are different from the structural changes produced in the D145E N-domain. For the Ca2+ range of low-affinity sites (pCa 2.5–7.0), several N-domain residues affected in WT were also affected in D145E, including Asp-25, Gly-30, Gly-34, Gly-42, and Gly-70, but perturbation of Gly-140 and Asp-149 in the C-domain was only observed for the mutant (Fig. 4B). The structural differences mapped here reveal sharp differences in the effect of Ca2+ on the structure of the C-domain of D145E.FIGURE 31H-15N HSQC spectrum showing the backbone assignment of NH cross-peaks for holo-D145E cTnC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4D145E eliminates the binding of two Ca2+ ions in cTnC.

First, the accurate molecular mass of WT and D145E in the absence of Ca2+ was determined by MALDI-TOF/MS. The WT and D145E forms revealed m/z values of 18,401.5 and 18,415.5 Da, respectively, and a Δm/z of 14 Da, as expected for incorporation of the methylene group due to the aspartic to glutamic acid substitution (Figs. 4C and 5, A and B). We next designed ESI-MS runs for WT and D145E under both the absence (2 mm EGTA) and presence of Ca2+ (4 mm Ca2+, no Mg2+) to measure the binding of Ca2+ by quantifying the average molecular masses. Our results revealed peak average m/z values of 18,756.6 and 18,873.4 Da for WT apo- and holoforms, respectively, and a difference between them of 116.8 Da. D145E apo- and holoforms differed by 41.1 Da, with peak average m/z values of 18,941.6 Da for the apoform and 18,982.7 Da for the holoform (Figs. 4C and 5, C–F, and Table 2). Our results show that D145E has lost the ability to bind two Ca2+ ions.TABLE 2ESI-MS analysis of WT and D145EComponentMassaPeak averaged mass.MoleculeAbundanceAbundanceS.D.Act. peakzIso. massPred. peak%Apo-WT18,756.6[M+H]+195,9001000.881104.217+18,755.11104.31173.316+18,757.91173.31251.215+18,754.61251.31340.914+18,759.91340.91443.513+18,753.51443.61564.212+18,758.91564.1Holo-WT18,873.4[M+H]+144,3551000.791573.812+18,874.515731716.811+18,873.91715.81887.910+18,870.11887Apo-D145E18,941.6[M+H]+143,5171000.371353.814+18,940.81354.61457.813+18,940.11458.71579.312+18,941.41580.21722.811+18,9411723.71894.010+18,940.21896Holo-D145E18,982.7[M+H]+159,8871000.551356.914+18,983.61356.91461.113+18,981.81461.11582.812+18,982.91582.8a Peak averaged mass. Open table in a new tab To characterize the thermal stability of WT and HCM variants, using circular dichroism we monitored the loss of secondary structure generated by rising temperatures. The apo-states of all three mutants exhibited a similar sigmoidal transition with an increase in temperature that could be fit as a three-state process. In the holo-state, only D145E maintained the three-state behavior observed for its apoform. Reversibility was observed for all constructs, and the melting temperatures at the midpoint for the first and second transitions (Tm) were extracted (Fig. 6). In the holo-state, because of increased stability for WT, A8V, and A31S, the second transition was not observed. Thus only one Tm value was extracted for this condition. Statistical significance for these differences was observed for WT against A31S (p = 0.041) and D145E (p = 0.0003) (Fig. 6). There was no difference in the thermostability of D145E in the absence or presence of Ca2+. These results show that the binding of Ca2+ to the C-domain sites of cTnC governs the increase of thermostability. The mutant, unable to bind Ca2+ at these sites, retains the two-transition profile of apo-cTnC. A detailed overview of how the mutation at Asp-145 affects the cTnC global conformation was obtained using dihedral angle restraints based on HN, Hα, Hβ, and 15N chemical shifts and the software TALOS+ to provide backbone phi and psi angles (14Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). The α-Helix and β-sheet contents were similar for D145E and WT, revealing that although the mutation impairs Ca2+ coordination, it does not affect protein secondary content (Fig. 7A). The interatomic function P(r) describes the distribution of distances r between pairs of points within a given volume (the protein particle). The expected P(r) distribution for a bilobular protein such as cTnC is a major peak at low values of r followed by a prominent shoulder at higher values of r, as clearly observed for all three holovariants. There were no significant differences in dimensional values extracted from P(r) distributions when comparing WT and D145E in the holo-state (Fig. 7, B–D). In contrast, higher Dmax values were obtained for the apo-states, as summarized in Table 3. Tertiary contacts were investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), creating a scattering profile of each protein in its apo- and holo-states (Fig. 8). Our results indicate that the mutations studied in the holo-state (A8V, A31S, and D145E) do not affect the overall conformation of cTnC. The effect of Ca2+-binding impairment on D145E stability is better observed when the protein is challenged by 5 m urea, in the holo- and apo-states. As shown on the Kratky plots, in the presence of 5 m urea, the bell shape of the WT holo-state contrasts with the WT apoform, whereas D145E is similar in both states (Fig. 7E). A continuous increase in I(s)*s2 values as a function of s in the Kratky plots is consistent with an unfolding process. Altogether our data suggest that the D145E mutation does not affect the global secondary and tertiary contacts but has lower stability because of local changes that arise from impaired Ca2+ binding.TABLE 3Dimensional values obtained by SAXS for cTnC isoformsConstructsWTA8VA31SD145EApoHoloApoHoloApoHoloApoHoloRg (Å)aRg, reciprocal space (derived using Guinier approximation).28.3 ± 0.222.5 ± 0.228.7 ± 0.322.5 ± 0.229 ± 0.223.2 ± 0.127 ± 0.521.9 ± 0.2Rg (Å)bRg, real space (calculated using the program GNOM).28.5 ± 0.0123.6 ± 0.0127.8 ± 0.0123.2 ± 0.0130.2 ± 0.0123.9 ± 0.0127.5 ± 0.0223.3 ± 0.02Dmax (Å)bRg, real space (calculated using the program GNOM).95.178.887.578.7101.679.688.476.9a Rg, reciprocal space (derived using Guinier approximation).b Rg, real space (calculated using the program GNOM).

When the data were plotted to show the R2/R1 ratio per residue, WT and D145E were markedly different (Fig. 9A, upper panel). R2/R1 values ≥ 1 S.D. from the average across all evaluated residues indicate conformational exchange motions on a μs-ms time scale. In D145E, several residues located in α-helix D (αD) (Asp-75, Phe-77, Val-79, Met-81, and Val-82), αE (Arg-102), αF (Leu-114 and Thr-124), αG (Met-137 and Gly-140), and αH (Phe-153, Glu-155, Met-157, and Gly-159) revealed values of R2/R1 more than 1 S.D. above the average (4.08 ± 0.71) (Fig. 9, B and C). This means that there are distinct regions along the backbone from αD to αH where N-H motions are slower for the mutant, presumably because of repercussions from loss of Ca2+ binding and lower stability. Of note, helices G and H flank the last EF-hand-binding site (site IV) in the C-domain. Moreover, several αD residues in the N-domain sense these slower dynamics occurring in the C-domain (Fig. 9B). Another type of information resides in the 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE values for each residue, which are related basically to internal motions of 1H-15N bonds on a much faster (ps-ns) time scale. These values were similar for WT and D145E, with average values across all residues of 0.55 ± 0.18 and 0.53 ± 0.22, respectively (Fig. 9A, lower panel). The N- and C-terminal segments of both proteins presented lower NOE values, a sign of increased flexibility at these sites. In addition, residues 87–91, forming the loop that connects the N- and C-domains, displayed negative values consistent with its flexible behavior (31Cordina N.M. Liew C.K. Gell D.A. Fajer P.G. Mackay J.P. Brown L.J. Interdomain orientation of cardiac Troponin C characterized by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR reveals a compact state.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 1376-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NOE values for these residues tended to be more negative for D145E compared with WT, indicating a more flexible linker (Fig. 9D). Conformational exchange motions on a μs-ms time scale were not present in the WT, and the R2/R1 values were not uniformly distributed among residues (Fig. 9A, upper panel), which is consistent with the presence of different correlation times (τc1 and τc2) for tumbling of the N (residues 1–90)- and C-domains (residues 91–161) of WT cardiac TnC (Fig. 9E). To quantify the conformational changes in D145E, we turned to 15N CPMG-RD measurements, which are sensitive to millisecond exchange dynamics. The effective decay constant of magnetization (R2eff) evaluated at 25 and 37 °C with refocusing pulses of 50 and 1000 Hz revealed intermediate exchange motions for D145E at both temperatures on the order of milliseconds that were not observed for WT cTnC. Of note, these movements, visible for residues 125–157 in the D145E panels of Fig. 10"

We conducted a qualitative study to explore the feasibility of STI screening among adolescent girls and young women in Mombasa, Kenya. Methods We conducted 17 in-depth interviews (IDIs) (8 with adolescent girls and 9 with young women) and 6 focus group discussions (FGDs) (4 with adolescent girls and 2 with young women, total 55 participants). The audio recordings for the IDIs and FGDs were translated and transcribed into English. Transcripts were independently reviewed by two researchers, and a set of codes was designed to help analyze the data using the content analysis approach. Data content was then analyzed manually and digitally using ATLAS.ti, and consensus was reached on central and specific emergent themes discussed by the research team. Results Adolescent girls and young women in Mombasa, Kenya expressed willingness to participate in STI screening. A major incentive for screening was participants’ desire to know their STI status, especially following perceived high-risk sexual behavior. Lack of symptoms and fear of positive test results were identified as barriers to STI screening at the individual level, while parental notification and stigmatization from parents, family members and the community were identified as barriers at the community level. Uncomfortable or embarrassing methods of specimen collection were an additional barrier. Thus, urine-based screening was felt to be the most acceptable. Conclusion Kenyan adolescent girls and young women seem willing to participate in screening for STIs using urine testing. Addressing stigmatization by parents, health care workers and the community could further facilitate STI screening in this population."

Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of strontium ranelate (SrR) treatment of osteoporosis in improving bone strength, promoting bone remodeling, and reducing the risk of fractures, but its effects on interbody fusion surgery have not been adequately investigated. SrR-treated rats subjected to interbody fusion surgery exhibited significantly higher lumbar vertebral bone mineral density after 12 weeks of treatment than rats subjected to the same surgery but not treated with SrR. Furthermore, histological and radiographic assessments showed that a greater amount of newly formed bone tissue was present and that better fusion union occurred in the SrR-treated rats than in the untreated rats. Taken together, these results show significant differences in bone mineral density, PINP level, histological score, SrR content and mechanical testing, which demonstrate a relatively moderate effect of SrR treatment on bone strength and remodeling in the specific context of recovery after an interbody fusion surgery, and suggest the potential of SrR treatment as an effective adjunct to spinal interbody fusion surgery for human patients."

Cases experienced forceful vomiting and/or 3 or more watery or looser-than-normal stools in 24 hours. Stools were tested by real-time RT-PCR for norovirus GI, GII and GIV and sapovirus GI, GII, GIV and GV. Positive samples were genotyped after sequencing conventional RT-PCR products. Norovirus was identified in 76 (31.5%) of the cases and 70 (20.4%) of the controls (p<0.001). GII.3 and GII.4 Farmington Hills were the most frequently identified genotypes in 14.5% and 30.3% of cases and 17.1% and 27.1% of controls, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2568511312,"We recently identified a remarkably strong (739 nt-long) IRES-like element in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV, Potyviridae). Here, we define the components of the cap-binding translation initiation complex that are required for TriMV translation. Using bio-layer interferometry and affinity capture of the native translation apparatus, we reveal that the viral translation element has a ten-fold greater affinity for the large subunit eIF4G/eIFiso4G than to the cap binding protein eIF4E/eIFiso4E. This data supports a translation mechanism that is largely dependent on eIF4G and its isoform. The binding of both scaffold isoforms requires an eight base-pair-long hairpin structure located 270 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation site, which we have previously shown to be crucial for IRES activity. Despite a weak binding affinity to the mRNA, eIFiso4G alone or in combination with eIFiso4E supports TriMV translation in a cap-binding factor-depleted wheat germ extract. Notably, TriMV 5’ UTR-mediated translation is dependent upon eIF4A helicase activity, as the addition of the eIF4A inhibitor hippuristanol inhibits 5’ UTR-mediated translation. This inhibition is reversible with the addition of recombinant wheat eIF4A. These results and previous observations demonstrate a key role of eIF4G and eIF4A in this unique mechanism of cap-independent-translation. This work provides new insights into the lesser studied translation mechanisms of plant virus-mediated internal translation initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2569657767,"Gene gain and loss shape both proteomes and the networks they form. The increasing availability of closely related sequenced genomes and of genome-wide network data should enable a better understanding of the evolutionary forces driving gene gain, gene loss and evolutionary network rewiring. Using orthology mappings across 23 ascomycete fungi genomes, we identified proteins that were lost, gained or universally conserved across the tree, enabling us to compare genes across all stages of their life-cycle. Based on a collection of genome-wide network and gene expression datasets from baker's yeast, as well as a few from fission yeast, we found that gene loss is more strongly associated with network and expression features of closely related species than that of distant species, consistent with the evolutionary modulation of gene loss propensity through network rewiring. We also discovered that lost and gained genes, as compared to universally conserved ""core"" genes, have more regulators, more complex expression patterns and are much more likely to encode for transcription factors. Finally, we found that the relative rate of network integration of new genes into the different types of networks agrees with experimentally measured rates of network rewiring. This systems-level view of the life-cycle of eukaryotic genes suggests that the gain and loss of genes is tightly coupled to the gain and loss of network interactions, that lineage-specific adaptations drive regulatory complexity and that the relative rates of integration of new genes are consistent with network rewiring rates."
https://openalex.org/W2567818495,"TMEM16A and TMEM16B encode for Ca2+-activated Cl− channels (CaCC) and are expressed in many cell types and play a relevant role in many physiological processes. Here, I performed a site-directed mutagenesis study to understand the molecular mechanisms of ion permeation of TMEM16B. I mutated two positive charged residues R573 and K540, respectively located at the entrance and inside the putative channel pore and I measured the properties of wild-type and mutant TMEM16B channels expressed in HEK-293 cells using whole-cell and excised inside-out patch clamp experiments. I found evidence that R573 and K540 control the ion permeability of TMEM16B depending both on which side of the membrane the ion substitution occurs and on the level of channel activation. Moreover, these residues contribute to control blockage or activation by permeant anions. Finally, R573 mutation abolishes the anomalous mole fraction effect observed in the presence of a permeable anion and it alters the apparent Ca2+-sensitivity of the channel. These findings indicate that residues facing the putative channel pore are responsible both for controlling the ion selectivity and the gating of the channel, providing an initial understanding of molecular mechanism of ion permeation in TMEM16B."
https://openalex.org/W2568482829,"Citations for randomized controlled trials (RCT) are important for the dissemination of study results. However, predictors of citations for RCTs have not been investigated. The study aimed to investigate the predictors of citations for RCTs in sepsis literature. RCTs that investigated the efficacy of treatment strategies on clinical outcomes in sepsis patients were included, and publication dates were restricted to the period from 2000 to 2016. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews and interventions. A multivariable linear regression model was built to investigate the independent variables associated with total citations. In total, 160 RCTs met our inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. The median of total citations was 28.5 (IQR: 6–76). The journal impact factor (IF) for articles was 6.312 (IQR: 3.143–7.214). The dependent variable was transformed by the square root to improve normality and meet the assumption of homoscedasticity. The journal IF (coefficient: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.25) was independently associated with total citations. Large samples were associated with more total citations (coefficient: 0.0026; 95% CI: 0.0013, 0.0039). The study demonstrated that the journal IF was a major determinant of the RCT’s total citation number."
https://openalex.org/W2568507446,"The popularity of online information generally experiences a rising and falling evolution. This paper considers the ""burst"", ""peak"", and ""fade"" key events together as a representative summary of popularity evolution. We propose a novel prediction task-predicting when popularity undergoes these key events. It is of great importance to know when these three key events occur, because doing so helps recommendation systems, online marketing, and containment of rumors. However, it is very challenging to solve this new prediction task due to two issues. First, popularity evolution has high variation and can follow various patterns, so how can we identify ""burst"", ""peak"", and ""fade"" in different patterns of popularity evolution? Second, these events usually occur in a very short time, so how can we accurately yet promptly predict them? In this paper we address these two issues. To handle the first one, we use a simple moving average to smooth variation, and then a universal method is presented for different patterns to identify the key events in popularity evolution. To deal with the second one, we extract different types of features that may have an impact on the key events, and then a correlation analysis is conducted in the feature selection step to remove irrelevant and redundant features. The remaining features are used to train a machine learning model. The feature selection step improves prediction accuracy, and in order to emphasize prediction promptness, we design a new evaluation metric which considers both accuracy and promptness to evaluate our prediction task. Experimental and comparative results show the superiority of our prediction solution."
https://openalex.org/W2568970897,"Hints from animals point to the existence of two novel small RNA (sRNA) species surrounding the transcription start sites (TSSs) and the termini of the genes, respectively. In this study, we performed a comprehensive search for the two sRNA species named promoter-associated sRNAs (PASRs) and terminus-associated sRNAs (TASRs) in Arabidopsis. By using sRNA sequencing data from wild type plants and several mutants related to the sRNA biogenesis, Argonaute (AGO) 1- and AGO4-associated sRNA sequencing data, double-stranded RNA sequencing (dsRNA-seq) data, and DNA methylation profiling data, the biogenesis and action pathways of the PASRs and the TASRs were investigated. PASR and TASR peaks were identified on hundreds of the protein-coding genes. Deep analysis uncovered that some of the sRNA peaks were covered by dsRNA-seq reads, and these peaks were significantly repressed in specific mutants. Besides, certain PASRs and TASRs were preferentially recruited by AGO4, and site-specific DNA methylation signals encompassing the genomic loci of these sRNAs were also detected. Accordingly, we proposed a model that certain PASRs and TASRs were generated through a specific Pol IV-, RDR-, DCL-dependent pathway, and they were associated with AGO4 to perform site-specific DNA methylation on their host genes. The above results indicate the existence of PASRs and TASRs in plants. The proposed biogenesis pathway and action mode of the PASRs and TASRs could facilitate us to perform in-depth functional studies on these novel sRNA species."
https://openalex.org/W2571049584,"Purpose We investigated whether lower urinary tract infection (LUTI), including cystitis or urethritis, is associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa), in a nationwide population-based cohort study. Methods We identified 14,273 men newly diagnosed with LUTI (9347 with cystitis, and 4926 with urethritis) between 1998 and 2011, from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. Each patient was randomly frequency-matched with 4 men without LUTI, based on age and index year of diagnosis. Cox’s proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of LUTI on the PCa risk. Results The risk of developing PCa was significantly higher in the cystitis cohort (adjusted HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.20–1.78) and in the urethritis cohort (adjusted HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.26–2.34) than in the group without LUTI. Further analyses indicated that patients with more than 5 medical visits for LUTI per year had a significantly greater risk of developing PCa. Conclusion We found that cystitis or urethritis may play an etiological role in the development of PCa in Taiwanese men, particularly in those with repeated medical visits for cystitis or urethritis. Further studies are warranted on the association between LUTI and PCa in other countries, particularly where the prevalence of PCa is high."
https://openalex.org/W2568269535,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor that continues to be associated with neurological morbidity and poor survival times. Brain invasion is a fundamental property of malignant glioma cells. The Go-or-Grow (GoG) phenotype proposes that cancer cell motility and proliferation are mutually exclusive. Here, we construct and apply a single glioma cell mathematical model that includes motility and angiogenesis and lacks the GoG phenotype. Simulations replicate key features of GBM including its multilayer structure (i.e.edema, enhancement, and necrosis), its progression patterns associated with bevacizumab treatment, and replicate the survival times of GBM treated or untreated with bevacizumab. These results suggest that the GoG phenotype is not a necessary property for the formation of the multilayer structure, recurrence patterns, and the poor survival times of patients diagnosed with GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2569443607,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced hepatic stress is associated with increased oxidative DNA damage and has been implicated in hepatic inflammation. However, HCV infection and replication are uneven and vary among individual hepatocytes. To investigate the effect of the viral load on host DNA damage, we used an Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein gene (EYFP)-tagged HCV virus to distinguish between HCV intracellular high viral load (HVL) cells and low viral load (LVL) cells. The cell sorting efficiency was confirmed by the high expression of the HCV polyprotein. We found DNA damage γ-H2AX foci in the HVL population. Comet assays demonstrated that HVL was related to the extent of the DNA strand breaks. Surprisingly, the DNA qPCR arrays and western blotting showed that the damage-related genes GPX2, MRE11, phospho-ATM, and OGG1 were significantly up-regulated in LVL cells but inversely down-regulated or consistently expressed in HVL cells. The colony survival assay to examine the repair abilities of these cells in response to irradiation showed that the LVL cells were more resistant to irradiation and had an increased ability to repair radiation-induced damage. This study found that intracellular viral loads drove cellular DNA damage levels but suppressed damage-related gene expression. However, the increase in damage-related gene expression in the LVL cells may be affected by ROS from the HVL cells. These findings provide new insights into the distinct DNA damage and repair responses resulting from different viral loads in HCV-infected cells."
