One of us (B.N.S.) has recently shown5 that some species of the Myxococcaceae undoubtedly cause lysis of living as well as dead bacteria, particularly upon solid non-nutrient media, but attempts to grow the lytic strains in suspensions of eubacteria in very dilute salt solution succeeded only when the latter were mostly non-viable. A possible explanation of this apparent anomaly is that the growth of the myxococcus concerned, upon dead bacteria or their products of disintegration, results in the production of a true non-enzymic antibiotic substance capable of killing viable eubacteria and so rendering them susceptible to lysis by the exocellular enzymes previously elaborated by the growing myxococci. If, therefore, an inoculum of myxococcal microcysts is made into a suspension of chiefly viable bacteria in a liquid, the minute amount of growth which can take place quickly upon the few dead bacteria will be insufficient to produce a high enough uniform concentration of antibiotic substance to kill any viable bacteria, and so growth ceases; but if an inoculation is made upon a dense mass of eubacteria on a solid medium, diffusion of metabolites is hindered and a high enough concentration of antibacterial substance is built up in the vicinity of the inoculum to kill some of the viable cells in that region and so enable growth of the myxobacterium to continue with progressive lysis of the eubacterial mass. We present below some evidence concerning the separation of the soluble non-enzymic antibiotic substance from the accompanying exocellular lytic enzymes which are active against non-viable bacteria only."

https://openalex.org/W1993555642,"ADULT mosquitoes of both sexes can be persuaded to take a considerable variety of foodstuffs, including fruit juices, milk, sugar solutions and various blood preparations. Some interesting lines of inquiry are suggested by the inability of such species as Culex fatigans to produce eggs on any diet other than whole blood taken by normal biting, while other species, such as Aëdes ægypti, can produce viable eggs on defibrinated or citrated blood. In the course of a number of experiments at Yaba with various blood preparations, only one Culex fatigans produced any eggs. These were very few in number and were never laid. They were discovered only on post-mortem examination. The mosquito had received one meal of citrated guinea pig blood followed by several meals of glucose. It has been found repeatedly that the same species will produce many more eggs on a meal of avian blood than on one of mammalian blood."

https://openalex.org/W2988333157,"THE type of colour filter developed by Christiansen1 consists of a powdered transparent solid (for example, glass) immersed in a liquid of about the same refractive index but with a different dispersion. For one particular wave-length the refractive index of the liquid and solid will be exactly the same, and this wave-length will be transmitted, while other wave-lengths for which the refractive indices are not quite the same will be scattered by the powder and so not transmitted. The theory of these filters has been discussed by Sethi2, and Kohn and Fragstein3 used a filter of amorphous silica in a mixture of 56 per cent benzene with 44 per cent ethanol to isolate the Hg line 3650 A. There does not appear to be any record of work farther in the ultra-violet, and it seems desirable briefly to report our attempts to develop a filter to transmit the 2537 A. line of Hg. This was required for quantitative measurements on the absorption of hydrogen peroxide produced during certain combustion processes."

https://openalex.org/W4206400674,"IN the last fifteen years, the situation in fundamental physics has undergone a remarkable change. Previously only very few elementary particles were known; and optimistic observers, in fact, believed that it would be a comparatively simple task to elucidate the inter-relations of these particles and to account for the values of the few dimensionless constants (such as the fine-structure constant and the ratio of proton to electron mass) derivable from them. It was even said that the end of physics might be in sight."

The macronucleus of Epistylis is a large and band-shaped body, staining deeply with all nuclear stains, and especially with Feulgen. The micronucleus is a small spherical structure situated in the neighbourhood of the macronucleus. The staining reactions of the micronucleus in two species of Epistylis show a significant difference. In Epistylis articulata From., the micronucleus is easily discernible as a deeply staining body. In E. plicatilis Ehrbg., on the other hand, the micronucleus gives a thoroughly negative reaction to Feulgen. Sometimes there are one or two minute granules which stain pink, but the rest of the nucleus is unstained. The difference is all the more striking because in the same mass culture both species were present, and they were treated together in the matter of fixation and staining."

Recent work in this laboratory has shown that heating with 2.5 N aqueous hydrochloric acid for periods of 30 min.—2 hr. converts both ψ-diethylstilbœstrol and diethylstilbœstrol into an equilibrium mixture in which, in so far as these two substances are concerned, diethylstilbœstrol preponderates in the ratio 9 : 1. The change has been followed by melting-point and colorimetric estimations2 of the products isolated from saturated acid solutions after cooling to room temperature, and checked by comparison with the properties of suitable mechanical mixtures."
