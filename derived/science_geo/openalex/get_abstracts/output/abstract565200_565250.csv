Here we present the 3.8 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the spliceosome immediately after lariat formation. The 5'-splice site is cleaved but remains close to the catalytic Mg2+ site in the U2/U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) triplex, and the 5'-phosphate of the intron nucleotide G(+1) is linked to the branch adenosine 2'OH. The 5'-exon is held between the Prp8 amino-terminal and linker domains, and base-pairs with U5 snRNA loop 1. Non-Watson-Crick interactions between the branch helix and 5'-splice site dock the branch adenosine into the active site, while intron nucleotides +3 to +6 base-pair with the U6 snRNA ACAGAGA sequence. Isy1 and the step-one factors Yju2 and Cwc25 stabilize docking of the branch helix. The intron downstream of the branch site emerges between the Prp8 reverse transcriptase and linker domains and extends towards the Prp16 helicase, suggesting a plausible mechanism of remodelling before exon ligation."

Here, using skin epidermis as a model, we assessed the effect of oncogenic hedgehog signalling in distinct cell populations and their capacity to induce basal cell carcinoma, the most frequent cancer in humans. We found that only stem cells, and not progenitors, initiated tumour formation upon oncogenic hedgehog signalling. This difference was due to the hierarchical organization of tumour growth in oncogene-targeted stem cells, characterized by an increase in symmetric self-renewing divisions and a higher p53-dependent resistance to apoptosis, leading to rapid clonal expansion and progression into invasive tumours. Our work reveals that the capacity of oncogene-targeted cells to induce tumour formation is dependent not only on their long-term survival and expansion, but also on the specific clonal dynamics of the cancer cell of origin."
https://openalex.org/W2483775813,"The accumulation of amyloid β peptide(1-42) (Aβ(1-42)) in extracellular plaques is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). Several studies have suggested that cellular reuptake of Aβ(1-42) may be a crucial step in its cytotoxicity, but the uptake mechanism is not yet understood. Aβ may be present in an aggregated form prior to cellular uptake. Alternatively, monomeric peptide may enter the endocytic pathway and conditions in the endocytic compartments may induce the aggregation process. Our study aims to answer the question whether aggregate formation is a prerequisite or a consequence of Aβ endocytosis. We visualized aggregate formation of fluorescently labeled Aβ(1-42) and tracked its internalization by human neuroblastoma cells and neurons. β-Sheet-rich Aβ(1-42) aggregates entered the cells at low nanomolar concentration of Aβ(1-42). In contrast, monomer uptake faced a concentration threshold and occurred only at concentrations and time scales that allowed Aβ(1-42) aggregates to form. By uncoupling membrane binding from internalization, we found that Aβ(1-42) monomers bound rapidly to the plasma membrane and formed aggregates there. These structures were subsequently taken up and accumulated in endocytic vesicles. This process correlated with metabolic inhibition. Our data therefore imply that the formation of β-sheet-rich aggregates is a prerequisite for Aβ(1-42) uptake and cytotoxicity."

The Phytophthora infestans RXLR-type effector PexRD54 binds potato ATG8 via its ATG8 family-interacting motif (AIM) and perturbs host-selective autophagy. However, the structural basis of this interaction remains unknown. Here, we define the crystal structure of PexRD54, which includes a modular architecture, including five tandem repeat domains, with the AIM sequence presented at the disordered C terminus. To determine the interface between PexRD54 and ATG8, we solved the crystal structure of potato ATG8CL in complex with a peptide comprising the effector's AIM sequence, and we established a model of the full-length PexRD54-ATG8CL complex using small angle x-ray scattering. Structure-informed deletion of the PexRD54 tandem domains reveals retention of ATG8CL binding in vitro and in planta This study offers new insights into structure/function relationships of oomycete RXLR effectors and how these proteins engage with host cell targets to promote disease."
https://openalex.org/W2493489412,"Exercise promotes multiple beneficial effects on muscle function, including induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. miR-133a is a muscle-enriched microRNA that regulates muscle development and function. The role of miR-133a inexercise tolerance hasnotbeenfully elucidated. Inthecurrent study, mice that were deficient in miR-133a demonstrated low maximal exercise capacity and low resting metabolic rate. Transcription of the mitochondrial biogenesis regulators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1-β, nuclear respiratory factor-1, and transcription factor A, mitochondrial were lower in miR-133a–deficient muscle, which was consistent with lower mitochondrial mass and impaired exercise capacity. Six weeks of endurance exercise training increased the transcriptional level of miR-133a and stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis in wild-type mice, but failed to improve mitochondrial function in miR-133a–deficient mice. Further mechanistic analysis showed an increase in the miR-133a potential target, IGF-1 receptor, alongwith hyperactivation of Akt signaling, in miR-133a–deficient mice, which was consistent with lower transcription of the mitochondrial biogenesis regulators. These findings indicate an essential role of miR-133a in skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, exercise tolerance, and response to exercise training.—Nie, Y., Sato, Y., Wang, C., Yue, F., Kuang, S., Gavin, T.

https://openalex.org/W2482537185,"Objective Americans do not vaccinate nearly enough against Influenza (flu) infection, despite severe health and economic burden of influenza. Younger people are disproportionately responsible for transmission, but do not suffer severely from the flu. Thus, to achieve herd immunity, prosocial motivation needs to be a partial driver of vaccination decisions. Past research has not established the causal role of prosociality in flu vaccination, and the current research evaluates such causal relationship by experimentally eliciting prosociality through messages about flu victims. Methods In an experimental study, we described potential flu victims who would suffer from the decision of others to not vaccinate to 3952 Internet participants across eight countries. We measured sympathy, general prosociality, and vaccination intentions. The study included two identifiable victim conditions (one with an elderly victim and another with a young victim), an unidentified victim condition, and a no message condition. Results We found that any of the three messages increased flu vaccination intentions. Moreover, this effect was mediated by enhanced prosocial motives, and was stronger among people who were historical non-vaccinators. In addition, younger victim elicited greater sympathy, and describing identifiable victims increased general sympathy and prosocial motives. Conclusions These findings provide direct experimental evidence on the causal role of prosocial motives in flu vaccination, by showing that people can be prompted to vaccinate for the sake of benefiting others."
https://openalex.org/W2501987374,"Outside of well characterized model eukaryotes, relatively little is known about the translocons that transport proteins across the two membranes that surround the mitochondrion. Apicomplexans are a phylum of intracellular parasites that cause major diseases in humans and animals and are evolutionarily distant from model eukaryotes such as yeast. Apicomplexans harbor a mitochondrion that is essential for parasite survival and is a validated drug target. Here, we demonstrate that the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii harbors homologues of proteins from all the major mitochondrial protein translocons present in yeast, suggesting these arose early in eukaryotic evolution. We demonstrate that a T. gondii homologue of Tom22 (TgTom22), a central component of the translocon of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, is essential for parasite survival, mitochondrial protein import, and assembly of the TOM complex. We also identify and characterize a T. gondii homologue of Tom7 (TgTom7) that is important for parasite survival and mitochondrial protein import. Contrary to the role of Tom7 in yeast, TgTom7 is important for TOM complex stability, suggesting the role of this protein has diverged during eukaryotic evolution.

Together, our study identifies conserved and modified features of mitochondrial protein import in apicomplexan parasites. Mitochondria arose through the endosymbiotic acquisition of an α-proteobacterium, likely in a single event that occurred early in eukaryotic evolution (1Embley T.M. Martin W. Eukaryotic evolution, changes and challenges.Nature. 2006; 440: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 2Sagan L. On the origin of mitosing cells.J. Theor. Biol. 1967; 14: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Most known extant eukaryotes retain a mitochondrion or homologous organelle (3van der Giezen M. Tovar J. Degenerate mitochondria.EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similar to their bacterial antecedents, most mitochondria retain a genome that encodes for some proteins. However, most proteins that function in the mitochondrion are nucleus-encoded and must post-translationally target across the two membranes that surround the mitochondrion. Proteins targeted to the mitochondrion contain either N-terminal presequences or internal targeting signals. These targeting signals interact with various protein translocons in the inner and outer membranes to ensure protein translocation across the mitochondrial membranes and into the appropriate compartment of the organelle. Mitochondrial protein import is a core organellar function that was a critical early step in the evolution of mitochondria from α-proteobacteria (4Dolezal P. Likic V. Tachezy J. Lithgow T. Evolution of the molecular machines for protein import into mitochondria.Science. 2006; 313: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes harbored a mitochondrion and also bore a functional mitochondrial protein import apparatus. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that mitochondrial protein import machinery has diversified through the course of eukaryotic evolution. Mitochondrial import has been most extensively studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Dudek J. Rehling P. van der Laan M. Mitochondrial protein import: common principles and physiological networks.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1833: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Translocation across the outer membrane is mediated by the translocon of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) 3The abbreviations used are: TOM,translocon of the outer mitochondrial membrane; SAM,sorting and assembly machinery; TIM,translocon of the inner mitochondrial membrane; PAM,presequence translocase-associated motor; MPP,mitochondrial processing peptidase; ATOM,archaic translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane; ATc,anhydrotetracycline; Shld1,Shield-1; LIC,ligation-independent cloning; BN-PAGE,blue native-PAGE; DDM,dodecyl maltoside; mDHFR,mouse dihydrofolate reductase; BisTris,2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; DD,destabilization domain; RFP,red fluorescent protein; 5′-RACE,5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends.; complex. The TOM complex represents the entry point into the organelle for most mitochondrial proteins. In yeast, the TOM complex includes the β-barrel protein Tom40, which forms the central pore of the complex (6Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Tom40 forms the hydrophilic channel of the mitochondrial import pore for preproteins.Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The TOM complex also includes the receptor proteins Tom20 and Tom70, three small Tom proteins (Tom5, Tom6, and Tom7) that function in regulating TOM complex assembly and function, and Tom22, a single-pass transmembrane protein that has several functions. The cytosolic N-terminal region of yeast Tom22 functions as a receptor domain that interacts with proteins as they enter from the cytosol (7Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. Differential recognition of preproteins by the purified cytosolic domains of the mitochondrial import receptors Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain is critical for assembling the TOM complex into a higher order structure (8van Wilpe S. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Maarse A.C. Meisinger C. Brix J. Dekker P.J. Moczko M. Wagner R. Meijer M. Guiard B. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Tom22 is a multifunctional organizer of the mitochondrial preprotein translocase.Nature. 1999; 401: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The intermembrane space-localized C-terminal domain of Tom22 interacts with presequence-containing proteins as they pass through the TOM complex, an interaction that is critical for translocation of these proteins to the translocase of the inner membrane (9Moczko M. Bömer U. Kübrich M. Zufall N. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. The intermembrane space domain of mitochondrial Tom22 functions as a trans binding site for preproteins with N-terminal targeting sequences.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The outer mitochondrial membrane contains several β-barrel proteins. The targeting of these proteins involves translocation into the intermembrane space through the TOM complex, and subsequent insertion into the outer membrane by an outer membrane insertase called the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) complex, the central component of which is known as Sam50 (10Gentle I. Gabriel K. Beech P. Waller R. Lithgow T. The Omp85 family of proteins is essential for outer membrane biogenesis in mitochondria and bacteria.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The presequence translocase, also known as the translocon of the inner mitochondrial membrane 23 (TIM23) complex, translocates presequence-containing proteins across the inner membrane. Tim23 forms the pore through this membrane, whereas Tim50 functions as a receptor for proteins as they translocate from the TOM complex (11Geissler A. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Brandner K. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Rehling P.

Kovermann P. Geissler A. Merlin A. Meijer M. Driessen A.J. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Wagner R. A presequence- and voltage-sensitive channel of the mitochondrial preprotein translocase formed by Tim23.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The presequence translocase can recruit a motor complex called the presequence-translocase associated motor (PAM) to drive ATP-dependent translocation of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. The central component of the PAM complex is a mitochondrial Hsp70 that associates with J-domain proteins such as Pam18 (13Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J. Müller H. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. A J-protein is an essential subunit of the presequence translocase-associated protein import motor of mitochondria.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Upon translocation into the matrix, the presequence is proteolytically cleaved by a mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) to yield the mature protein (14Hawlitschek G. Schneider H. Schmidt B. Tropschug M. Hartl F.U. Neupert W. Mitochondrial protein import: identification of processing peptidase and of PEP, a processing enhancing protein.Cell. 1988; 53: 795-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), which can then fold and carry out its function. Many mitochondrial proteins lack N-terminal presequences and instead harbor internal signals to direct them to the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial solute carrier proteins are inner membrane proteins that fall into this category. Mitochondrial carrier proteins enter the mitochondrion through the TOM complex and then interact with small Tim proteins such as Tim9 and Tim10 in the intermembrane space. These function to deliver carrier proteins to the TIM22 complex, which inserts carrier proteins into the inner membrane. The core component of this insertase is the protein Tim22 (15Rehling P. Model K. Brandner K. Kovermann P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Kühlbrandt W. Wagner R. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Protein insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane by a twin-pore translocase.Science. 2003; 299: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of mitochondrial import are well characterized in yeast and related organisms such as animals, this is less true of other eukaryotic lineages. The core components of the mitochondrial import machinery, including the TOM, TIM23, TIM22, PAM, and SAM complexes, are present in plants (16Duncan O. Murcha M.W. Whelan J. Unique components of the plant mitochondrial protein import apparatus.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1833: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). There are, however, several major differences between plants and yeast, most notably features of the TOM complex. Plants lack homologues of the receptor proteins Tom70 and Tom20 and have evolved alternative receptor proteins (17Lister R. Carrie C. Duncan O. Ho L.H. Howell K.A. Murcha M.W. Whelan J.

Biol. 2011; 405: 804-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, the plant Tom22 homologue is truncated at the N terminus and may not function as a presequence receptor (18Rimmer K.A. Foo J.H. Ng A. Petrie E.J. Shilling P.J. Perry A.J. Mertens H.D.

Another phylum where the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial import have been functionally examined is the trypanosomatids, a group of parasites that include Trypanasoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. The outer membrane translocon of trypanosomatids is termed the archaic translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (ATOM) complex and appears different from the TOM complex in yeast. The central component of the ATOM complex is a β-barrel protein called Atom40 (20Pusnik M. Schmidt O. Perry A.J. Oeljeklaus S. Niemann M. Warscheid B. Lithgow T. Meisinger C. Schneider A.

Studies have identified other ATOM protein components, including Atom69, Atom46, Atom36, Atom14, Atom12, and Atom11 (23Mani J. Desy S. Niemann M. Chanfon A. Oeljeklaus S. Pusnik M. Schmidt O.

Apicomplexans are a phylum of intracellular parasites. They include important human parasites such as the Plasmodium species, the causative agents of malaria, and Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that causes congenital disease in unborn children and encephalitis in immunocompromised people.

These have identified putative homologues of the core components of mitochondrial import, including members of the TOM, TIM23, TIM22, PAM, and SAM complexes. The TOM complex of apicomplexans appears divergent from that found in yeast. Apicomplexan genomes lack identifiable homologues to TOM complex receptors such as Tom70 and Tom20. Like plants, the N terminus of Plasmodium Tom22 appears truncated (19Maćasev D. Whelan J. Newbigin E. Silva-Filho M.C. Mulhern T.D. Lithgow T.

Additionally, these comparative approaches have not identified Tom7 homologues in apicomplexan genomes, making apicomplexans one of the few lineages where a TOM complex is present that appears to lack Tom7 (19Maćasev D.

Peeping at TOMs-diverse entry gates to mitochondria provide insights into the evolution of eukaryotes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2016; 33: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The last common ancestor of apicomplexans and yeast contained a mitochondrion and must have had a means of targeting nucleus-encoded proteins into this organelle. In this paper, we ask the following. What features of this mitochondrial import apparatus have been conserved from the last common ancestor? What new features have arisen? We use T. gondii as our model system to perform the first broad functional analysis of the mitochondrial protein import machinery in Apicomplexa. In particular, we focus on the TOM complex and assay the role of two TOM complex components in mitochondrial import and TOM complex biogenesis. These studies provide insights into conserved and novel functions of mitochondrial import machinery across their evolution, and they provide a platform for future studies of mitochondrial import in an evolutionarily interesting and medically important group of organisms. To identify candidate mitochondrial import proteins, we performed Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches, querying the T. gondii genome with characterized mitochondrial import proteins from the yeast S. cerevisiae, the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the trypanosomatid T. brucei. Matches were confirmed through reciprocal BLAST searches against the T. gondii genome. The results of these searches are summarized in supplemental Table S1. We identified homologues of major subunits from each of the translocases and insertases involved in protein import into the mitochondrion. These include homologues of Tom40, Sam50, Tim23, Tim17, Tim50, Hsp70, Mge1, Tim44, Pam18, Tim22, and a host of small Tims. We also identified a T. gondii homologue of Oxa1, a protein that functions in the insertion of inner membrane proteins encoded on the mitochondrial genome (supplemental Table S1) (33Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Oxa1p acts as a general membrane insertion machinery for proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Some notable proteins lacked detectable homologues in T. gondii. This was particularly the case for the TOM complex, for which we were unable to identify candidates for receptor proteins (e.g. Tom70 and Tom20) or small Tom proteins (e.g. Tom5 and Tom7). Additionally, we were unable to identify components of the SAM and carrier insertase complexes beyond the central Sam50 and Tim22 subunits. We were also unable to identify a homologue of MIA40, a protein with a central role in the import of small Tim proteins into the intermembrane space (34Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Sanjuán Szklarz L.K. Schulze-Specking A. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Essential role of Mia40 in import and assembly of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3735-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To determine whether these candidate mitochondrial import proteins localized to the mitochondrion, we epitope-tagged select members of each protein complex. We first tagged TgTom40, the putative import pore in the outer membrane, and demonstrated co-localization with mitochondrially targeted RFP (Fig. 1A). Additionally, we generated polyclonal rabbit antibodies against TgTom40. Immunofluorescence assays using this antibody supported the mitochondrial localization of TgTom40 (Fig. 1B). Analysis by Western blotting revealed that TgTom40 is a protein with a mass of 48 kDa (Fig. 1C). Through co-localization with either Tom40 or mitochondrial RFP, and associated Western blottings, we demonstrated mitochondrial localization and protein expression for the following proteins: TgSam50 (Fig. 1, D and E), consistent with the mitochondrial localization of this protein reported in a recent study (35Sheiner L. Fellows J.D. Ovciarikova J. Brooks C.F. Agrawal S. Holmes Z.C. Bietz I. Flinner N. Heiny S. Mirus O. Przyborski J.M. Striepen B. Toxoplasma gondii Toc75 functions in import of stromal but not peripheral apicoplast proteins.Traffic. 2015; 16: 1254-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); TgTim22 (Fig. 1, F and G); TgTim23 (Fig. 1, H and I); TgTim50 (Fig. 1, J and K); and TgMPPα (Fig. 1, L and M). We were unable to generate a parasite strain that stably expressed epitope-tagged TgPam18. Instead, we transiently overexpressed c-Myc-tagged TgPam18 in T. gondii parasites and performed an immunofluorescence assay. This revealed mitochondrial localization of TgPam18 (Fig. 1N). Taken together, these data indicate that T. gondii homologues of each of the major mitochondrial protein translocases and insertases localize to the mitochondrion (Fig. 1O). Our bioinformatics survey (supplemental Table S1) identified a T. gondii homologue of Tom22 that we called TgTom22. We performed an alignment of TgTom22 with Tom22 homologues from Plasmodium falciparum, yeast, humans, and plants (Fig. 2A). This alignment revealed that the N terminus of TgTom22 is truncated compared with yeast and human Tom22, as noted previously for Tom22 homologues in plants and Plasmodium (19Maćasev D. Whelan J. Newbigin E. Silva-Filho M.C. Mulhern T.D. Lithgow T. Tom22′, an 8-kDa trans-site receptor in plants and protozoans, is a conserved feature of the TOM complex that appeared early in the evolution of eukaryotes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1557-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We identified two predicted transmembrane domains in TgTom22, one in an equivalent position to the transmembrane domain predicted for other Tom22 proteins and the second at the very C terminus of the protein (Fig. 2A). Sequence conservation among putative Tom22 homologues is generally poor, with only three identical residues found in all the proteins presented in the alignment, all three of which are found in the predicted transmembrane domain. To localize TgTom22, and to facilitate subsequent functional analysis of this protein, we introduced an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged TgTom22 into the TATi strain of T. gondii. This exogenous version of TgTom22 was placed under the control of an anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-regulated promoter. We termed the resultant strain rTom22/eTom22, to indicate the presence of both regulatable and endogenous copies of TgTom22. We then knocked out the native Tom22 locus, verifying successful knock-out by PCR analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). The resultant strain was termed rTom22/Δtom22 and expressed only the ATc-regulatable HA-tagged TgTom22. Immunofluorescence analysis of this strain revealed that HA-Tom22 co-localizes with TgTom40, indicating that TgTom22 is a mitochondrial protein (Fig. 2B). Western blotting revealed that HA-Tom22 is 10 kDa in mass, close to the predicted mass of 12 kDa for the HA-tagged protein. To test whether TgTom22 is a transmembrane protein, we extracted T. gondii proteins in the rTom22/Δtom22 cell line with either the detergent Triton X-100 or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at pH 11.5. We determined that the HA-Tom22 protein localizes to the soluble fraction in Triton X-100 extraction but to the membrane fraction upon Na2CO3 extraction (Fig. 2C). This is similar to the predicted integral membrane protein TgTom40 and distinct from the β-subunit of ATP synthase, a predicted soluble protein. We conclude that TgTom22 is a mitochondrial integral membrane protein. As a first step to characterizing the TOM complex of T. gondii, we performed blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) on rTom22/Δtom22 strain T. gondii parasites, probing Western blottings with the TgTom40 antibody. When solubilized in either 0.5 or 1% digitonin, TgTom40 localizes to a protein complex of around 400 kDa (Fig. 4A). When solubilized in 1% dodecyl maltoside or 1% Triton X-100, TgTom40 localizes to a slightly smaller complex of around 325 kDa. The TgTom40 complex appeared insoluble in octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. We conclude that the TgTom40 protein is part of an ∼400-kDa protein complex in the mitochondrion of T. gondii, which is similar in mass to characterized TOM complexes measured by BN-PAGE in yeast (36Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. The TOM core complex: the general protein import pore of the outer membrane of mitochondria.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We refer to this complex as the T. gondii TOM complex. We have identified one other putative outer membrane protein involved in import, namely TgSam50, which is predicted to function in the outer membrane insertase complex. We hypothesized that TgTom22 localizes to the TOM complex, whereas TgSam50 localizes to a separate complex. To test this, we expressed a c-Myc epitope-tagged TgSam50 in the rTom22/Δtom22 cell line. We initially performed one-dimensional BN-PAGE and were unable to identify either HA-Tom22 or TgSam50-Myc protein, likely because the epitope tags on these proteins were inaccessible to antibodies when in the complete complex. 4G. van Dooren, unpublished observations. We therefore performed two-dimensional BN-PAGE, separating protein complexes in the second dimension using SDS-PAGE. These studies revealed that TgTom40 is predominantly found in a 400-kDa complex that corresponds in mass to the TOM complex we observed in one-dimensional BN-PAGE (Fig. 4B). Lesser amounts of TgTom40 were observed in smaller complexes of around 300 and 200 kDa (Fig. 4B). HA-Tom22 localizes exclusively in a 400-kDa complex that corresponds in mass to the 400-kDa complex containing TgTom40. TgSam50-c-Myc localizes in complexes of 200 and 350 kDa (Fig. 4B). To further test the composition of the T. gondii TOM complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments on the TgSam50-c-Myc/rTom22/Δtom22 cell line. We solubilized T. gondii proteins in 0.5% digitonin and immunoprecipitated TgTom40 and all interacting proteins using anti-TgTom40 antibodies. HA-Tom22, but not TgSam50, co-immunoprecipitated with TgTom40 antibodies (Fig. 4C). Next, we performed pulldowns of HA-Tom22-interacting proteins using anti-HA antibodies. These studies revealed t"
https://openalex.org/W2481842979,"Painful peripheral neuropathy is a severe adverse effect of chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel (Taxol). The glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are critically involved in the synaptic plasticity associated with neuropathic pain. However, paclitaxel treatment does not alter the postsynaptic NMDAR activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons. In this study, we determined whether paclitaxel affects presynaptic NMDAR activity by recording excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) of dorsal horn neurons in spinal cord slices. In paclitaxel-treated rats, the baseline frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) was significantly increased; the NMDAR antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) completely normalized this frequency. Also, AP5 significantly reduced the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs evoked by dorsal root stimulation and reversed the reduction in the paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs in paclitaxel-treated rats. Blocking GluN2A-containing, but not GluN2B-containing, NMDARs largely decreased the frequency of mEPSCs and the amplitude of evoked EPSCs of dorsal horn neurons in paclitaxel-treated rats. Furthermore, inhibition of protein kinase C fully reversed the increased frequency of mEPSCs and the amplitude of evoked EPSCs in paclitaxel-treated rats. Paclitaxel treatment significantly increased the protein level of GluN2A and phosphorylated GluN1 in the dorsal root ganglion. In addition, intrathecal injection of AP5 or systemic administration of memantine profoundly attenuated pain hypersensitivity induced by paclitaxel. Our findings indicate that paclitaxel treatment induces tonic activation of presynaptic NMDARs in the spinal cord through protein kinase C to potentiate nociceptive input from primary afferent nerves. Targeting presynaptic NMDARs at the spinal cord level may be an effective strategy for treating chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2503325535,"Previous research indicates adults with eating disorders (EDs) report smaller social networks, and difficulties with social functioning, alongside demonstrating difficulties recognising and regulating emotions in social contexts. Concurrently, those recovered from the illness have discussed the vital role offered by social support and interaction in their recovery. To date, little is known about the social skills and social networks of adolescents with EDs and this study aimed to conduct focus groups to explore the social functioning of 17 inpatients aged 12-17. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and six core themes were identified: group belonging, self-monitoring, social sensitivity, impact of hospitalisation, limited coping strategies and strategies for service provision. Key areas for service provision were: management of anxiety, development and/or maintenance of a social network and development of inter and intrapersonal skills. The most salient finding was that adolescents with EDs reported social difficulties which appeared to persist over and above those typically experienced at this point in the lifespan and therefore a key area for future focus is the development of appropriate coping strategies and solutions to deal with these reported difficulties."

Growing evidence suggests both inflammation and neurodegeneration are pivotal to secondary injury processes and the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study we characterized circulating brain injury and inflammatory mediators in healthy male and female athletes according to concussion history and collision sport participation. Eighty-seven university level athletes (male, n = 60; female, n = 27) were recruited before the start of the competitive season. Athletes were healthy at the time of the study (no medications, illness, concussion or musculoskeletal injuries). Dependent variables included 29 inflammatory and 10 neurological injury analytes assessed in the peripheral blood by immunoassay. Biomarkers were statistically evaluated using partial least squares multivariate analysis to identify possible relationships to self-reported previous concussion history, number of previous concussions and collision sport participation in male and female athletes. Multiple concussions were associated with increases in peripheral MCP-1 in females, and MCP-4 in males. Collision sport participation was associated with increases in tau levels in males. These results are consistent with previous experimental and clinical findings that suggest ongoing inflammatory and cerebral injury processes after repetitive mild head trauma. However, further validation is needed to correlate systemic biomarkers to repetitive brain impacts, as opposed to the extracranial effects common to an athletic population such as exercise and muscle damage."

To date, at least 23 GRA proteins have been reported, though the function(s) of most of these proteins still remains unknown. We targeted gene knockouts at ten GRA gene loci (GRA1-10) to investigate the cellular roles and essentiality of these classical GRA proteins during acute infection in the virulent type I RH strain. While eight of these genes (GRA2-9) were successfully knocked out, targeted knockouts at the GRA1 and GRA10 loci were not obtained, suggesting these GRA proteins may be essential. As expected, the Δgra2 and Δgra6 knockouts failed to form an intravacuolar network (IVN). Surprisingly, Δgra7 exhibited hyper-formation of the IVN in both normal and lipid-free growth conditions. No morphological alterations were identified in parasite or PV structures in the Δgra3, Δgra4, Δgra5, Δgra8, or Δgra9 knockouts. With the exception of the Δgra3 and Δgra8 knockouts, all of the GRA knockouts exhibited defects in their infection rate in vitro. While the single GRA knockouts did not exhibit reduced replication rates in vitro, replication rate defects were observed in three double GRA knockout strains (Δgra4Δgra6, Δgra3Δgra5 and Δgra3Δgra7). However, the virulence of single or double GRA knockout strains in CD1 mice was not affected. Collectively, our results suggest that while the eight individual GRA proteins investigated in this study (GRA2-9) are not essential, several GRA proteins may provide redundant and potentially important functions during acute infection."

It is not understood how the synthesis of each granule is initiated or how starch granule number is determined within each chloroplast.

https://openalex.org/W2488511372,"The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is a surveillance pathway that defends proteostasis in the “powerhouse” of the cell. Activation of the UPRmt protects against stresses imposed by reactive oxygen species, respiratory chain deficits, and pathologic bacteria. Consistent with the UPRmt’s role in adaption, we found that either its pharmacological or genetic activation by ethidium bromide (EtBr) or RNAi of the mitochondrial AAA-protease spg-7 was sufficient to reduce death in an anoxia-based Caenorhabditis elegans model of ischemia-reperfusion injury. The UPRmt-specific transcription factor atfs-1 was necessary for protection and atfs-1 gain-of-function (gf) mutants were endogenously protected from both death and dysfunction. Neurons exhibited less axonal degeneration following non-lethal anoxia-reperfusion (A-R) when the UPRmt was pre-activated, and consistent with the concept of mitochondrial stress leading to cell non-autonomous (ie. “remote”) effects, we found that restricted activation of the UPRmt in neurons decreased A-R death. However, expression of the atfs-1(gf) mutant in neurons, which resulted in a robust activation of a neuronal UPRmt, did not upregulate the UPRmt in distal tissues, nor did it protect the worms from A-R toxicity. These findings suggest that remote signaling requires additional component(s) acting downstream of de facto mitochondrial stress."
https://openalex.org/W2489882500,"Volunteered geographical information (VGI) and citizen science have become important sources data for much scientific research. In the domain of land cover, crowdsourcing can provide a high temporal resolution data to support different analyses of landscape processes. However, the scientists may have little control over what gets recorded by the crowd, providing a potential source of error and uncertainty. This study compared analyses of crowdsourced land cover data that were contributed by different groups, based on nationality (labelled Gondor and Non-Gondor) and on domain experience (labelled Expert and Non-Expert). The analyses used a geographically weighted model to generate maps of land cover and compared the maps generated by the different groups. The results highlight the differences between the maps how specific land cover classes were under- and over-estimated. As crowdsourced data and citizen science are increasingly used to replace data collected under the designed experiment, this paper highlights the importance of considering between group variations and their impacts on the results of analyses. Critically, differences in the way that landscape features are conceptualised by different groups of contributors need to be considered when using crowdsourced data in formal scientific analyses. The discussion considers the potential for variation in crowdsourced data, the relativist nature of land cover and suggests a number of areas for future research. The key finding is that the veracity of citizen science data is not the critical issue per se. Rather, it is important to consider the impacts of differences in the semantics, affordances and functions associated with landscape features held by different groups of crowdsourced data contributors."

Therefore, antimicrobial proteins and peptides that are promising alternative candidates for the control of bacterial infections are under investigation. The MAP30 protein of Momordica charantia is a valuable type I ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) with anti-HIV and anti-tumor activities. Whereas the antimicrobial activity of some type I RIPs has been confirmed, less attention has been paid to the antimicrobial activity of MAP30 produced in a stable, easily handled, and extremely cost-effective protein-expression system. rMAP30-KDEL was expressed in Nicotiana tobacum hairy roots, and its effect on different microorganisms was investigated. Analysis of the extracted total proteins of transgenic hairy roots showed that rMAP30-KDEL was expressed effectively and that this protein exhibited significant antibacterial activity in a dose-dependent manner. rMAP30-KDEL also possessed thermal and pH stability. Bioinformatic analysis of MAP30 and other RIPs regarding their conserved motifs, amino-acid contents, charge, aliphatic index, GRAVY value, and secondary structures demonstrated that these factors accounted for their thermophilicity. Therefore, RIPs such as MAP30 and its derived peptides might have promising applications as food preservatives, and their analysis might provide useful insights into designing clinically applicable antibiotic agents."

When these yeasts are grown with methanol as the carbon source, AOX forms large crystalline arrays in peroxisomes. We determined the structure of AOX by cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.4 Å. All residues of the 662-amino acid polypeptide as well as the FAD are well resolved. AOX shows high structural homology to other members of the GMC family of oxidoreductases, which share a conserved FAD binding domain, but have different substrate specificities. The preference of AOX for small alcohols is explained by the presence of conserved bulky aromatic residues near the active site. Compared to the other GMC enzymes, AOX contains a large number of amino acid inserts, the longest being 75 residues. These segments are found at the periphery of the monomer and make extensive inter-subunit contacts which are responsible for the very stable octamer. A short surface helix forms contacts between two octamers, explaining the tendency of AOX to form crystals in the peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W2479893139,"Non-native bark and ambrosia beetles represent a threat to forests worldwide. Their invasion patterns are, however, still unclear. Here we investigated first, if the spread of non-native bark and ambrosia beetles is a gradual or a discontinuous process; second, which are the main correlates of their community structure; third, whether those correlates correspond to those of native species. We used data on species distribution of non-native and native scolytines in the continental 48 USA states. These data were analyzed through a beta-diversity index, partitioned into species richness differences and species replacement, using Mantel correlograms and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination for identifying spatial patterns, and regression on distance matrices to test the association of climate (temperature, rainfall), forest (cover area, composition), geographical (distance), and human-related (import) variables with β-diversity components. For both non-native bark and ambrosia beetles, β-diversity was mainly composed of species richness difference than species replacement. For non-native bark beetles, a discontinuous invasion process composed of long distance jumps or multiple introduction events was apparent. Species richness differences were primarily correlated with differences in import values while temperature was the main correlate of species replacement. For non-native ambrosia beetles, a more continuous invasion process was apparent, with the pool of non-native species arriving in the coastal areas that tended to be filtered as they spread to interior portions of the continental USA. Species richness differences were mainly correlated with differences in rainfall among states, while rainfall and temperature were the main correlates of species replacement. Our study suggests that the different ecology of bark and ambrosia beetles influences their invasion process in new environments. The lower dependency that bark beetles have on climate allowed them to potentially colonize more areas within the USA, while non-native ambrosia beetles, being dependent on rainfall, are typically filtered by the environment."

In mammals, the central circadian pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, synchronizes cellular circadian clocks in the heart and many other tissues throughout the body. Cardiac ventricle explants maintain autonomous contractions and robust circadian oscillations of clock gene expression in culture. In the present study, we examined the relationship between intrinsic myocardial function and circadian rhythms in cultures from mouse heart. We cultured ventricular explants or dispersed cardiomyocytes from neonatal mice expressing a PER2::LUC bioluminescent reporter of circadian clock gene expression. We found that isoproterenol, a β-adrenoceptor agonist known to increase heart rate and contractility, also amplifies PER2 circadian rhythms in ventricular explants. We found robust, cell-autonomous PER2 circadian rhythms in dispersed cardiomyocytes. Single-cell rhythms were initially synchronized in ventricular explants but desynchronized in dispersed cells. In addition, we developed a method for long-term, simultaneous monitoring of clock gene expression, contraction rate, and basal intracellular Ca2+ level in cardiomyocytes using PER2::LUC in combination with GCaMP3, a genetically encoded fluorescent Ca2+ reporter. In contrast to robust PER2 circadian rhythms in cardiomyocytes, we detected no rhythms in contraction rate and only weak rhythms in basal Ca2+ level. In summary, we found that PER2 circadian rhythms of cardiomyocytes are cell-autonomous, amplified by adrenergic signaling, and synchronized by intercellular communication in ventricle explants, but we detected no robust circadian rhythms in contraction rate or basal Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2505710738,"Background and Objective Recently, we have shown that the Parkinson’s disease (PD) susceptibility locus MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau) is associated with parkinsonism in older adults without a clinical diagnosis of PD. In this study, we investigated the relationship between parkinsonian signs and MAPT transcripts by assessing the effect of MAPT haplotypes on alternative splicing and expression levels of the most common isoforms in two prospective clinicopathologic studies of aging. Materials and Methods using regression analysis, controlling for age, sex, study and neuropathology, we evaluated 976 subjects with clinical, genotyping and brain pathology data for haplotype analysis. For transcript analysis, we obtained MAPT gene and isoform-level expression from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 505 of these subjects. Results The MAPT H2 haplotype was associated with lower total MAPT expression (p = 1.2x10-14) and global parkinsonism at both study entry (p = 0.001) and proximate to death (p = 0.050). Specifically, haplotype H2 was primarily associated with bradykinesia in both assessments (p<0.001 and p = 0.008). MAPT total expression was associated with age and decreases linearly with advancing age (p<0.001). Analysing MAPT alternative splicing, the expression of 1N/4R isoform was inversely associated with global parkinsonism (p = 0.008) and bradykinesia (p = 0.008). Diminished 1N/4R isoform expression was also associated with H2 (p = 0.001). Conclusions Overall, our results suggest that age and H2 are associated with higher parkinsonism score and decreased total MAPT RNA expression. Additionally, we found that H2 and parkinsonism are associated with altered expression levels of specific isoforms. These findings may contribute to the understanding of the association between MAPT locus and parkinsonism in elderly subjects and in some extent to age-related neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2499690073,"Studies based on contemporary plant occurrences and pollen fossil records have proposed that the current disjunct distribution of seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) across South America is the result of fragmentation of a formerly widespread and continuously distributed dry forest during the arid climatic conditions associated with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which is known as the modern-day dry forest refugia hypothesis. We studied the demographic history of Tabebuia rosealba (Bignoniaceae) to understand the disjunct geographic distribution of South American SDTFs based on statistical phylogeography and ecological niche modeling (ENM). We specifically tested the dry forest refugia hypothesis; i.e., if the multiple and isolated patches of SDTFs are current climatic relicts of a widespread and continuously distributed dry forest during the LGM. We sampled 235 individuals across 18 populations in Central Brazil and analyzed the polymorphisms at chloroplast (trnS-trnG, psbA-trnH and ycf6-trnC intergenic spacers) and nuclear (ITS nrDNA) genomes. We performed coalescence simulations of alternative hypotheses under demographic expectations from two a priori biogeographic hypotheses (1. the Pleistocene Arc hypothesis and, 2. a range shift to Amazon Basin) and other two demographic expectances predicted by ENMs (3. expansion throughout the Neotropical South America, including Amazon Basin, and 4. retraction during the LGM). Phylogenetic analyses based on median-joining network showed haplotype sharing among populations with evidence of incomplete lineage sorting. Coalescent analyses showed smaller effective population sizes for T. roseoalba during the LGM compared to the present-day. Simulations and ENM also showed that its current spatial pattern of genetic diversity is most likely due to a scenario of range retraction during the LGM instead of the fragmentation from a once extensive and largely contiguous SDTF across South America, not supporting the South American dry forest refugia hypothesis."

Moreover, CCL2 induced p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation via CCR2, and p42/44 MAPK inhibition reversed the suppression of CCL2 on HDL metabolism in ECs. Our study suggests that CCL2 was elevated in CAD patients. CCL2 suppressed HDL internalization and cholesterol efflux via CCR2 induction and p42/44 MAPK activation in ECs. CCL2 induction may contribute to impair HDL function and form atherosclerosis in CAD."

Data from 19,756 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years or older were analyzed. We inquired about diversity of friendships based on seven types of friends. Ordered logistic regression models were developed to determine the association between the diversity of social networks and number of teeth (categorized as ≥20, 10-19, 1-9, and 0).Of the participants, 54.1% were women (mean age, 73.9 years; standard deviation, 6.2). The proportion of respondents with ≥20 teeth was 34.1%. After adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status (income, education, and occupation), marital status, health status (diabetes and mental health), and size and contact frequency of the social network, an increase in the diversity of social networks was significantly associated with having more teeth (odds ratio = 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.11). Even adjusted for oral health behaviors (smoking, curative/preventive dental care access, use of dental floss/fluoride toothpaste), significant association was still observed (odds ratio = 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.08)).Social connectedness among people from diverse backgrounds may increase information channels and promote the diffusion of oral health behaviors and prevent tooth loss."

ELISA tests to determine stool elastase concentrations have therefore been developed for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Five different isoforms of pancreatic elastase (CELA1, CELA2A, CELA2B, CELA3A, CELA3B) are encoded in the human genome. We have investigated three different polyclonal antisera that are used in a commercial fecal elastase ELISA to determine their specificity for different pancreatic elastase isoforms.Different polyclonal rabbit antisera against human elastase peptides (BIOSERV Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) were tested by Western blot analysis of human pancreatic juice, in HEK-293 cells expressing Elastase constructs, and in the protein content of porcine pancreatin, used for treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.In human pancreatic juice the polyclonal antisera detected proteins at the corresponding size of human pancreatic elastase isoforms (~29kDa). Transiently expressed GFP fusion protein of elastase isoform CELA3A (CELA3A-GFP), but not CELA2A (CELA2A-GFP) could be precipitated from HEK-293 cell lysates with the elastase antisera. We detected no cross-reactivity with elastases in the porcine pancreatic extracts (pancreatin) used for enzyme replacement therapy.The polyclonal antisera used in a commercial fecal elastase ELISA are specific for the human pancreatic elastase isoform CELA3 and do not cross-react with elastase contained in pig pancreatin. While pancreatic elastase 1 (CELA1) is not expressed in the adult human pancreas, possible differences between the other isoforms regarding their cellular expression, pathophysiological role and relevance in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency deserve further investigation."

However, the pathological type of lupus nephritis closely related to the clinical manifestations; therefore, the treatment of lupus nephritis depends on the different pathological types.To assess the level of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), fractalkine (Fkn), and receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) in different pathological types of lupus nephritis and to explore the value of these biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of lupus nephritis.Patients included in this study were assessed using renal biopsy. Class III and class IV were defined as the proliferative group, class V as non-proliferative group, and class V+III and class V+IV as the mixed group. During the follow-up, 40 of 178 enrolled patients had a poor response to the standard immunosuppressant therapy. The level of markers in the different response groups was tested.The levels of urine and serum MCP-1, urine and serum fractalkine, and serum RAGE were higher in the proliferative group, and lower in the non-proliferative group, and this difference was significant. The levels of urine and serum MCP-1 and serum RAGE were lower in the poor response group, and these differences were also significant. The relationship between urine MCP-1 and urine and serum fractalkine with the systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index was evaluated.The concentration of cytokines MCP-1, fractalkine, and RAGE may be correlated with different pathology type of lupus nephtitis. Urine and serum MCP-1 and serum RAGE may help in predicting the prognosis prior to standard immunosuppressant therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2476638614,"Puf6 and Loc1 have two important functional roles in the cells, asymmetric mRNA distribution and ribosome biogenesis. Puf6 and Loc1 are localized predominantly in the nucleolus. They bind ASH1 mRNA, repress its translation, and facilitate the transport to the daughter cells. Asymmetric mRNA distribution is important for cell differentiation. Besides their roles in mRNA localization, Puf6 and Loc1 have been shown to be involved in 60S biogenesis. In puf6Δ or loc1Δ cells, pre-rRNA processing and 60S export are impaired and 60S subunits are underaccumulated.

In this study, we found that Puf6 and Loc1 interact directly with each other and both proteins interact with the ribosomal protein Rpl43 (L43e). Notably, the roles of Puf6 and Loc1 in 60S biogenesis are interdependent, and both are required for efficient accommodation of Rpl43. Loc1 is further required to maintain the protein level of Rpl43.

Almost every process in a cell is mediated by proteins, the products of translating mRNA by ribosomes. Ribosomes are composed of two subunits, a small subunit and a large subunit, 40S and 60S, respectively, in eukaryotic cells. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the 40S and 60S subunits are assembled from a large primary 35S rRNA transcribed by RNA polymerase I. Processing of this rRNA yields 5.8S, 18S, and 25S rRNAs. The 5S rRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III separately (see reviews in Refs. 1Gerhardy S. Menet A.M. Peña C. Petkowski J.J. Panse V.G.

Ribosome biogenesis is necessary for cell growth and proliferation. The synthesis of ribosome is a complex pathway in which over 200 trans-acting factors are involved. Many of the RNA folding, protein assembly, and maturation events are hierarchical, requiring the correct completion of one event to progress to the next event. This is seen in the assembly of ribosomal proteins onto the RNA in bacterial ribosome assembly (8Sykes M.T. Williamson J.R. A complex assembly landscape for the 30S ribosomal subunit.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2009; 38: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as well as in cytoplasmic maturation of the large subunit in yeast (9Panse V.G. Johnson A.W.

In addition, trans-acting factors also perform quality control steps for the assembly of the protein synthesis machinery. Syo1 facilitates the synchronized import of the two 5S rRNA-binding proteins, Rpl5 and Rpl11, to ensure stoichiometric the incorporation of these two proteins into the pre-60S subunits and also works as an assembly platform for the 5S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) (11Calviño F.R.

Whereas previous studies of Puf6 and Loc1 functions have been focused on their roles in the asymmetric distribution of ASH1 mRNA in yeast, their roles in 60S biogenesis have not been clearly elucidated.

Loc1, an RNA-binding protein, is also required for asymmetric localization of ASH1 mRNA in yeast (20Long R.M. Gu W. Meng X. Gonsalvez G. Singer R.H. Chartrand P. An exclusively nuclear RNA-binding protein affects asymmetric localization of ASH1 mRNA and Ash1p in yeast.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is not an essential gene, but loc1Δ cells show a severe, slow growing phenotype. Loc1 is distributed predominantly in the nucleolus, consistent with a role in the biogenesis of 60S subunits. Loc1 associates with 60S subunits (33Harnpicharnchai P. Jakovljevic J. Horsey E. Miles T. Roman J. Rout M. Meagher D. Imai B. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Woolford Jr., J.L.

Functional specificity among ribosomal proteins regulates gene expression.Cell. 2007; 131: 557-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and loc1Δ mutant cells show significantly reduced levels of mature 25S rRNA and increased levels of 35S pre-RNA and aberrant 23S RNA (35Urbinati C.R. Gonsalvez G.B. Aris J.P. Long R.M. Loc1p is required for efficient assembly and nuclear export of the 60S ribosomal subunit.Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2006; 276: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Additionally, 60S export is reduced in loc1Δ cells. Here, we have described a mechanistic study of Puf6 and Loc1 function in 60S biogenesis in yeast. Direct protein-protein interaction was found among Puf6, Loc1, and Rpl43. In the absence of Puf6 or Loc1, Rpl43 could not be loaded efficiently into pre-60S subunits. Furthermore, depletion of Rpl43 in yeast blocked Puf6 and Loc1 release from 60S. PUF6 is nonessential, as yeast cells from which PUF6 has been deleted are viable and do not show a slow growth phenotype at 30 °C; they have only a slight reduction in growth rate at 37 °C and a somewhat greater defect at 20 °C (Fig. 1A). A sucrose gradient analysis was carried out in puf6Δ cells at different temperatures. Despite the fact that puf6Δ cells did not show a significant growth defect at 30 °C, there was a modest deficiency in 60S subunits, evident as a reduced ratio of free 60S to free 40S. These defects became more pronounced at 20 and 37 °C (Fig. 1B). In summary, the growth rate of puf6Δ is correlated with 60S levels. To gain insight into the function of Puf6 in 60S biogenesis, we first carried out a high-copy suppressor screen in a puf6 mutant. Because puf6Δ cells showed only a modest slow growth defect at low temperature, we considered ways to enhance the growth defect in puf6Δ cells. We found that the puf6 mutant with a truncated PUF domain (ΔPUF) was slower growing than puf6Δ (Fig. 1C). Therefore, a plasmid containing the ΔPUF mutant was transformed to puf6Δ to enhance the severity of the growth phenotype (Fig. 1C). A ΔPUF strain was transformed with a high-copy number (2μ) yeast genomic library. Compared with empty vector control, transformants showing a larger colony size should contain either a wild-type PUF6 clone or genes that suppress the growth defects of ΔPUF when expressed in a higher amount. In addition to PUF6, RPL43B was identified as a suppressor of both ΔPUF and the puf6Δ mutant (Fig. 1C). Yeast has two homologues of RPL43, RPL43A and RPL43B. Each gene was cloned into a high-copy number (2μ) plasmid, and each was found able to suppress the growth defects of ΔPUF and the puf6Δ mutant (Fig. 1C and data not shown). To determine whether the suppression of puf6Δ by RPL43 reversed the ribosome biogenesis defects of puf6Δ, Rpl11-GFP was used to monitor the localization of 60S subunits in the cells. Although Rpl11 was localized predominantly in the nucleus in puf6Δ at 25 °C, with Rpl43 overexpression the cytoplasmic localization of Rpl11 was significantly restored in puf6Δ cells (Fig. 1D). We concluded that Rpl43 is a high-copy suppressor of puf6Δ. Puf6 and Loc1 function together in the asymmetric distribution and translational repression of ASH1 mRNA (20Long R.M. Gu W. Meng X.

They are both RNA-binding proteins, localized predominantly to the nucleolus, and required for the efficient assembly and export of 60S subunits (31Li Z. Lee I. Moradi E. Hung N.J. Johnson A.W.

Genomics. 2006; 276: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We asked whether they also work together in 60S biogenesis. Compared with puf6Δ, loc1Δ showed more severe defects in growth (Fig. 2A) and 60S biogenesis (Fig. 2, B–D). We first examined the potential genetic interaction between puf6Δ and loc1Δ. Interestingly, the deletion of PUF6 in loc1Δ partially rescued the growth rate at 25 and 30 °C and slightly rescued it at 37 °C. But at the lower temperature of 16 °C, the puf6Δloc1Δ double mutant displayed a worsened growth compared with either the puf6Δ or loc1Δ mutant (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the slow growing phenotype was correlated with its function in 60S biogenesis, we assayed the export of 60S subunits with Rpl11-GFP as a reporter. Although wild-type cells did not show nuclear accumulation of Rpl11-GFP, 30% of the puf6Δ cells had nuclear Rpl11-GFP at 30 °C (Fig. 2C). Rpl11 accumulated more strongly in the nucleus in loc1Δ cells, in which 86% of the cells showed nuclear accumulation of Rpl11-GFP (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the growth rate, the nuclear fraction of Rpl11 was reduced (45%) in puf6Δloc1Δ cells compared with loc1Δ cells (Fig. 2C). We further analyzed the ribosomal subunit levels in these strains. Interestingly, loc1Δ showed reduced amounts of both the 40S and 60S subunits. The additional deletion of PUF6 slightly enhanced the levels of both subunits above those of loc1Δ alone (Fig. 2D). The ability of the deletion of PUF6 to partially suppress the loc1Δ mutant implies a functional connection between Puf6 and Loc1 in 60S biogenesis. Puf6 and Loc1 interact directly (21Shahbabian K.

We asked whether Puf6 and Loc1 also exist concurrently on nascent 60S. We selected several 60S-associated trans-acting factors and immunoprecipitated nascent 60S subunits with the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag.

Puf6 and Loc1 most strongly co-purified with Brx1, and the levels of Puf6 and Loc1 decreased in order from the Brx1-, Tif6-, Arx1-, and Rix1-containing nascent 60S subunits (Fig. 3A). This observation is consistent with the nucleolar distribution of Puf6 and Loc1. To further demonstrate that Puf6 and Loc1 coexist on nascent 60S subunits, ribosomal subunits were pelleted by ultracentrifugation to separate them from free proteins. The pellets were resuspended in buffer and immunoprecipitated with Puf6 or Loc1. Each protein co-purified with the other and with pre-60S (Fig. 3B). Neither protein was significantly immunoprecipitated in the untagged control. These results demonstrate that Loc1 and Puf6 bind concurrently to the same nascent 60S particles. To further dissect the functional connection between Puf6 and Loc1, the cellular localization of Puf6 was monitored in the loc1Δ condition and vice versa. Sik1-mRFP was used as a nucleolar marker. Puf6 and Loc1 are localized predominantly in the nucleolus in wild-type cells. Interestingly, Puf6 showed increased mislocalization to the nucleoplasm in loc1Δ cells, and a similar result was observed for Loc1 in puf6Δ cells (Fig. 3C). We also checked the protein distributions of Nug1, Nog2, and Tif6. They were still localized predominantly in the nucleolus in puf6Δ and loc1Δ and no significant differences were observed from that of the wild type (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the loss of Puf6 specifically results in the mislocalization of Loc1 and vice versa. To test whether these nuclear diffused proteins are free or 60S-bound, we immunoprecipitated nascent 60S subunits using the trans-acting factors Ssf1, Brx1, Nug1, and Nog2. Although Ssf1 and Brx1 immunoprecipitated comparable amounts of Loc1 in wild-type and puf6Δ cells, Puf6 was enriched 1.5–2-fold in loc1Δ cells compared with the level in the wild type (Fig. 3D). Nug1 and Nog2 immunoprecipitated low levels of Loc1 in wild-type cells but had a 3–4-fold increased amount of Loc1 in puf6Δ (Fig. 3E, left panel). The accumulation of Puf6 increased ∼1.3–1.7-fold in loc1Δ cells in Nug1- and Nog2-containing 60S subunits (Fig. 3E, right panel). These data demonstrate that Puf6 and Loc1 do not depend on each other for binding to pre-60S subunits but that deletion of either protein causes the other to accumulate on pre-60S subunits. The protein accumulation on intermediates may suggest that transitions between steps in biogenesis are slowed. We next asked whether direct interaction could be detected among these factors. Recombinant His6-tagged Puf6 and GST-tagged Loc1 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Glutathione beads were first incubated with extracts containing GST or GST-Loc1 and then incubated with protein extracts containing His6-tagged Puf6. Puf6 was pulled down with GST-Loc1 but not with GST alone (Fig. 4A, right panel, compare lanes 1 and 2) and the interaction was not disrupted by RNase treatment (Fig. 4A, right panel, compare lanes 2 and 3), suggesting direct physical interaction between Puf6 and Loc1. This result is consistent with the data published by Shahbabian et al. (21Shahbabian K. Jeronimo C. Forget A. Robert F. Chartrand P. Co-transcriptional recruitment of Puf6 by She2 couples translational repression to mRNA localization.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 8692-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We then tested whether Rpl43 would interact directly with either Puf6 or Loc1. The interactions between GST-Rpl43 and His6-tagged Puf6 or Loc1 were assessed in vitro. Surprisingly, both Puf6 and Loc1 co-eluted with GST-Rpl43 but not with GST alone (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 3 and lanes 2 and 4). The above data suggest a direct protein-protein interaction between Puf6 and Loc1, Loc1 and Rpl43, and Rpl43 and Puf6. Rpl43 had a direct physical interaction with Puf6 and Loc1 in in vitro assays (Fig. 4B). Consequently, we wondered whether they coexisted on the same pre-60S particle in vivo. Puf6-myc and Loc1-myc were immunoprecipitated, and the presence of Rpl43 was detected by Western blotting. Rpl43 was present in both Puf6- and Loc1-containing nascent 60S subunits (Fig. 5A). During the course of this work, we noticed that although the Rpl43 protein levels were comparable in wild-type and puf6Δ mutant cells, they decreased significantly in loc1Δ cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that Loc1 may play a role in loading Rpl43. The association of Rpl43 with nascent 60S subunits was further examined in puf6Δ and loc1Δ strains. Pre-60S subunits were immunoprecipitated with Nog2-myc and Arx1-myc. Surprisingly, the level of Rpl43 decreased dramatically in pre-60S subunits in loc1Δ but not the level of Rpl23 (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 2 and 4 and lanes 5 and 7), which suggests that Loc1 is required to accommodate Rpl43. In contrast, the level of Rpl43 on pre-60S subunits was slightly decreased in Nog2 containing pre-60S in puf6Δ cells compared with the WT cells (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 2 and 3) but not in Arx1-containing subunits (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 5 and 6) or Nmd3-containing subunits (data not shown). Arx1 and Nmd3 are required for the efficient export of 60S subunits from the nucleus. These results suggest that the decrease of Rpl43 on pre-60S particles in puf6Δ cells is more pronounced in the earlier nuclear steps but not in the later nuclear or cytoplasmic steps. As Rpl43 levels were much lower in loc1Δ cells, perhaps the decrease of Rpl43 levels accounted for the more severe defects in the growth and ribosomal levels of loc1Δ versus puf6Δ cells (Fig. 2).

We compared impact stresses in subchondral bone between two subject-specific, three-dimensional, finite-element models of the equine metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint-one with advanced OA and one healthy, and with similar published data on the stresses that occur at midstance.Two right MCP joints (third metacarpal and proximal phalanx) were scanned using micro-computed tomography (μCT). Images were segmented, and meshed using modified 10-node quadratic tetrahedral elements. Bone material properties were assigned based on the bone density. An impact velocity of 3.55 m/s was applied to each model and contact pressures and stress distribution were calculated for each. In a separate iteration, the third metacarpal was loaded statically. A sampling grid of 160 equidistant points was superimposed over selected slices, and average peak stresses were calculated for 6 anatomical regions. Within-region maximal peak and average von Mises stresses were compared between healthy and OA bones in both midstance and impact loading.Average impact stresses across all regions, in both locations (palmar and dorsal) were greater in the OA model. Highest impact stresses were located in the dorsal medial condyle in the healthy (12.8 MPa) and OA (14.1MPa) models, and were lowest in the palmar medial and lateral parasagittal grooves in the healthy (5.94 MPa) and OA (7.07 MPa) models. The healthy static model had higher peak (up to 49.7% greater) and average (up to 38.6% greater) stresses in both locations and across all regions compared to the OA static model.Under simulated footfall a trot, loading on the dorsal aspect of the third metacarpal at impact created stresses similar to those found during midstance. The high accelerations that occur under impact loading are likely responsible for creating the high stresses, as opposed to midstance loading where the high stresses are the result of high mass loading. Although the stress magnitudes were found to be similar among the two loading conditions, the location of the high stress loading occurred in sites that are not typically associated with osteoarthritic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2478825592,"Background Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with substantial mortality and risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Despite considerable growth in incidence of severe AKI, information pertaining to trends in outcomes remains limited. We evaluated time trends in one year risks of ESRD and death in patients with dialysis-requiring AKI over an eight year period in Denmark. Methods In a retrospective nationwide study based on national registers, all adults requiring acute renal replacement therapy between 2005 and 2012 were identified. Patients with preceding ESRD were excluded. Through individual-level cross-referencing of administrative registries, information pertaining to comorbidity, preceding surgical interventions, and concurrent other organ failure and sepsis was ascertained. Comparisons of period-specific one year odds ratios for ESRD and death were calculated in a multiple logistic regression model. Results A total of 13,819 patients with dialysis-requiring AKI were included in the study. Within one year, 1,017 (7.4%) patients were registered with ESRD, and 7,908 (57.2%) patients died. The one-year rate of ESRD decreased from 9.0% between 2005 and 2006 to 6.1% between 2011 and 2012. Simultaneously, the one-year mortality rate decreased from 58.2% between 2005 and 2006 to 57.5% between 2011 and 2012. Consequently, the adjusted odds ratios for the period 2011–2012 (with the period 2005–2006 as reference) were 0.75 (0.60–0.95, p = 0.015) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.78–0.97, p = 0.010) for ESRD and death, respectively. Conclusions In a nationwide retrospective study on time trends in one year outcomes following dialysis-requiring AKI, risk of all-cause mortality and ESRD decreased over a period of 8 years."

New biomarkers of fibrosis are therefore constantly sought for, leading us to evaluate procollagen C-proteinase enhancer 1 (PCPE-1), a fibrosis-related extracellular matrix glycoprotein, as a plasma marker of fibrosis. A sandwich ELISA that permitted accurate measurements of PCPE-1 concentrations in mouse plasma was established. Tissue fibrosis was assessed using histochemical, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting analyses for type I collagen and PCPE-1. The normal plasma concentration of PCPE-1 in 6 weeks to 4 months old mice was ~200 ng/ml (189.5 ± 11.3 to 206.8 ± 13.8 ng/ml). PCPE-1 plasma concentrations in four and 8.5 months old mdx mice displaying fibrotic diaphragms increased 27 and 40% respectively relatively to age-matched control mice, an increase comparable to that of the N-propeptide of procollagen type III (PIIINP), a known blood marker of fibrosis. PCPE-1 plasma levels in mice with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis increased 34 to 50% relatively to respective controls and reflected the severity of the disease, namely increased gradually during the progression of fibrosis and went down to basal levels during recovery, in parallel to changes in the liver content of collagen I and PCPE-1. The results favor PCPE-1 as a potential new clinically valuable fibrosis biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2494280070,"Recent exploitation of the avian immune system has highlighted its suitability for the generation of high-quality, high-affinity antibodies to a wide range of antigens for a number of therapeutic and biotechnological applications. The glycosylation profile of potential immunoglobulin therapeutics is species specific and is heavily influenced by the cell-line/culture conditions used for production. Hence, knowledge of the carbohydrate moieties present on immunoglobulins is essential as certain glycan structures can adversely impact their physicochemical and biological properties. This study describes the detailed N-glycan profile of IgY polyclonal antibodies from the serum of leghorn chickens using a fully quantitative high-throughput N-glycan analysis approach, based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) separation of released glycans. Structural assignments revealed serum IgY to contain complex bi-, tri- and tetra-antennary glycans with or without core fucose and bisects, hybrid and high mannose glycans. High sialic acid content was also observed, with the presence of rare sialic acid structures, likely polysialic acids. It is concluded that IgY is heavily decorated with complex glycans; however, no known non-human or immunogenic glycans were identified. Thus, IgY is a potentially promising candidate for immunoglobulin-based therapies for the treatment of various infectious diseases."

The most aggressive type, Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is one of the deadliest human diseases, with an average survival at diagnosis of about 1 year. Previous evidence suggests a link between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and gliomas. HCMV has been shown to be present in these tumors and several viral proteins can have oncogenic properties in glioma cells. Here we have investigated the presence of HCMV DNA, RNA and proteins in fifty-two gliomas of different grades of malignancy. The UL83 viral region, the early beta 2.7 RNA and viral protein were detected in 73%, 36% and 57% by qPCR, ISH and IHC, respectively. Positivity of the viral targets and viral load was independent of tumor type or grade suggesting no correlation between viral presence and tumor progression. Our results demonstrate high prevalence of the virus in gliomas from Brazilian patients, contributing to a better understanding of the association between HCMV infection and gliomas worldwide and supporting further investigations of the virus oncomodulatory properties."
https://openalex.org/W2497531187,"Contact dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is the phenomenon where CDI+ bacterial strain (inhibitor) inhibits the growth of CDI-strain (target) by direct cell to cell contact. CDI is mediated by cdiBAI gene cluster where CdiB facilitates the export of CdiA, an exotoxin, on the cell surface and CdiI acts as an immunity protein to protect CDI+ cells from autoinhibition. CdiA-CT, the C-terminal region of the toxin CdiA, from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 536 (UPEC536) is a latent tRNase that requires binding of a biosynthetic enzyme CysK (O-acetylserine sulfyhydrylase) for activation in the target cells. CdiA-CT can also interact simultaneously with CysK and immunity protein, CdiI, to form a ternary complex in UPEC536. But the role of CysK in the ternary complex is not clear. We studied the hydrodynamic, thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of binary and ternary complexes using AUC, ITC and SPR respectively, to investigate the role of CysK in UPEC536. We report that CdiA-CT binds CdiI and CysK with nanomolar range affinity. We further report that binding of CysK to CdiA-CT improves its affinity towards CdiI by ~40 fold resulting in the formation of a more stable complex with over ~130 fold decrease in dissociation rate. Thermal melting experiments also suggest the role of CysK in stabilizing CdiA-CT/CdiI complex as Tm of the binary complex shifts ~10°C upon binding CysK. Hence, CysK acts a modulator of CdiA-CT/CdiI interactions by stabilizing CdiA-CT/CdiI complex and may play a crucial role in preventing autoinhibition in UPEC536. This study reports a new moonlighting function of a biosynthetic enzyme, CysK, as a modulator of toxin/immunity interactions in UPEC536 inhibitor cells."

There were 2137 useable responses to the questionnaire from veterinarians in 78 countries. The majority of respondents (n = 1835/2137, 85.9%) undertook clinical work and worked in a high income country (n = 1576/1762, 89.4%). Respondents heard about the survey via national veterinary organisations or regulatory bodies (31.5%), online veterinary forums and websites (22.7%), regional, discipline-based or international veterinary organisations (22.7%) or by direct invitation from the researchers or via friends, colleagues or social media (7.6%). Clinicians and non-clinicians reportedly used journals most commonly (65.8%, n = 1207/1835; 75.6%, n = 216/286) followed by electronic resources (58.7%, n = 1077/1835; 55.9%, n = 160/286), respectively. Respondents listed a total of 518 journals and 567 electronic sources that they read. Differences in veterinarian preference for resources in developed, and developing countries, were found. The nominated journals most read were the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (12.7% of nominations) for clinicians and the Veterinary Record (5.7%) for non-clinicians. The most accessed electronic resource reported was the Veterinary Information Network (25.6%) for clinicians and PubMed (7.4%) for non-clinicians. In conclusion, a wide array of journals and electronic resources appear to be accessed by veterinarians worldwide. Veterinary organisations appear to play an important role in global communication and outreach to veterinarians and consideration should be given to how these channels could be best utilised for effective dissemination of key research findings."
https://openalex.org/W2477160069,"Sediments beneath modern ice sheets exert a key control on their flow, but are largely inaccessible except through geophysics or boreholes. In contrast, palaeo-ice sheet beds are accessible, and typically characterised by numerous bedforms. However, the interaction between bedforms and ice flow is poorly constrained and it is not clear how bedform sizes might reflect ice flow conditions. To better understand this link we present a first exploration of a variety of statistical models to explain the size distribution of some common subglacial bedforms (i.e., drumlins, ribbed moraine, MSGL). By considering a range of models, constructed to reflect key aspects of the physical processes, it is possible to infer that the size distributions are most effectively explained when the dynamics of ice-water-sediment interaction associated with bedform growth is fundamentally random. A ‘stochastic instability’ (SI) model, which integrates random bedform growth and shrinking through time with exponential growth, is preferred and is consistent with other observations of palaeo-bedforms and geophysical surveys of active ice sheets. Furthermore, we give a proof-of-concept demonstration that our statistical approach can bridge the gap between geomorphological observations and physical models, directly linking measurable size-frequency parameters to properties of ice sheet flow (e.g., ice velocity). Moreover, statistically developing existing models as proposed allows quantitative predictions to be made about sizes, making the models testable; a first illustration of this is given for a hypothesised repeat geophysical survey of bedforms under active ice. Thus, we further demonstrate the potential of size-frequency distributions of subglacial bedforms to assist the elucidation of subglacial processes and better constrain ice sheet models."

Materials and Methods Fifty-two pigs were randomly divided into 4 groups: (1) the IR group (n = 24), where intestinal ischemia was induced by separating and clamping the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) for 2 h, followed by reperfusion for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h (IR-1h, IR-2h, IR-3h, and IR-4h; n = 6, respectively); (2) the sham-operated (SO) group (n = 20), where the SMA was separated without clamping and controlled at postoperative 3, 4, 5, and 6 h (SO-3h, SO-4h, SO-5h, and SO-6h; n = 5, respectively); (3) the ischemia group (n = 4), where the SMA was separated and clamped for 2 h, without reperfusion, and (4) baseline group (n = 4), an additional group that was not manipulated. Small intestinal CTPI was performed at corresponding time points and perfusion parameters were obtained. The distal ileum was resected to measure the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and for histopathological examination. Results The perfusion parameters of the IR groups showed significant differences compared with the corresponding SO groups and the baseline group (before ischemia). The blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability surface (PS) among the 4 IR groups were significantly different. BF and BV were significantly negatively correlated with MDA, and significantly positively correlated with SOD in the IR groups. Histopathologically, the effects of the 2-h ischemic loops were not significantly exacerbated by reperfusion. Conclusion CTPI can be a valuable tool for detecting microcirculatory dysfunction and for dynamic monitoring of small intestinal IR injury."

https://openalex.org/W2501167881,"The basic principle of nonlocal means is to denoise a pixel using the weighted average of the neighbourhood pixels, while the weight is decided by the similarity of these pixels. The key issue of the nonlocal means method is how to select similar patches and design the weight of them. There are two main contributions of this paper: The first contribution is that we use two images to denoise the pixel. These two noised images are with the same noise deviation. Instead of using only one image, we calculate the weight from two noised images. After the first denoising process, we get a pre-denoised image and a residual image. The second contribution is combining the nonlocal property between residual image and pre-denoised image. The improved nonlocal means method pays more attention on the similarity than the original one, which turns out to be very effective in eliminating gaussian noise.

https://openalex.org/W2489646739,"The European brown hare (Lepus europaeus, Pallas 1778) is an important small game species in Europe. Due to its size and position in the food chain, as well as its life history, phenotypic variation and the relatively recent speciation events, brown hare plays an important role in the structure of various ecosystems and has emerged as an important species for population management and evolutionary studies. In order to identify informative SNPs for such studies, heart and liver tissues of three samples from the European lineage and a three-sample pool from the Anatolian lineage were subjected to RNA-Sequencing analysis. This effort resulted in 9496 well-assembled protein-coding sequences with close homology to human. After applying very stringent filtering criteria, 66185 polymorphic sites were identified in 7665 genes/cds and 2050 of those polymorphic sites are potentially capable of distinguishing the European from the Anatolian lineage. From these distinguishing mutations we focused on those in genes that are involved in cellular energy production, namely the glycolysis, Krebs cycle and the OXPHOS machinery. A selected set of SNPs was also validated by Sanger sequencing. By simulating the three European individuals as one pool, no substantial informative-SNP identification was lost, making it a cost-efficient approach. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to correlate the differentiation in both nuclear and mitochondrial genome between the two different lineages of L. europaeus with the observed spatial partitioning of the lineages of the species, proposing a possible mechanism that is maintaining the reproductive isolation of the lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2500585058,"Background Grainyhead-like-3 (GRHL3) was recently identified as the second gene that, when mutated, can leads to Van der Woude syndrome, which is characterized by orofacial clefts (OFC) and lower lip pits. In addition, a missense variant (rs41268753) in GRHL3 confers risk for non-syndromic cleft palate cases of European ancestry. Together with interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6), GRHL3 may be associated with the risk of NSOFC which awaits for being verified across different ethnic populations. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the possible relationship between common functional variants in GRHL3 and susceptibility to NSOFC, especially cleft palate cases, in a Han Chinese population, one of the ethnic groups with the highest birth prevalence of orofacial clefting. Methods Because the allele frequency for rs41268753 minor alleles was zero in our Chinese population, we selected functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning GRHL3 with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) > 5% in the Han Chinese population. Two SNPs which meet the above criteria were then genotyped in a case-control cohort comprising 1145 individuals using the TaqMan 5′-exonuclease allelic discrimination assay. Results SNPs rs2486668 and rs545809 were used in this study. Overall genotype and allele distributions of both SNPs in general and stratified genotyping analyses revealed no statistically significant differences between cases and controls. Further logistic regression analyses using different genetic models failed to reveal any evidence that these markers influence risk to NSOFC. Conclusions The variant rs41268753 in GRHL3 increases the risk for cleft palate in European population, but our findings failed to detect the link between two GRHL3 SNPs (rs2486668 and rs545809) and risk to NSOFC in the Han Chinese cohort. Although the present study did not provide any evidence that common functional variants in GRHL3 may contribute to NSOFC etiology in this Chinese population, further studies with a larger sample size, additional SNPs, and a more diverse ethnic cohort are still warranted."

We report the development of a novel irreversible inhibitor of furin (QUB-F1) consisting of a diphenyl phosphonate electrophilic warhead coupled with a substrate-like peptide (RVKR), that also includes a biotin tag, to facilitate activity-based profiling/visualisation. QUB-F1 displays greater selectivity for furin, in comparison to a widely used exemplar compound (furin I) which has a chloromethylketone warhead coupled to RVKR, when tested against the serine trypsin-like proteases (trypsin, prostasin and matriptase), factor Xa and the cysteine protease cathepsin B. We demonstrate QUB-F1 does not prevent P. aeruginosa exotoxin A-induced airway epithelial cell toxicity; in contrast to furin I, despite inhibiting cell surface furin-like activity to a similar degree. This finding indicates additional proteases, which are sensitive to the more broad-spectrum furin I compound, may be involved in this process."

Samples were collected monthly and analyzed using the semi-automated system ZooScan. Salinity, temperature and phytoplankton abundance (nano and microphytoplankton) were also measured. Results show no significant temporal trend in sea surface temperature over the years. Between 2005–2010, salinity in the upper layer (0–80 m) of the Levantine basin increased (~0.3°C). During this 5 year period, total zooplankton abundance significantly increased. These modifications were concomitant to the activation of Aegean Sea as a source of dense water formation as part of the “Eastern Mediterranean Transient-like” event. The results of the present study suggested that zooplankton benefited from enhanced phytoplankton production during the mixing years of the event. Changes in the phenology of some taxa were observed accordingly with a predominantly advanced peak of zooplankton abundance. In conclusion, long-term changes in zooplankton abundance were related to the Levantine thermohaline circulation rather than sea surface warming. Sampling must be maintained to assess the impact of long-term climate change on zooplankton communities."

Steatosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. The structural protein core of the virus induces lipid droplet formation and localizes on the surface of the lipid droplets. However, the precise molecular mechanisms for the core-induced formation of lipid droplets remain elusive. Recently, we showed that the expression of the core protein in yeast as a model system could induce lipid droplet formation. In this study, we probed the cellular factors responsible for the formation of core-induced lipid-droplets in yeast cells. We demonstrated that one of the enzymes responsible for triglyceride synthesis, a phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (Lro1), is required for the core-induced lipid droplet formation. While core proteins inhibit Lro1 degradation and alter Lro1 localization, the characteristic localization of Lro1 adjacent to the lipid droplets appeared to be responsible for the core-induced lipid droplet formation. RNA virus genomes have evolved using high mutation rates to maintain their ability to replicate. Our observations suggest a functional relationship between the core protein with hepatocytes and yeast cells. The possible interactions between core proteins and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane affect the mobilization of specific proteins."

The photoperiodic information is transmitted through the retino-hypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), site of the master circadian clock. To investigate effects of day length change on the sheep SCN, we used in-situ hybridization to assess the daily temporal organization of expression of circadian clock genes (Per1, Per2, Bmal1 and Fbxl21) and neuropeptides (Vip, Grp and Avp) in animals acclimated to a short photoperiod (SP; 8h of light) and at 3 or 15 days following transfer to a long photoperiod (LP3, LP15, respectively; 16h of light), achieved by an acute 8-h delay of lights off. We found that waveforms of SCN gene expression conformed to those previously seen in LP acclimated animals within 3 days of transfer to LP. Mean levels of expression for Per1-2 and Fbxl21 were nearly 2-fold higher in the LP15 than in the SP group. The expression of Vip was arrhythmic and unaffected by photoperiod, while, in contrast to rodents, Grp expression was not detectable within the sheep SCN. Expression of the circadian output gene Avp cycled robustly in all photoperiod groups with no detectable change in phasing. Overall these data suggest that synchronizing effects of light on SCN circadian organisation proceed similarly in ungulates and in rodents, despite differences in neuropeptide gene expression."

No cure is yet available for this disease and infected trees generally decline after several months. Disease management depends on early detection of symptoms and chemical control of insect vectors. In this work, different combinations of organic compounds were tested for the ability to modulate citrus molecular responses to HLB disease beneficially. Three small-molecule regulating compounds were tested: 1) L-arginine, 2) 6-benzyl-adenine combined with gibberellins, and 3) sucrose combined with atrazine. Each treatment contained K-phite mineral solution and was tested at two different concentrations. Two trials were conducted: one in the greenhouse and the other in the orchard. In the greenhouse study, responses of 42 key genes involved in sugar and starch metabolism, hormone-related pathways, biotic stress responses, and secondary metabolism in treated and untreated mature leaves were analyzed. TGA5 was significantly induced by arginine. Benzyladenine and gibberellins enhanced two important genes involved in biotic stress responses: WRKY54 and WRKY59. Sucrose combined with atrazine mainly upregulated key genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism such as sucrose-phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase, starch synthase, and α-amylase. Atrazine also affected expression of some key genes involved in systemic acquired resistance such as EDS1, TGA6, WRKY33, and MYC2. Several treatments upregulated HSP82, which might help protect protein folding and integrity. A subset of key genes was chosen as biomarkers for molecular responses to treatments under field conditions. GPT2 was downregulated by all small-molecule treatments. Arginine-induced genes involved in systemic acquired resistance included PR1, WRKY70, and EDS1. These molecular data encourage long-term application of treatments that combine these regulating molecules in field trials."
https://openalex.org/W2496469496,"Water chestnut beetle (Galerucella birmanica Jacoby) is a pest of the water chestnut (Trapa natans L.). To analyze the phylogeny and biogeography of the beetle and provide evidence for the origin of T. natans in China, we conducted this by using three mitochondrial genes (COI, COII and Cytb) and nuclear ITS2 ribosomal DNA of G. birmanica. As for mtDNA genes, the beetle could be subdivided into three groups: northeastern China (NEC), central-northern-southern China (CC-NC-SC) and southwestern China (SWC) based on SAMOVA, phylogenetic analyses and haplotype networks. But for ITS2, no obvious lineages were obtained but individuals which were from NEC region clustered into one clade, which might be due to sequence conservation of ITS2. Significant genetic variation was observed among the three groups with infrequent gene flow between groups, which may have been restricted due to natural barriers and events in the Late Pleistocene. Based on our analyses of genetic variation in the CC-NC-SC geographical region, the star-like haplotype networks, approximate Bayesian computation, niche modelling and phylogeographic variation of the beetle, we concluded that the beetle population has been lasting in the lower, central reaches of the Yangtze River Basin with its host plant, water chestnut, which is consistent with archaeological records. Moreover, we speculate that the CC-NC-SC population of G. birmanica may have undergone a period of expansion coincident with domestication of the water chestnut approximately 113,900–126,500 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2485276252,"Saliva crystallization was previously studied in both humans and animals with various results. The study aimed to confirm of the presence of saliva crystallization in female Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), to evaluate the quality of samples which were collected from animals and processed by keepers, and to test preliminarily if the saliva crystallization could be connected with menstrual cycle and could serve as a cheap, quick and simple method for the basic monitoring of their reproductive status. The research was carried out from September 2014 to January 2015. Sampling of saliva was done in three female orangutans from three zoological gardens (Dvur Kralove, Usti nad Labem, Bojnice) daily, mostly by tongue prints on glass slides with ground edges or by sampling directly from the mouth using plastic spoons from which the saliva was transferred onto glass slides. Samples were evaluated by light microscopy with ×400 magnification. The quality of the sample and type of crystallization was assessed for two different approaches. In total, 246 samples were evaluated. We confirmed the presence of saliva crystallization in orangutans. The quality of samples was variable however acceptable. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect exact fertile period in two females. However in one orangutan female, when the crystallization was evaluated by the approach typically used in humans, we discovered that saliva crystallization during the fertile period significantly differed from saliva crystallization in the non-fertile period. This points out the possibility of using saliva crystallization for detection of the fertile period in orangutans. However, further research was recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2503107034,"Whether the diabetic heart benefits from ischemic preconditioning (IPC), similar to the non-diabetic heart, is a subject of controversy. We recently proposed new roles for iron and ferritin in IPC-protection in Type 1-like streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat heart. Here, we investigated iron homeostasis in Cohen diabetic sensitive rat (CDs) that develop hyperglycemia when fed on a high-sucrose/low-copper diet (HSD), but maintain normoglycemia on regular-diet (RD). Control Cohen-resistant rats (CDr) maintain normoglycemia on either diet. The IPC procedure improved the post-ischemic recovery of normoglycemic hearts (CDr-RD, CDr-HSD and CDs-RD). CDs-HSD hearts failed to show IPC-associated protection. The recovery of these CDs-HSD hearts following I/R (without prior IPC) was better than their RD controls. During IPC ferritin levels increased in normoglycemic hearts, and its level was maintained nearly constant during the subsequent prolonged ischemia, but decayed to its baseline level during the reperfusion phase. In CDs-HSD hearts the baseline levels of ferritin and ferritin-saturation with iron were notably higher than in the controls, and remained unchanged during the entire experiment. This unique and abnormal pattern of post-ischemic recovery of CDs-HSD hearts is associated with marked changes in myocardial iron homeostasis, and suggests that iron and iron-proteins play a causative role/s in the etiology of diabetes-associated cardiovascular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2485502977,"In traditional public good experiments participants receive an endowment from the experimenter that can be invested in a public good or kept in a private account. In this paper we present an experimental environment where participants can invest time during five days to contribute to a public good. Participants can make contributions to a linear public good by logging into a web application and performing virtual actions. We compared four treatments, with different group sizes and information of (relative) performance of other groups. We find that information feedback about performance of other groups has a small positive effect if we control for various attributes of the groups. Moreover, we find a significant effect of the contributions of others in the group in the previous day on the number of points earned in the current day. Our results confirm that people participate more when participants in their group participate more, and are influenced by information about the relative performance of other groups."
