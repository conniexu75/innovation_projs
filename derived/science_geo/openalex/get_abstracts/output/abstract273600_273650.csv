https://openalex.org/W2043401730,"Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were used to establish the phylogenetic affiliations of symbioses in which prokaryotes appear to confer sulfur-based chemoautotrophy on their invertebrate hosts. Two submarine hydrothermal vent animals, the vestimentiferan tube worm Riftia pachyptila and the clam Calyptogena magnifica, and a tidal-flat bivalve, Solemya velum, were inspected. 5S rRNA's were extracted from symbiont-bearing tissues, separated into unique forms, and their nucleotide sequences determined and related to other 5S rRNA's in a phylogenetic tree analysis. The prokaryotic symbionts are related to one another and affiliated with the same narrow phylogenetic grouping as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sequence comparisons suggest that Riftia is more closely related to the bivalves than their current taxonomic status would suggest."

Two-dimensional OH molecular concentrations were measured with planar laser-induced fluorescence excited by a sheet of light (formed from a single tunable ultraviolet laser pulse) and detected with a two-dimensional, image-intensified photodiode array camera. From the resulting data details of instantaneous flame front structures (including positions, shapes, and widths) were obtained."

Parascaris univalens chromosomes contain only terminal heterochromatin, while P. equorum chromosomes also contain intercalary heterochromatin. In the somatic cells of both species during early embryogenesis, chromatin diminution occurs in and consists of the elimination of all heterochromatin independent of its localization in the chromosomes."

A histocompatibility bioassay of clonal identity was used to ascertain the extent of phenotypic variation within natural clones of two species of marine sponges. Multiple morphological forms of the sponge Aplysina fistularis were found to occur within single clones, indicating a nongenetic polymorphism. In contrast, a genetic basis is suggested for a polymorphism of Aplysina cauliformis; within single clones of this species, individuals were uniform in color and morphology."

https://openalex.org/W1978736130,"Detailed field data on the occurrence, flow pattern, and internal dynamics of both surge and continuous turbidity currents have been obtained with a three-dimensional array of optical and thermal sensors. The array, operated in a glacial lake in southeastern British Columbia, collected detailed information on the character of surge events with velocities reaching 110 centimeters per second and continuous underflows exceeding 90 centimeters per second. The findings (i) indicate that such currents are frequent events, occurring with density differences between the incoming stream water and the lake water as low as 0.19 kilogram per cubic meter of water; (ii) document the differences in the initiation and internal characteristics of the continuous and surge events; and (iii) support the concept of erosion by turbidity currents."

https://openalex.org/W2019075794,"Two independently dated, high-resolution paleomagnetic records, one lacustrine and one archeological, record the passage across western North America of the same nondipole feature of the geomagnetic field during the time interval from A.D. 750 to 1450. Although these sequences indicate that correlation between paleomagnetic and archeomagnetic records is feasible under certain conditions, differences between the records underscore the difficulty of dating accurately an archeological site by correlation of a single archeomagnetic direction with a secular variation curve."

https://openalex.org/W2057452083,"The determination of chemical abundances of the interstellar medium is related to three different areas of astronomy: pregalactic conditions, stellar evolution, and chemical evolution of galaxies. The observed abundances permit the testing of theories associated with these areas. Knowledge of the abundances of helium, carbon, nitrogen, and neon relative to the abundance of hydrogen in the interstellar medium puts limits on current models of cosmology, stellar evolution, and galactic evolution."

https://openalex.org/W4241220177,"On page 1426 of the report ""Association of parvoviruses with rheumatoid arthritis of humans"" by R. W. Simpson et al. (30 Mar., p. 1425), a portion of the text beginning on line 18 of the first full paragraph in column 3 was incorrectly printed. It should have read, ""We were unable to detect 24-nm particles in brains of normal mice from our colony or mice intracerebrally inoculated with extracts of synovial cells from patients with noninflammatory degenerative joint disease (DJD). More conclusive evidence for the identity of RA-1 as a parvovirus comes from our recent success in demonstrating that CsCl gradient fractions containing the infectious 24-nm particles can be extracted for a single-stranded DNA which is approximately 4.5 kilobases in size."""
https://openalex.org/W1975645106,"The necessity of assessing the future results of the use of fossil fuels is discussed. The need for further investigation of the effects of elevated CO/sub 2/ levels on plant growth is emphasized. Data is reviewed on the response of photosynthesizing plants to levels of CO/sub 2/ approximately double current ones. The book is concerned with the levels of possible change to individuals plants and plant communities over a spectrum of environmental conditions. It is shown that the insufficient ambient CO/sub 2/ in the present atmosphere is a limitation to photosynthesis in C3 species and that a large portion of the newly fixed carbon can be lost by the process of photorespiration in these plants. It is concluded that a doubling of the atmospheric CO/sub 2/ will promote increased rates of CO/sub 2/ fixation, but there is no evidence to suggest that increased photosynthesis could prevent the rise in ambient CO/sub 2/."

https://openalex.org/W2099347889,"Bacterial cultures, viruses, bacteriophages, and other materials which might be dried and sealed in small containers under the original vacuum are frequently kept for months or years before use. Methods commonly used for identification of such tubes, frequently only 7-10 mm. in diameter, are unsatisfactory. Gummed-paper labels are defaced or soak off during the customary preliminary freezing. If a spiral strip of paper is used, the contents of the tube may not be readily visible for inspection. Paper labels of any type are likely to become dry and frequently fall off during prolonged storage under varying conditions of humidity; furthermore, they are subjected to the attentions of the cockroaches and silverfish which are too frequently present in many laboratories. Adhesive tape is awkward to handle and difficult to write on. Scotch tape protects labels to some extent, but eventually dries. Writing on the container itself with wax pencil is impermanent, while the use of a diamond point introduces the possibility of weakening the glass. Most small containers do not afford sufficient area to permit inscribing adequate data. Introduction of a marker into the tube before use is more satisfactory. Permanent identification can be afforded by colored seed glass beads now available at 5and 10-cent stores. These beads, about 2 mm. in diameter and 1 mm. in height, can be obtained for about 15 cents per vial containing approximately 1,000 beads. Ten clearly differentiated colors are sold. The beads are made of colored glass and do not change color after being subjected to autoclaving or treatment in the hotair sterilizer. No toxic effect has been apparent. They can be introduced into the tube and sterilized with it or can be sterilized separately and put into the tube with aseptic precautions. The colors are readily visible after the culture or other material has been dried in the usual amounts. A standard code for identification of cultures dried by lyophile, cryochem, or other processes would permit exchange of materials between laboratories and ready identification. By a suggested system, now in use, a single bead is assigned to each of the major groups as follows: red, Clostridium; purple, Corynebacterium; green, Hemophilus; blue, Neisseria; white, Pasteurella; yellow, Salmonella; brown, Shigella; black, Streptococcus; gold, bacteriophage; and silver, virus. Forty-five additional generic combinations can be made by using two beads, each of different color. The use of an indicator code for each genus reduces records to a minimum, permits rapid recognition, and will simplify correspondence. Amplifying this system, the species is represented by two beads of the same color. With a single genus indicator bead, 10 species can be identified, using a total of three beads per tube. An additional 10 species can be identified by using three similarly colored beads with the single genus indicator color. When this possibility is exhausted, the number of combinations becomes greatly increased, since the addition of four beads to the genus indicator permits the possibility of representing the species by pairs differing in color from each other. If the genus is represented by two single beads of different colors, the 8"
