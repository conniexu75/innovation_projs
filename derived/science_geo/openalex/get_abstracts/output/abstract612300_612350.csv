https://openalex.org/W2805301067,"Theoretical models of critical mass have shown how minority groups can initiate social change dynamics in the emergence of new social conventions. Here, we study an artificial system of social conventions in which human subjects interact to establish a new coordination equilibrium. The findings provide direct empirical demonstration of the existence of a tipping point in the dynamics of changing social conventions. When minority groups reached the critical mass-that is, the critical group size for initiating social change-they were consistently able to overturn the established behavior. The size of the required critical mass is expected to vary based on theoretically identifiable features of a social setting. Our results show that the theoretically predicted dynamics of critical mass do in fact emerge as expected within an empirical system of social coordination."

Although there are several ways of exploiting nonlinear light-matter interactions to coax silicon into optical functionality, the effects tend to be weak. Otterstrom et al. used a suspended silicon waveguide racetrack structure to stimulate the stronger nonlinear effect of Brillouin scattering and achieve lasing from silicon. The ability to engineer the nonlinearity and tune the optical response through the design of the suspended cavity provides a powerful and flexible route for developing silicon-based optoelectronic circuits and devices.

Under light conditions favoring PSII excitation, the PSII antenna, light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), is phosphorylated and forms a supercomplex with PSI core and the PSI antenna, light-harvesting complex I (LHCI). Both LHCI and LHCII then transfer excitation energy to the PSI core. We report the structure of maize PSI-LHCI-LHCII solved by cryo-electron microscopy, revealing the recognition site between LHCII and PSI. The PSI subunits PsaN and PsaO are observed at the PSI-LHCI interface and the PSI-LHCII interface, respectively. Each subunit relays excitation to PSI core through a pair of chlorophyll molecules, thus revealing previously unseen paths for energy transfer between the antennas and the PSI core."

Although recent research has shown that some other vertebrates understand the concept of the “empty set,” Howard et al. now show that an understanding of this concept is present in untrained honey bees (see the Perspective by Nieder). This finding suggests that such an understanding has evolved independently in distantly related species that deal with complexity in their environments, and that it may be more widespread than previously appreciated.

Such genetic barriers can prevent the movement of potentially beneficial genes from wild rice into domestic varieties. To understand the barriers preventing gene flow, Yu et al. mapped a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that determines sterility between wild-type and domestic rice. This QTL encodes two open reading frames (ORFs) that are both expressed during gametogenesis. The ORFs encode a toxin, which affects the development of pollen, and an antidote, which is required for pollen viability. Thus, selfish genetic elements can underlie evolutionary strategies that facilitate reproductive isolation. Science , this issue p. 1130"

This study analyzes the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on diet-induced obesity through regulation of BA signaling and gut microbiota. The data revealed that EGCG effectively reduced diet-increased obesity, visceral fat, and insulin resistance. Gene profiling data showed that EGCG had a significant impact on regulating genes implicated in fatty acid uptake, adipogenesis, and metabolism in the adipose tissue. In addition, metabolomics analysis revealed that EGCG altered the lipid and sugar metabolic pathways. In the intestine, EGCG reduced the FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic acid, as well as the FXR-regulated pathway, suggesting intestinal FXR deactivation. However, in the liver, EGCG increased the concentration of FXR and TGR-5 agonists and their regulated signaling. Furthermore, our data suggested that EGCG activated Takeda G protein receptor (TGR)-5 based on increased GLP-1 release and elevated serum PYY level. EGCG and antibiotics had distinct antibacterial effects. They also differentially altered body weight and BA composition. EGCG, but not antibiotics, increased Verrucomicrobiaceae, under which EGCG promoted intestinal bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila. Excitingly, A. muciniphila was as effective as EGCG in treating diet-induced obesity. Together, EGCG shifts gut microbiota and regulates BA signaling thereby having a metabolic beneficial effect.—Sheng, L., Jena, P. K., Liu, H.-X., Hu, Y., Nagar, N., Bronner, D. N., Settles, M.

We aimed to determine the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDR) of parC and gyrA in cultured M. genitalium strains. In addition, we examined the prevalence of macrolide- and fluoroquinolone resistance mediating mutations in specimens collected from Japanese male patients with urethritis in two time-periods between 2005-2009 and 2010-2017, respectively, by sequencing the QRDR of parC and gyrA and domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, doxycycline, minocycline, azithromycin and clarithromycin were determined in 23 M. genitalium strains. Three cultured strains had elevated MICs for moxifloxacin at 16, 4 and 2 mg/L and had SNPs with the amino-acid change Ser83→Ile in ParC (p<0.001) and 3 kinds of SNPs with amino-acid changes Asp99→Asn, Gly93→Cys and Met95→Ile in GyrA, respectively. Among a total of 148 M. genitalium positive urine specimens, the prevalence of A2058G and A2059G SNPs in the 23S rRNA gene and any SNPs in ParC increased from 4.8% and 22.6% in 2005-2009 to 42.2% and 53.1% in 2010-2017, respectively. If M. genitalium is considered multi-drug resistant in clinical specimens carrying SNPs in the 23S rRNA gene and Ser83→Ile in ParC, the prevalence of multi-drug resistance is 12.5% in 2010-2017 in Japan. In conclusion, the SNP resulting in Ser83→Ile in ParC is closely related to moxifloxacin resistance even though other factors may also affect treatment outcomes by moxifloxacin. The prevalence of circulating multi-drug resistant M. genitalium strains with macrolide- and fluoroquinolone-resistance is dramatically increasing in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2806274529,"Overexpression of the androgen receptor (AR) characterizes a distinct molecular subset of triple negative breast carcinomas (TNBC). The role of AR as a prognostic/predictive biomarker in TNBC is controversial, but increasing evidence suggests that this subset may respond to therapeutic agents targeting AR. Evaluation of AR has not been standardized, and criteria for selection of patients for antiandrogen therapy remain controversial. In this study we determine the appropriate threshold of AR immunoreactivity to define AR positive (AR+) TNBC, describe the clinicopathologic features of AR+ TNBC, and discuss the utility of AR positivity as a prognostic and predictive marker in TNBC.135 invasive TNBC processed in accordance with ASCO/CAP guidelines, were immunostained for AR. Clinicopathologic features of AR+ TNBC were analyzed and compared to AR negative (AR-) TNBC. Patients' age, tumor size, tumor grade, lymph node status, proliferation rate, immunopositivity for EGFR, CK5/6, Ki-67, and disease free survival (DFS) were evaluated statistically.A 1% cutpoint was confirmed as the appropriate threshold for AR positivity. Using this cutpoint 41% of 135 TNBC were AR+. AR+ TNBC occurred in older women, were larger, had lower mean proliferation rate and increased incidence of axillary metastasis than AR- TNBC. 76% of TNBC with apocrine morphology were AR+. A subset of AR+TNBC expressed basal markers (EGFR and CK5/6). A prognostic model was created.AR identifies a heterogeneous group of TNBC. Additional evaluation of EGFR expression allowed us to stratify TNBCs into 3 risk groups with significant differences in DFS and therapeutic implications: low-risk (AR+ EGFR-) which represents the LAR molecular subtype with the best prognosis and may benefit the most from anti-androgen therapies; high-risk (AR- EGFR+) which represents the basal molecular subtype with the worst prognosis and may benefit the most from chemotherapy regimens; intermediate-risk (AR+EGFR+ and AR-EGFR-) TNBC with an intermediate prognosis. Prospective trials are required to further validate this prognostic and predictive grouping."
https://openalex.org/W2805704277,"This study investigated the epidemiology and risk factors associated with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) during induction chemotherapy in a cohort of Taiwanese patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). IFIs are a significant complication in the management of immunocompromised cancer patients; such infections are associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality, particularly in many South-Asian countries, where IFI rates are increasing. We retrospectively analyzed IFI incidence data from 105 patients with newly diagnosed AML at a single center undergoing their first course of induction chemotherapy without primary antifungal prophylaxis between November 2008 and December 2014. Of 21 cases documented as proven/provable IFIs 16 (76%) were invasive aspergillosis, 2 (10%) were mucormycosis infections, and 3 (14%) were proven yeast infections. The lung was the most commonly affected site (n = 16; 76%); 2 patients (10%) developed fungal sinusitis. IFI cases were more often males (P = 0.020). In multivariate analysis, patients with neutropenia lasting>30 days were more than twice as likely to develop IFI (OR, 2.24 [95% CI, 2.81–31.11], P<0.001). We also confirmed patients with smoker and receiving parenteral nutrition during chemotherapy were significant associated with IFIs. Our findings suggest that antifungal prophylaxis should be considered for patients with AML during induction chemotherapy, particularly in patients from Southeastern Asia, an area of potentially high IFI rates. We recommend that clinicians determine which patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML are at high risk of developing IFI, to allow for targeted therapeutic prophylaxis."

This study aimed to evaluate the life expectancy and the causes of death of patients with BSCL. Method We analyzed death certificates, and medical records of BSCL patients who died between 1997 and 2017. If the death certificate was incomplete or unavailable, we reviewed the medical records, and if they were not available too, we collected information from the patient's relatives to understand how the death happened. We calculated the potential years of life lost as a result of premature death. Results Twenty patients (12 female and 8 male) died between 1997 and 2017. The mean age at the time of death was 27.1±12.4 years (women 25.2±12.5 vs. men 29.9±12.6 years, p = 0.41). Life expectancy for the study population was 62.9±4.8 years. The potential number of years of life lost was 35.6±16.6 years. The causes of deaths were divided into three major groups: infections (7 patients, 35%), liver disease (7 patients, 35%), and other causes (acute pancreatitis, one patient; renal failure, three patients; sudden death/myocardial infarction, two patients). Three patients had pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusion BSCL led to premature death, cutting the patients’ lifespan by 30 or more years. The majority of these young patients died of liver disease or infection. Other studies are needed to understand better the mechanisms that predispose to infections, as well as to assess whether new therapies can alter the natural history of this disease."

The aim of this study was to investigate TLR2 (-196 to-174del), TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) and TLR9 (T1237C and T1486C) gene polymorphisms at risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression. Methods Peripheral blood was obtained from 397 patients with adjuvant (stage II/III, n = 202) and metastatic (n = 195) CRC. Moreover, blood samples from 50 healthy volunteers and 40 patients with adenomatous polyps were also included as control groups. DNA from patients and controls was analyzed using PCR and PCR-RFLP for genotyping functional polymorphism within TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 genotypes. Results TLR2–196 to-174del/del genotype was detected in 76.6% of the patients and was significantly higher that the controls groups (p<0.001). TLR4 Asp299Gly, TLR4 Thr399Ile, TLR9 T1237C and T1486C homozygous genotypes were detected in 70.5%, 70.5%, 61.5% and 61.5% of the patients respectively, and were also significantly higher than that in the control groups (p<0.001). All polymorphisms detected were also significantly associated with the metastatic disease (p<0.001) leading to shorter overall survival (p<0.001); whereas, TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms were significantly associated with KRAS mutations. Conclusions The detection of higher frequencies of the TLR2, TLR4 and/or TLR9 polymorphisms in CRC patients compared with the control groups highlight the role of these polymorphism in CRC development and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2805050726,"Lysosomal dysfunction is associated with a number of age-related pathologies that affect all organ systems. While much research has focused on neurodegenerative diseases and aging-induced changes in neurons, much less is known about the impact that aging has on lower urinary tract function. Our studies explored age-dependent changes in the content of endo-lysosomal organelles (i.e., multivesicular bodies, lysosomes, and the product of their fusion, endolysosomes) and age-induced effects on lysosomal degradation in the urothelium, the epithelial tissue that lines the inner surface of the bladder, ureters, and renal pelvis. When examined by transmission electron microscopy, the urothelium from young adult rats (~3 months), mature adult rats (~12 months), and aged rats (~26 months old) demonstrated a progressive age-related accumulation of aberrantly large endolysosomes (up to 7μm in diameter) that contained undigested content, likely indicating impaired degradation. Stereological analysis confirmed that aged endolysosomes occupied approximately 300% more volume than their younger counterparts while no age-related change was observed in multivesicular bodies or lysosomes. Consistent with diminished endolysosomal degradation, we observed that cathepsin B activity was significantly decreased in aged versus young urothelial cell lysates as well as in live cells. Further, the endolysosomal pH of aged urothelium was higher than that of young adult (pH 6.0 vs pH 4.6). Our results indicate that there is a progressive decline in urothelial endolysosomal function during aging. How this contributes to bladder dysfunction in the elderly is discussed."

In this approach, critical method attributes (CMAs) and critical method parameters (CMPs) of the analytical method were determined using the same data collected from screening experiments. The HPLC-ELSD method for separation and quantification of sugars in Codonopsis Radix extract (CRE) samples and Astragali Radix extract (ARE) samples was developed as an example method with a novel AQbD approach. Potential CMAs and potential CMPs were found with Analytical Target Profile. After the screening experiments, the retention time of the D-glucose peak of CRE samples, the signal-to-noise ratio of the D-glucose peak of CRE samples, and retention time of the sucrose peak in ARE samples were considered CMAs. The initial and final composition of the mobile phase, flow rate, and column temperature were found to be CMPs using a standard partial regression coefficient method. The probability-based design space was calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation method and verified by experiments. The optimized method was validated to be accurate and precise, and then it was applied in the analysis of CRE and ARE samples. The present AQbD approach is efficient and suitable for analysis objects with complex compositions."
https://openalex.org/W2806725828,"The Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model is widely used for image classification, object recognition and image retrieval problems. In BoVW model, the local features are quantized and 2-D image space is represented in the form of order-less histogram of visual words. The image classification performance suffers due to the order-less representation of image. This paper presents a novel image representation that incorporates the spatial information to the inverted index of BoVW model. The spatial information is added by calculating the global relative spatial orientation of visual words in a rotation invariant manner. For this, we computed the geometric relationship between triplets of identical visual words by calculating an orthogonal vector relative to each point in the triplets of identical visual words. The histogram of visual words is calculated on the basis of the magnitude of these orthogonal vectors. This calculation provides the unique information regarding the relative position of visual words when they are collinear. The proposed image representation is evaluated by using four standard image benchmarks. The experimental results and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that the proposed image representation outperforms the existing state-of-the-art in terms of classification accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2806040421,"Despite the identification of MYCN amplification as an adverse prognostic marker in neuroblastoma, MYCN inhibitors have yet to be developed. Here, by integrating evidence from a whole-genome shRNA library screen and the computational inference of master regulator proteins, we identify transcription factor activating protein 4 (TFAP4) as a critical effector of MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma, providing a novel synthetic lethal target. We demonstrate that TFAP4 is a direct target of MYCN in neuroblastoma cells, and that its expression and activity strongly negatively correlate with neuroblastoma patient survival. Silencing TFAP4 selectively inhibits MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, silencing TFAP4 induces neuroblastoma differentiation, as evidenced by increased neurite outgrowth and upregulation of neuronal markers. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TFAP4 is a key regulator of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and may represent a valuable novel therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2806497304,"Over the past decade there has been increasing enthusiasm in the cognitive neurosciences around using network science to understand the system-level changes associated with brain disorders. A growing literature has used whole-brain fMRI analysis to examine changes in the brain’s subnetworks following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Much of network modeling in this literature has focused on static network mapping, which provides a window into gross inter-nodal relationships, but is insensitive to more subtle fluctuations in network dynamics, which may be an important predictor of neural network plasticity. In this study, we examine the dynamic connectivity with focus on state-level connectivity (state) and evaluate the reliability of dynamic network states over the course of two runs of intermittent task and resting data. The goal was to examine the dynamic properties of neural networks engaged periodically with task stimulation in order to determine: 1) the reliability of inter-nodal and network-level characteristics over time and 2) the transitions between distinct network states after traumatic brain injury. To do so, we enrolled 23 individuals with moderate and severe TBI at least 1-year post injury and 19 age- and education-matched healthy adults using functional MRI methods, dynamic connectivity modeling, and graph theory. The results reveal several distinct network “states” that were reliably evident when comparing runs; the overall frequency of dynamic network states are highly reproducible (r-values>0.8) for both samples. Analysis of movement between states resulted in fewer state transitions in the TBI sample and, in a few cases, brain injury resulted in the appearance of states not exhibited by the healthy control (HC) sample. Overall, the findings presented here demonstrate the reliability of observable dynamic mental states during periods of on-task performance and support emerging evidence that brain injury may result in diminished network dynamics."

It was first detected in France (in the southwest) in 2005. It has since expanded throughout Europe and has caused significant harm to honeybee populations. We must better characterize the hornet's flight capacity to understand the species' success and develop improved control strategies. Here, we carried out a study in which we quantified the flight capacities of V. velutina workers using computerized flight mills. We observed that workers were able to spend around 40% of the daily 7-hour flight tests flying. On average, they flew 10km to 30km during each flight test, although there was a large amount of variation. Workers sampled in early summer had lower flight capacities than workers sampled later in the season. Flight capacity decreased as workers aged. However, in the field, workers probably often die before this decrease becomes significant. During each flight test, workers performed several continuous flight phases of variable length that were separated by rest phases. Based on the length of those continuous flight phases and certain key assumptions, we estimated that V. velutina colony foraging radius is at least 700 m (half that in early summer); however, some workers are able to forage much farther. While these laboratory findings remain to be confirmed by field studies, our results can nonetheless help inform V. velutina biology and control efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2806277318,"We have developed a very simple method, termed absorbance summation (AS), for comparing protein concentrations between samples in ELISA assays without a standard. This method sums the observed absorbance values from all dilutions to obtain one data point for each sample to be used for comparison. AS is less computationally intensive than fitting sigmoidal curves, and it avoids the difficulty of parameter estimation for samples with absorbance values lying primarily at the lower tail of the curve. Our simulation studies showed that it performs much better than the sigmoidal curve fitting method and the conventional endpoint titer method. The power of this simple method is as high as the formal curve fitting followed by the estimation of area under the curve (AUC)."

The inter-genomic conservation of the PfRH5 complex proteins makes them attractive blood stage vaccine candidates. However, little is known about how antibodies to PfRH5, CyRPA and Pf113 are acquired and maintained in naturally exposed populations, and the role of PfRH5 complex proteins in naturally acquired immunity. To provide such data, we studied 206 Ghanaian children between the ages of 1–12 years, who were symptomatic, asymptomatic or aparasitemic and healthy. Plasma levels of antigen-specific IgG and IgG subclasses were measured by ELISA at several time points during acute disease and convalescence. On the day of admission with acute P. falciparum malaria, the prevalence of antibodies to PfRH5-complex proteins was low compared to other merozoite antigens (EBA175, GLURP-R0 and GLURP-R2). At convalescence, the levels of RH5-complex-specific IgG were reduced, with the decay of PfRH5-specific IgG being slower than the decay of IgG specific for CyRPA and Pf113. No correlation between IgG levels and protection against P. falciparum malaria was observed for any of the PfRH5 complex proteins. From this we conclude that specific IgG was induced against proteins from the PfRH5-complex during acute P. falciparum malaria, but the prevalence was low and the IgG levels decayed rapidly after treatment. These data indicate that the levels of IgG specific for PfRH5-complex proteins in natural infections in Ghanaian children were markers of recent exposure only."

https://openalex.org/W2806812693,"Using data provided by a ride-hailing platform, this paper examines the factors that affect taxi driver response behavior to ride-hailing requests. The empirical investigation from a driver's perspective is of great importance for ride-hailing service providers, given that approximately 40% of the hailing requests receive no response from any driver. To comprehensively understand taxi driver response behavior, we use a rich dataset to generate variables related to the spatio-temporal supply-demand intensities, the economic incentives, the requests' and the drivers' characteristics. The results show that drivers are more likely to respond to requests with economic incentives (especially a firm subsidy), and those with a lower spatio-temporal demand intensity or a higher spatio-temporal supply intensity. In addition, drivers are more likely to respond to requests involving rides covering a greater geographical distance and to those with a smaller number of repeated submissions. The drivers' characteristics, namely, the number of requests received and the number of requests responded, however, have relatively little impacts on their response probability to the current request. Our findings contribute to the related literature and provide managerial implications for ride-hailing service providers."

Although sustained hyperglycemia is a known risk factor of AF and poor ICU outcomes, emerging in-vitro studies reveal acute glycemic fluctuations to be an additional independent predictor of AF. The effect of acute glycemic fluctuations on the incidence of POAF in the clinical setting remains unclear. We aim to investigate the effect of the magnitude of acute perioperative glycemic fluctuations on the incidence of POAF in a multi-ethnic Southeast-Asian population.We obtained data from1743 patients who underwent elective CABG in a tertiary heart centre from 2009-2011. Patients were kept to a tight baseline glycemic control in accordance with hospital protocol. The magnitude of the difference between the highest and lowest perioperative glucose levels up till the first 48 postoperative hours was employed as a measure of glycemic fluctuation. Patients were divided into 4 groups for analysis based on the magnitude of glycemic fluctuation:A)0-2mmol/L(N = 147); B)>2-4mmol/L(N = 426); C)>4-6mmol/L(N = 513); D)>6mmol/L(N = 657).Our primary outcome was the incidence of POAF. Secondary outcomes included ICU and 30-day mortality and length of stay.The overall incidence of POAF was 14.7%. This increased as the magnitude of glycemic fluctuation increased, and was statistically highest in Group D(16.4%) as compared with the other 3 sub-groups. Multivariate logistic regression revealed the magnitude of perioperative glycemic fluctuation to be an independent risk factor of POAF(O.R.1.06, 95% C.I.1.01-1.11, p = 0.014).ICU length of stay was statistically highest in Group D(63.1 hours, p = < .001). However, ICU and 30 day mortality rates were similar among the 4 groups.Increased magnitudes of acute perioperative glycemic fluctuations are associated with a significantly increased risk of POAF and length of ICU stay; and should therefore be minimised but balanced against the risks of hypoglycemia so as to avoid POAF and optimise patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2807582825,"Exposure to light and accumulation of aberrant visual cycle by-products causes stress in the retina. The physical and chemical properties of carotenoids may provide protection against such scenario. These pigments exist in retinas of many vertebrates, including humans. However, the absence of carotenoids in mice, the preferred ophthalmologic animal model, hindered molecular and biochemical examination of the pigments′ role in vision. We established a mouse model that accumulates significant amounts of carotenoids in the retina due to inactivating mutations in the Isx and Bco2 genes. We introduced a robust light damage protocol for the mouse retina using green (532 nm) and blue (405 nm) low-energy lasers. We observed that blue but not green laser light treatment triggered the formation of aberrant retinaldehyde isomers in the retina. The production of these visual cycle by-products was accompanied by morphologic damage in inferior parts of the mouse retina. Zeaxanthin supplementation of mice shielded retinoids from these photochemical modifications. These pigments also reduced the extent of the damage to the retina after the blue laser light insult. Thus, our study discovered a novel role of carotenoids in the visual cycle and indicated that vertebrates accumulate carotenoids to shield photoreceptors from short-wavelength light- induced damage.—Widjaia-Adhi, M.

We examined some abiotic drivers of variability in locomotor activity of a free-ranging freshwater predatory fish, Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii), for six months using tri-axial accelerometers. Murray cod (n = 20) occupied discrete river reaches and generally exhibited small-scale movements (<5 km). Activity was highest during crepuscular and nocturnal periods when water temperatures were warmest (19-30°C; January-March). As water temperatures cooled (9-21°C; April-June) Murray cod were active throughout the full diel cycle and dormant periods were rarely observed. Light level, water temperature and river discharge all had a significant, non-linear effect on activity. Activity peaked during low light levels, at water temperatures of ~20°C, and at discharge rates of ~400 ML d-1. The temporal changes observed in the behaviour of Murray cod likely reflect the complex interactions between physiological requirements and prey resource behaviour and availability in driving activity, and highlight the importance of empirical field data to inform bioenergetics models."
https://openalex.org/W2805585026,"As a crucial living environment, the Internet shapes cognition. The Internet provides massive information that can be accessed quickly via hyperlinks, but the information is typically fragmentary and concrete rather than integrative. According to construal level theory, the processing of this concrete and fragmentary information, should reduce attentional scope. Two experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis. In Experiment 1, three groups of participants were asked to shop online, read magazines or have a rest respectively, and a divided attention Navon-letter task was employed to measure the attentional scope before and after the assigned activity. It was found that the difference between reaction times in response to local vs. global targets was decreased only after Internet use, while there was no decrease in either the reading or resting group. In Experiment 2, the same procedure was used, and EEG/ERP methods were used to record both behavioral response and neural activity. Results showed that before the assigned activity, there was no significant difference in N2 amplitude in response to local vs. global targets in any of the three groups; during the activity, the lower-alpha activity induced by Internet use was significantly lower than that induced by reading or resting; after the activity, correspondingly, a more negative N2 wave was induced by the global than local targets only in the Internet group, while there were no significant differences in the other groups. Consistent with construal level theory, the results suggest that when surfing the Internet, attentional scope is reduced, and this effect might continue after Internet activity."

While the fraction of population dependent on solid fuels has declined in these nations over the last 25 years, the number of people using them has risen. Here, we first assess current patterns of cooking energy use in these nations. We then apply a discrete model of household cooking choices and demand to simulate future pathways of clean cooking uptake and the outlook for achieving target 7.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. We find that by 2030, ensuing income growth is likely to enable 90% of urban populations in these nations to switch to using modern cooking energy services. However, without supporting policies, between 40% to 50% of rural Guatemalans and Hondurans, while over two-thirds of rural Nicaraguans, are likely to find clean fuels or stoves unaffordable in 2030. A targeted subsidy on modern fuels, like liquid petroleum gas (LPG), is the most effective policy mechanism we studied that could provide such support. A 50% subsidy policy on LPG targeted to the rural and urban poor population could, by 2030, make cooking with LPG affordable to an additional 7.3 million people in these countries. We estimate that such a policy would cost about $250 million per year and would have negligible greenhouse gas emissions impacts. Such a policy could also have significant health benefits, preventing about 8,890 premature deaths annually from reduced exposure to cooking-related household pollution in 2030."
https://openalex.org/W2807577281,"Laterality can be observed as side biases in locomotory behaviour which, in the horse, manifest inter alia as forelimb preferences, most notably in the gallop. The current study investigated possible leading-leg preferences at the population and individual level in Thoroughbred racehorses (n = 2095) making halt-to-gallop transitions. Videos of flat races in the UK (n = 350) were studied to record, for each horse, the lead-leg preference of the initial stride into gallop from the starting stalls. Races from clockwise (C) and anti-clockwise (AC) tracks were chosen alternately at random to ensure equal representation. Course direction, horse age and sex, position relative to the inside rail and finishing position were also noted. On C courses, the left/right ratio was 1.15, which represents a significant bias to the left (z = –2.29, p = 0.022), while on AC courses it was 0.92 (z = 0.51, p = 0.610). In both course directions, there was no significant difference between winning horses that led with the left leading leg versus the right (C courses, z = –1.32, p = 0.19 and AC courses, z = –0.74, p = 0.46). Of the 2,095 horses studied 51.26% led with their L fore and 48.74% with their R, with no statistically significant difference (z = -1.16, p = 0.25). Therefore, there was no evidence of a population level motor laterality. Additionally, 22 male and 22 female horses were randomly chosen for repeated measures of leading leg preference. A laterality index was calculated for each of the 44 horses studied using the repeated measures: 22 exhibited right laterality (of which two were statistically significant) and 21 exhibited left laterality (eight being statistically significant); one horse was ambilateral. Using these data, left lateralized horses were more strongly lateralized on an individual level than the right lateralized horses (t = 2.28, p = 0.03, DF = 34) and mares were more left lateralized than males (t = 2.4, p = 0.03, DF = 19)."

This study investigated the in situ expression of CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells and TGF-β1, IFN-γ, IL-17 in leprosy T1R and T2R. Tregs were evaluated in 114 skin biopsies from 74 leprosy patients: 56 T1R (28-paired reaction-free/reactional biopsies, 28 unpaired T1R), 18 T2R (12 paired reaction-free/reactional biopsies, 6 unpaired T2R). Double CD25+Foxp3+immunostained Treg cells obtained by automated platform (Ventana BenchMark XT, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) were counted (Nikon Eclipse E400 2mm2). Cytokine expression was evaluated by immunostaining in 96 biopsies (48 paired reaction-free/reactional lesions, 24 T1R, 24 T2R) using rabbit polyclonal anti human TGF-β1, IFN-γ, IL-17 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology CA, USA). Treg cell counts in leprosy reactional lesions were higher compared to reaction-free (p = 0.002). Treg numbers were higher in T1R compared to paired unreactional T1R lesions (p = 0.001). Similar frequency of Treg was seen in paired reactional versus unreactional T2R lesions. Higher expression of TGF-β, IFN-γ and IL-17 was seen in T2R lesions compared to T1R and reaction-free lesions. The increase in Treg cells during T1R suggests a suppressive role to control the exacerbated cellular immune response during T1R that can cause tissue and nerve damage. Evidences of upregulated Treg cells in TR1, which usually occurs in patients with Th1-Th17 immunity and the indications of the expression of Th17/IL-17 in T2R, which develops in patients with Th2-Treg profile, suggest plasticity of Treg-Th17 cells populations and a potential role for these cell populations in the immunopathogenesis of leprosy reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2806729437,"The pathophysiology of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure is not completely understood but impaired outward remodeling (OR) and intimal hyperplasia are thought to be contributors. This adverse vascular response after AVF surgery results from interplay between vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the extracellular matrix (ECM), and inflammatory cells. Relaxin (RLN) is a hormone that acts on the vasculature via interaction with RLN/insulin-like peptide family receptor 1 (RXFP1), resulting in vasodilata-tion, ECM remodeling, and decreased inflammation. In the present study, we evaluated the consequences of RXFP1 knockout (Rxfp1-/-)onAVF maturationinamurine modelofAVF failure. Rxfp1-/- mice showed a 22% decrease in vessel size at the venous outflow tract 14 d after AVF surgery. Furthermore, a 43% increase in elastin content was observed in the lesions of Rxfp1-/- mice and coincided with a 41% reduction in elastase activity. In addition, Rxfp1-/- mice displayed a 6-fold increase in CD45+ leukocytes, along with a 2-fold increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) levels, when compared with wild-type mice. In vitro,VSMCs from Rxfp1-/- mice exhibited a synthetic phenotype, as illustrated by augmentation of collagen, fibronectin, TGF-β, and platelet-derived growth factor mRNA. In addition, VSMCs derived from Rxfp1-/- mice showed a 5-fold increase in cell migration. Finally, RXFP1 and RLN expression levels were increased in human AVFs when compared with unoperated cephalic veins. In conclusion, RXFP1 deficiency hampers elastin degradation and results in induced vascular inflammation after AVF surgery. These processes impair OR in murine AVF, suggesting that the RLN axis could be a potential therapeutic target for promoting AVF maturation.—Bezhaeva T., de Vries M. R., Geelhoed W.

https://openalex.org/W2806209365,"The genus Anthroherpon Reitter, 1889 exhibits the most pronounced troglomorphic characters among Coleoptera, and represents one of the most spectacular radiations of subterranean beetles. However, radiation, diversification, and biogeography of this genus have never been studied in a phylogenetic context. This study provides a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the Anthroherpon radiation, using a dated molecular phylogeny as a framework for understanding Anthroherpon diversification, reconstructing the ancestral range, and exploring troglomorphic diversity. Based on 16 species and 22 subspecies, i.e. the majority of Anthroherpon diversity, we reconstructed the phylogeny using Bayesian analysis of six loci, both mitochondrial and nuclear, comprising a total of 4143 nucleotides. In parallel, a morphometric analysis was carried out with 79 landmarks on the body that were subjected to geometric morphometrics. We optimized morphometric features to phylogeny, in order to recognize the way troglomorphy was expressed in different clades of the tree, and did character evolution analyses. Finally, we reconstructed the ancestral range of the genus using BioGeoBEARS. Besides further elucidating the suprageneric classification of the East-Mediterranean Leptodirini, our main findings also show that Anthroherpon dates back to the Early Miocene (ca. 22 MYA) and that the genus diversified entirely underground. Biogeographic reconstruction of the ancestral range shows the origin of the genus in the area comprising three high mountains in western Montenegro, which is in the accordance with the available data on the paleogeography of the Balkan Peninsula. Character evolution analysis indicates that troglomorphic morphometric traits in Anthroherpon mostly evolve neutrally but may diverge adaptively under syntopic competition."
https://openalex.org/W2807056462,"Slaughterhouse surveillance through post-mortem meat inspection provides an important mechanism for detecting bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infections in cattle herds in Great Britain (GB), complementary to the live animal skin test based programme. We explore patterns in the numbers of herd breakdowns detected through slaughterhouse surveillance and develop a Bayesian hierarchical regression model to assess the associations of animal-level factors with the odds of an infected animal being detected in the slaughterhouse, allowing us to highlight slaughterhouses that show atypical patterns of detection. The analyses demonstrate that the numbers and proportions of breakdowns detected in slaughterhouses increased in GB over the period of study (1998-2013). The odds of an animal being a slaughterhouse case was strongly associated with the region of the country that the animal spent most of its life, with animals living in high-frequency testing areas of England having on average 21 times the odds of detection compared to animals living in Scotland. There was also a strong effect of age, with animals slaughtered at > 60 months of age having 5.3 times the odds of detection compared to animals slaughtered between 0-18 months of age. Smaller effects were observed for cattle having spent time on farms with a history of bTB, quarter of the year that the animal was slaughtered, movement and test history. Over-and-above these risks, the odds of detection increased by a factor of 1.1 for each year of the study. After adjustment for these variables, there were additional variations in risk between slaughterhouses and breed. Our framework has been adopted into the routine annual surveillance reporting carried out by the Animal Plant Health Agency and may be used to target more detailed investigation of meat inspection practices."
https://openalex.org/W2806035797,"Background Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in brain neurodegeneration and peripheral pathology affecting different organs including testis. Patients with HD suffer from motor and cognitive impairment, and multiple psychiatric symptoms. Among behavioral abnormalities in HD, sexual disturbances have often been reported, but scarcely investigated in animal models. The BACHD rat model of HD carries the human full-length mutated HTT (mHTT) genomic sequence with 97 CAG-CAA repeats and displays HD-like alterations at neuropathological and behavioral level. Objective This study aims to phenotype the BACHD rats’ sexual behavior and performance as well as testis morphology because alterations in these aspects have been associated to HD. Methods Two rat cohorts at the age of 3 and 7 months were subjected to mating tests to assess different parameters of sexual behavior. Histological analyses for testis morphology were performed in different rat cohorts at 1.5, 7 and 12 months of age whereas immunohistochemical analyses were carried out at 7 and 12 months of age to visualize the presence of mHTT in testicular tissue. Furthermore, western blot analyses were used to assess HTT and mHTT expression levels in striatum and testis at three months of age. Results At 3 months, BACHD rats showed a decreased time exploring the female anogenital area (AGA), decreased latency to mount, increased number of intromissions and ejaculations and enhanced hit rate. At 7 months, all sexual parameters were comparable between genotypes with the exception that BACHD rats explored the AGA less than wild type rats. Testis analyses did not reveal any morphological alteration at any of the examined ages, but showed presence of mHTT limited to Sertoli cells in transgenic rats at both 7 and 12 months. BACHD rat HTT and mHTT expression levels in testis were lower than striatum at 3 months of age. Conclusions The testis phenotype in the BACHD rat model does not mimic the changes observed in human HD testis. The altered sexual behavior in BACHD rats at three months of age could be to a certain extent representative of and share common underlying pathways with some of the sexual disturbances in HD patients. Further investigating the biological causes of the sexual phenotype in BACHD rats may therefore contribute to clarifying the mechanisms at the base of sexual behavior changes in HD."
https://openalex.org/W2805964336,"Mast cells, in addition to endocrine cells and neurons, are typical secretory cells. Their function in allergic inflammation is to secrete inflammatory mediators from secretory vesicles. Intracellular synthesized inflammatory mediators are transported by vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) to vesicles where they are stored. After stimulation, the contents of the secretory vesicles are released via exocytosis. This study established a high throughput imaging screening system to monitor the functions of secretory vesicles in mast cells, including molecular uptake via VMAT2 and the exocytotic process, by using a novel fluorescent probe, FFN206, which was developed as a VMAT2 substrate. After loading with FFN206, the rapid uptake of FFN206 was observed and secretory vesicles in mouse bone marrow derived mast cells and a cultured mast cell line were clearly visualized. FFN206 uptake by secretory vesicles was time-dependent and was blocked by reserpine. Furthermore, exocytotic trafficking was monitored dynamically by real-time high-throughput fluorescence quantitation. In the present study, we verified the application of FFN206 for the monitoring of functional vesicles. This high-throughput screening system may benefit instinctive drug evaluation."

Here, we aimed to develop a transgenic line of Daphnia magna that contains the human estrogen receptor alpha (hERα) and shows a fluorescence response to exposure of estrogens. We designed plasmids to express hERα in Daphnia (EF1α1:esr1) and to report estrogenic activity via red fluorescence (ERE:mcherry) under the control of estrogen response element (ERE). After confirmation of functionality of the plasmids by microinjection into embryos, the two plasmids were joined, a TALE site was added and integrated into the D. magna genome using TALEN. When the resulting transgenic Daphnia named the ES line was exposed to Diethylstilbestrol (DES) or 17β-Estradiol (E2), the ES line could reliably expressed red fluorescence derived from mCherry in a ligand-dependent manner, indicating that an estrogen-responsive line of D. magna was established. This is the first time a human gene was expressed in Daphnia, showcasing potential for further research."

Although a number of previous studies have examined which characteristics of the stimulus will produce the illusion, there is, until now, no description of the cognitive mechanism that underlies the illusion. We suggest that the processes found in Node Structure Theory that are used to explain normal language processing as well as other auditory illusions might also account for the Speech-to-Song Illusion. In six experiments we tested whether the satiation of lexical nodes, but continued priming of syllable nodes may lead to the Speech-to-Song Illusion. The results of these experiments provide evidence for the role of priming, activation, and satiation as described in Node Structure Theory as an explanation of the Speech-to-Song Illusion."

Over the years the efficacy of antibiotic treatment is becoming more fruitless due to the development of multiple drug resistant strains. Therefore, identification of new drug targets is a valuable tool for the development of new treatments for affected patients and can be obtained by targeting essential protein(s) of CjR. We conducted this in silico study in order to identify therapeutic targets by subtractive CjR proteome analysis. The most important proteins of the CjR proteome, which includes chokepoint enzymes, plasmid, virulence and antibiotic resistant proteins were annotated and subjected to subtractive analyses to filter out the CjR essential proteins from duplicate or human homologous proteins. Through the subtractive and characterization analysis we have identified 38 eligible therapeutic targets including 1 potential vaccine target. Also, 12 potential targets were found in interactive network, 5 targets to be dealt with FDA approved drugs and one pathway as potential pathway based drug target. In addition, a comprehensive database 'CampyNIBase' has also been developed. Besides the results of this study, the database is enriched with other information such as 3D models of the identified targets, experimental structures and Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences.

https://openalex.org/W2806404262,"There is an interest in identifying Anaphase Promoting-Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) inhibitors that lead to sensitivity to microtubule poisons as a strategy for targeting cancer cells. Using budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, peptides derived from the Mitotic Arrest Deficient 2 (Mad2)-binding motif of Cell Division Cycle 20 (Cdc20) were observed to inhibit both Cdc20- and CDC20 Homology 1 (Cdh1)-dependent APC/C activity. Over expression of peptides in vivo led to sensitivity to a microtubule poison and, in a recovery from a microtubule poison arrest, delayed degradation of yeast Securin protein Precocious Dissociation of Sisters 1 (Pds1). Peptides with mutations in the Cdc20 activating KILR-motif still bound APC/C, but lost the ability to inhibit APC/C in vitro and lost the ability to induce sensitivity to a microtubule poison in vivo. Thus, an APC/C binding and activation motif that promotes mitotic progression, namely the Cdc20 KILR-motif, can also function as an APC/C inhibitor when present in excess. Another activator for mitotic progression after recovery from microtubule poison is p31comet, where a yeast predicted open-reading frame YBR296C-A encoding a 39 amino acid predicted protein was identified by homology to p31comet, and named Tiny Yeast Comet 1 (TYC1). Tyc1 over expression resulted in sensitivity to microtubule poison. Tyc1 inhibited both APC/CCdc20 and APC/CCdh1 activities in vitro and bound to APC/C. A homologous peptide derived from human p31comet bound to and inhibited yeast APC/C demonstrating evolutionary retention of these biochemical activities. Cdc20 Mad2-binding motif peptides and Tyc1 disrupted the ability of the co-factors Cdc20 and Cdh1 to bind to APC/C, and co-over expression of both together in vivo resulted in an increased sensitivity to microtubule poison. We hypothesize that Cdc20 Mad2-binding motif peptides, Tyc1 and human hp31 peptide can serve as novel molecular tools for investigating APC/C inhibition that leads to sensitivity to microtubule poison in vivo."

We included children below 6 years of age who visited the emergency department (ED) after thermal injuries who were registered in the Korean Emergency Department-based Injury In-Depth Surveillance (2011-2016) database. Demographic characteristics, injury-related factors, and factors associated with ED treatment were gathered from the data. Then, we divided all children into two groups according to the ED discharge status: discharge versus admission (including cases transferred to other hospitals). The characteristics of the two groups were compared, and factors associated with admission were investigated. During the study period, 11,667 children with thermal injuries visited the ED. The number of boys was higher than the number of girls, and children aged 1 year accounted for the largest proportion. Most cases occurred in spring and indoors; the home was found to be the most common place. The most common type of burn was scald burns (69%), followed by contact burns (25.9%), and the most commonly burnt body area was the upper limbs (43.7%), followed by the lower limbs (16.8%). Most children (95.8%) were discharged home. The odds for hospital admission were lower for 2-3 and 4-5 year olds than for 0-1 year olds. The odds for hospital admission for contact burns were lower and those for electrical burns were higher than odds for hospital admission for scald burns. In summary, those aged 0-1 showed the largest incidence of thermal injuries and the most common burn mechanism was scald burns. Upper limbs were the most commonly affected body area, but their odds for requiring admission was lowest. Our results could be used as baseline data for prospective interventional studies investigating ways to reduce the incidence of childhood thermal injuries."

https://openalex.org/W2805393779,"Source analyses on event related potentials (ERPs) derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) were performed to examine the respective roles of cortical areas preceding exogenously triggered saccades, combined convergences, and combined divergences. All eye movements were triggered by the offset of a central fixation light emitting diode (LED) and the onset of a lateral LED at various depths in an otherwise fully darkened room. Our analyses revealed that three source pairs, two located in the frontal lobe-the frontal eye fields (FEF) and an anterior frontal area-, and one located within the occipital cortex, can account for 99.2% of the observed ERPs. Overall, the comparison between source activities revealed the largest activity in the occipital cortex, while no difference in activity between FEF and the anterior frontal area was obtained. For all sources, increased activity was observed for combined vergences, especially combined convergences, relative to saccades. Behavioral results revealed that onset latencies were longest for combined convergences, intermediate for combined divergences, and the shortest for saccades. Together, these findings fit within a perspective in which both occipital and frontal areas play an important role in retinal disparity detection. In the case of saccades and combined divergences stimulus-locked activity was larger than response-locked activity, while no difference between stimulus- and response-locked activity was observed for combined convergences. These findings seem to imply that the electrophysiological activity preceding exogenous eye movements consists of a sensory-related part that is under cortical control, while subcortical structures may be held responsible for final execution."
https://openalex.org/W2805397465,"Summary In this report we introduce a weak-model approach for examination of the intrinsic time-varying properties of the hemoglobin signal, with the aim of advancing the application of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for the detection of breast cancer, among other potential uses. The developed methodology integrates concepts from stochastic network theory with known modulatory features of the vascular bed, and in doing so provides access to a previously unrecognized dense feature space that is shown to have promising diagnostic potential. Notable features of the methodology include access to this information solely from measures acquired in the resting state, and analysis of these by treating the various components of the hemoglobin (Hb) signal as a co-varying interacting system. Approach The principal data-transform kernel projects Hb state-space trajectories onto a coordinate system that constitutes a finite-state representation of covariations among the principal elements of the Hb signal (i.e., its oxygenated (ΔoxyHb) and deoxygenated (ΔdeoxyHb) forms and the associated dependent quantities: total hemoglobin (ΔtotalHb = ΔoxyHb + ΔdeoxyHb), hemoglobin oxygen saturation (ΔHbO2Sat = 100Δ(oxyHb/totalHb)), and tissue-hemoglobin oxygen exchange (ΔHbO2Exc = ΔdeoxyHb-ΔoxyHb)). The resulting ten-state representation treats the evolution of this signal as a one-space, spatiotemporal network that undergoes transitions from one state to another. States of the network are defined by the algebraic signs of the amplitudes of the time-varying components of the Hb signal relative to their temporal mean values. This assignment produces several classes of coefficient arrays, most with a dimension of 10×10. Biological motivation Motivating our approach is the understanding that effector mechanisms that modulate blood delivery to tissue operate on macroscopic scales, in a spatially and temporally varying manner. Also recognized is that this behavior is sensitive to nonlinear actions of these effectors, which include the binding properties of hemoglobin. Accessible phenomenology includes measures of the kinetics and probabilities of network dynamics, which we treat as surrogates for the actions of feedback mechanisms that modulate tissue-vascular coupling. Findings Qualitative and quantitative features of this space, and their potential to serve as markers of disease, have been explored by examining continuous-wave fNIRS 3D tomographic time series obtained from the breasts of women who do and do not have breast cancer. Inspection of the coefficient arrays reveals that they are governed predominantly by first-order rate processes, and that each array class exhibits preferred structure that is mainly independent of the others. Discussed are strategies that may serve to extend evaluation of the accessible feature space and how the character of this information holds potential for development of novel clinical and preclinical uses."
