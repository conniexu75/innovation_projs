https://openalex.org/W2057025197,"Previous studies have shown that cytotoxic activated macrophages cause inhibition of DNA synthesis, of mitochondrial respiration, and of aconitase activity in tumor target cells. An L-arginine-dependent biochemical pathway synthesizing L-citrulline and nitrite, coupled to an effector mechanism, is now shown to cause this pattern of metabolic inhibition. Murine cytotoxic activated macrophages synthesize L-citrulline and nitrite in the presence of L-arginine but not D-arginine. L-Citrulline and nitrite biosynthesis by cytotoxic activated macrophages is inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, which also inhibits this cytotoxic effector mechanism. This activated macrophage cytotoxic effector system is associated with L-arginine deiminase activity, and the imino nitrogen removed from the guanido group of L-arginine by the deiminase reaction subsequently undergoes oxidation to nitrite. L-Homoarginine, an alternative substrate for this deiminase, is converted to L-homocitrulline with concurrent nitrite synthesis and similar biologic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2003227439,Lymphocytes bearing the CD8 marker were shown to suppress replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The effect was dose-dependent and most apparent with autologous lymphocytes; it did not appear to be mediated by a cytotoxic response. This suppression of HIV replication could be demonstrated by the addition of CD8+ cells at the initiation of virus production as well as after several weeks of virus replication by cultured cells. The observations suggest a potential approach to therapy in which autologous CD8 lymphocytes could be administered to individuals to inhibit HIV replication and perhaps progression of disease.
https://openalex.org/W2057951471,"The mammalian heart rate is regulated by the vagus nerve, which acts via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to cause hyperpolarization of atrial pacemaker cells. The hyperpolarization is produced by the opening of potassium channels and involves an intermediary guanosine triphosphate-binding regulatory (G) protein. Potassium channels in isolated, inside-out patches of membranes from atrial cells now are shown to be activated by a purified pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein of subunit composition alpha beta gamma, with an alpha subunit of 40,000 daltons. Thus, mammalian atrial muscarinic potassium channels are activated directly by a G protein, not indirectly through a cascade of intermediary events. The G protein regulating these channels is identified as a potent Gk; it is active at 0.2 to 1 pM. Thus, proteins other than enzymes can be under control of receptor coupling G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1989825490,"The steady-state levels of functional mRNAs are determined in part by their rates of decay in the cytoplasm. Hence, this process plays an important role in the control of gene expression. Individual mRNA species differ widely with respect to metabolic stability. In mammalian cells, the mRNAs for transiently expressed genes such as c-fos and c-myc have half-life (tIh) values as low as 15 min, while others such as 8-globin mRNA appear to be fully stable. Bacterial mRNAs decay far more rapidly, with usual Lh values of 2-3 min, although some species are considerably more stable. The rates of decay of some species can be altered in response to physiological signals, such as hormone induction in animals (Guyette et al., Cell 77,1013-1023,1979; Brock and Shapiro, Cell 34,207-214, 1983) and changes in growth rate in bacteria (Nilsson et al., Nature 372, 75-77, 1984). Recent studies have provided some insight into the nature of the mRNA decay process, and have led to the identification of structural features of mRNA that determine its susceptibility to decay, both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The basis for differential degradation of mRNA is a challenging biochemical problem. If mRNA decay were due to a random endonucleolytic process, some diversity could be provided by the target size and by the degree of accessibility of the internucleotide linkages. However, at least in prokaryotes there is no obvious relationship between mRNA size and decay rate. Belasco et al. (Cell 46, 245-251,1988) have addressed this question by comparing the stability of transcripts derived from the E. coli b/a gene (a gene carried on the plasmid pBR322 that encodes p-lactamase), and from a truncated form of the gene containing an internal in-frame deletion. The transcripts differed in size by 500/o, yet had similar decay rates. The possibility that mRNA can be protected by ribosomes has also been considered. Although this idea was supported by early studies of the frp operon (Morse and Yanofsky, Nature 224,329-331,1969), more recent experiments with other systems indicate that protection by ribosomes may not be a significant factor in mRNA decay. Stanssens et al. (Cell 44,711-718,1986) compared the stability of /acZ transcripts that differed in their ability to initiate translation-and hence in the number of r ibosomes covering their coding region-and found no differences in their decay rates. In addition, von Gabain et al. (PNAS 80, 653-657, 1983) have shown that the most stable portion of the E. coli ompA transcript (coding for the bacterial outer membrane protein) lies mainly in the 5’ noncoding region, which is not covered by ribosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2080100789,"The REP sequence is a highly conserved inverted repeat that is present in about 25% of all E. coli transcription units. We show that the REP sequence can stabilize upstream RNA, independently of any other sequences, by protection from 3'-5' exonuclease attack. The REP sequence is frequently responsible for the differential stability of different segments of mRNA within an operon. We demonstrate that REP-stabilized mRNA can be translated in vivo and that cloning the REP sequence downstream of a gene can increase protein synthesis. This provides direct evidence that alterations in mRNA stability can play a role in determining bacterial gene expression. The implications of these findings for the mechanisms of mRNA degradation and for the role of RNA stability in the regulation of gene expression are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2027559384,"Immunization with either an Escherichia coli recombinant segment of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-III/LAV) envelope protein (gp 120) or with deglycosylated gp 120 envelope protein produced antibodies that neutralize HTLV-III/LAV infection in vitro. Virus neutralization titers of these antisera were equivalent to those obtained with purified native gp120 as immunogen. This localizes at least one class of neutralizing epitopes to the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule. In addition, native gp120 prevented HTLV-III/LAV--mediated cell fusion, whereas the recombinant gp120 fragment did not. This shows that although glycosylation is not required for induction of neutralizing antibodies, it may be important for interaction with CD4, the virus receptor. A segment of the HTLV-III/LAV envelope produced in E. coli may be an important ingredient of a vaccine for acquired immune deficiency syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2004811543,"The 5' flanking region of the mouse alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene contains a tissue-specific promoter and three upstream regulatory elements that behave as classical enhancers. At least one of these enhancers is now shown to be required for the tissue-specific expression of the AFP gene when it is introduced into the mouse genome by microinjection of cloned DNA fragments into fertilized eggs. Each enhancer can direct expression in the appropriate tissues, the visceral endoderm of the yolk sac, the fetal liver, and the gastrointestinal tract, but each exerts different influence in these three tissues. These differences may explain the tissue-specific diversity in the levels of expression characteristic of the AFP gene. The postnatal repression of transcription of the AFP gene in both liver and gut, as well as the reinitiation of its transcription during liver regeneration, is mimicked by the introduced gene when it is linked to the enhancer domains together or singly. Thus, the DNA sequence elements responsible for directing the activation of AFP transcription, its repression, and reinduction are contained in a limited segment of DNA within or 5' to the gene (or both) and are operative in the absence of the closely linked albumin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1569239908,"In some patients with neuropathy and plasma cell dyscrasia, the serum IgM M-proteins are known to bind to the myelin associated glycoprotein and to peripheral nerve glycolipids. We have isolated two acidic glycolipids which bind to the M-protein from human cauda equina by DEAE-Sephadex, Iatrobeads, and high performance liquid column chromatographies. The major acidic glycolipid migrated between GM1 and GD1a and the minor acidic glycolipid migrated between GD1a and GD1b. Their structures were elucidated by sugar analysis, enzymatic digestion, mild acid hydrolysis, permethylation, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and NMR studies. Their core structure was confirmed to be paragloboside by high performance thin-layer chromatography-immunostaining using anti-paragloboside monoclonal antibody. Both acidic glycolipids lacked sialic acid but contained sulfated glucuronic acid as their acidic moiety. The sulfate group in the glucuronic acid was established by periodate oxidation and permethylation studies to be attached to the 3 position. The structures of the two acidic glycolipids are therefore consistent with the following: IV3GlcUA(3-sulfate)nLcOse4Cer and VI3GlcUA(3-sulfate)nLcOse6Cer. Additionally, the free carboxyl group on the glucuronic acid residue was shown to be necessary to bind the IgM M-proteins from neuropathy patients."

Both mRNAs contain the same open reading frame, including a homeo box. In situ hybridization and antibody staining show that the maternal RNA and protein are localized in an anteroposterior gradient during the syncytial blastoderm stage. The protein is found mainly in the nuclei and is also present in the pole cells. Zygotic RNA and protein are localized in the primordia of the terminal abdominal segment, the hindgut, and in the posterior midgut rudiment. In third instar larvae, cad is expressed in the gut, the gonads, and parts of the genital discs. It is the first homeo box-containing gene expressed in the germ line of Drosophila."

https://openalex.org/W1993131621,"Satellite 2 of the newt, Notophthalmus viridescens, is a 330 bp tandemly repeated sequence scattered throughout the genome. Cytoplasmic transcripts homologous to satellite 2 are found in a variety of tissues. Most of the transcripts correspond precisely in length to the DNA repeat unit or to whole multiples of that repeat. We show here that dimer-sized satellite 2 transcripts, synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase from a plasmid clone, undergo site-specific, self-catalyzed cleavage in vitro. The reaction proceeds at neutral pH and requires Mg++ but no other cofactor or energy source. The cleavage products have 5'-hydroxyl and 3'-phosphate groups, at least some of which are in the form of 2',3'-cyclic phosphates. In this respect the reaction resembles the self-cleavage of certain small, infectious RNAs found in plants. Furthermore, the in vitro cleavage of satellite 2 transcripts occurs within a sequence that is homologous to the conserved cleavage site of the infectious RNAs. The existence of monomer and multimer transcripts in the cell suggests that the monomer may arise by site-specific cleavage of long primary transcripts. However, the 5' end of the cellular monomer is 46 or 47 bases upstream of the in vitro cleavage site, suggesting that factors in the cell may modify the cleavage reaction."
https://openalex.org/W79597194,"The activity of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) in the presence of phosphatidylserine and its physiological regulator, diacylglycerol, could be suppressed by a mixture of brain gangliosides. Half-maximal inhibition was observed at 30 microM and was nearly complete at 100 microM. Inhibition was observed at all concentrations of Ca2+ between 10(-8) and 10(-4) M. Inhibition of protein kinase C activity could not be reversed by increasing the concentration of diacylglycerol or the substrate, histone. Inhibition was also observed when myelin basic protein or a synthetic myelin basic protein peptide was used as substrate. Among the individual gangliosides, the rank order of potency was GT1b greater than GD1a = GD1b greater than GM3 = GM1. Our results suggest that gangliosides may regulate the responsiveness of protein kinase C to diacylglycerol."

Metabolism of ddCyd by human T-lymphoblastic cells (Molt 4) negative for human immunodeficiency virus and OKT4 was examined. Molt 4 cells accumulated ddCyd and its phosphorylated derivatives into acid-soluble and acid-insoluble material in a dose-dependent manner. For each concentration tested, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine triphosphate represented 40% of the total acid-soluble pool of ddCyd metabolites. Uptake of 5 microM ddCyd was linear for 4 h after addition of drug. Efflux of ddCyd metabolites from cells followed a biphasic course with an initial retention half-life of 2.6 h for 2',3'-dideoxycytidine triphosphate. DNA, but not RNA, of cells incubated with [3H]ddCyd became radiolabeled. Nuclease and phosphatase treatment of DNA followed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography showed that the nucleoside was incorporated into DNA in its original form. ddCyd was not susceptible to deamination by human Cyd-dCyd deaminase. It was a poor substrate for human cytoplasmic and mitochondrial dCyd kinases, with Km values of 180 +/- 30 and 120 +/- 20 microM, respectively. DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and gamma varied in their sensitivity to inhibition by ddCTP with Ki values of 110 +/- 40, 2.6 +/- 0.3, and 0.016 +/- 0.008 microM, respectively; however, inhibition was competitive with dCTP in each case."

By means of expression cloning in Escherichia coli, fusion proteins were derived from specific fragments of a complementary DNA encoding the mouse alpha-chain, allowing the mapping of the toxin-binding site to residues 160-216 and the main immunogenic region to residues 6-85. This approach permits the independent study of different functional domains of a complex receptor molecule and should be generally applicable to other proteins for which complementary DNA clones are available."
https://openalex.org/W1558298279,"The potentiation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-stimulated cAMP production by vasopressin (VP) in the pituitary cell was investigated by studies on the interaction of CRF, VP, and the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on cAMP, adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase. Addition of VP or PMA (0.01-100 nM) alone did not alter cellular cAMP content, but markedly increased the effect of 10 nM CRF with ED50 of about 1 nM. Treatment of the cells with 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 4 h increased CRF-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 3.2-fold, an effect that was not additive to those of VP and PMA. Incubation of pituitary cells with 2 mM 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine increased CRF-stimulated cAMP accumulation and decreased the relative effect of VP and PMA, suggesting that the actions of VP and PMA are partially due to inhibition of phosphodiesterase. This was confirmed by the demonstration of a 30% inhibition of the low-affinity phosphodiesterase activity in cytosol and membranes prepared from cells preincubated with VP or PMA. In intact cells, following [3H]adenine prelabeling of endogenous ATP pools, measurement of adenylate cyclase in the presence of 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine showed no effect of VP and PMA alone, but did show a 2-fold potentiation of the effect of CRF. Measurement of adenylate cyclase in pituitary homogenates by conversion of [alpha-32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP showed a paradoxical GTP-dependent inhibition by VP of basal and CRF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, suggesting that the VP receptor is coupled to an inhibitory guanyl nucleotide-binding protein. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of the cells prevented the VP inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity observed in pituitary cell homogenates. These findings indicate that besides inhibition of phosphodiesterase, VP has a dual interaction with the pituitary adenylate cyclase system; a direct inhibitory effect, manifested only in broken cells, that is mediated by a receptor-coupled guanyl nucleotide-binding protein, and a physiologically predominant indirect stimulatory effect in the intact cell, mediated by protein kinase C phosphorylation of one of the components of the CRF-activated adenylate cyclase system."
https://openalex.org/W1499636416,"A major Arg-Gly-Asp-directed receptor on M21 human melanoma cells is a heterodimer of alpha and beta chains which under reducing conditions have molecular masses of 130 and 105 kDa, respectively. This receptor is one member of a large family of cell adhesion receptors that shares antigenic determinants with the vitronectin receptor of fibroblasts and the platelet IIb X IIIa complex. Both subunits of the M21 cell adhesion receptor acquire high mannose-type oligosaccharides that are processed before transport to the cell surface. In addition, the alpha chain undergoes a proteolytic cleavage step. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that, following its synthesis, the beta chain remains unbound to alpha chain for 1-2 h and in this free form is unable to bind an Arg-Gly-Asp containing heptapeptide. Conversely, the biosynthetic precursor of the alpha chain is fully capable of binding the Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptide immediately after its synthesis. Thus, Arg-Gly-Asp recognition by one member of this cell adhesion receptor family requires its 130-kDa alpha chain which appears to be functional prior to post-translational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W1607397542,"The pnp gene is located at 69 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome adjacent to the rpsO gene which encodes the ribosomal protein S15. In this paper, we present the sequence of a 3030-nucleotide DNA fragment containing the open reading frames coding for ribosomal protein S15 and polynucleotide phosphorylase. Translation of pnp is initiated by 5'-UUG-3' codon separated by 7 nucleotides from a good ribosome binding site. Codon usage in this gene is typical of highly expressed proteins of E. coli. Some of the transcripts of the pnp gene terminate just after the stem of the terminator t2 visible in the nucleotide sequence. However, a very strong read-through occurs at this site, thus permitting many of the pnp transcripts to extend beyond this transcription terminator. We also describe the primary structure homologies between a 69-amino-acid stretch of polynucleotide phosphorylase and the four homologous stretches of ribosomal protein S1 which form its RNA binding site. The possibility that this 69-amino-acid stretch constitutes the polynucleotide binding domain of polynucleotide phosphorylase is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1521156175,"We have prepared three types of RNA polymerase II transcription complexes: a preinitiation complex (complex 0), a complex which has synthesized two phosphodiester bonds (complex 2), and a complex which has synthesized 10-13 bonds (complex 10). We have studied the differential response of these complexes to a variety of disruptions: detergent (Sarkosyl), high levels of KCl, extended incubation at 25 degrees C, proteolysis, and digestion with DNase I. Complex 0 is extremely stable at 25 degrees C in the absence of ATP, but it is sensitive to the other treatments including 25 degrees C incubation in the presence of ATP. Once the complex has made two phosphodiester bonds, the properties almost reverse from those of complex 0; complex 2 remains unstable at 25 degrees C in the presence of ATP but is resistant to high levels of Sarkosyl and KCl, to extensive DNase I digestion, and to brief proteolysis. Addition of 10 or more bases to the growing RNA chain results in a complex completely resistant to all of the treatments used. When DNase I-trimmed complex 0 is allowed to initiate RNA synthesis, chains of about 33 bases are obtained. In contrast, DNase-trimmed complex 2 gives only about 23 base transcripts; DNase-treated complex 10 will elongate its nascent chains by about 21 bases as well (to give, on average, 34 base transcripts)."
https://openalex.org/W1511090919,"The type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor, like the insulin receptor, contains a ligand-stimulated protein-tyrosine kinase activity in its beta-subunit. However, in vivo, no substrates have been identified. We used anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to identify phosphotyrosine-containing proteins which occur during IGF-I stimulation of normal rat kidney and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells labeled with ortho[32P]phosphate. Both cells provide a good system to study the function of the type I IGF receptors because they contain high concentrations of these receptors but no insulin receptors. In addition, physiological levels of IGF-I, but not insulin, stimulated DNA synthesis in growth-arrested cells. IGF-I stimulated within 1 min of tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins. One of them, with a molecular mass between 97 and 102 kDa, was supposed to be the beta-subunit of the type I IGF receptor previously identified. The other protein had an approximate molecular mass of 185 kDa, which resembled, by several criteria, pp 185, originally identified during the initial response of Fao cells to insulin binding (White, M. F., Maron, R., and Kahn, C. R. (1985) Nature 318, 183-186). These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp 185 may occur during activation of both the type I IGF receptor and the insulin receptor, and it could be a common substrate that transmits important metabolic signals during ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1973291188,"When isolated adult oligodendrocytes adhere to a substratum myelinogenesis occurs. Investigation of the mechanism by which this happens indicated that the oligodendrocyte-substratum interaction activated protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of myelin basic protein and promoted the synthesis of myelin basic protein. In addition, when agents that activate protein kinase C (second messenger diacylglycerol or a tumor-promoting phorbol ester) were added to nonattached oligodendrocytes, they mimicked the influence of the substratum by inducing phosphorylation of myelin basic protein; and reagents that increase cellular adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) inhibited phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. Thus, at least in vitro, the interaction between oligodendrocytes and the substratum may mediate myelinogenic events, and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein may be an early requirement in the sequence of steps that ultimately results in myelin formation."
https://openalex.org/W1585941552,"Fast Ca2+ uptake into K+-depolarized cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells has been isotopically measured in a time scale of 1-10 s. Depolarized cells retained as much as 80-fold 45Ca2+ taken up by resting cells; Ca2+ was not taken up by fibroblasts or endothelial-like cells. Because Ca2+ entry was inhibited by inorganic (La3+, Co2+, Mg2+) and organic (nifedipine) Ca2+ channel antagonists and enhanced by the Ca2+ channel activator Bay-K-8644, it seems clear that Ca2+ gains access to the chromaffin cell cytosol mainly through specific voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ uptake evoked by 59 mM K+ was linear during the first 5 s of stimulation and continued to rise at a much slower rate up to 60 s. The rate of Ca2+ entry became steeper as the external [Ca2+] increased; initial rates of Ca2+ uptake varied from 0.06 fmol/cells . s at 0.125 mM Ca2+ to 2.85 fmol/cell . s at 7.5 mM Ca2+. The early 90Sr2+ uptake was linear but faster than Ca2+ uptake and later on was also saturated; 133Ba2+ was taken up still at a much faster rate and was linear for the entire depolarization period (2-60 s). Increased [K+] gradually depolarized chromaffin cells; Ca2+ and Sr2+ uptakes were not apparent below 30 mM K+ but were linear for 30 to 60 mM K+. In contrast, substantial Ba2+ uptake was seen even in K+-free solutions; and in 5.9 mM K+, Ba2+ uptake was as high as Ca2+ uptake obtained in 60 mM K+. Five to ten-second pulses of 45Ca2+, 90Sr2+, or 133Ba2+ given at different times after pre-depolarization of chromaffin cells served to analyze the kinetics of inactivation of the rates of entry of each divalent cation. Inactivation of Ca2+ uptake was faster than Sr2+, and Ba2+ uptake inactivated very little. Neither voltage changes nor Ca2+ ions passing through the channels seems to cause their inactivation; however, experiments aimed to manipulate the levels of internal Ca2+ using the cell-permeable chelator Quin-2 or the ionophore A23187 strongly suggest that intracellular Ca2+ levels determine the rates of inactivation of these channels."
https://openalex.org/W2096122257,"Through gene transfection studies, we have discovered that the forced expression of a foreign type II epidermal keratin in fibroblasts can trigger the expression of an endogenous type I epidermal keratin. Both the transfected and the induced proteins participate in the formation of filamentous structures. Interestingly, this regulation appears to be unidirectional: the expression of a transfected type I keratin does not induce type II expression. Rather, nonfilamentous aggregates of type I protein accumulate in the cytoplasm. In contrast, simple epithelial cells transfected with either a type I or a type II epidermal keratin gene do not respond by inducing the expression of a host epidermal keratin. In this case, the foreign protein is incorporated into the endogenous keratin network. These results suggest the possibility that type I keratin expression may be dependent on the accumulation of unpolymerized type II keratin."
https://openalex.org/W1589922055,"Using a collagen film assay utilizing 14C-labeled type I collagen, we demonstrated that cultured human keratinocytes produced a procollagenase after treatment with the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Production of collagenase paralleled alterations in cellular morphology induced by TPA. When procollagenase was immunoprecipitated with antibody to human fibroblast collagenase and analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, the zymogen was revealed as a 56- and 51-kDa doublet. The keratinocyte-derived collagenase was a neutral metalloprotease, required activation with trypsin for detection in the collagenase assay and produced the characteristic three-quarter and one-quarter length collagen cleavage products when incubated with type I collagen at 25 degrees C. The enzyme was inhibited by serum and cysteine and was largely unaffected by serine, thiol, and carboxyl protease inhibitors. Cycloheximide inhibited the TPA-induced production of collagenase, suggesting that the procollagenase was not stored preformed in the keratinocytes. Keratinocytes treated with a tumor-promoting analogue of TPA also produced collagenase, but cells treated with cytochalasin B, interleukin-1, or two non-tumor promoting phorbol esters did not. Keratinocyte-derived collagenase may play a role in wound healing and morphogenesis."

When substrates that allow only one bond to form are used, no stable ternary complex is obtained and no RNA is made that can be incorporated into longer RNA chains. A stable complex is obtained, however, if the RNA polymerase can make two bonds. The production of a stable ternary complex requires ATP or dATP and is inhibited by alpha-amanitin. In the course of exploring the energy requirement for initiation we found that dATP may be incorporated, in the absence of ATP, as the initial base of the RNA. However, deoxyribonucleotides are not appreciably incorporated into the body of the transcript after the first two bases have been added to the growing chain."

The availability of homogeneous preparations of beta 36 and beta 35 will facilitate studies designed to address the significance of the doublet structure. This manuscript presents the preparative purification of the beta 35 protein from a highly enriched source, human placenta. Unlike the beta gamma complex associated with G-proteins from placenta, the beta 35 preparations consist predominantly of the 35,000-dalton protein. The gamma-peptide associated with beta 35 is indistinguishable electrophoretically and immunologically from that associated with the placental G-protein oligomers. The beta 35 preparation and beta-subunit doublet exhibit similar specific activities in inhibiting human platelet adenylate cyclase activity. The preparations have proven useful for the generation of a panel of rabbit polyclonal antisera that recognize beta 35, Gt beta 36, and both beta 36 and beta 35 in the doublet associated with Gs, Gi, Go, and Gp. One antiserum generated to beta 35 recognizes the gamma-peptide associated with these preparations and human placental G-protein oligomers. The antiserum does not recognize Gt gamma. Protease digestion of Gt beta 36 and human placental beta 35 with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease identified a unique peptide generated from beta 35 which is absent in beta 36 digests."

This mAb specifically detected glycolipids with the Y determinant Fuc alpha 1----2Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc(3----1 alpha Fuc)-beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----1 Cer and the Y-related B-active difucosylated determinant Gal alpha 1----3Gal(2----1 alpha Fuc) beta 1----4GlcNAc(3----1 alpha Fuc) beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----1 Cer, but was not reactive with related monofucosylated glycolipids of type 2 chain (X-antigen, blood group H), type 1 chain (Lea antigen, blood group H and B) or with difucosylated type 2 and type 1 chain structures (A blood group antigen or blood group B and Leb, respectively). A series of glycolipids with Y and blood group B type 2 determinants were detected in human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line KATO III with mAb BR55-2 and with a previously characterized anti-blood group B mAb PA83-52 (Hansson, G. C., Karlsson, K.-A., Larson, G., McKibbin, J. M., Blaszczyk, M., Herlyn, M., Steplewski, Z., and Koprowski, H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4091-4097). The isolated antigens were structurally characterized by mass spectrometry of permethylated and permethylated-reduced derivatives and by proton NMR spectroscopy. In a chromatogram binding assay, mAb BR55-2 and mAb PA83-52 detected minor components with slower mobility than the Y-6 and blood group B-7-type 2 structures. The detection of a B type 2 determinant is the first chemical evidence for the presence of an autologous difucosyl blood group B type 2 antigen in human adenocarcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975902254,"Stigmatella aurantiaca is a gliding, gram-negative bacterium that shows a spectacular fruiting body formation upon starvation of nutrient. This bacterium was found to contain approximately 500 copies per cell of a short single-stranded linear DNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA: msDNA). The primary structure of msDNA was determined and found to consist of 162 or 163 deoxyrlbonucleotides. Its unique chromosomal gene was cloned and sequenced. The msDNA was found to be attached to a branched RNA by its 5′ end. Structural analysis of the branched RNA revealed that it consists of a triribonucleotide, 5′A-G-(C or U)3′, and that msDNA is branched out from the 2′ position of the rG residue forming a 2′, 5′ phosphodiester linkage with the dC residue at the 5′ end of msDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1994302865,The hypothesis that transported vesicles are preferentially associated with a subclass of microtubules has been tested in lobster axons. A cold block was used to collect moving vesicles in these axons; this treatment caused the vesicles to accumulate in files along some of the microtubules. Quantitative analysis of the number of vesicles associated with microtubule segments indicated that lobster axons have two distinct populations of microtubules--transport microtubules that are the preferred substrates for vesicle transport and architectural microtubules that contribute to axonal structure.

https://openalex.org/W1534869523,"In normal human plasma two forms of kininogen exist, low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK). When these proteins are cleaved they are found to have a common heavy chain and bradykinin, but each has a unique light chain. Monoclonal antibodies to the heavy and light chains of HMWK have been developed, and the effects of each on the function of this protein are defined. Initial studies showed that an antibody, C11C1, completely neutralized the coagulant activity of plasma HMWK whereas another antibody, 2B5, did not. On a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA) the C11C1 antibody was consumed by kininogen antigen in normal plasma but not by kininogen antigen in HMWK-deficient plasma. On immunoblot, the C11C1 antibody recognized one kininogen protein in normal plasma and did not recognize any kininogen antigen in HMWK-deficient plasma. These combined studies indicated that the C11C1 antibody was directed to an epitope on the unique 46-kDa light chain of HMWK. In contrast, the 2B5 antibody on a CELISA was consumed by kininogen antigen in both normal plasma and HMWK-deficient plasma but not by total kininogen-deficient plasma. On immunoblot, the 2B5 antibody recognized both kininogens in normal plasma but only LMWK in HMWK-deficient plasma. These combined studies indicated that the 2B5 antibody was directed to the common 64-kDa heavy chain of the plasma kininogens. Utilizing direct binding studies or competition kinetic experiments, the 2B5 and C11C1 antibodies bound with high affinity (1.71 and 0.77 nM, respectively) to their antigenic determinants on the HMWK molecule. The 2B5 antibody did neutralize the ability of HMWK to inhibit platelet calpain. These studies with monoclonal antibodies directed to each of the HMWK chains indicate that HMWK is a bifunctional molecule that can serve as a cofactor for serine zymogen activation and an inhibitor of cysteine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1514747567,"The dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel from cardiac tissue was purified 900-fold using DEAE-Sephadex A-25, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose. The purified preparation was highly enriched in a peptide of 140,000 daltons when electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, or 170,000 when electrophoresed in the presence of iodoacetamide. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified subunits of the rabbit skeletal muscle Ca2+ channel recognized the 170-kDa protein in preparations electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions, and the large peptide of 140 kDa and smaller peptides of 29-32 kDa in preparations analyzed under reducing conditions. Monoclonal antibodies, which were raised against the native Ca2+ channel from skeletal muscle, immunoprecipitated [3H]PN 200-110 binding activity from solubilized cardiac membranes and immunoprecipitated 125I-labeled peptides (from the purified cardiac Ca2+ channel preparation) which migrated as a single species of 170 kDa under nonreducing conditions, or as 140, 32, and 29 kDa under reducing conditions. The results show that the purified cardiac Ca2+ channel, like that previously purified from skeletal muscle, consists of a major component of 170 kDa which is comprised of a 140-kDa peptide linked by disulfide bonds to smaller peptides of 32-29 kDa. Peptide maps of the 140-kDa peptide purified from cardiac and skeletal muscle preparations were strikingly similar, suggesting a high degree of homology in their primary sequence."

The msDNA is linked at the 19th G residue of msdRNA by a 2', 5' phosphodiester linkage. The coding region for msdRNA (msr) is located downstream of the coding region for msDNA (msd). These coding regions exist in opposite orientation with respect to each other and overlap by 8 bases at their 3' ends.

https://openalex.org/W2024185246,"In order to study the rate and form of tubulin transport in cultured neuronal cells, the fluorescence recovery after the photobleaching of a fluorescent tubulin analog has been followed within the neuritic processes of differentiated PC12 cells. In these cells, as in peripheral axons, tubulin is transported in coherent, nondiffusing waves at two different slow rates that are within the range of the slow components a and b of axonal transport measured in vivo. Finally, it appears that most, if not all, of the tubulin analog is moving out these processes. Thus, slow neuroplasmic transport in cultured neuron-like cells is a good model of axonal transport, in which experimental manipulations of the system can be performed that would be difficult in the whole animal."
https://openalex.org/W1498014555,"Anti-peptide antibodies that bind to the amino terminus of human erythropoietin (residues 1-26) do not inhibit the hormone's biological activity, indicating that this region of the protein does not play a role in receptor recognition (Sytkowski, A. J., and Fisher, J. W. (1985) J. Biol Chem. 260, 14727-14731). We have now identified six other regions of the primary sequence that are relatively hydrophilic and, therefore, have a higher probability of being accessible to such antibody probes. Antibodies raised against synthetic peptides homologous to five of these regions, corresponding to residues 40-59, 80-99, 99-118, 111-129, and 131-150 recognize erythropoietin, confirming the prediction based upon relative hydrophilicity. Antibodies to a carboxyl terminal peptide 147-166 failed to bind the hormone, presumably due to steric hindrance imposed by a disulfide bond between Cys161 and one of the other cysteinyl residues. The antibodies were affinity purified on the relevant immobilized peptide and their capacity to inhibit (neutralize) erythropoietin's activity was assessed. Only anti-peptide 99-118 and anti-peptide 111-129 antibodies inhibited erythropoietin. This effect was reversed by excess peptide, demonstrating that the neutralizing action of the antibody was due to its antigen-specific binding. The results strongly suggest that the portion of erythropoietin's amino acid sequence represented by these peptides plays a functional role in the hormone's action, most probably by forming part of the receptor-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1509209316,"Since we had shown recently that fatty acyl-CoA derivatives stimulate (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity at suboptimal ATP concentrations, we used sealed vesicles of beef heart sarcolemma to examine the effects of these compounds on the transport function of the enzyme. The sodium pump was detected in inside-out vesicles as a component of Na+ uptake that was dependent on intravesicular (extracellular) K+ and extravesicular (intracellular) ATP and was sensitive to vanadate and digitoxigenin. The pump flux was stimulated without a lag by palmitoyl-CoA (K0.5 = 3 microM) when ATP concentration was 50 microM, but not when it was 2 mM. Saturating palmitoyl-CoA reduced the K0.5 of ATP for the pump by a factor of 3-6. Raising the intracellular K+ concentration increased the K0.5 of ATP, and this effect of K+ was antagonized by palmitoyl-CoA. At concentrations up to 0.5 mM, palmitoyl-CoA had no effect on ATP-independent (passive) Na+ uptake. All tested long-chain acyl-CoA derivatives had effects similar to that of palmitoyl-CoA; but CoA, acetyl-CoA, and palmitic acid were ineffective. Palmitoyl carnitine and docosahexanoic acid, amphiphilic compounds with inhibitory and biphasic effects on the hydrolytic activity of purified (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, had purely inhibitory effects on the pump at high concentrations that also affected the passive fluxes. The data support the proposition that fatty acyl-CoA derivatives mimic the effect of ATP at a regulatory site and suggest that these intracellular liponucleotides may be involved in the control of the pump."
https://openalex.org/W2084934675,"Mutation at the regA locus confers on somatic cells of Volvox (which otherwise undergo programmed death) ability to redifferentiate as reproductive cells. Stable mutations at the regA locus, but not at other loci, were induced at high frequency when embryos at one particular stage were exposed to either UV irradiation, novobiocin, nalidixic acid, bleomycin, 4-hydroxyami-noquinoline-1-oxide, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, or 5-fluorouracil. All treatments led to some mutations that were not expressed until the second generation after treatment. The sensitive period was after somatic and reproductive cells of the next generation had been set apart, but before they had undergone cytodifferentiation. Hypermutability occurs in presumptive reproductive cells (in which regA is normally not expressed) somewhat before regA normally acts in somatic cells. We postulate that hypermutability of regA in the reproductive cells at this time reflects a change of state that the locus undergoes as it is inactivated."
https://openalex.org/W1518073340,"A high molecular weight actin-binding protein with subunit mass of 240 kilodaltons has been purified from vegetative amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum. Briefly, a cell extract was prepared by homogenizing vegetative amoebae in 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM 1,4-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.0, followed by ultracentrifugation at 114,000 X g for 1 h. The 240-kDa protein in this extract was separated from actin by chromatography on ATP-saturated DEAE-cellulose and further purified by chromatography on hydroxylapatite and Sephacryl S-300. The 240-kDa protein increases the low shear viscosity of F-actin. Covalent cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate demonstrates that the 240-kDa protein can form dimers in high salt (500 mM NaCl). Hydrodynamic studies in high salt demonstrate the presence of an asymmetric dimer (Stokes' radius = 8.6 nm, sedimentation coefficient = 12 S, native molecular weight = 434,000, and frictional ratio = 1.7). Rotary shadowing demonstrates that the monomer is a flexible rod of approximately 70 nm in length that can associate end to end to form a dimer of approximately 140 nm in length. The 240-kDa protein cross-reacts with antibodies to chicken gizzard filamin. The properties of the 240-kDa protein suggest that it is a member of the filamin class of actin-associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1992947311,"RNA containing the aI3 group I intron of the yeast mitochondrial gene encoding cytochrome oxidase subunit I shows self-splicing in vitro. The excised intron, comprising 1514 nucleotides, is partially split into an upstream portion, containing the intronic reading frame, and a downstream portion, containing the typical group I conserved sequence elements. Full-length intron RNA and intron parts occur in linear and circular form. In the transesterification reactions leading to circle formation, only the guanosine nucleotide added during splicing is removed. Reincubation of isolated, complete circular intron RNA under self-splicing conditions leads to formation of free subintronic RNA circles. Under similar conditions, purified linear intron RNA gives rise to a number of circular and linear products, one of which consists of interlocked subintronic RNA circles. These observations suggest that the intron RNA possesses a dynamic structure in which subtle alterations in folding result in the formation of RNA products with different topology."
https://openalex.org/W1602042735,"We have applied the technique of Northern blotting hybridization analysis to examine the transcription of the Escherichia coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (ileS) and prolipoprotein signal peptidase (lsp) genes. RNA samples from the wild-type strain CS412 and CS412 containing the plasmids pMT521 and pSYC890 were examined with ileS- and lsp-specific 32P-labeled probes. pMT521 is a pBR322 derivative into which a chromosomal DNA fragment containing the ileS and lsp genes has been cloned downstream of the pBR322 tet promoter. pSYC890 is a derivative of pMT521 which lacks the tet promoter, but nevertheless is active in lsp mRNA transcription due to the presence of a weak lsp internal promoter located in the distal portion of the upstream ileS DNA, RNA from CS412(pMT521) exhibited a high level of a 5500-nucleotide ileS-lsp cotranscript that hybridized to both probes. RNA from CS412(pSYC890) contained a high level of low molecular weight lsp-specific transcripts from the lsp internal promoter. However, only high molecular weight (5000-6500 nucleotides) cotranscripts were detected in RNA from CS412 by Northern blotting analysis. A trace level of lsp-specific mRNA was detected in CS412 by S1 nuclease mapping. The 5'-end of this transcript was mapped using RNA from CS412(pSYC890). The mRNA begins 192/193 base pairs upstream of the lsp translation initiation codon at a site within ileS DNA that codes for the aspartate residue located 61 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal of ILES. In conclusion, most of the transcription of lsp in wild-type E. coli originates from upstream of ileS and yields ileS-lsp cotranscripts."
https://openalex.org/W2083703564,"The anomalous rectifier potassium current in Aplysia neurons was examined to determine the immediate cause of an increase in conductance induced by serotonin and mediated by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Voltage-dependent cesium ion block and steady-state current power spectral density were measured under voltage clamp before and after application of serotonin. The amplitude of the anomalous rectifier conductance was increased by adding serotonin, but the shapes of the conductance-voltage curve and the power spectrum were not altered. Calculation of the number of functional channels and of the single-channel conductance from the power spectra indicates that the serotonin-induced increase in conductance resulted from an increase in the number of functional channels, while the single-channel conductance and the open-channel probability were unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W1607033309,"We previously demonstrated that an acidic variant (B1) of lysosomal arylsulfatase B from transplanted human lung cancer is phosphorylated on its protein and carbohydrate moieties (Gasa, S., and Makita, A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5034-5039). The present study identifies that a cAMP-dependent protein kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of arylsulfatase B. The protein kinase activity toward the sulfatase was considerably higher in the transplanted lung cancer than in normal lung in the presence of cAMP. B enzyme purified from normal human liver was found to contain 0.6 mol/mol B enzyme, and protein kinase treatment added further 1.3 mol of Pi to give a single phosphopeptide (X). On the other hand, B1 enzyme purified from the transplanted human lung cancer which had been labeled in vivo with 32Pi revealed at least two phosphopeptides (X and Y). Assuming that the sulfatase from normal liver and lung cancer possesses the same number of available phosphorylation sites, phosphorylation of site X which was available only by deliberate phosphorylation of the native, ordinary B enzyme appears to be cancer-associated. Increasing phosphorylation of the sulfatase resulted in a maximum 50% elevation in arylsulfatase activity, followed by a decrease of the activity upon overphosphorylation, using an artificial substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1575044986,The carbon and nitrogen metabolism of Klebsiella pneumoniae M5a1 has been characterized using 13C and 15N labeling with detection by cross-polarization magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR. Cells grown on ammonium typically require some 20 h to derepress fully for nitrogenase when transferred to medium devoid of any source of fixed nitrogen. We have established that during this period some cellular proteins are catabolized with the liberated nitrogen being used for the synthesis of purines needed for formation of ribosomal RNA. The 20-h derepression period can be shortened to 6 h by the introduction of fixed nitrogen in certain specific forms. Serine is the most successful agent we have examined for shortening the derepression period and glycine among the least successful. We attribute this difference to the advantage of serine over glycine in providing both specific and nonspecific carbon and nitrogen sources for complete purine synthesis. These determinations were made by tracing the metabolism of 13C- and 15N-labeled chemical bonds from the 2 amino acids during derepression.
https://openalex.org/W1598622521,"Agents known to elevate intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in cultured mesangial cells (e.g., isoproterenol with and without isobutylmethylxanthine (MIX] inhibit vasopressin-induced contraction. Since contraction of these cells in response to vasopressin is accompanied by release of inositol trisphosphate and increased intracellular ionized calcium, we wanted to determine whether cAMP is exerting its relaxing effect by altering phosphoinositide metabolism. Isoproterenol and MIX did not diminish the release of inositol trisphosphate in response to vasopressin. However, the stimulated 32P incorporation into phospholipids seen with vasopressin treatment was diminished by prior treatment with isoproterenol-MIX. Since incorporation of 32P into phospholipids is not only dependent on phospholipid synthesis but also on the amount of label in the gamma-phosphate of ATP, we determined the specific activity of 32P in ATP. We found that suppression of 32P incorporation into phospholipids in cells treated with isoproterenol-MIX was paralleled by a decline of specific activity of 32P in ATP. Furthermore, the changes in ATP specific activity were paralleled by similar changes in phosphate uptake into the cells. Thus, diminished phosphate uptake (transport) could account for the decline of 32P content in phospholipids and ATP following treatment of mesangial cells with isoproterenol-MIX."
