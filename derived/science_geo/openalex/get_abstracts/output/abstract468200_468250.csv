At the postsynaptic density (PSD), extracellular Aβo bound to lipid-anchored PrP(C) activates intracellular Fyn kinase to disrupt synapses. Here, we screened transmembrane PSD proteins heterologously for the ability to couple Aβo-PrP(C) with Fyn. Only coexpression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, allowed PrP(C)-bound Aβo to activate Fyn. PrP(C) and mGluR5 interact physically, and cytoplasmic Fyn forms a complex with mGluR5. Aβo-PrP(C) generates mGluR5-mediated increases of intracellular calcium in Xenopus oocytes and in neurons, and the latter is also driven by human AD brain extracts. In addition, signaling by Aβo-PrP(C)-mGluR5 complexes mediates eEF2 phosphorylation and dendritic spine loss. For mice expressing familial AD transgenes, mGluR5 antagonism reverses deficits in learning, memory, and synapse density. Thus, Aβo-PrP(C) complexes at the neuronal surface activate mGluR5 to disrupt neuronal function."

Microglia are the immune cells of the brain. They constantly survey the brain for abnormalities and are quickly activated upon encountering tissue damage or injury (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005Nimmerjahn A. Kirchhoff F. Helmchen F. Resting microglial cells are highly dynamic surveillants of brain parenchyma in vivo.Science. 2005; 308: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). Following activation, microglia become capable of numerous functions depending on the stimuli in the surrounding environment. One such function is phagocytosis, which facilitates brain homeostasis via the clearance of cellular debris and possibly the pruning of synapses (Lucin and Wyss-Coray, 2009Lucin K.M. Wyss-Coray T.

In addition to general maintenance roles, recent genome-wide association studies also suggest that microglial phagocytic receptors may have a critical role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Indeed, rare variants of the phagocytic receptor TREM2 triple the risk of developing AD and represent one of the strongest known risk factors (Guerreiro et al., 2013Guerreiro R. Wojtas A. Bras J.

In mice, genetic defects in different receptors or proteins involved in phagocytosis result in neurodegeneration (Kaifu et al., 2003Kaifu T. Nakahara J. Inui M. Mishima K. Momiyama T. Kaji M.

Yan F. Lin A.H. Lambris J.D. Alexander J.J. Quigg R.J. Masliah E. Prominent neurodegeneration and increased plaque formation in complement-inhibited Alzheimer’s mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 10837-10842Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Conversely, driving microglial activation toward a more phagocytic phenotype reduces Aβ pathology in mouse models of AD (Heneka et al., 2013Heneka M.T. Kummer M.P. Stutz A. Delekate A. Schwartz S. Vieira-Saecker A. Griep A. Axt D. Remus A. Tzeng T.C. et al.NLRP3 is activated in Alzheimer’s disease and contributes to pathology in APP/PS1 mice.Nature. 2013; 493: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). These studies highlight the importance of phagocytosis in brain homeostasis and suggest that identifying key regulators of phagocytosis may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological disease. While various studies have identified extrinsic factors that modulate phagocytosis in health and disease (Lucin and Wyss-Coray, 2009Lucin K.M. Wyss-Coray T. Immune activation in brain aging and neurodegeneration: too much or too little?.Neuron. 2009; 64: 110-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), key intracellular regulators are much less understood. Beclin 1 represents an intriguing target that may act to regulate phagocytic receptor function in health and disease. Indeed, beclin 1 is actively involved in protein degradation and host defense and, in mouse models of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, has a critical role in mitigating amyloidosis and neurodegeneration (Levine et al., 2011Levine B. Mizushima N. Virgin H.W. Autophagy in immunity and inflammation.Nature. 2011; 469: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar, Pickford et al., 2008Pickford F. Masliah E. Britschgi M.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13578-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). While beclin 1 is classically associated with autophagy, a major protein degradation pathway, studies now suggest that beclin 1 may also have alternative functions independent of autophagy. This is suggested by studies showing that genetic deletion of beclin 1 results in lethality at embryonic day 7.5–8.5 (Qu et al., 2003Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H. Troxel A. Rosen J. Eskelinen E.L. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. et al.Promotion of tumorigenesis by heterozygous disruption of the beclin 1 autophagy gene.J. Clin.

USA. 2003; 100: 15077-15082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), while genetic deletion of various downstream autophagy proteins results in postnatal lethality (Komatsu et al., 2005Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. et al.Impairment of starvation-induced and constitutive autophagy in Atg7-deficient mice.J.

The role of autophagy during the early neonatal starvation period.Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). What these additional functions of beclin 1 might be is not entirely clear. However, given that apoptotic cell clearance is impaired during mouse embryonic development when beclin 1 is knocked out (Qu et al., 2007Qu X. Zou Z. Sun Q. Luby-Phelps K. Cheng P. Hogan R.N. Gilpin C. Levine B. Autophagy gene-dependent clearance of apoptotic cells during embryonic development.Cell. 2007; 128: 931-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), one possibility is a role in clearance processes such as phagocytosis. To that end, recent studies reveal that beclin 1 rapidly associates with phagosomes (Berger et al., 2010Berger S.B. Romero X. Ma C. Wang G. Faubion W.A. Liao G. Compeer E. Keszei M. Rameh L.

Whether beclin 1 has an essential role in receptor-mediated phagocytosis is unknown. Furthermore, whether microglial beclin 1 is dysfunctional during neurological disease and how this dysfunction may impair phagocytosis of disease-relevant substrates also remains unexplored. Here, we identify a role for microglial beclin 1 in receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Beclin 1, together with its phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) binding partner, Vps34, accomplish this by regulating the retromer complex, which is involved in sorting cellular components to the lysosome or recycling the components back to defined compartments (e.g., the cell surface). Consequently, genetic reduction of beclin 1 results in reduced retromer levels, phagocytic receptor recycling, and phagocytosis of latex beads and Aβ. Importantly, beclin 1 and retromer are reduced in microglia isolated from postmortem human AD brains. Together these findings suggest that similar mechanisms may be impaired in AD, possibly rendering microglia less efficient at phagocytosing Aβ or any other potentially toxic debris whose uptake depends on receptor-mediated phagocytosis. To determine whether beclin 1 has a role in phagocytosis, we reduced its expression in BV2 microglial cells with lentivirus encoding beclin 1 shRNA (beclin 1 knockdown; KD) and assayed for microglial uptake of latex beads. Using this lentiviral approach, which allowed us to reduce beclin 1 expression by ∼80% (Figure 1A), we find that reducing microglial beclin 1 levels significantly impaired the phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads as determined by flow cytometry (Figures 1B and 1C). This effect was not exclusive to BV2 cells as N9 cells, another mouse microglial cell line, and C6 astrocyte cells showed a similar phagocytic defect when beclin 1 was reduced (Figures S1A and S1B). Importantly, phagocytosis was “rescued” in BV2 cells by recovering beclin 1 levels with a lentivirus encoding mouse beclin 1 (Figures 1D and 1E), demonstrating the specificity of the beclin 1 shRNA knockdown approach. Interestingly, reduced expression of Atg5, a protein critical for autophagy downstream of beclin 1, did not alter phagocytosis (Figures S1C and S1D), suggesting that beclin 1 may regulate phagocytosis through alternative pathways. Along with changes in overall phagocytosis, flow cytometry scattergrams also suggested that phagocytic efficiency was impaired in beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells, as indicated by the loss of highly phagocytic cell populations (Figure 1B). Subsequent flow cytometry analysis revealed that while significantly more beclin 1-deficient cells phagocytosed a single bead, they were less competent at phagocytosing 3–10 beads (Figure 2A) when compared with control shRNA transduced BV2 cells. Impaired phagocytic efficiency by beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells could also be rescued by recovering beclin 1 levels (Figure 2B). To confirm these findings in primary cells, we next isolated microglia from beclin 1 heterozygous knockout mice (beclin 1+/−) (Figure 2C), which show a 40%–50% reduction in beclin 1 levels (Pickford et al., 2008Pickford F. Masliah E. Britschgi M. Lucin K. Narasimhan R. Jaeger P.A. Small S. Spencer B. Rockenstein E. Levine B. Wyss-Coray T. The autophagy-related protein beclin 1 shows reduced expression in early Alzheimer disease and regulates amyloid beta accumulation in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2190-2199PubMed Google Scholar, Qu et al., 2003Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H. Troxel A. Rosen J. Eskelinen E.L. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. et al.Promotion of tumorigenesis by heterozygous disruption of the beclin 1 autophagy gene.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). In agreement with our lentiviral approach, beclin 1+/− microglia also showed impairments in phagocytic efficiency when analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 2D). To determine if impaired phagocytic efficiency in beclin 1-deficient cells resulted from beads stalling at the cell surface or from a disruption in the kinetics of phagocytosis, we used microscopy and live-cell imaging. We observed that while beads were initially phagocytosed at a similar rate (Figure S2A), beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells were less able to phagocytose subsequent beads (Figure S2B and Figure 2E). Quantification of cell migration confirmed that beclin 1-deficient cells have a similar migratory capacity as control cells, indicating that impaired movement is not responsible for phagocytic deficits (Figure 2F). Instead, our data suggest that beclin 1 deficiency impairs the ability of cells to phagocytose subsequent beads beyond the initial phagocytic event (see Figure 2G for representative live-cell images), resulting in overall reduced phagocytic uptake (Figure S2C). Phagocytosis is initiated by numerous receptors that recognize molecular structures on extracellular substrates. Upon binding and internalization of substrates, phagocytic receptors are recycled back to the cell surface to be used again. Accordingly, disruptions in phagocytic receptor recycling have dramatic consequences on phagocytic efficiency (Chen et al., 2010Chen D. Xiao H. Zhang K. Wang B. Gao Z. Jian Y. Qi X. Sun J. Miao L. Yang C. Retromer is required for apoptotic cell clearance by phagocytic receptor recycling.Science. 2010; 327: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine if reduced phagocytic efficiency seen in beclin 1-deficient cells is due to changes in phagocytic receptor dynamics, we used an established receptor recycling assay (Mitchell et al., 2004Mitchell H. Choudhury A. Pagano R.E. Leof E.B. Ligand-dependent and -independent transforming growth factor-beta receptor recycling regulated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and Rab11.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4166-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). Indeed, beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells showed a prominent reduction in recycling of the phagocytic receptor CD36 (Figures 3C and 3D), a class B scavenger receptor involved in phagocytosing a wide range of substrates, including Aβ (El Khoury et al., 2003El Khoury J.B. Moore K.J. Means T.K. Leung J. Terada K. Toft M. Freeman M.W. Luster A.D. CD36 mediates the innate host response to beta-amyloid.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and latex beads (Figure 3A). Primary microglia obtained from beclin 1+/− mice also showed a similar deficit in CD36 recycling (Figures 3E and 3F). Importantly, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that beclin 1 shRNA did not affect baseline cell surface expression of CD36 in the absence of ligand (Figure 3G). Additionally, because the phagocytic receptor Trem2 has been reported to recycle (Prada et al., 2006Prada I. Ongania G.N. Buonsanti C. Panina-Bordignon P. Meldolesi J. Triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) trafficking in microglial cells: continuous shuttling to and from the plasma membrane regulated by cell stimulation.Neuroscience. 2006; 140: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and is a risk factor for AD (Guerreiro et al., 2013Guerreiro R. Wojtas A. Bras J. Carrasquillo M. Rogaeva E. Majounie E. Cruchaga C. Sassi C. Kauwe J.S. Younkin S. et al.Alzheimer Genetic Analysis GroupTREM2 variants in Alzheimer’s disease.N. Engl. J.

Med. 2013; 368: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), we investigated Trem2 recycling in beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells. Trem2 recycling was impaired in beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells as was observed with CD36 (Figure 3H). Taken together, these data suggest that beclin 1 has a function in phagocytic receptor recycling. While receptor recycling is regulated by numerous mechanisms, a recent study in C. elegans showed that clearance of apoptotic cell corpses by the phagocytic receptor CED-1 was dependent on receptor recycling via the retromer complex (Chen et al., 2010Chen D. Xiao H. Zhang K. Wang B. Gao Z. Jian Y. Qi X. Sun J. Miao L. Yang C. Retromer is required for apoptotic cell clearance by phagocytic receptor recycling.Science. 2010; 327: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This conserved structure is responsible for endosome-to-Golgi retrograde transport of membrane proteins and in mammals consists of the subunits Vps26, Vps29, Vps35, and sorting nexins (Bonifacino and Hurley, 2008Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Retromer.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To determine whether beclin 1 might regulate the retromer complex, we knocked down beclin 1 expression using a lentivirus encoding beclin 1 shRNA and subsequently investigated whether the retromer complex was affected by beclin 1 knockdown. Remarkably, beclin 1 knockdown resulted in a prominent reduction of the retromer complex (Figures 4A and 4B ). To test whether diminished retromer expression impairs CD36 recycling, we knocked down Vps35 levels in BV2 cells using lentivirus encoding Vps35 shRNA (Figure 4C) and analyzed CD36 recycling. Reducing Vps35 significantly impaired CD36 recycling (Figure 4D). Furthermore, reducing Vps35 also resulted in a concomitant reduction in phagocytic efficiency (Figure 4E). Because previous studies have demonstrated that retromer dysfunction can be reversed by enhancing Vps35 levels (MacLeod et al., 2013MacLeod D.A. Rhinn H. Kuwahara T. Zolin A. Di Paolo G. McCabe B.D. Marder K.S. Honig L.S. Clark L.N. Small S.A. Abeliovich A. RAB7L1 interacts with LRRK2 to modify intraneuronal protein sorting and Parkinson’s disease risk.Neuron. 2013; 77: 425-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we rescued Vps35 levels in beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells. Rescuing Vps35 resulted in enhanced CD36 recycling (Figure 4G) and phagocytosis (Figure 4H). Together these data suggest that beclin 1 regulates the retromer complex, which is required to maintain phagocytic receptor recycling and phagocytosis. To further explore this connection, we first tested whether beclin 1 might regulate retromer via a direct interaction. This proved unlikely, as we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate beclin 1 and Vps35 (data not shown). Moreover, a recent study using mass spectrometry screens to identify putative binding partners of mammalian beclin 1 and other known autophagy proteins that complex with beclin 1 did not reveal any binding partners exclusive to the retromer complex (Behrends et al., 2010Behrends C. Sowa M.E. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Network organization of the human autophagy system.Nature. 2010; 466: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested whether beclin 1 may have a role in the recruitment of retromer. Retromer is typically recruited to vesicles via its sorting nexin subunits. These subunits contain a Phox homology domain capable of binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) present on target membranes (Burda et al., 2002Burda P. Padilla S.M. Sarkar S. Emr S.D. Retromer function in endosome-to-Golgi retrograde transport is regulated by the yeast Vps34 PtdIns 3-kinase.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3889-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphatidylinositol is converted to PI3P primarily by the PI3K, Vps34, which is known to form a complex with beclin 1 and regulate autophagy and apoptosis (Funderburk et al., 2010Funderburk S.F. Wang Q.J. Yue Z. The Beclin 1-VPS34 complex—at the crossroads of autophagy and beyond.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). If the beclin 1/Vps34 complex were responsible for recruiting retromer in microglia, we speculated that reducing beclin 1 would diminish Vps34 levels. Consistent with our previous observations in neurons (Jaeger et al., 2010Jaeger P.A. Pickford F. Sun C.H. Lucin K.M. Masliah E. Wyss-Coray T. Regulation of amyloid precursor protein processing by the Beclin 1 complex.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11102Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), beclin 1 knockdown in BV2 cells also resulted in a prominent reduction in Vps34 (Figure 5A). To begin to establish whether PI3P has a role in recruiting retromer in BV2 cells, we next tested whether Vps35 colocalized with vesicles containing PI3P. To visualize PI3P we utilized a reporter construct expressing an RFP fusion protein containing a 2xFYVE PI3P binding domain. Using this approach, we observed colocalization of PI3P and Vps35 in BV2 cells (Figure 5B). To determine the kinetics by which PI3P and Vps35 localize to vesicles, we utilized live-cell imaging. To best monitor the recruitment of PI3P and Vps35 to clearly defined vesicles, we provided latex beads to BV2 cells expressing either the PI3P reporter construct or a Vps35-RFP fusion construct. These cells allowed us to track the uptake of latex beads into clearly defined phagosomes. Given that the phagocytic receptor CD36 is involved in part in phagocytosing latex beads (Figure 3A), and that beclin 1 and Vps35 play a role in recycling CD36 (Figures 3 and 4), the phagosomal membrane surrounding latex beads provides an excellent substrate to monitor PI3P and Vps35 recruitment. Using this paradigm, we find that PI3P is rapidly generated at the phagosomal membrane within 10 min and is followed by the recruitment of Vps35 around 20 min (Figure 5C). To investigate the role of beclin 1 in these events, we knocked down beclin 1 and monitored PI3P generation and Vps35 recruitment. In agreement with beclin 1 deficiency causing diminished Vps34 levels (Figure 5A), reducing beclin 1 also impaired the generation of PI3P at the phagosomal membrane (Figure 5D; Movies S1 and S2) and the recruitment of Vps35 to the phagosomal membrane (Figure 5E; Movies S3 and S4). Importantly, when Vps34 was inhibited with the PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine, which selectively inhibits Vps34 kinase activity (Miller et al., 2010Miller S. Tavshanjian B. Oleksy A. Perisic O. Houseman B.T. Shokat K.M. Williams R.L. Shaping development of autophagy inhibitors with the structure of the lipid kinase Vps34.Science. 2010; 327: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we observed mislocalization of Vps35 (Figure 5F) and reduced retromer complex levels (Figure 5G), similar to what was seen in beclin 1 knockdown cells. Treatment with 3-methyladenine also resulted in a significant impairment in phagocytic efficiency that was similar to what was seen in beclin 1 knockdown cells (Figure 5H). Given the role of PI3P in regulating phagosomal maturation (Vieira et al., 2001Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C. Grinstein S. Distinct roles of class I and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases in phagosome formation and maturation.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), we tested whether beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells show impairments in phagosomal maturation. Indeed, beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells also demonstrated impairments in phagosomal maturation (Figure S3). Together, these data indicate that beclin 1 works in collaboration with Vps34 to generate PI3P at phagosomal membranes, which then allows for the recruitment of the retromer complex. When this process is disrupted, phagocytic receptor recycling, phagocytic efficiency, and phagosomal maturation are impaired. Given that beclin 1 deficiency impairs the recycling of CD36, a known Aβ phagocytic receptor, we next asked whether phagocytosis of Aβ is impaired in beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells. To evaluate Aβ phagocytosis, we used a previously described ex vivo brain slice assay (Bard et al., 2000Bard F. Cannon C. Barbour R. Burke R.L. Games D. Grajeda H. Guido T. Hu K. Huang J. Johnson-Wood K. et al.Peripherally administered antibodies against amyloid beta-peptide enter the central nervous system and reduce pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar) (Figure 6A), where microglial cells are added to unfixed brain slices from aged, plaque-depositing APP transgenic mice. Microglia then surround and engulf Aβ (Figure 6B), and its removal can be measured immunohistochemically or by ELISA. While control BV2 cells efficiently cleared Aβ deposits from these brain sections, beclin 1-deficient cells were significantly less efficient at clearing the aggregates in both the hippocampus (Figures 6C and 6D) and cortex (Figure 6E). These histological findings were supported by independent measurements of Aβ content in brain slices by ELISA (Figures 6F and 6G). Moreover, primary microglia isolated from beclin 1+/− mice showed similar impairments in Aβ phagocytosis when compared to wild-type littermates (Figures S4A and S4B). Importantly, Aβ phagocytosis by beclin 1-deficient BV2 cells could be rescued by recovering beclin 1 levels (Figures S4C and S4D). To determine whether beclin 1 has a role in the removal of extracellular Aβ in vivo, we used beclin 1+/− mice and injected fibrillar Aβ into the frontal cortex (Figure 7A). In agreement with our ex vivo phagocytosis assay, the removal of Aβ was significantly impaired in beclin 1-deficient mice, resulting in twice as much Aβ remaining in the brains of beclin 1+/− mice compared with wild-type littermates (Figures 7B and 7C). We then tested whether reduced phagocytic capacity could explain impairments in the removal of Aβ in vivo by injecting pH-sensitive beads, which fluoresce when internalized by microglial cells (insert of Figure 7D), into the frontal cortex of beclin 1+/− mice or wild-type littermates. Quantification of fluorescence as an indicator of phagocytosed beads showed that beclin 1+/− mice phagocytosed almost 4-fold fewer beads than wild-type mice (Figures 7D and 7E). Because the fluorescence readout of our pH-sensitive beads could be confounded by changes in phagosomal or lysosomal pH, we tested whether reduced beclin 1 levels might affect phagosomal or lysosomal pH."
https://openalex.org/W2038327893,"A dynamic interplay between intrinsic regional molecular cues and extrinsic factors from the thalamus shape multiple features of early cortical development. It remains uncertain and controversial, however, whether the initial formation of cortical columns depends on neuronal activity, and there is little evidence that cortical lamination or neuronal differentiation is influenced by extrinsic activity. We examined the role of thalamic-derived factors in cortical development by selectively eliminating glutamatergic synaptic transmission from thalamocortical neurons in mice and found that eliminating thalamocortical neurotransmission prevented the formation of ""barrel"" columns in somatosensory cortex. Interestingly, based on cytoarchitectonic criteria and genetic markers, blocking thalamocortical neurotransmission also perturbed the development of superficial cortical lamina and the morphologic development of neurons. These experiments demonstrate that barrels and aspects of the layer-dependent pattern of cortical cytoarchitecture, gene expression, and neuronal differentiation depend on thalamocortical neurotransmission, extending the apparent influence of extrinsic, presumably activity-dependent factors, on cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W2080851537,"Taking advantage of the well-characterized olfactory system of Drosophila, we derive a simple quantitative relationship between patterns of odorant receptor activation, the resulting internal representations of odors, and odor discrimination. Second-order excitatory and inhibitory projection neurons (ePNs and iPNs) convey olfactory information to the lateral horn, a brain region implicated in innate odor-driven behaviors. We show that the distance between ePN activity patterns is the main determinant of a fly’s spontaneous discrimination behavior. Manipulations that silence subsets of ePNs have graded behavioral consequences, and effect sizes are predicted by changes in ePN distances. ePN distances predict only innate, not learned, behavior because the latter engages the mushroom body, which enables differentiated responses to even very similar odors. Inhibition from iPNs, which scales with olfactory stimulus strength, enhances innate discrimination of closely related odors, by imposing a high-pass filter on transmitter release from ePN terminals that increases the distance between odor representations."
https://openalex.org/W2012712733,"We characterize an inhibitory circuit motif in the Drosophila olfactory system, parallel inhibition, which differs from feedforward or feedback inhibition. Excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory projection neurons (ePNs and iPNs) each receive input from antennal lobe glomeruli and send parallel output to the lateral horn, a higher center implicated in regulating innate olfactory behavior. Ca(2+) imaging of specific lateral horn neurons as an olfactory readout revealed that iPNs selectively suppressed food-related odor responses, but spared signal transmission from pheromone channels. Coapplying food odorant did not affect pheromone signal transmission, suggesting that the differential effects likely result from connection specificity of iPNs, rather than a generalized inhibitory tone. Ca(2+) responses in the ePN axon terminals show no detectable suppression by iPNs, arguing against presynaptic inhibition as a primary mechanism. The parallel inhibition motif may provide specificity in inhibition to funnel specific olfactory information, such as food and pheromone, into distinct downstream circuits."

Subsets of MB neurons have temporally unique roles in memory processing, but valence-related organization has not been demonstrated. We functionally subdivided the αβ neurons, revealing a value-specific role for the ∼160 αβ core (αβc) neurons. Blocking neurotransmission from αβ surface (αβs) neurons revealed a requirement during retrieval of aversive and appetitive memory, whereas blocking αβc only impaired appetitive memory. The αβc were also required to express memory in a differential aversive paradigm demonstrating a role in relative valuation and approach behavior. Strikingly, both reinforcing dopamine neurons and efferent pathways differentially innervate αβc and αβs in the MB lobes.

Understanding how nervous systems represent sensory cues, store memories, and support decision making and appropriate action selection is of major interest. Olfactory learning in Drosophila is ideally suited to address these questions. Conditioning flies with aversive electric shock or sugar reward assigns value to otherwise meaningless odors and alters naive odor preferences so that subsequent odor-driven behavior becomes goal-directed movement (Tully and Quinn, 1985Tully T.

Olfactory memories are believed to be represented within the ∼2,000 intrinsic Kenyon cells (KCs) of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB) (Heisenberg, 2003Heisenberg M. Mushroom body memoir: from maps to models.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Individual odors activate relatively sparse populations of KCs within the overall MB ensemble providing cellular specificity to odor memories (Turner et al., 2008Turner G.C. Bazhenov M. Laurent G.

Prior research of fly memory suggests that the KCs can be functionally split into at least three major subdivisions: the αβ, α′β′, and γ neurons. The current consensus suggests a role for γ in short-term memory, for α′β′ after training for memory consolidation, and for αβ in later memory retrieval, with the αβ requirement becoming more pronounced as time passes (Zars et al., 2000Zars T.

Value is assigned to odors during training by anatomically distinct dopaminergic (DA) neurons that innervate unique zones of the MB (Waddell, 2013Waddell S. Reinforcement signalling in Drosophila; dopamine does it all after all.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2013; 23: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Negative value is conveyed to MB γ neurons in the heel and junction and to αβ neurons at the base of the peduncle and the tip of the β lobe (Claridge-Chang et al., 2009Claridge-Chang A. Roorda R.D.

Tanimoto H. Three dopamine pathways induce aversive odor memories with different stability.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002768Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast, a much larger number of rewarding DA neurons project to approximately seven nonoverlapping zones in the horizontal β, β′, and γ lobes (Burke et al., 2012Burke C.J. Huetteroth W. Owald D. Perisse E. Krashes M.J. Das G. Gohl D. Silies M. Certel S. Waddell S.

A subset of dopamine neurons signals reward for odour memory in Drosophila.Nature. 2012; 488: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This clear zonal architecture of reinforcing neurons suggests that plastic valence-relevant KC synapses may lie adjacent to these reinforcing neurons. Furthermore, presumed downstream MB efferent neurons also have dendrites restricted to discrete zones on the MB lobes (Tanaka et al., 2008Tanaka N.K. Tanimoto H. Ito K. Neuronal assemblies of the Drosophila mushroom body.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 508: 711-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), consistent with memories being formed at KC-output neuron synapses. Long before the zonal DA neuron innervation of the MB was fully appreciated, experiments suggested that appetitive and aversive memories were independently processed and stored (Tempel et al., 1983Tempel B.L. Bonini N. Dawson D.R. Quinn W.G. Reward learning in normal and mutant Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1983; 80: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Subsequently, models were proposed that represented memories of opposite valence at distinct output synapses on the same odor-activated KCs or on separate KCs (Schwaerzel et al., 2003Schwaerzel M. Monastirioti M. Scholz H. Friggi-Grelin F. Birman S. Heisenberg M. Dopamine and octopamine differentiate between aversive and appetitive olfactory memories in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10495-10502PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, memory retrieval through these modified KC-output synapses was predicted to guide either odor avoidance or approach behavior. A KC synapse-specific representation of memories of opposing valence would dictate that it is not possible to functionally separate the retrieval of aversive and appetitive memories by disrupting KC-wide processes. We therefore tested these models by systematically blocking neurotransmission from subsets of the retrieval-relevant αβ neurons. We found that aversive and appetitive memories can be distinguished in the αβ KC population, showing that opposing odor memories do not exclusively rely on overlapping KCs. Whereas output from the αβs neurons is required for aversive and appetitive memory retrieval, the αβ core (αβc) neurons are only critical for conditioned approach behavior. Higher-resolution anatomical analysis of the innervation of reinforcing DA neurons suggests that valence-specific asymmetry may be established during training. Furthermore, dendrites of KC-output neurons differentially innervate the MB in a similarly stratified manner. We therefore propose that aversive memories are retrieved and avoidance behavior triggered only from the αβ surface (αβs) neurons, whereas appetitive memories are retrieved and approach behavior is driven by efferent neurons that integrate across the αβ ensemble. Several studies have reported the importance of output from MB αβ neurons for the retrieval of aversive and appetitive olfactory memories (Dubnau et al., 2001Dubnau J. Grady L. Kitamoto T. Tully T.

However, genetic labeling reveals further anatomical segregation of the ∼1,000 αβ neurons into at least αβ posterior (αβp or pioneer), αβ surface (αβs or early), and αβ core (αβc or late) subsets that are sequentially born during development (Ito et al., 1997Ito K.

We therefore investigated the role of these αβ subsets in memory retrieval. We first obtained, or identified, GAL4 lines with expression that was restricted to αβ subsets and verified their expression. Prior reports showed that the c739 GAL4 (McGuire et al., 2001McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Davis R.L. The role of Drosophila mushroom body signaling in olfactory memory.Science. 2001; 293: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) labels αβ neurons contributing to all three classes (Aso et al., 2009Aso Y.

Lastly, we identified the 0770 GAL4 line from the InSITE collection (Gohl et al., 2011Gohl D.M. Silies M.A. Gao X.J. Bhalerao S. Luongo F.J. Lin C.C. Potter C.J. Clandinin T.R. A versatile in vivo system for directed dissection of gene expression patterns.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with strong expression in αβs neurons and weaker expression in αβp neurons. We expressed a membrane-tethered GFP (uas-mCD8::GFP) using the c739, 0770, NP7175, and c708a GAL4 drivers and localized expression within the overall MB neurons using a LexAop-rCD2::RFP transgene driven by 247-LexA::VP16 (Pitman et al., 2011Pitman J.L.

Projections of confocal stacks through the MBs revealed labeling within the MB in each of these GAL4 driver lines that is restricted to the respective αβ subdivision (Figure 1 and S1 available online). In addition, the αβs and αβc lines have dendrites in the main calyx, whereas αβp neurons innervate only the accessory calyx (Lin et al., 2007Lin H.H. Lai J.S. Chin A.L. Chen Y.C. Chiang A.S.

Tanimoto H. Ito K. Neuronal assemblies of the Drosophila mushroom body.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 508: 711-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We used 0770, NP7175, and c708a GAL4-driven expression of the dominant temperature-sensitive uas-shibirets1 (shits1) transgene (Kitamoto, 2001Kitamoto T. Conditional modification of behavior in Drosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire allele in defined neurons.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) to examine the role of neurotransmission from αβs, αβc, and αβp neurons in olfactory memory retrieval. In each experiment, we also compared the effect of blocking all MB αβ neurons with c739. We first tested sucrose-reinforced appetitive memory (Krashes and Waddell, 2008Krashes M.J. Waddell S. Rapid consolidation to a radish and protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory after single-session appetitive olfactory conditioning in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3103-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Flies were trained at the permissive 23°C and αβ subsets were blocked by shifting the flies to restrictive 33°C 30 min before and during testing 3 hr memory. Performance of c739;shits1, 0770;shits1, and NP7175;shits1 flies, but not that of c708a;shits1 flies, was statistically different to shits1 and their respective GAL4 control flies (Figure 2A). Experiments at permissive 23°C did not reveal significant differences in performance between the relevant groups (Figure S2A). Therefore, output from the αβs and αβc neurons is required for the retrieval of appetitive memory, whereas αβp neuron output is dispensable. We similarly tested the role of αβ subsets in retrieval of electric-shock-reinforced aversive memory. Memory performance of c739;shits1 and 0770;shits1, but not NP7175;shits1 or c708a;shits1, flies was statistically different to that of shits1 and their respective GAL4 control flies (Figure 2B). Importantly, control aversive experiments performed at 23°C did not reveal significant differences between the relevant groups (Figure S2B). Therefore, these data reveal that output from the αβs neurons is required for the retrieval of aversive memory, whereas the αβc and αβp neurons are dispensable, implying a possible appetitive memory-specific role for αβc neurons. Since odors are represented as activation of sparse collections of MB neurons (Honegger et al., 2011Honegger K.S. Campbell R.A. Turner G.C. Cellular-resolution population imaging reveals robust sparse coding in the Drosophila mushroom body.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11772-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that certain odor pairs might be biased in their odor representations in particular αβ subsets. The reciprocal nature of the conditioning assays should account for this caveat. Nevertheless, we also tested the effect of αβ subset block when flies were appetitively or aversively trained using ethyl butyrate and isoamyl acetate—two odors shown to activate αβc neurons (Murthy et al., 2008Murthy M. Fiete I. Laurent G. Testing odor response stereotypy in the Drosophila mushroom body.Neuron. 2008; 59: 1009-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These experiments again revealed a role for αβs and αβc in appetitive memory but only αβs in aversive memory (Figures 2C and 2D). The αβp neurons remained dispensable. The appetitive retrieval defect is unlikely to result from defective odor perception since flies with blocked αβc neurons (NP7175;shits1) exhibit normal aversive memory. Furthermore, control experiments demonstrated that c739;shits1 and 0770;shits1 exhibit normal olfactory acuity at the restrictive temperature (Table S1). We further challenged a valence-specific role for αβ neuron subsets using additional genetic approaches. We first confirmed that αβs neurons are required for both appetitive and aversive memory retrieval using NP5286, another GAL4 line with strong expression in αβs neurons and weaker expression in αβp neurons (Figures 3A and S1F; Tanaka et al., 2008Tanaka N.K. Tanimoto H. Ito K. Neuronal assemblies of the Drosophila mushroom body.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 508: 711-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Appetitive and aversive memory performance of NP5286;shits1 flies was statistically different to that of shits1 and GAL4 control flies (Figures 3E and 3F). No statistical differences were apparent when experiments were performed at permissive 23°C (Figure S3) and the NP5286;shits1 flies exhibit normal olfactory acuity at the restrictive temperature (Table S1). We next challenged an appetitive memory-specific role for αβc neurons using an intersectional genetic strategy. Combining a ChaGAL80 transgene with c739 removes expression in the αβs and αβp neurons from the c739-labeled αβ population and leaves robust expression in αβc neurons (Figures 3B and S1G). We again trained flies at the permissive temperature and blocked αβc during retrieval. Similar to the analysis with NP7175;shits1 flies, appetitive memory performance of c739;ChaGAL80/shits1 flies was impaired, being statistically different to the relevant control groups (Figure 3E). Moreover, the c739 disruptive effect on aversive memory was abolished with ChaGAL80, consistent with removal of αβs expression from c739 (Figure 3F). Control experiments at 23°C did not reveal significant differences between the relevant groups (Figure S3). A role for αβc in memory consolidation has been reported (Huang et al., 2012Huang C. Zheng X. Zhao H. Li M. Wang P. Xie Z. Wang L. Zhong Y. A permissive role of mushroom body α/β core neurons in long-term memory consolidation in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1981-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Blocking NP6024-labeled αβc neurons for several hours after training disrupted appetitive and aversive memory consolidation, whereas blocking NP7175-labeled neurons only impaired aversive memory consolidation (Huang et al., 2012Huang C. Zheng X. Zhao H. Li M. Wang P. Xie Z. Wang L. Zhong Y. A permissive role of mushroom body α/β core neurons in long-term memory consolidation in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1981-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although others defined the αβ neurons labeled in NP6024 as inner and outer αβc neurons (Tanaka et al., 2008Tanaka N.K. Tanimoto H. Ito K. Neuronal assemblies of the Drosophila mushroom body.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 508: 711-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, Huang et al., 2012Huang C. Zheng X. Zhao H. Li M. Wang P. Xie Z. Wang L. Zhong Y. A permissive role of mushroom body α/β core neurons in long-term memory consolidation in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1981-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), our anatomical analysis revealed that outer αβc neurons occupy the area of the vertical MB lobe that is anatomically indistinguishable from that containing the αβs neurons (Figures 3A–3D). Furthermore, blocking output during retrieval in NP6024;shits1 flies significantly impaired both appetitive and aversive memory (Figures 3E and 3F), consistent with NP6024 expressing in αβc and αβs neurons. Control experiments at the permissive temperature did not reveal significant differences between the relevant groups (Figure S3) and the NP6024;shits1 flies exhibit normal olfactory acuity (Table S1). Perhaps more importantly, a consolidation effect cannot account for our appetitive memory retrieval-specific function because the retrieval role for αβc is not time dependent. As shown for 3 hr memory (Figures 2A and 2C), blocking NP7175 αβc neurons during retrieval also impaired appetitive 24 hr LTM (Figure S4A), whereas it did not impair aversive 24 hr LTM (Huang et al., 2012Huang C. Zheng X. Zhao H. Li M. Wang P. Xie Z. Wang L. Zhong Y. A permissive role of mushroom body α/β core neurons in long-term memory consolidation in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1981-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that αβc have a unique role in appetitive memory retrieval. As a final step to rule out odor-specific effects, we used live Ca2+ imaging to determine whether the four odors used in conditioning activate αβ subsets. We expressed a uas-GCaMP5 transgene and live-imaged odor-evoked changes in fluorescence in a cross-section of the α axons in the vertical lobe tip. Each odor evoked a robust, odor-specific positive response in αβscp, αβs, and αβc neurons labeled by c739, 0770, and NP7175 (Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, the odors evoked a marked reduction of GCaMP5 fluorescence in c708a αβp neurons (Figure 4A). We also observed odor-specific responses in αβs, αβc, and αβsc neurons labeled by NP5286, c739;ChaGAL80, and NP6024, respectively (Figure S5). Therefore, the odors employed in conditioning activate the functionally critical αβs and αβc neurons in an odor-specific manner, whereas they inhibit the dispensable αβp neurons. Appetitive memories are more stable than aversive memories formed after a single training session (Tempel et al., 1983Tempel B.L. Bonini N. Dawson D.R. Quinn W.G.

https://openalex.org/W2110478179,"The outcome of patients with resistant phenotypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or those who relapse remains poor. We investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by metformin in Bp- and T-ALL cell models and primary cells, and show that metformin effectively induces apoptosis in ALL cells. Metformin activated AMPK, down-regulated the unfolded protein response (UPR) demonstrated by significant decrease in the main UPR regulator GRP78, and led to UPR-mediated cell death via up-regulation of the ER stress/UPR cell death mediators IRE1α and CHOP. Using shRNA, we demonstrate that metformin-induced apoptosis is AMPK-dependent since AMPK knock-down rescued ALL cells, which correlated with down-regulation of IRE1α and CHOP and restoration of the UPR/GRP78 function. Additionally rapamycin, a known inhibitor of mTOR-dependent protein synthesis, rescued cells from metformin-induced apoptosis and down-regulated CHOP expression. Finally, metformin induced PIM-2 kinase activity and co-treatment of ALL cells with a PIM-1/2 kinase inhibitor plus metformin synergistically increased cell death, suggesting a buffering role for PIM-2 in metformin’s cytotoxicity. Similar synergism was seen with agents targeting Akt in combination with metformin, supporting our original postulate that AMPK and Akt exert opposite regulatory roles on UPR activity in ALL. Taken together, our data indicate that metformin induces ALL cell death by triggering ER and proteotoxic stress and simultaneously down-regulating the physiologic UPR response responsible for effectively buffering proteotoxic stress. Our findings provide evidence for a role of metformin in ALL therapy and support strategies targeting synthetic lethal interactions with Akt and PIM kinases as suitable for future consideration for clinical translation in ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2057596490,"Electrical synapses are abundant in the vertebrate brain, but their functional and molecular complexities are still poorly understood. We report here that electrical synapses between auditory afferents and goldfish Mauthner cells are constructed by apposition of hemichannels formed by two homologs of mammalian connexin 36 (Cx36) and that, while Cx35 is restricted to presynaptic hemiplaques, Cx34.7 is restricted to postsynaptic hemiplaques, forming heterotypic junctions. This molecular asymmetry is associated with rectification of electrical transmission that may act to promote cooperativity between auditory afferents. Our data suggest that, in similarity to pre- and postsynaptic sites at chemical synapses, one side in electrical synapses should not necessarily be considered the mirror image of the other. While asymmetry based on the presence of two Cx36 homologs is restricted to teleost fish, it might also be based on differences in posttranslational modifications of individual connexins or in the complement of gap junction-associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2019135050,"Although many studies have identified neural correlates of memory, relatively little is known about the circuit properties connecting single-neuron physiology to behavior. Here we developed a modeling framework to bridge this gap and identify circuit interactions capable of maintaining short-term memory. Unlike typical studies that construct a phenomenological model and test whether it reproduces select aspects of neuronal data, we directly fit the synaptic connectivity of an oculomotor memory circuit to a broad range of anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral data. Simultaneous fits to all data, combined with sensitivity analyses, revealed complementary roles of synaptic and neuronal recruitment thresholds in providing the nonlinear interactions required to generate the observed circuit behavior. This work provides a methodology for identifying the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying short-term memory and demonstrates how the anatomical structure of a circuit may belie its functional organization."

Neuronal connections in the brain are first established by genetic programs and then shaped during postnatal development by an individual’s sensory and motor experience when interacting with the environment. The experience-induced changes occur during “critical periods” in early life, and failing to receive appropriate experience during these time windows leads to abnormal circuit formation that is difficult to repair later in life (Lewis and Maurer, 2009Lewis T.L.

A classic example in critical period studies is ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the visual cortex. During the critical period of OD plasticity, monocular visual deprivation leads to a loss of cortical response to the deprived eye and an increase to the nondeprived eye (Emerson et al., 1982Emerson V.F.

For example, complete visual deprivation from birth delays the onset of the critical period (Cynader et al., 1976Cynader M. Berman N. Hein A.

On the other hand, the critical period can be reactivated in adulthood by enriched sensory, motor, and social interactions with the environment (Sale et al., 2007Sale A. Maya Vetencourt J.F.

In addition, the critical period of OD plasticity can also be advanced or delayed genetically by enhancing or reducing synaptic inhibition in the cortex (Fagiolini et al., 2004Fagiolini M.

Fagiolini M. Obata K. Hensch T.K. Rapid critical period induction by tonic inhibition in visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6695-6702PubMed Google Scholar). Although the above studies have identified methods to alter critical period timing experimentally, it is unknown whether and how these alterations influence normal visual development. On the one hand, cortical functions could still achieve their normal levels as long as visual stimulation is present during the critical period, regardless of whether it is earlier or later. On the other hand, if the timing of the critical period is important, its alteration would result in abnormal visual development despite the normal visual experience. However, which of the two scenarios is true cannot be determined with OD plasticity because it is a deprivation-induced plasticity that does not normally occur. We recently discovered that visual experience during the critical period drives the binocular matching of orientation preference in the mouse primary visual cortex (Wang et al., 2010aWang B.S. Sarnaik R. Cang J. Critical period plasticity matches binocular orientation preference in the visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 246-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), thus making it possible to study the functional significance of the proper timing of the critical period in normal development. In this study, we have first examined binocular matching of orientation preference in mice that have a precocious critical period due to genetically enhanced inhibition (Huang et al., 1999Huang Z.J. Kirkwood A. Pizzorusso T. Porciatti V. Morales B. Bear M.F. Maffei L. Tonegawa S. BDNF regulates the maturation of inhibition and the critical period of plasticity in mouse visual cortex.Cell. 1999; 98: 739-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). We find that binocular matching in these mice is permanently disrupted and the disruption is due to a temporal discrepancy between the genetically induced precocious critical period and normal binocular development. The matching deficit in these mice is fully rescued by environmental enrichment during early postnatal development, which induces acetylation of histone H4 via insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and consequently advances the matching process to coincide with the precocious plasticity. Together, our experiments demonstrate that a properly timed critical period is essential for establishing normal binocularity in the visual cortex and the detrimental impact of its genetic misregulation can be rescued by environmental manipulations via epigenetic mechanisms. To study the functional significance of a properly timed critical period, we examined binocular matching of orientation preference in a line of transgenic mice that overexpress brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) in their forebrains (Huang et al., 1999Huang Z.J. Kirkwood A. Pizzorusso T. Porciatti V. Morales B. Bear M.F. Maffei L. Tonegawa S. BDNF regulates the maturation of inhibition and the critical period of plasticity in mouse visual cortex.Cell. 1999; 98: 739-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). These BDNF overexpression (BDNF-OE) mice display accelerated maturation of GABAergic innervation and inhibition in the visual cortex, which leads to precocious OD plasticity (Hanover et al., 1999Hanover J.L. Huang Z.J. Tonegawa S. Stryker M.P. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor overexpression induces precocious critical period in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC40PubMed Google Scholar, Huang et al., 1999Huang Z.J. Kirkwood A. Pizzorusso T. Porciatti V. Morales B. Bear M.F. Maffei L. Tonegawa S.

We made single-unit recordings in the binocular zone of the primary visual cortex (V1) in these mice and determined individual neurons’ orientation tuning separately for each eye. The monocularly preferred orientations were then compared between the two eyes, and their difference (referred to as ΔO) was used to quantify the degree of binocular matching (Wang et al., 2010aWang B.S. Sarnaik R. Cang J. Critical period plasticity matches binocular orientation preference in the visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 246-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We first studied the BDNF-OE mice after postnatal day 30 (P30), when binocular matching has normally reached adult level in WT mice (Wang et al., 2010aWang B.S. Sarnaik R. Cang J. Critical period plasticity matches binocular orientation preference in the visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 246-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Remarkably, we found that many cortical neurons in these mice were still tuned to very different orientations through the two eyes (Figures 1A and 1B ), and the deficit persisted well into adulthood (P31–P36: mean ΔO = 29.1° ± 3.3°, n = 44; P60–P90: mean ΔO = 33.4° ± 2.9°, n = 93; p = 0.58). Across the population, ΔO in the BDNF-OE mice was significantly greater than the age-matched WT controls (BDNF-OE: mean ΔO = 32.0° ± 2.2°, n = 137; WT: mean ΔO = 21.8° ± 1.2°, n = 297; p < 0.001; Figures 1B and 1C), indicating a mismatch of orientation preference through the two eyes. The disrupted binocular matching in BDNF-OE mice was not due to a possible change in orientation selectivity. In fact, both orientation selectivity index (OSI, BDNF-OE: contra = 0.70 ± 0.03, ipsi = 0.64 ± 0.03, n = 137; WT: contra = 0.67 ± 0.02, ipsi = 0.64 ± 0.02, n = 297; p = 0.25 and 0.73, respectively) and tuning width (BDNF-OE: contra = 26.0° ± 1.2°, ipsi = 24.2° ± 1.2°, n = 92; WT: contra = 27.2° ± 0.8°, ipsi = 26.6° ± 0.8°, n = 197; p = 0.31 and 0.13, respectively) were similar to WT controls (Figures 1F and 1G). In other words, BDNF overexpression specifically disrupts the matching of the two streams of eye-specific inputs in the cortex while keeping monocular tuning properties intact. Although disrupted, the binocular matching of orientation preference in the BDNF-OE mice was not completely random, which would result in a uniform distribution of ΔO between 0° and 90° (Figures 1B and 1C; p < 0.001). We thus studied whether some cells were better matched than others in the BDNF-OE mice. Neurons in the visual cortex can be classified into simple and complex cells, with the two classes of cells representing successive stages in visual information processing (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962Hubel D.H.

We divided the recorded neurons into these two groups based on the linearity of their responses to drifting sinusoidal gratings (see Experimental Procedures for details) and then determined their degree of matching. Remarkably, simple and complex cells in the BDNF-OE mice showed different phenotypes in binocular matching. While simple cells in the BDNF-OE mice had normal and well-matched orientation preference (BDNF-OE: mean ΔO = 24.2° ± 3.2°, n = 51; WT: mean ΔO = 19.1° ± 1.5°, n = 170; p = 0.46, Figure 1D), the binocular matching of complex cells was severely disrupted (BDNF-OE: ΔO = 35.7° ± 2.9°, n = 86; WT: ΔO = 25.4° ± 2.0°, n = 127; p < 0.05, Figure 1E; also see Figures S1A and S1C available online for examples). Again, the monocular orientation tuning properties of both simple and complex cells in BDNF-OE mice were normal (see Figure S1 and Table S1), consistent with the observation across the whole population. We next sought to confirm that the cell-type-specific disruption of binocular matching in the BDNF-OE mice is indeed due to the precocious cortical plasticity induced by accelerated inhibition maturation. It was shown that brief enhancement of inhibition with the GABAA receptor agonist diazepam after eye opening can induce precocious critical period for OD plasticity (Iwai et al., 2003Iwai Y.

Physiol. 2009; 587: 2857-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and injected diazepam into WT mice daily at P16 and P17 and then studied their binocular matching at P31–P36. The pharmacological manipulation of inhibition indeed phenocopied the matching defect of the BDNF-OE mice (Figures 1D and 1E). While simple cells in the diazepam-treated mice showed normal binocular matching (mean ΔO = 19.8° ± 3.6°, n = 39; p = 0.52, Figure 1D), the matching of complex cells was completely disrupted (mean ΔO = 40.9° ± 4.1°, n = 48; p < 0.01 compared to WT; p = 0.02 compared to vehicle-treated controls; p = 0.26 compared to random; Figure 1E). Just like in the BDNF-OE mice, the development of monocular orientation tuning was not affected by the diazepam injection (see Table S1). To understand the cause of the complex cell-specific disruption in mice with precocious cortical plasticity, we determined the normal time course of binocular matching in WT mice. At P15–P18, a few days after eye opening, most cells had mismatched orientation preference (mean ΔO = 34.2° ± 3.3°, n = 60), and the mismatch did not improve until P20/P21 (mean ΔO = 34.8° ± 2.7°, n = 97; p = 0.99 between the two groups). Furthermore, the level of matching at P20/P21 was similarly poor as in mice that had never experienced any visual stimulation (reared in complete darkness from P11 to P31–P36: mean ΔO = 39.2° ± 1.8°, n = 234, p = 0.26). At this age, the orientation preferences were mismatched in both simple (mean ΔO = 33.0° ± 3.1°, n = 69; Figures 2A and 2B ) and complex cells (mean ΔO = 39.2° ± 5.3°, n = 28; Figures 2D and 2E), comparable to their dark-reared counterparts (simple: mean ΔO = 37.7° ± 2.3°, n = 135, p = 0.16; complex: mean ΔO = 41.2° ± 2.8°, n = 99, p = 0.96; Figures 2B and 2E). In other words, even with 6–7 days of visual experience after eye opening, the level of binocular matching did not significantly improve before P20. Just a couple days later, by P22/P23, however, the matching in simple cells had already reached the adult level (mean ΔO = 18.3° ± 2.7°, n = 52, p = 0.99; Figures 2A and 2B). In contrast, the complex cells were still mismatched at this age (mean ΔO = 37.6° ± 4.1°, n = 38), at a similar level as in the dark-reared animals (p = 0.26). The complex cells remained mismatched until P26/P27 (mean ΔO = 38.5° ± 4.2°, n = 39, p = 0.60 compared to dark-reared group; Figures 2D and 2E), and their matching reached the mature level by P31 (mean ΔO = 24.4° ± 2.3°, n = 84; Figures 2D and 2E; p = 0.37 compared to P60–P90 adults). These results thus demonstrate that complex cells normally match orientation preference binocularly after simple cells. In addition to the sequential process of binocular matching in simple and complex cells, the development of monocular orientation selectivity also differs in these two cell types. As a whole population, V1 neurons increased their contralateral OSI after eye opening (P15–P18: mean OSI = 0.55 ± 0.04, P31–P36: mean OSI = 0.66 ± 0.02; p < 0.05), consistent with previous studies (Kuhlman et al., 2011Kuhlman S.J.

Development of direction selectivity in mouse cortical neurons.Neuron. 2011; 71: 425-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We also revealed an increase in V1 orientation selectivity through the ipsilateral eye (P15–P18: mean OSI = 0.54 ± 0.04, P31–P36: mean OSI = 0.64 ± 0.02, p = 0.06). Interestingly, such orientation selectivity improvement was restricted to simple cells (Figure 2C; also see Table S1) but was not in complex cells (Figure 2F). Taken together, these results revealed a detailed temporal profile of visual cortical development. While acquiring their orientation selectivity during the first 2 weeks after eye opening, the simple cells match their orientation preference binocularly and reach adult level by P23. In contrast, the complex cells match a few days after the simple cells, without any obvious improvement of orientation selectivity. Importantly, the discovery that the binocular matching of simple and complex cells occurs at two distinct stages, together with the complex cell-specific disruption in mice with a precocious critical period, indicates that the matching in the complex cells is not a trivial or automatic consequence of simple cells being matched. Instead, the intracortical connections from simple to complex cells, after simple cells have already matched, must still undergo synaptic changes in order to match the complex cells. Although previous studies of the BDNF-OE mice showed that OD plasticity in these mice peaked earlier than in WT mice (Hanover et al., 1999Hanover J.L. Huang Z.J. Tonegawa S. Stryker M.P. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor overexpression induces precocious critical period in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC40PubMed Google Scholar, Huang et al., 1999Huang Z.J. Kirkwood A.

BDNF regulates the maturation of inhibition and the critical period of plasticity in mouse visual cortex.Cell. 1999; 98: 739-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), they did not test cortical plasticity before P20, i.e., the period before the normal binocular matching process as we just discovered. We therefore initiated monocular deprivation at P15 in both WT and BDNF-OE mice and studied the degree of OD plasticity 5–6 days later, using optical imaging of intrinsic signals to measure the visually evoked responses in V1 (Cang et al., 2005Cang J. Kalatsky V.A. Löwel S. Stryker M.P. Optical imaging of the intrinsic signal as a measure of cortical plasticity in the mouse.Vis. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar; Figure 3A). The response amplitude through the contralateral eye (C) and that through the ipsilateral eye (I) were determined separately and used to calculate an ocular dominance index (ODI = [C − I]/[C + I]). Monocular deprivation of the contralateral eye between P15 and P20 did not cause any ODI change in the WT mice (Figures 3A and 3B). In contrast, the same manipulation in the BDNF-OE mice induced a significant ODI shift (Figures 3A and 3B, p = 0.007), demonstrating a precocious onset of cortical plasticity in these mice. Despite the precocious plasticity before P20, however, binocular matching of simple cells in the BDNF-OE mice does not occur earlier. At P20/P21, simple cells in the BDNF-OE mice still remained mismatched, with ΔO comparable to the WT age-matched controls (mean ΔO = 34.1° ± 4.5°, n = 29; Figure 3C, p = 0.82). The OSI was also similar between these cells (see Table S1), showing that advancing critical period plasticity has no impact on the development of monocular orientation tuning. These results thus revealed a genetically induced temporal “mismatch” between the critical period and binocular matching in the BDNF-OE mice: the early onset of cortical plasticity does not advance binocular matching and the precocious closure of the critical period (Hanover et al., 1999Hanover J.L.

The above findings suggest that the matching deficits in the BDNF-OE mice could potentially be rescued if the timing of the binocular matching process is shifted earlier to coincide with the precocious cortical plasticity. To test this, we reared mice in an enriched environment, which is known to accelerate many aspects of visual system development (Cancedda et al., 2004Cancedda L. Putignano E. Sale A. Viegi A.

Cenni M.C. Maffei L. Berardi N. Environmental enrichment effects on development of retinal ganglion cell dendritic stratification require retinal BDNF.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e346Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). First, we examined whether environmental enrichment (EE) accelerates binocular matching in WT mice. We recorded mice that were born and reared in an environment with enhanced sensory, motor, and social experiences (see Movie S1 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). At P20/P21, when the binocular matching process had not initiated under normal rearing (NR) conditions, the matching in the enriched mice was significantly improved (mean ΔO = 22.9° ± 1.9°, n = 129, p < 0.001 compared to NR). In fact, the degree of binocular matching in both simple and complex cells had already reached the adult level (simple cells: ΔO = 20.6° ± 2.3°, n = 78, p < 0.01 compared to the age-matched control and p = 0.43 compared to NR adult; complex cells: ΔO = 26.5° ± 3.2°, n = 51, p = 0.09 compared to the age-matched control and p = 0.83 compared to NR adult; Figures 4A and 4B ). The enrichment also accelerated the maturation of monocular orientation selectivity in simple cells, with their OSI significantly greater than in the age-matched NR animals for both contralateral (EE: mean OSI = 0.78 ± 0.03, n = 78; NR: mean OSI = 0.66 ± 0.04, n = 69; p < 0.05) and ipsilateral (EE: mean OSI = 0.72 ± 0.03, n = 78; NR: mean OSI = 0.57 ± 0.04, n = 69, p < 0.05; Figures S2 and S3) eyes.

It is generally assumed that the corticosterone response of animals to capture and handling reflects the corticosterone response to stimuli such as the sight of a predator that are thought to be natural stressors. Fijian ground frogs (Platymantis vitiana) are preyed upon by the introduced cane toads (Rhinella marina), and we used ground frogs to test the hypothesis that the sight of a predator will induce a corticosterone stress response in an amphibian. Urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations increased in male ground frogs exposed to the sight of a toad for 1, 3 or 6 h, whereas corticosterone did not change in frogs exposed to another male ground frog, a ball, or when no stimulus was present in the test compartment. The frogs exposed to a toad initially moved towards the stimulus then moved away, whereas frogs exposed to another frog moved towards the test frog and remained closer to the frog than at the start of the test. Tonic immobility (TI) was measured as an index of fearfulness immediately after the test exposure of the frogs to a stimulus. The duration of TI was longer in frogs exposed to a toad than to another frog or to a ball. The results provide novel evidence that the sight of a predator can induce a corticosterone response and lead to increased fearfulness in amphibians. In addition, they show that endemic frogs can recognise an introduced predator as a threat."
https://openalex.org/W2006015502,"Adequate pain sensitivity requires a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This balance is severely impaired in neuropathy leading to enhanced pain sensations (hyperalgesia). The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we explored the hypothesis that the excitatory drive to spinal GABAergic neurons might be impaired in neuropathic animals. Transgenic adult mice expressing EGFP under the promoter for GAD67 underwent either chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve or sham surgery. In transverse slices from lumbar spinal cord we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from identified GABAergic neurons in lamina II. In neuropathic animals rates of mEPSC were reduced indicating diminished global excitatory input. This downregulation of excitatory drive required a rise in postsynaptic Ca(2+). Neither the density and morphology of dendritic spines on GABAergic neurons nor the number of excitatory synapses contacting GABAergic neurons were affected by neuropathy. In contrast, paired-pulse ratio of Aδ- or C-fiber-evoked monosynaptic EPSCs following dorsal root stimulation was increased in neuropathic animals suggesting reduced neurotransmitter release from primary afferents. Our data indicate that peripheral neuropathy triggers Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways in spinal GABAergic neurons. This leads to a global downregulation of the excitatory drive to GABAergic neurons. The downregulation involves a presynaptic mechanism and also applies to the excitation of GABAergic neurons by presumably nociceptive Aδ- and C-fibers. This then leads to an inadequately low recruitment of inhibitory interneurons during nociception. We suggest that this previously unrecognized mechanism of impaired spinal inhibition contributes to hyperalgesia in neuropathy."

We pilot-tested a real-time intervention for promoting behavior change in homes that reduces second hand tobacco smoke (SHS) levels. The intervention uses a monitor and feedback system to provide immediate auditory and visual signals triggered at defined thresholds of fine particle concentration. Dynamic graphs of real-time particle levels are also shown on a computer screen. We experimentally evaluated the system, field-tested it in homes with smokers, and conducted focus groups to obtain general opinions. Laboratory tests of the monitor demonstrated SHS sensitivity, stability, precision equivalent to at least 1 µg/m(3), and low noise. A linear relationship (R(2) = 0.98) was observed between the monitor and average SHS mass concentrations up to 150 µg/m(3). Focus groups and interviews with intervention participants showed in-home use to be acceptable and feasible. The intervention was evaluated in 3 homes with combined baseline and intervention periods lasting 9 to 15 full days. Two families modified their behavior by opening windows or doors, smoking outdoors, or smoking less. We observed evidence of lower SHS levels in these homes. The remaining household voiced reluctance to changing their smoking activity and did not exhibit lower SHS levels in main smoking areas or clear behavior change; however, family members expressed receptivity to smoking outdoors. This study established the feasibility of the real-time intervention, laying the groundwork for controlled trials with larger sample sizes. Visual and auditory cues may prompt family members to take immediate action to reduce SHS levels. Dynamic graphs of SHS levels may help families make decisions about specific mitigation approaches."

Here, to investigate the cortical contributions to exploratory behavior, we analyzed single-neuron activity recorded from four different cortical areas of monkeys performing a matching-pennies task and a visual search task, which encouraged and discouraged exploration, respectively. We found that neurons in multiple regions in the frontal and parietal cortex tended to encode signals related to previously rewarded actions more reliably than unrewarded actions. In addition, signals for rewarded choices in the supplementary eye field were attenuated during the visual search task and were correlated with the tendency to switch choices during the matching-pennies task. These results suggest that the supplementary eye field might play a unique role in encouraging animals to explore alternative decision-making strategies."

The aim of this study was to determine the effects and the underlying mechanisms of SM934 in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods Female C57BL/6 mice immunized with MOG35–55 were treated with or without SM934, then the clinical scores and other relevant parameters were assessed. Th1, Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cell profiles were determined through ELISA, qRT-PCR, flow cytometry and BrdU incorporation assay. The effects of SM934 on Th1, Th17 and Treg cells differentiation were explored through intracellular staining and flow cytometry examination. Results In vivo, administration of SM934 significantly inhibited the development of EAE and suppressed the elevation of serum IL-17. Ex vivo, upon antigen-recall stimulation, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-17 and IL-6 production were decreased, whereas IL-10 and TGF-β production were increased from the splenocytes isolated from SM934-treated mice. Consistently, both flow cytometry and qRT-PCR results showed that SM934 treatment significantly increased the Treg, while strongly suppressed the Th17 and Th1, responses in the peripheral. Furthermore, in the spinal lesion, SM934 treatment dramatically decreased the infiltration of CD4+ T cells, within which the Treg cells percentage was enlarged, whereas the Th17, but not Th1 percentage, was significantly decreased comparing with the vehicle-treated groups. Finally, both BrdU incorporation and in vitro Treg differentiation assays revealed that SM934 treatment could directly promote the expansion of Treg cells in vivo and in vitro. Conclusion Taken together, this study demonstrated that SM934 treatment could ameliorate the murine EAE disease, which might be mediated by inducing Treg differentiation and expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2016775256,"Although protein quality control (PQC) is generally perceived as important for the development of the nervous system, the specific mechanisms of neuronal PQC have remained poorly understood. Here, we report that C. elegans Elongin BC-binding axon regulator (EBAX-1), a conserved BC-box protein, regulates axon guidance through PQC of the SAX-3/Robo receptor. EBAX-1 buffers guidance errors against temperature variations. As a substrate-recognition subunit in the Elongin BC-containing Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL), EBAX-1 also binds to DAF-21, a cytosolic Hsp90 chaperone. The EBAX-type CRL and DAF-21 collaboratively regulate SAX-3-mediated axon pathfinding. Biochemical and imaging assays indicate that EBAX-1 specifically recognizes misfolded SAX-3 and promotes its degradation in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, vertebrate EBAX also shows substrate preference toward aberrant Robo3 implicated in horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS). Together, our findings demonstrate a triage PQC mechanism mediated by the EBAX-type CRL and DAF-21/Hsp90 that maintains the accuracy of neuronal wiring."
https://openalex.org/W2013913094,"Wnt signaling is involved in many aspects of development and in the homeostasis of stem cells. Its importance is underscored by the fact that misregulation of Wnt signaling has been implicated in numerous diseases, especially colorectal cancer. However, how Wnt signaling regulates itself is not well understood. There are several Wnt negative feedback regulators, which are active antagonists of Wnt signaling, but one feedback regulator, Nkd1, has reduced activity compared to other antagonists, yet is still a negative feedback regulator. Here we describe our efforts to understand the role of Nkd1 using Wnt signaling compromised zebrafish mutant lines. In several of these lines, Nkd1 function was not any more active than it was in wild type embryos. However, we found that Nkd1's ability to antagonize canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling was enhanced in the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity mutants silberblick (slb/wnt11) and trilobite (tri/vangl2). While slb and tri mutants do not display alterations in canonical Wnt signaling, we found that they are hypersensitive to it. Overexpression of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin ligand Wnt8a in slb or tri mutants resulted in dorsalized embryos, with tri mutants being much more sensitive to Wnt8a than slb mutants. Furthermore, the hyperdorsalization caused by Wnt8a in tri could be rescued by Nkd1. These results suggest that Nkd1 functions as a passive antagonist of Wnt signaling, functioning only when homeostatic levels of Wnt signaling have been breached or when Wnt signaling becomes destabilized."
https://openalex.org/W2152053863,"Though widely employed for clinical intervention in obesity, metabolic syndrome, seizure disorders and other neurodegenerative diseases, the mechanisms through which low carbohydrate ketogenic diets exert their ameliorative effects still remain to be elucidated. Rodent models have been used to identify the metabolic and physiologic alterations provoked by ketogenic diets. A commonly used rodent ketogenic diet (Bio-Serv F3666) that is very high in fat (~94% kcal), very low in carbohydrate (~1% kcal), low in protein (~5% kcal), and choline restricted (~300 mg/kg) provokes robust ketosis and weight loss in mice, but through unknown mechanisms, also causes significant hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and cellular injury. To understand the independent and synergistic roles of protein restriction and choline deficiency on the pleiotropic effects of rodent ketogenic diets, we studied four custom diets that differ only in protein (5% kcal vs. 10% kcal) and choline contents (300 mg/kg vs. 5 g/kg). C57BL/6J mice maintained on the two 5% kcal protein diets induced the most significant ketoses, which was only partially diminished by choline replacement. Choline restriction in the setting of 10% kcal protein also caused moderate ketosis and hepatic fat accumulation, which were again attenuated when choline was replete. Key effects of the 5% kcal protein diet – weight loss, hepatic fat accumulation, and mitochondrial ultrastructural disarray and bioenergetic dysfunction – were mitigated by choline repletion. These studies indicate that synergistic effects of protein restriction and choline deficiency influence integrated metabolism and hepatic pathology in mice when nutritional fat content is very high, and support the consideration of dietary choline content in ketogenic diet studies in rodents to limit hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and fat accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2057155738,"Experimental and clinical experiences highlight the need to review some aspects of islet transplantation, especially with regard to site of grafting and control of the immune response. The subcutaneous space could be a good alternative to liver but its sparse vasculature is its main limitation. Induction of graft tolerance by using cells with immunoregulatory properties is a promising approach to avoid graft rejection. Both Fibroblasts and Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have shown pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory properties. Transplantation of islets into the subcutaneous space using plasma as scaffold and supplemented with fibroblasts and/or Bone Marrow-MSCs could be a promising strategy to achieve a functional extra-hepatic islet graft, without using immunosuppressive drugs. Xenogenic rat islets, autologous fibroblasts and/or allogenic BM-MSCs, were mixed with plasma, and coagulation was induced to constitute a Plasma-based Scaffold containing Islets (PSI), which was transplanted subcutaneously both in immunodeficient and immunocompetent diabetic mice. In immunodeficient diabetic mice, PSI itself allowed hyperglycemia reversion temporarily, but the presence of pro-angiogenic cells (fibroblasts or BM-MSCs) within PSI was necessary to improve graft re-vascularization and, thus, consistently maintain normoglycemia. In immunocompetent diabetic mice, only PSI containing BM-MSCs, but not those containing fibroblasts, normalized glycemia lasting up to one week after transplantation. Interestingly, when PSI contained both fibroblasts and BM-MSCs, the normoglycemia period showed an increase of 4-times with a physiological-like response in functional tests. Histology of immunocompetent mice showed an attenuation of the immune response in those grafts with BM-MSCs, which was improved by co-transplantation with fibroblasts, since they increased BM-MSC survival. In summary, fibroblasts and BM-MSCs showed similar pro-angiogenic properties in this model of islet xenotransplantation, whereas only BM-MSCs exerted an immunomodulatory effect, which was improved by the presence of fibroblasts. These results suggest that cooperation of different cell types with islets will be required to achieve a long-term functional graft."
https://openalex.org/W2033843688,"Flavonoids have been reported to inhibit tumor growth by causing cell cycle arrest. However, little is known about the direct targets of flavonoids in tumor growth inhibition. In the present study, we developed a novel method using magnetic FG beads to purify flavonoid-binding proteins, and identified ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9) as a binding partner of the flavonoid apigenin. Similar to treatment with apigenin, knockdown of RPS9 inhibited the growth of human colon cancer cells at the G2/M phase by downregulating cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) expression at the promoter level. Furthermore, knockdown of RPS9 suppressed G2/M arrest caused by apigenin. These results suggest that apigenin induces G2/M arrest at least partially by directly binding and inhibiting RPS9 which enhances CDK1 expression. We therefore raise the possibility that identification of the direct targets of flavonoids may contribute to the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms governing tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2003783955,"Previous investigations into the factors associated with house loss in wildfires have focused on the house construction and its immediate environment (e.g. gardens). Here, we examine how nearby native forest and other houses can influence house loss. Specifically, we used a sample of 3500 houses affected by the Victorian bushfires of February 7th 2009 to explore how the amount of forest, proportion of forest burned by crown fire and the number of nearby houses affected house loss and how far from the house this influence was exerted. These fires were the most destructive in Australian history and so represent the extreme of fire risk. Using generalized linear modeling we found that the probability of house loss increased with forest extent and the proportion burnt by crown fire and this relationship was strongest for forest measured 1 km from the houses. Houses were more likely to be destroyed if there were other houses within 50 m and if they were on a slope. A model containing these variables predicted house loss with 72% accuracy. Our findings have three important implications: i) management to change the occurrence of crown fire will be effective in reducing house loss; ii) this management may be required up to 1 km away from houses in some situations (a much larger zone than is currently used); iii) high density of houses may increase risk of loss. Given the potentially large width of this management zone and the hazard from nearby houses, it may be more sensible to concentrate on modification of buildings to reduce their vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2107754129,The present study investigates the relationship between inter-individual differences in fearful face recognition and amygdala volume. Thirty normal adults were recruited and each completed two identical facial expression recognition tests offline and two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Linear regression indicated that the left amygdala volume negatively correlated with the accuracy of recognizing fearful facial expressions and positively correlated with the probability of misrecognizing fear as surprise. Further exploratory analyses revealed that this relationship did not exist for any other subcortical or cortical regions. Nor did such a relationship exist between the left amygdala volume and performance recognizing the other five facial expressions. These mind-brain associations highlight the importance of the amygdala in recognizing fearful faces and provide insights regarding inter-individual differences in sensitivity toward fear-relevant stimuli.
https://openalex.org/W2042949070,"Helicobacter pylori is a major pathogen associated with the development of gastroduodenal diseases. It has been reported that H. pylori induced pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1B is one of the various modulators of acid secretion in the gut. Earlier we reported that IL1B-activated NFkB down-regulates gastrin, the major hormonal regulator of acid secretion. In this study, the probable pathway by which IL1B induces NFkB and affects gastrin expression has been elucidated. IL1B-treated AGS cells showed nine-fold activation of MyD88 followed by phosphorylation of TAK1 within 15 min of IL1B treatment. Furthermore, it was observed that activated TAK1 significantly up-regulates the NFkB subunits p50 and p65. Ectopic expression of NFkB p65 in AGS cells resulted in about nine-fold transcriptional repression of gastrin both in the presence and absence of IL1B. The S536A mutant of NFkB p65 is significantly less effective in repressing gastrin. These observations show that a functional NFkB p65 is important for IL1B-mediated repression of gastrin. ChIP assays revealed the presence of HDAC1 and NFkB p65 along with NCoR on the gastrin promoter. Thus, the study provides mechanistic insight into the IL1B-mediated gastrin repression via NFkB."
https://openalex.org/W2067880990,"Lutein is selectively taken up by the primate retina and plays an important role as a filter for harmful blue light and as an antioxidant. Recent studies have shown that lutein has systemic anti-inflammatory properties. Dietary lutein has been associated with reduced circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP and sICAM. Whether lutein also affects activation of the complement system has not yet been addressed and was the purpose of the study described here. Seventy-two subjects with signs of early macular degeneration were randomly assigned to receive either a 10 mg lutein supplement or a placebo during one year. EDTA blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months. Complement factor D (CFD), a rate limiting component of the alternative pathway of complement activation and the complement activation products C5a and C3d were determined in the plasma samples by ELISA. A significant 0.11 µg/ml monthly decrease in plasma CFD concentration was observed in the lutein group (p<0.001), resulting in a 51% decrease from 2.3 µg/ml at baseline to 1.0 µg/ml at 12 months. The C5a concentration showed a significant 0.063ng/ml monthly decrease in the lutein group (p<0.001) resulting in a 36% decrease from 2.2ng/ml at baseline to 1.6ng/ml at 12 months. The C3d concentration showed a significant 0.19µg/ml monthly decrease in the lutein group (p=0.004) that gave rise to a 9% decrease from 15.4µg/ml at baseline to 14.4µg/ml at 12 months. In the placebo group we found a significant 0.04 µg/ml monthly decrease in plasma CFD concentration, whereas no changes were observed for C5a and C3d. Lutein supplementation markedly decreases circulating levels of the complement factors CFD, C5a and C3d levels, which might allow a simple method to control this inflammatory pathway of the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1972464895,"Introduction Much research on the health and well-being of third level students is focused on poor mental health leading to a dearth of information on positive mental health and well-being. Recently, the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being scale (WEMWBS) was developed as a measurement of positive mental health and well-being. The aim of this research is to investigate the distribution and determinants of positive mental health and well-being in a large, broadly representative sample of third level students using WEMWBS. Methods Undergraduate students from one large third level institution were sampled using probability proportional to size sampling. Questionnaires were distributed to students attending lectures in the randomly selected degrees. A total of 2,332 self-completed questionnaires were obtained, yielding a response rate of 51% based on students registered to relevant modules and 84% based on attendance. One-way ANOVAs and multivariate logistic regression were utilised to investigate factors associated with positive mental health and well-being. Results The sample was predominantly female (62.66%), in first year (46.9%) and living in their parents’ house (42.4%) or in a rented house or flat (40.8%). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age and stratified by gender, no significant differences in WEMWBS score were observed by area of study, alcohol, smoking or drug use. WEMWBS scores were higher among male students with low levels of physical activity (p=0.04). Men and women reporting one or more sexual partners (p<0.001) were also more likely to report above average mental health and well-being. Conclusion This is the first study to examine positive mental health and well-being scores in a third level student sample using WEMWBS. The findings suggest that students with a relatively adverse health and lifestyle profile have higher than average mental health and well-being. To confirm these results, this work needs to be replicated across other third level institutions."

https://openalex.org/W2060752782,"Humans have evolved strong preferences for equity and fairness. Neuroimaging studies suggest that punishing unfairness is associated with the activation of a neural network comprising the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, the ventral striatum, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Here, we report the neuronal correlates of retribution and “forgiveness” in a scenario, in which individuals first acted as a recipient in an Ultimatum Game, and subsequently assumed the position of a proposer in a Dictator Game played against the same opponents as in the Ultimatum Game. Most subjects responded in a tit-for-tat fashion, which was accompanied by activation of the ventral striatum, corroborating previous findings that punishing unfair behaviour has a rewarding connotation. Subjects distinguished between the human opponent and computer condition by activation of the ventromedial PFC in the human condition, indicative of mentalising. A substantial number of subjects did not retaliate. Neurally, this “forgiveness” behaviour was associated with the activation of the right (and to a lesser degree left) DLPFC, a region that serves as a cognitive control region and thus may be involved in inhibiting emotional responses against unfairness."
https://openalex.org/W1973188805,"The lung is, more than other solid organs, susceptible for ischemia reperfusion injury after orthotopic transplantation. Corticosteroids are known to potently suppress pro-inflammatory processes when given in the post-operative setting or during rejection episodes. Whereas their use has been approved for these clinical indications, there is no study investigating its potential as a preservation additive in preventing vascular damage already in the phase of ischemia. To investigate these effects we performed orthotopic lung transplantations (LTX) in the rat. Prednisolone was either added to the perfusion solution for lung preservation or omitted and rats were followed for 48 hours after LTX. Prednisolone preconditioning significantly increased survival and diminished reperfusion edema. Hypoxia induced vasoactive cytokines such as VEGF were reduced. Markers of leukocyte invasiveness like matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, or common pro-inflammatory molecules like the CXCR4 receptor or the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)-2 were downregulated by prednisolone. Neutrophil recruitment to the grafts was only increased in Perfadex treated lungs. Together with this, prednisolone treated animals displayed significantly reduced lung protein levels of neutrophil chemoattractants like CINC-1, CINC-2α/β and LIX and upregulated tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1. Interestingly, lung macrophage invasion was increased in both, Perfadex and prednisolone treated grafts, as measured by MMP-12 or RM4. Markers of anti-inflammatory macrophage transdifferentiation like MRC-1, IL-13, IL-4 and CD163, significantly correlated with prednisolone treatment. These observations lead to the conclusion that prednisolone as an additive to the perfusion solution protects from hypoxia triggered danger signals already in the phase of ischemia and thus reduces graft edema in the phase of reperfusion. Additionally, prednisolone preconditioning might also lead to macrophage polarization as a beneficial long-term effect."

This study used qualitative methods to assess women's perceptions of male circumcision in Iringa, Tanzania. Women in this study had strong preferences for circumcised men because of the low risk perception of HIV with circumcised men, social norms favoring circumcised men, and perceived increased sexual desirability of circumcised men. The health benefits of male circumcision were generally overstated; many respondents falsely believed that women are also directly protected against HIV and that the risk of all STIs is greatly reduced or eliminated in circumcised men. Efforts to engage women about the risks and limitations of male circumcision, in addition to the benefits, should be expanded so that women can accurately assess their risk of HIV or STIs during sexual intercourse with circumcised men."

Elevation data were fitted to a general quadratic model that considered both translational and rotational displacements. Comparisons between fellow corneas of estimates of corneal shape parameters (elevation, radius in two main directions, Rx and Ry, and corresponding shape factors, Qx and Qy) and corneal position parameters (translational displacements: x0, y0 and z0, and rotational displacements: α, β and γ) were statistically analyzed.The general quadratic model provided average RMS of fit errors with the topography data of 1.7±0.6 µm and 5.7±1.3 µm in anterior and posterior corneal surfaces. The comparisons showed highly significant bilateral correlations with the differences between fellow corneas in Rx, Ry, Qx and Qy of anterior and posterior surfaces remaining insignificantly different from zero. Bilateral differences in elevation measurements at randomly-selected points in both corneal central and peripheral areas indicated strong mirror symmetry between fellow corneas. The mean geometric center (x0, y0, z0) of both right and left corneas was located on the temporal side and inferior-temporal side of the apex in anterior and posterior topography map, respectively. Rotational displacement angle α along X axis had similar distributions in bilateral corneas, while rotation angle β along Y axis showed both eyes tilting towards the nasal side. Further, rotation angle γ along Z axis, which is related to corneal astigmatism, showed clear mirror symmetry.Analysis of corneal topography demonstrated strong and statistically-significant mirror symmetry between bilateral corneas. This characteristic could help in detection of pathological abnormalities, disease diagnosis, measurement validation and surgery planning."

We investigated, for the first time in a UK-wide cohort, longitudinal employment status, and its association with deprivation, disease severity, and time in hospital.We did a longitudinal registry study of adults with CF in the UK aged 20 to 40 (3458 people with 15,572 observations between 1996 and 2010), using mixed effects models.Around 50% of adults with CF were in employment. Male sex, higher lung function and body mass index, and less time in hospital were associated with improved employment chances. All other things being equal, being in the most deprived quintile was associated with a reduction of employment prevalence of 17.6 percentage points compared to the prevalence in the least deprived quintile. Having poor lung function was associated with a reduced employment prevalence of 7.2 percentage points compared to the prevalence for people with relatively good lung function. Acting synergistically, deprivation modifies the effect of lung function on employment chances - poor lung function in the least deprived group was associated with a 3 percentage point reduction in employment chances, while poor lung function in the most deprived quintile was associated with a 7.7 point reduction in employment chances.Greater deprivation, disease severity, and time in hospital are all associated with employment chances in adults with CF. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that deprivation amplifies the harmful association of disease severity on employment. Future studies should focus on understanding and mitigating the barriers to employment faced by people with CF."
https://openalex.org/W2072601713,"The parallel βhelix is a common fold among extracellular proteins, however its mechanical properties remain unexplored. In Gram-negative bacteria, extracellular proteins of diverse functions of the large ‘TpsA’ family all fold into long βhelices. Here, single-molecule atomic force microscopy and steered molecular dynamics simulations were combined to investigate the mechanical properties of a prototypic TpsA protein, FHA, the major adhesin of Bordetella pertussis. Strong extension forces were required to fully unfold this highly repetitive protein, and unfolding occurred along a stepwise, hierarchical process. Our analyses showed that the extremities of the βhelix unfold early, while central regions of the helix are more resistant to mechanical unfolding. In particular, a mechanically resistant subdomain conserved among TpsA proteins and critical for secretion was identified. This nucleus harbors structural elements packed against the βhelix that might contribute to stabilizing the N-terminal region of FHA. Hierarchical unfolding of the βhelix in response to a mechanical stress may maintain β-helical portions that can serve as templates for regaining the native structure after stress. The mechanical properties uncovered here might apply to many proteins with β-helical or related folds, both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes, and play key roles in their structural integrity and functions."
https://openalex.org/W2096000860,"Predator depletion on Cape Cod (USA) has released the herbivorous crab Sesarma reticulatum from predator control leading to the loss of cordgrass from salt marsh creek banks. After more than three decades of die-off, cordgrass is recovering at heavily damaged sites coincident with the invasion of green crabs (Carcinus maenas) into intertidal Sesarma burrows. We hypothesized that Carcinus is dependent on Sesarma burrows for refuge from physical and biotic stress in the salt marsh intertidal and reduces Sesarma functional density and herbivory through consumptive and non-consumptive effects, mediated by both visual and olfactory cues. Our results reveal that in the intertidal zone of New England salt marshes, Carcinus are burrow dependent, Carcinus reduce Sesarma functional density and herbivory in die-off areas and Sesarma exhibit a generic avoidance response to large, predatory crustaceans. These results support recent suggestions that invasive Carcinus are playing a role in the recovery of New England salt marshes and assertions that invasive species can play positive roles outside of their native ranges."
https://openalex.org/W2155552591,"Whilst gonadal hormones can substantially influence sexual differentiation of the brain, recent findings have suggested that sex-linked genes may also directly influence neurodevelopment. Here we used the well-established murine 'four core genotype' (FCG) model on a gonadally-intact, outbred genetic background to characterise the contribution of Sry-dependent effects (i.e. those arising from the expression of the Y-linked Sry gene in the brain, or from hormonal sequelae of gonadal Sry expression) and direct effects of sex-linked genes other than Sry ('sex chromosome complement' effects) to sexually dimorphic mouse behavioural phenotypes. Over a 24 hour period, XX and XY gonadally female mice (lacking Sry) exhibited greater horizontal locomotor activity and reduced food consumption per unit bodyweight than XX and XY gonadally male mice (possessing Sry); in two behavioural tests (the elevated plus and zero mazes) XX and XY gonadally female mice showed evidence for increased anxiety-related behaviours relative to XX and XY gonadally male mice. Exploratory correlational analyses indicated that these Sry-dependent effects could not be simply explained by brain expression of the gene, nor by circulating testosterone levels. We also noted a sex chromosome complement effect on food (but not water) consumption whereby XY mice consumed more over a 24hr period than XX mice, and a sex chromosome complement effect in a third test of anxiety-related behaviour, the light-dark box. The present data suggest that: i) the male-specific factor Sry may influence activity and feeding behaviours in mice, and ii) dissociable feeding and anxiety-related murine phenotypes may be differentially modulated by Sry and by other sex-linked genes. Our results may have relevance for understanding the molecular underpinnings of sexually dimorphic behavioural phenotypes in healthy men and women, and in individuals with abnormal sex chromosome constitutions."
https://openalex.org/W2014551118,"To evaluate the conservation status of a species or population it is necessary to gain insight into its ecological requirements, reproduction, genetic population structure, and overall genetic diversity. In our study we examined the genetic diversity of Rhinopithecus brelichi by analyzing microsatellite data and compared them with already existing data derived from mitochondrial DNA, which revealed that R. brelichi exhibits the lowest mitochondrial diversity of all so far studied Rhinopithecus species. In contrast, the genetic diversity of nuclear DNA is high and comparable to other Rhinopithecus species, i.e. the examined microsatellite loci are similarly highly polymorphic as in other species of the genus. An explanation for these differences in mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity could be a male biased dispersal. Females most likely stay within their natal band and males migrate between bands, thus mitochondrial DNA will not be exchanged between bands but nuclear DNA via males. A Bayesian Skyline Plot based on mitochondrial DNA sequences shows a strong decrease of the female effective population size (Nef) starting about 3,500 to 4,000 years ago, which concurs with the increasing human population in the area and respective expansion of agriculture. Given that we found no indication for a loss of nuclear DNA diversity in R. brelichi it seems that this factor does not represent the most prominent conservation threat for the long-term survival of the species. Conservation efforts should therefore focus more on immediate threats such as development of tourism and habitat destruction."

The present electrophysiological study was conducted to determine the mechanisms which modulated the performances in inter- and intramodal conditions. Participants were asked to categorise as short or long empty intervals marked by auditory (A) and/or visual (V) signals (intramodal intervals: AA, VV; intermodal intervals: AV, VA). Behavioural data revealed that the performances were higher for the AA intervals than for the three other intervals and lower for inter- compared to intramodal intervals. Electrophysiological results indicated that the CNV amplitude recorded at fronto-central electrodes increased significantly until the end of the presentation of the long intervals in the AA conditions, while no significant change in the time course of this component was observed for the other three modalities of presentation. They also indicated that the N1 and P2 amplitudes recorded after the presentation of the signals which delimited the beginning of the intervals were higher for the inter- (AV/VA) compared to the intramodal intervals (AA/VV). The time course of the CNV revealed that the high performances observed with AA intervals would be related to the effectiveness of the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of the ongoing interval. The greater amplitude of the N1 and P2 components during the intermodal intervals suggests that the weak performances observed in these conditions would be caused by an attentional bias induced by the cognitive load and the necessity to switch between modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2166494705,"The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is an established animal model of ADHD. It has been suggested that ADHD symptoms arise from deficits in executive functions such as working memory, attentional control and decision making. Both ADHD patients and SHRs show deficits in spatial working memory. However, the data on spatial working memory deficits in SHRs are not consistent. It has been suggested that the reported cognitive deficits of SHRs may be related to the SHRs’ locomotor activity. We have used a holeboard (COGITAT) to study both cognition and activity in order to evaluate the influence of the activity on the cognitive performance of SHRs. In comparison to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, SHRs did not have any impairment in spatial working memory and reference memory. When the rats’ locomotor activity was taken into account, the SHRs’ working memory and reference memory were significantly better than in WKY rats. The locomotor activity appears to be a confounding factor in spatial memory tasks and should therefore be controlled for in future studies. In the SHR model of ADHD, we were unable to demonstrate an impairment of working memory which has been reported in patients with ADHD."

Understanding these complex interactions is of great interest from both a scientific and a clinical perspective. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to study brain functional networks during voluntary saliva swallowing in twenty-two adult healthy subjects (all females, years of age). To construct these functional connections, we computed mean partial correlation matrices over ninety brain regions for each participant. Two regions were determined to be functionally connected if their correlation was above a certain threshold. These correlation matrices were then analyzed using graph-theoretical approaches. In particular, we considered several network measures for the whole brain and for swallowing-related brain regions. The results have shown that significant pairwise functional connections were, mostly, either local and intra-hemispheric or symmetrically inter-hemispheric. Furthermore, we showed that all human brain functional network, although varying in some degree, had typical small-world properties as compared to regular networks and random networks. These properties allow information transfer within the network at a relatively high efficiency. Swallowing-related brain regions also had higher values for some of the network measures in comparison to when these measures were calculated for the whole brain. The current results warrant further investigation of graph-theoretical approaches as a potential tool for understanding the neural basis of dysphagia."
https://openalex.org/W2086450056,"NK cells rapidly kill tumor cells, virus infected cells and even self cells. This is mediated via killer receptors, among which NKp46 (NCR1 in mice) is prominent. We have recently demonstrated that in type 1 diabetes (T1D) NK cells accumulate in the diseased pancreas and that they manifest a hyporesponsive phenotype. In addition, we found that NKp46 recognizes an unknown ligand expressed by beta cells derived from humans and mice and that blocking of NKp46 activity prevented diabetes development. Here we investigated the properties of the unknown NKp46 ligand. We show that the NKp46 ligand is mainly located in insulin granules and that it is constitutively secreted. Following glucose stimulation the NKp46 ligand translocates to the cell membrane and its secretion decreases. We further demonstrate by using several modalities that the unknown NKp46 ligand is not insulin. Finally, we studied the expression of the NKp46 ligand in type 2 diabetes (T2D) using 3 different in vivo models and 2 species; mice and gerbils. We demonstrate that the expression of the NKp46 ligand is decreased in all models of T2D studied, suggesting that NKp46 is not involved in T2D."

Although, CoM shows lower wear rates than MoM, in-vitro wear testing of CoM shows widely varying results. This may be related to limitations of wear-measuring methods. Therefore, the aim of this study was to improve the gravimetric measurement technique and to test wear behaviour of CoM bearings compared to CoC bearings. Level walking according to ISO-14242 was simulated for four CoM and four CoC bearings. Prior to simulation, errors in measurement of gravimetric wear were detected and improvements in measurement technique incorporated. The results showed no differences in mean wear rates between CoM and CoC bearings. However, the CoM bearings showed wear results over a wide range of wear performance. High reliability of wear results was recorded for the CoC bearings. Material transfer was observed on the ceramic heads of the CoM bearings. Therefore, for level walking a partial mixed or boundary lubrication has to be assumed for this type of bearing. CoM is a highly sensitive wear-couple. The reasons for the observed behaviour cannot be clarified from this study. Simulator studies have to be considered as an ideal loading condition. Therefore, high variations in wear rates as seen in this study, even at low levels, may have an adverse effect on the in-vivo wear behavior. Careful clinical use may be advisable until the reasons for the variation are fully clarified and understood."
https://openalex.org/W2041022378,"The neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is an important regulator of immune cell activity within the immunosuppressive ocular microenvironment. Its constitutive presence not only suppresses macrophage inflammatory activity, it also participates in retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) mediated activation of macrophages to function similar to myeloid suppressor cells. In addition, α-MSH promotes survival of the alternatively activated macrophages where without α-MSH RPE induce apoptosis in the macrophages, which is seen as increased TUNEL stained cells. Since there is little know about α-MSH as an anti-apoptotic factor, the effects of α-MSH on caspase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, Bcl2 to BAX expression, along with TUNEL staining, and Annexin V binding were examined in RAW 264.7 macrophages under serum-starved conditions that trigger apoptosis. There was no effect of α-MSH on activated Caspase 9 and Caspase 3 while there was suppression of Caspase 8 activity. In addition, α-MSH did not improve mitochondrial membrane potential, change the ratio between Bcl-2 and BAX, nor reduce Annexin V binding. These results demonstrate that the diminution in TUNEL staining by α-MSH is through α-MSH mediating suppression of the apoptotic pathway that is post-Caspase 3, but before DNA fragmentation. Therefore, as α-MSH promotes the alternative activation of macrophages it also provides a survival signal, and the potential for the caspases to participate in non-apoptotic activities that can contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment."

https://openalex.org/W2090082681,"Data screening is an indispensable phase in initiating the scientific discovery process. Fractional factorial designs offer quick and economical options for engineering highly-dense structured datasets. Maximum information content is harvested when a selected fractional factorial scheme is driven to saturation while data gathering is suppressed to no replication. A novel multi-factorial profiler is presented that allows screening of saturated-unreplicated designs by decomposing the examined response to its constituent contributions. Partial effects are sliced off systematically from the investigated response to form individual contrasts using simple robust measures. By isolating each time the disturbance attributed solely to a single controlling factor, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank stochastics are employed to assign significance. We demonstrate that the proposed profiler possesses its own self-checking mechanism for detecting a potential influence due to fluctuations attributed to the remaining unexplainable error. Main benefits of the method are: 1) easy to grasp, 2) well-explained test-power properties, 3) distribution-free, 4) sparsity-free, 5) calibration-free, 6) simulation-free, 7) easy to implement, and 8) expanded usability to any type and size of multi-factorial screening designs.

https://openalex.org/W2049748364,"Biochemical and toxicological properties of catechin remain unclear, e.g.; how catechin affects female offspring from undernourished pregnant dams. Here, to elucidate effects of low prenatal protein on female offspring health status, changes of enzymes which modify epigenetic marks related with metabolism in kidneys from newborns were investigated after continuously administering catechin extracted from green tea to lactating maternal rats after pregnant undernourishment. We found that green tea extract intake during lactation up-regulated the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in young female offspring from protein-restricted dams and modulated the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway in the kidney. This pathway was indicated to be stimulated by SIRT1 gene expression. The feeding of green tea extract to protein-restricted dams during lactation is likely to up-regulate AMP-activated protein kinase activation and may partly lead to alterations of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway in female offspring kidneys. In addition, energy metabolism in fetal and offspring period with green tea extract administration might be related to enzymes which modify epigenetic marks such as DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3a."
https://openalex.org/W2147628975,"Recent studies employing speech stimuli to investigate 'cocktail-party' listening have focused on entrainment of cortical activity to modulations at syllabic (5 Hz) and phonemic (20 Hz) rates. The data suggest that cortical modulation filters (CMFs) are dependent on the sound-frequency channel in which modulations are conveyed, potentially underpinning a strategy for separating speech from background noise. Here, we characterize modulation filters in human listeners using a novel behavioral method. Within an 'inverted' adaptive forced-choice increment detection task, listening level was varied whilst contrast was held constant for ramped increments with effective modulation rates between 0.5 and 33 Hz. Our data suggest that modulation filters are tonotopically organized (i.e., vary along the primary, frequency-organized, dimension). This suggests that the human auditory system is optimized to track rapid (phonemic) modulations at high sound-frequencies and slow (prosodic/syllabic) modulations at low frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2019440160,"Pea aphids have an obligate nutritional symbiosis with the bacteria Buchneraaphidicola and frequently also harbor one or more facultative symbionts. Aphids are also susceptible to bacterial pathogen infections, and it has been suggested that aphids have a limited immune response towards such pathogen infections compared to other, more well-studied insects. However, aphids do possess at least some of the genes known to be involved in bacterial immune responses in other insects, and immune-competent hemocytes. One possibility is that immune priming with microbial elicitors could stimulate immune protection against subsequent bacterial infections, as has been observed in several other insect systems. To address this hypothesis we challenged aphids with bacterial immune elicitors twenty-four hours prior to live bacterial pathogen infections and then compared their survival rates to aphids that were not pre-exposed to bacterial signals. Using two aphid genotypes, we found no evidence for immune protection conferred by immune priming during infections with either Serratia marcescens or with Escherichia coli. Immune priming was not altered by the presence of facultative, beneficial symbionts in the aphids. In the absence of inducible immune protection, aphids may allocate energy towards other defense traits, including production of offspring with wings that could escape deteriorating conditions. To test this, we monitored the ratio of winged to unwinged offspring produced by adult mothers of a single clone that had been exposed to bacterial immune elicitors, to live E. coli infections or to no challenge. We found no correlation between immune challenge and winged offspring production, suggesting that this mechanism of defense, which functions upon exposure to fungal pathogens, is not central to aphid responses to bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2105874682,"Rock lobster growth is routinely measured for research to optimise management measures such as size limits and quotas. The process of estimating growth is complicated in crustaceans as growth only occurs when the animal moults. As data are typically collected by tag-recapture methods, the timing of moulting events can bias results. For example, if annual moulting events take place within a very short time-at-large after tagging, or if time-at-large is long and no moulting occurs. Classifying data into cases where moulting has / has not occurred during time-at-large can be required and can generally be determined by change in size between release and recapture. However, in old or slow growth individuals the moult increment can be too small to provide surety that moulting has occurred. A method that has been used since the 1970’s to determine moulting in rock lobsters involves clipping the distal portion of a pleopod so that any regeneration observed at recapture can be used as evidence of a moult. We examined the use of this method in both tank and long-duration field trials within a marine protected area, which provided access to large animals with smaller growth increments. Our results emphasised that determination of moulting by change in size was unreliable with larger lobsters and that pleopod clipping can assist in identifying moulting events. However, regeneration was an unreliable measure of moulting if clipping occurred less than three months before the moult."

We investigated the mechanisms of motion integration across apertures in two hemifields by presenting gratings through two rectangles (that form the dual barber poles) and recording the perceived direction of motion by human observers. To this end, we presented dual barber poles in conditions with various inter-component distances between the apertures and evaluated the degree to which the hemifield information was integrated by measuring the magnitude of the perceived barber pole illusion. Surprisingly, when the inter-component distance between the two apertures was short, the perceived direction of motion of the dual barber poles was similar to that of a single barber pole formed by the concatenation of the two component barber poles, indicating motion integration is achieved through a simple concatenation mechanism. We then presented dual barber poles in which the motion and contour properties of the two component barber poles differed to characterize the constraints underlying cross-hemifield integration. We found that integration is achieved only when phase, speed, wavelength, temporal frequency, and duty cycle are identical in the two barber poles, but can remain robust when the contrast of the two component barber poles differs substantially. We concluded that a motion stimulus presented in bilateral hemifields tends to be integrated to yield a global percept with a substantial tolerance for spatial distance and contrast difference."
