https://openalex.org/W1519219147,"Ethylene was produced when methional (β-methylthio-propionaldehyde) was incubated under aerobic conditions with milk xanthine oxidase plus xanthine. The accumulation of ethylene under these conditions exhibited a brief lag phase which was overcome by small amounts of hydrogen peroxide. The production of ethylene was inhibited by either superoxide dismutase or by catalase, indicating that both superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide were required. We have proposed that the hydroxyl radical is the chemical species actually responsible for the production of ethylene from methional and that hydroxyl radicals are generated in the aerobic xanthine oxidase system. This proposal generated several predictions which were experimentally affirmed. 1. Compounds which act as scavengers of hydroxyl radicals inhibited the production of ethylene. 2. Xanthine oxidase acting on limiting amounts of xanthine accumulated less than the theoretical amount of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide dismutase increased the amount of peroxide accumulated. 3. Xanthine oxidase plus ample xanthine reduced cytochrome c to a plateau representing a balance between the reduction of ferricytochrome c by O2- and the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by ·OH. Scavengers of the hydroxyl radical allowed more nearly complete reduction of cytochrome c. Catalase did likewise. 4. Xanthine oxidase exhibited a xanthine-dependent ferrocytochrome c peroxidase activity which was inhibited by catalase, superoxide dismutase, or by scavengers of the hydroxyl radical. These results have led to the conclusion that xanthine oxidase generates O2- and H2O2 as the primary products of the reduction of oxygen and generates ·OH as a secondary consequence of the interaction of O2- with H2O2 and that it is the hydroxyl radical rather than the superoxide anion radical which reacts with methional to generate ethylene."

https://openalex.org/W2093158883,"Retrograde amnesia for a passive avoidance response was produced in rats by electroconvulsive shock and in mice by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. One day after training the memory could be restored if a ""reminder"" of the original foot shock was given after the retention test on which the amnesia was demonstrated. Memory did not return if the reminder was given without the prior retention test or if the reminder and the test were separated by 23 hours."
https://openalex.org/W1598458336,"Abstract Fatty acid synthetase has been purified from lactating rat mammary gland and some of its physical and kinetic properties studied. This synthetase is an asymmetrical multienzyme complex of molecular weight 478,000 which readily dissociates into approximately half-molecular weight subunits. The sedimentation and diffusion coefficients of the native enzyme are 12.9 sec x 10-13 and 2.56 cm2 sec-1 x 10-7, respectively. The enzyme contains one 4'-phosphopantetheine residue and approximately 56 sulfhydryl groups per mole. Under optimum assay conditions, palmitic acid is the major product. With respect to size, shape, 4'-phosphopantetheine content, turnover number, and products of the reaction, the enzyme is very similar to the fatty acid synthetases purified from pigeon and rat liver. Studies of the kinetic properties, however, have revealed several differences in the Michaelis-Menten constants and inhibition and activation characteristics of the fatty acid synthetases from mammary gland and liver."
https://openalex.org/W1622131884,"Abstract Treatment of reduced carboxymethylated bovine pancreatic ribonuclease with 2 m hydroxylamine, pH 9.0, resulted in specific cleavage at the Asn-Gly bond (Residues 67 to 68). Cleavage also occurred to a minor extent at the Asn-Leu bond (Residues 34 to 35). It is proposed that cyclization of asparaginyl side chains, particularly in sequences in which asparagine is followed by glycine, leads to the formation of intrachain cyclic imides which are susceptible to nucleophilic attack by hydroxylamine. In certain instances such relatively specific nonenzymatic cleavage may be utilized as a method for the limited reproducible degradation of proteins. These studies, in conjunction with similar studies of collagen, show conclusively that the existence of hydroxylamine-sensitive bonds does not indicate the presence of ester or other non-peptide bonds in proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1527779582,"Abstract Pig heart citrate synthase has been estimated to have a molecular weight of 96,000 and a sedimentation coefficient of 6.2 S. The presence of two similar subunits is indicated by sedimentation equilibrium studies and viscosity measurements in 7.0 m guanidine containing 0.1 m mercaptoethanol. Further evidence for two similar subunits has been obtained from the number of peptides produced by tryptic digestion of the enzyme. The pure enzyme, specific activity of 180 units per mg of protein, has an absorbance index (E1 cm1% at 280 nm) of 17.8. The turnover number has been calculated to be 17,000 moles of citrate formed per min per mole of enzyme. The amino acid composition of this protein is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2041887181,The response of five species of crabs to simulated predator attack was examined. Two terrestrial species autotomized their chelipeds after the chelae were firmly attached to the predator. Selection for attack autotomy is balanced by selection for retention of the cheliped whenever the cheliped is important in social or maintenance functions.

https://openalex.org/W1606547290,"Abstract The rate of electron transfer between horse cytochrome c and Pseudomonas cytochrome c 551 has been examined by stopped flow spectrophotometry. Experiments were conducted at temperatures from 4.5 to 32.5° and ionic strengths from 0.03 to 0.32. The pH was maintained at 7.0 with 0.02 m potassium phosphate buffer. Comparative data were obtained for the reaction of cytochrome c with potassium ferricyanide under these conditions. Whereas the rate of the ferricyanide reaction varied with the ionic strength, but not the temperature, the reverse held true for the reaction between cytochrome c and cytochrome c 551. The latter process was insensitive to changes in the ionic strength, and exhibited an activation energy of 12 kcal per mole. The equilibrium constant was found to be 1 at all temperatures. At 4.5°, pH 7.0, and an ionic strength of 0.2, a second order rate constant of 1.57 ± 0.18 x 104 m-1 sec-1 was obtained. Although Pseudomonas cytochrome c 551 and horse cytochrome c differ markedly in primary structure, and are oppositely charged at neutral pH, the rate of electron transfer at 20° corresponds closely to that previously estimated from nuclear magnetic resonance data for the electron exchange reaction between horse ferri- and ferrocytochrome c at this temperature."

https://openalex.org/W2035308766,"Rats given a single electroconvulsive shock immediately after but not 60 seconds after an aversive conditioning trial exhibited behavioral retention deficits 24 hours later in a one-trial passive avoidance task. In contrast to these differential performance deficits, similar heart-rate changes, indicative of fear retention, were seen in punished animals irrespective of the time of delivery of the shock. These data suggest retention of a generalized fear to the training experience that was not revealed by the behavioral measure. The potential usefulness of concomitant behavioral and physiological response assessment in consolidation research is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2069693866,"Single waves of unilateral and bilateral cortical spreading depression were administered to rats by electrophoretic injection of potassium ions into the occipital cortices. Aggressive and stereotyped eating, drinking, and exploratory behavior were elicited by unilateral and bilateral spreading depression. Onset of the elicited behaviors varied among rats from 4 to 8 minutes after injection of the ions. Direct activation of, or rebound from, inhibition of subcortical motivational mechanisms may be responsible for the effects."

https://openalex.org/W1491732967,"Abstract Protamines are synthesized in the cytoplasm of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii) spermatid cells. Following a pulse of 14C-arginine, the majority of the labeled nascent protamine is found on diribosomes (disomes) sedimenting at 120 S (Ling, V., Trevithick, J. R., and Dixon, G. H., Can. J. Biochem., 47, 51 (1969)). Polysome profiles obtained at various times during testis maturation, which, in this species, takes place from September to December, show the appearance of high concentrations of such disomes during the period of rapid protamine synthesis. This effect is not observed in trout liver polysomes isolated under the same conditions, the polysome profiles being independent of the sexual maturation of the fish. Spermatid cell disomes are not disaggregated by lowering Mg++ concentration during isolation or by the addition of pancreatic ribonuclease. Pulse-chase experiments with 14C-arginine show that disomes are labeled more rapidly than heavier polysomes. The distribution of incorporated 14C-arginine and 14C-lysine through the polysome profiles changes markedly during the maturation of the testis; at the time of rapid protamine synthesis, the disomes incorporate arginine rapidly but lysine slowly, suggesting that they are largely engaged in protamine synthesis. Actinomycin D has an inhibitory effect on the incorporation of 14C-arginine into protamine only during the early protamine stage of development, suggesting that messenger RNA for protamine is synthesized before protamine synthesis takes place and is metabolically stable."
https://openalex.org/W2082130382,"Sixty mice received either shock or no shock in a shuttle box, or nonspecific stress in another apparatus. Brain and liver homogenates from these animals were then injected into 120 naive recipients, who were all tested in the shuttle box. Subjects receiving brain or liver from shocked or stressed donors had significantly higher latencies than control counterparts. These results are interpreted in terms of stress, rather than a memory transfer hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1533112940,"Abstract A number of carbohydrate-containing fragments were separated from a Pronase digest of bovine plasma amine oxidase-phenylhydrazone derivative by chromatography on Dowex 50-X2 and DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. The sequence of the carbohydrate moiety and the type of the linkage between amino acid and carbohydrate residue of the major component (GP-I-b) were studied by sequential hydrolysis of the carbohydrate with glycosidases and by hydrolysis with amidase. The rest of the glycopeptide components were isolated in low yields and have been difficult to purify. The composition of the major component indicated the presence of 1 residue of asparagine, 2 residues of N-acetylglucosamine, and 5 residues of mannose. A glycosylamine type linkage between asparagine and N-acetylglucosamine was proved by the hydrolysis of the major component (GP-I-b) with amidase. Three residues of mannose, 1 residue of N-acetylglucosamine, and 2 additional residues of mannose were released in that order when the major component (GP-I-b) was treated successively with jack bean α-mannosidase, jack bean β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and α-mannosidase. Based on these results, a tentative structure of the major component (GP-I-b) has been proposed."

As a result, there exists a tendency to dismiss almost offhandedly the entire concept of using material incentives to further contraceptive practice before any have been adequately tried. Moreover, a majority of proposals thus far have been characterized by a search to uncover the ""one best way"" to circumvent the myriad frustrations encountered in attempting to reduce birthrates in traditional societies."

https://openalex.org/W2095231266,"L5178Y lymphoma cells from DBA/2 mice grow well in vitro and the cytotoxicity of immune lymphoid cells can be assayed easily in terms of the degree to which they inhibit the growth of the lymphoma. Using this system we have already shown that sheep lymph cells, collected from the efferent ducts of individual lymph nodes that had been immunized with the lymphoma, displayed a powerful and immunologically specific cytotoxic action1. The cytotoxicity of the lymphoid cell population correlated with the percentage of large basophilic immunoblasts that were present and consequently an unequivocal cytotoxic action was only demonstrable between 4–7 days after immunization when large numbers of immunoblasts were present in the lymph. At later times the lymph was populated mainly with small lymphocytes and these cells, even when collected from hyperimmune sheep, were without demonstrable cytotoxic action in vitro. For these reasons it was concluded that the immunoblast was the cytotoxic cell. In these experiments the lymphoma cells were cultured in a medium containing 10 per cent heat-inactivated foetal calf serum."
https://openalex.org/W1544323086,"Abstract A derivative of pancreatic ribonuclease, in which the terminal α-NH2 has been converted to a hydroxyl group, has been prepared by treatment with nitrous acid. Comparative potentiometric titrations of this derivative and of unmodified RNase indicate the assignment at 25° of a pK of 7.3 to the α-NH2 of RNase. The Cu(II)-binding properties of RNase lacking the terminal α-NH2 have been compared with those of unmodified RNase by spectrophotometric and gel filtration binding studies. Analysis of gel filtration data obtained at pH 7 in 0.4 m acetate is most consistent with a weak cooperativity among the binding sites of both RNase and its deaminated derivative. Differences between the two proteins in these studies indicate that loss of the α-NH2 from RNase leads to loss of the strongest of its five Cu(II)-binding sites at pH 7. Spectrophotometric studies in the absence of acetate at pH 7 show that the 640 mµ absorption band of the 1:1 Cu(II)-RNase complex is diminished in intensity by 35% in the corresponding complex of deaminated RNase. Between pH 7 and pH 9, the net spectral contribution of the site lost by deamination shifts from 640 mµ to 540 mµ. The data support the thesis that the single strongest Cu(II)-binding site in RNase under these conditions contains the α-NH2 and its adjacent peptide bond nitrogen atoms. At pH 5.5, gel filtration and spectrophotometric differences between the deaminated derivative and RNase are of smaller magnitude than at pH 7 and indicate that the α-NH2 is one of the weaker Cu(II)-binding sites at this pH. Formation of the ternary complex involving Cu(II), RNase, and 3'CMP has been shown to be independent of the presence of the α-NH2 terminus."
