https://openalex.org/W2061954020,"A complementary DNA encoding a salicylic acid (SA)-binding protein has been cloned. Its properties suggest involvement in SA-mediated induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants. The sequence of the protein is similar to that of catalases and the protein exhibits catalase activity. Salicylic acid specifically inhibited the catalase activity in vitro and induced an increase in H2O2 concentrations in vivo. H2O2 or compounds, such as SA, that inhibit catalases or enhance the generation of H2O2, induced expression of defense-related genes associated with SAR. Thus, the action of SA in SAR is likely mediated by elevated amounts of H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W2038407368,"The key cell-cycle regulator Cdc2 belongs to a family of cyclin-dependent kinases in higher eukaryotes. Dominant-negative mutations were used to address the requirement for kinases of this family in progression through the human cell cycle. A dominant-negative Cdc2 mutant arrested cells at the G2 to M phase transition, whereas mutants of the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk3 caused a G1 block. The mutant phenotypes were specifically rescued by the corresponding wild-type kinases. These data reveal that Cdk3, in addition to Cdc2 and Cdk2, executes a distinct and essential function in the mammalian cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2080202616,"X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a form of hereditary neuropathy with demyelination. Recently, this disorder was mapped to chromosome Xq13.1. The gene for the gap junction protein connexin32 is located in the same chromosomal segment, which led to its consideration as a candidate gene for CMTX. With the use of Northern (RNA) blot and immunohistochemistry technique, it was found that connexin32 is normally expressed in myelinated peripheral nerve. Direct sequencing of the connexin32 gene showed seven different mutations in affected persons from eight CMTX families. These findings, a demonstration of inherited defects in a gap junction protein, suggest that connexin32 plays an important role in peripheral nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2084228983,"The interleukin-2 receptor γ chain (IL-2Rγ) is a necessary component of functional IL-2 receptors. IL-2Rγ mutations result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) in humans, a disease characterized by the presence of few or no T cells. In contrast, SCID patients with IL-2 deficiency and IL-2-deficient mice have normal numbers of T cells, suggesting that IL-2Rγ is part of more than one cytokine receptor. By using chemical cross-linking, IL-2Rγ was shown to be physically associated with the IL-7 receptor. The presence of IL-2Rγ augmented both IL-7 binding affinity and the efficiency of internalization of IL-7. These findings may help explain the defects of XSCID. Given its role in more than one cytokine receptor system, the common γ chain (gamma;c) is proposed as the designation for IL-2Rγ."
https://openalex.org/W1971500432,"The γ chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is an indispensable subunit for IL-2 binding and intracellular signal transduction. A monoclonal antibody to the γ chain, TUGm2, inhibited IL-2 binding to the functional IL-2 receptors and also inhibited IL-4-induced cell growth and the high-affinity binding of IL-4 to the CTLL-2 mouse T cell line. Another monoclonal antibody, TUGm3, which reacted with the γ chain cross-linked with IL-2, also immunoprecipitated the γ chain when cross-linked with IL-4. These results suggest that the IL-2 receptor γ chain is functionally involved in the IL-4 receptor complex."

https://openalex.org/W2145191135,"The perceived brightness of a gray patch depends on the surrounding context. For example, a medium-gray patch appears darker when placed on a bright background and brighter when placed on a dark background. Models to explain these effects are usually based on simple low-level mechanisms. A new set of brightness illusions cannot be explained by such models. In these illusions, the brightness percept is strongly influenced by the perceptual organization of the stimuli. Simple modifications of the stimuli that should have little effect on low-level mechanisms greatly alter the strength of the illusion. These effects may be ascribed to more complex mechanisms occurring later in the visual system."

https://openalex.org/W2044279758,"The genes encoding two of the subunits of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae origin recognition complex (ORC) have been isolated. Characterization of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding the 72-kD subunit of ORC (ORC2) indicates that this protein complex functions early in the DNA replication process. Moreover, ORC derived from orc2ts cells is defective for DNA binding. Others have shown a defect in orc2ts cells in transcriptional silencing at the silent mating-type loci. Consistent with this finding, ORC specifically binds to each of the four mating-type silencers identified in yeast. These findings support the hypothesis that ORC acts as an initiator protein at yeast origins of DNA replication and suggest that ORC also functions in the determination of transcriptional domains."
https://openalex.org/W2072897152,"Here a method is described to identify genes encoding proteins that recognize a specific DNA sequence. A bank of random protein segments tagged with a transcriptional activation domain is screened for proteins that can activate a reporter gene containing the sequence in its promoter. This strategy was used to identify an essential protein that interacts in vivo with the yeast origin of DNA replication. Matches between its predicted amino acid sequence and peptide sequence obtained from the 50-kilodalton subunit of the yeast origin recognition complex (ORC) established that the gene isolated here, ORC6, encodes this subunit. These observations provide evidence that ORC recognizes yeast replication origins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2022346667,"Five small nuclear RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) participate in precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. To probe their interactions within the active center of the mammalian spliceosome, substrates containing a single photoactivatable 4-thiouridine residue adjacent to either splice site were synthesized, and crosslinks were induced during the course of in vitro splicing. An invariant loop sequence in U5 small nuclear RNA contacts exon 1 before and after the first step of splicing because a crosslink between U5 and the last residue of exon 1 appeared in the pre-mRNA and then in the cutoff exon 1 intermediate. Both of these crosslinked species could undergo subsequent splicing, indicating that the crosslinks reflect a functional interaction that is maintained through both reaction steps. The same U5 loop aligns the two exons for ligation since the first residue of exon 2 also became crosslinked to U5 in the lariat intermediate. An invariant sequence in U6 RNA became crosslinked to the conserved second position of the intron within both the lariat intermediate and the lariat intron product. On the basis of these results, several conformational arrangements of small nuclear RNAs within the spliceosomal active center can be distinguished, and additional mechanistic parallels between the spliceosome and self-splicing introns can be drawn."
https://openalex.org/W2034996484,"Intermolecular multiple-quantum coherences between bulk water and a glycoprotein fragment at modest concentration (20 mM) have been experimentally produced and detected, although such coherences are inconceivable in the normal theoretical framework of nuclear magnetic resonance. A density matrix treatment explains these results by including the long-range dipolar interaction between spins and by discarding the high-temperature approximation. These results imply that peak intensities (critical for structural determinations) can be distorted in many gradient experiments, and show that magic-angle gradients provide substantial improvements with reduced gradient strengths. They also suggest methods for contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2119805163,"The elongated proteins of the spectrin family (dystrophin, alpha-actinin, and spectrin) contain tandemly repeated segments and form resilient cellular meshworks by cross-linking actin filaments. The structure of one of the repetitive segments of alpha-spectrin was determined at a 1.8 angstrom resolution. A segment consists of a three-helix bundle. A model of the interface between two tandem segments suggests that hydrophobic interactions between segments may constrain intersegment flexibility. The helix side chain interactions explain how mutations that are known to produce hemolytic anemias disrupt spectrin associations that sustain the integrity of the erythrocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1481976779,"The small proteoglycans, decorin, fibromodulin, biglycan, and lumican, represent a family of structurally related but genetically distinct molecules present in many types of connective tissues. Fibromodulin and decorin interact with collagens I and II (Hedbom, E., and Heinegard, D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6898-6905). These interactions have been characterized further by using native radiolabeled components from fibroblast cultures and nonlabeled proteoglycans purified from guanidine hydrochloride extracts of bovine tendon. Binding of metabolically labeled macromolecules to collagen I was measured in an assay based on precipitation of collagen fibrils formed in vitro. Among a large number of secreted fibroblast products, decorin and fibromodulin represented the vast majority of the collagen binding components. These molecules showed poor binding to denatured collagen, in contrast to fibronectin, which was also present in the medium. Decorin and fibromodulin bind to different sites on collagen I fibrils, since the binding of either radiolabeled component could be competed for only by the corresponding nonlabeled proteoglycan. Similarly, these proteoglycans showed binding to separate sites on collagen II. Binding of isolated fibromodulin and decorin to collagens in solution was measured in a solid-phase inhibition assay. Each of the proteoglycans interacted with triple helical molecules, but not with denatured collagen chain constituents or fragments. For fibromodulin, the data indicated an average of one binding site per collagen I molecule (Kd = 9.9 nM). The data on decorin indicated additional interactions, some apparently mediated by the dermatan sulfate side chain. The results suggest that the small proteoglycans bind to distinct triple helical sites, apparently differing from several other similar structures within each collagen molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1539477594,"Fumonisins, mycotoxins produced by Fusarium moniliforme and a number of other fungi, cause neuronal degeneration, liver and renal toxicity, cancer, and other injury to animals. Recent work with rat hepatocytes (Wang, E., Norred, W. P., Bacon, C. W., Riley, R. T., and Merrill, A. H., Jr. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14486-14490) found that fumonisins block sphingosine biosynthesis by inhibiting the conversion of sphinganine to dihydroceramides, which precedes introduction of the 4,5-trans-double bond of sphingosine. The current study utilized mouse cerebellar neurons in culture to evaluate how this affects the distribution of newly synthesized ceramides among different complex sphingolipids. Fumonisin B1 inhibited ceramide synthase in mouse brain microsomes with a competitive-like kinetic behavior with respect to both sphinganine and stearoyl-CoA. Fumonisin B1 inhibited sphingolipid biosynthesis in cultured cerebellar neurons in situ as reflected by accumulation of free sphinganine, a reduction in the mass of total sphingolipids, reductions in the incorporation of [14C]serine into glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, sphingomyelin, and gangliosides (GM1, GD3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b), and inhibition of the incorporation of [14C]galactose and [3H]sphinganine into complex sphingolipids. Dose-response studies revealed that the labeling of sphingomyelin (IC50 of 0.7 microM) was more sensitive to inhibition by fumonisin B1 than was glycolipid formation (IC50 of approximately 7 microM) in these cells. A similar effect was seen when beta-fluoroalanine was added to inhibit the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase, the first enzyme of the pathway. The inhibition of complex sphingolipid synthesis was reversible, and nearly normal labeling profiles were obtained 48 h after removing the mycotoxin. These studies establish that fumonisin B1 inhibits de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis by neuronal cells and, moreover, that limiting ceramide synthesis differentially affects the formation of sphingomyelin versus glycosphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1975939844,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the HMR-E silencer blocks site-specific interactions between proteins and their recognition sequences in the vicinity of the silencer. Silencer function is correlated with the firing of an origin of replication at HMR-E. An essential gene with a role in transcriptional silencing was identified by means of a screen for mutations affecting expression of HMR. This gene, known as ORC2, was shown to encode a component of the origin recognition complex that binds yeast origins of replication. A temperature-sensitive mutation in ORC2 disrupted silencing in cells grown at the permissive temperature. At the restrictive temperature, the orc2-1 mutation caused cell cycle arrest at a point in the cell cycle indicative of blocks in DNA replication. The orc2-1 mutation also resulted in the enhanced mitotic loss of a plasmid, suggestive of a defect in replication. These results provide strong evidence for an in vivo role of ORC in both chromosomal replication and silencing, and provide a link between the mechanism of silencing and DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1968843636,"What determines the precise sites of cleavage in the two transesterification reactions of messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing is a major unsolved question. Mutation of the invariant G (guanosine) at position 5 of 5' splice sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae introns activates cleavage at nearby aberrant sites. A genetic approach was used to test the hypothesis that a base-pairing interaction between the 5' splice site and the invariant ACAGAG sequence of U6 is a determinant of 5' splice site choice. Mutations in U6 or the intron (or both) that were predicted to stabilize the interaction suppressed aberrant cleavage and increased normal cleavage. In addition, a mutation in the ACAGAG sequence suppressed mutations of the 3' splice site dinucleotide. These data can fit a model for the spliceosomal active site comprised of a set of RNA-RNA interactions between the intron, U2 and U6."
https://openalex.org/W2013224893,"Yin-Yang-1 (YY1) regulates the transcription of many genes, including the oncogenes c-fos and c-myc. Depending on the context, YY1 acts as a transcriptional repressor, a transcriptional activator, or a transcriptional initiator. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a human complementary DNA (cDNA) library for proteins that associate with YY1, and a c-myc cDNA was isolated. Affinity chromatography confirmed that YY1 associates with c-Myc but not with Max. In cotransfections, c-Myc inhibits both the repressor and the activator functions of YY1, which suggests that one way c-Myc acts is by modulating the activity of YY1."
https://openalex.org/W1553769217,"Two models describing the interaction between U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and the 5' splice site of introns have been proposed on the basis of cross-linking experiments. Here it is shown that a conserved sequence present in U6 snRNA forms base pairs with conserved nucleotides at the 5' splice junction and that this interaction is involved in 5' splice site choice. These results demonstrate a specific function for U6 snRNA in splicing and suggest that U6 snRNA has a proofreading role during splice site selection. A model is presented in which this new interaction, in concert with previously described interactions between U6 snRNA, U2 snRNA, and the pre-messenger RNA, would position the branch point near the 5' splice site for the catalysis of the first splicing step."
https://openalex.org/W2012842274,"The mitochondrial inner membrane protease is required for the maturation of mitochondrial proteins that are delivered to the intermembrane space. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this protease is now shown to be a complex that contains two catalytic subunits, Imp2p and the previously identified Imp1p. Primary structure similarity indicates that Imp1p and Imp2p are related to each other and to the family of eubacterial and eukaryotic signal peptidases. Imp1p and Imp2p have separate, nonoverlapping substrate specificities. In addition to its catalyzing the cleavage of intermembrane space sorting signals, Imp2p is required for the stable and functional expression of Imp1p. Thus, inner membrane protease, and by analogy eukaryotic multisubunit signal peptidases, may have acquired multiple catalytic subunits by gene duplication to broaden their range of substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2051205587,"Intracellular recordings from simple cells of the cat visual cortex were used to test linear models for the generation of selectivity for the direction of visual motion. Direction selectivity has been thought to arise in part from nonlinear processes, as suggested by previous experiments that were based on extracellular recordings of action potentials. In intracellular recordings, however, the fluctuations in membrane potential evoked by moving stimuli were accurately predicted by the linear summation of responses to stationary stimuli. Nonlinear mechanisms were not required."
https://openalex.org/W2067116956,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules associate with peptides that are delivered from the cytosol to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Liver microsomes of SHR and Lewis rats, which express different alleles of TAP (cimb and cima, respectively), accumulate different sets of peptides. Use of MHC congenic rats assigned this difference to the MHC, independent of the class I products expressed. Both the cima and cimb TAP complexes translocate peptides with a hydrophobic carboxyl terminus, but translocation of peptides with a carboxyl-terminal His, Lys, or Arg residue is unique to cima. Thus, the specificity of the TAP peptide translocator restricts the peptides available for antigen presentation."
https://openalex.org/W1968938754,"The glycosyl-enzyme intermediate in lysozyme action has long been considered to be an oxocarbonium ion, although precedent from other glycosidases and theoretical considerations suggest it should be a covalent enzyme-substrate adduct. The mutation of threonine 26 to glutamic acid in the active site cleft of phage T4 lysozyme (T4L) produced an enzyme that cleaved the cell wall of Escherichia coli but left the product covalently bound to the enzyme. The crystalline complex was nonisomorphous with wild-type T4L, and analysis of its structure showed a covalent linkage between the product and the newly introduced glutamic acid 26. The covalently linked sugar ring was substantially distorted, suggesting that distortion of the substrate toward the transition state is important for catalysis, as originally proposed by Phillips. It is also postulated that the adduct formed by the mutant is an intermediate, consistent with a double displacement mechanism of action in which the glycosidic linkage is cleaved with retention of configuration as originally proposed by Koshland. The peptide part of the cell wall fragment displays extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the enzyme, consistent with previous studies of mutations in T4L."
https://openalex.org/W2001880533,"Most members of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) superfamily hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) quite slowly unless stimulated by a GTPase activating protein or GAP. The α subunits (Gα) of the heterotrimeric G proteins hydrolyze GTP much more rapidly and contain an ∼120-residue insert not found in other GTPases. Interactions between a Gα insert domain and a Gα GTP-binding core domain, both expressed as recombinant proteins, show that the insert acts biochemically as a GAP. The results suggest a general mechanism for GAP-dependent hydrolysis of GTP by other GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W1547645050,"Iron regulatory factor (IRF) is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein involved in regulating iron homeostasis. IRF controls expression of ferritin and transferrin receptor post-transcriptionally via specific binding to stem-loop iron-responsive elements (IREs) located in the untranslated regions of the respective mRNAs. We have confirmed by RNA band-shift analysis that a second IRE-protein complex observed in different rodent cell extracts is, like IRF, regulated by intracellular iron levels. This faster migrating complex appears to represent a specific interaction between the ferritin IRE and an iron-regulated protein that is distinct from IRF, as concluded from the following lines of evidence. First, UV cross-linking and partial digestion with different proteases revealed different peptide patterns for the two IRE-protein complexes. Second, antiserum raised against IRF peptides immunoprecipitated only authentic IRF and not the protein of the faster migrating complex, as determined by band-shift analysis. Following separation of the two IRE-binding proteins by ion-exchange chromatography, only the IRF-containing fraction reacted with the antibodies on Western blots. The second protein binds IREs with an affinity similar to that of IRF as demonstrated by competition with a ferritin IRE and related stem-loop RNAs. UV cross-linking experiments indicate that this second protein, tentatively named IRFB, has a molecular mass of approximately 105 kDa. Analysis of mouse tissues revealed differences in the distribution of IRF and IRFB. Whereas IRF protein and IRE binding activity were predominant in liver, intestine, and kidney, the IRFB protein(s) revealed highest binding activity in intestine and brain. Our data support the existence of two distinct iron-regulated IRE-binding proteins in rodents."
https://openalex.org/W2055912592,"A human Wilms tumor cell line (RM1) was developed to test the tumor suppressor activity of WT1, a zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in the developing human kidney and is mutationally inactivated in a subset of Wilms tumors. Transfection of each of four wild-type WT1 isoforms suppressed the growth of RM1 cells. The endogenous WT1 transcript in these cells was devoid of exon 2 sequences, a splicing alteration that was also detected in varying amounts in all Wilms tumors tested but not in normal kidney. Production of this abnormal transcript, which encodes a functionally altered protein, may represent a distinct mechanism for inactivating WT1 in Wilms tumors."

When H1 was removed from the extract, the resultant metaphase chromosomes were indistinguishable from those formed in complete extract. Nucleosomal spacing was the same for both. Thus, H1 is not required for the structural reorganization that leads to condensed metaphase chromosomes in this egg extract."
https://openalex.org/W2053453319,"Altered sensory input can result in the reorganization of somatosensory maps in the cerebral cortex and thalamus, but the extent to which reorganization occurs at lower levels of the somatosensory system is unknown. In cat dorsal column nuclei (DCN), the injection of local anesthetic into the receptive fields of DCN neurons resulted in the emergence of a new receptive field in all 13 neurons studied. New receptive fields emerged rapidly (within minutes), sometimes accompanied by changes in adaptation rates and stimulus selectivity, suggesting that the new fields arose from the unmasking of previously ineffective inputs. Receptive field reorganization was not imposed by descending cortical inputs to the DCN, because comparable results were obtained in 10 additional cells when the somatosensory and motor cortex were removed before recording. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying somatotopic reorganization exist at the earliest stages of somatosensory processing. Such mechanisms may participate in adaptive responses of the nervous system to injury or continuously changing sensory stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2014521800,The product of the PET56 nuclear gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was shown to be required for ribose methylation at a universally conserved nucleotide in the peptidyl transferase center of the mitochondrial large ribosomal RNA (21S rRNA). Cells reduced in this activity were deficient in formation of functional large subunits of the mitochondrial ribosome. The purified Pet56 protein catalyzed the site-specific formation of 2'-O-methylguanosine on in vitro transcripts of both mitochondrial 21S rRNA and Escherichia coli 23S rRNA. These results provide evidence for an essential modified nucleotide in rRNA.
https://openalex.org/W1486598646,"We have cloned the promoter of the avian beta 3 integrin gene. Using a probe comprising the 5'-untranslated region of an avian macrophage beta 3 cDNA, characterized by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends, several clones were isolated from an avian genomic library. One major and one minor transcriptional start site were identified at +1 and -47 base pairs, respectively, with the latter coinciding with a consensus sequence of an initiator. DNA sequence analysis of 800 base pairs 5' of the transcriptional start site fails to reveal either a TATA or CAAT box. In addition to an initiator, the first 200 base pairs contain consensus sequences for the binding of AP-1 and SP-1. A 3.5-kilobase fragment located immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site exhibits functional promoter activity, and deletion analysis reveals both suppressor and enhancer elements. In light of our observation that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3) accelerates beta 3 transcription, we determined whether the avian beta 3 promoter contains a vitamin D response element (VDRE). Transfected reporter constructs containing the first 1.5 kilobases upstream of the major beta 3 transcriptional start site respond to D3 with enhanced luciferase activity. Analysis of this region reveals a classical VDRE consensus sequence, located at -756 to -770. The following observations support the hypothesis that this sequence represents a functional VDRE: 1) a 600-base pair genomic fragment or a 29-base pair oligomer, each containing the putative VDRE, respond to D3 when transfected into HD11 cells; 2) a 67-base pair DNA fragment derived from genomic DNA and containing the candidate beta 3 VDRE specifically binds the vitamin D receptor-retinoid X receptor beta complex; and 3) avian osteoclast precursor-derived nuclear extracts bind to a synthetic oligomer containing the beta 3 VDRE-like sequence and, in turn, are specifically displaced by unlabeled beta 3 VDRE and anti-vitamin D receptor antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1502398235,"We report that a thiol leader peptidase, produced by replacing the critical serine at position 90 with a cysteine residue, is enzymatically active. In contrast to the wild-type leader peptidase, the thiol enzyme can be inactivated with N-ethylmaleimide, a cysteine-specific reagent. This strongly suggests that the serine 90 is involved in catalysis and is located at the active site. Of the three conserved basic residues in the signal peptidase family, only lysine 145 appears to be critical for catalysis; when lysine 145 was mutated to an alanine residue, leader peptidase K145A protein was inactive both in vitro and in vivo. A control experiment showed that the K145A mutant competes with the wild-type leader peptidase for substrate binding, confirming that the K145A mutation did not cause a global conformational change. The data provides evidence that catalysis of leader peptidase is carried out by a serine-lysine dyad."
https://openalex.org/W2018857111,"Myosin II, which converts the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis into the movement of actin filaments, is a hexamer of two heavy chains, two essential light chains, and two regulatory light chains (RLCs). Dictyostelium myosin II is known to be regulated in vitro by phosphorylation of the RLC. Cells in which the wild-type myosin II heavy chain was replaced with a recombinant form that lacks the binding site for RLC carried out cytokinesis and almost normal development, processes known to be dependent on functional myosin II. Characterization of the purified recombinant protein suggests that a complex of RLC and the RLC binding site of the heavy chain plays an inhibitory role for adenosine triphosphatase activity and a structural role for the movement of myosin along actin."
https://openalex.org/W1596672035,"Voltage-sensitive brain Na+ channels are regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cA-PK) and protein kinase C. Using synthetic peptides and protein microsequencing, we have determined that the alpha subunit of rat brain Na+ channel is selectively phosphorylated by cA-PK in vitro and in intact cells on 4 serine residues in the intracellular loop connecting homologous domains I and II. Ser-623 was most rapidly and extensively phosphorylated in vitro, whereas Ser-573, Ser-610, and Ser-687 were phosphorylated to lesser extents. In contrast, serine 687 was most extensively phosphorylated in mammalian cells transfected with the alpha subunit of type IIA Na+ channel in response to an increase in intracellular cAMP. Purified protein phosphatases dephosphorylated these sites selectively. Calcineurin rapidly and extensively dephosphorylated Ser-623 and also dephosphorylated Ser-573, Ser-610, and Ser-687 to lesser extents. Phosphatase 2A selectively dephosphorylated Ser-610. Together these results indicate that modulation of neuronal Na+ channel activity and therefore neuronal excitability by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation results from selective phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of four sites in the intracellular loop connecting homologous domains I and II of the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1594389718,"The iron-responsive element-binding protein (IRE-BP) is a cytosolic RNA-binding protein that functions in the maintenance of iron homeostasis by post-transcriptionally regulating transferrin receptor and ferritin synthesis. Little is known concerning how factors other than iron may modulate the activity of this central regulator of cellular iron utilization. We present evidence indicating that phosphorylation of the IRE-BP by protein kinase C (PKC) could provide a mechanism for regulation of IRE-BP function. Purified rat liver IRE-BP was phosphorylated by PKC up to 1.3 mol of phosphate/mol of protein with Ser the modified amino acid. Ser was also the phosphoacceptor in the IRE-BP in intact cells. The Km of PKC for the IRE-BP was 0.4 microM. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping identified one major phosphopeptide plus several other peptides with lesser amounts of phosphate. Synthetic peptides of the IRE-BP containing Ser 138 (site A) and Ser 711 (site B) were phosphorylated by PKC. In HL 60 cells, addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated IRE-BP phosphorylation within 30 min and increased high affinity IRE RNA binding activity 2-fold. After 90 min, the level of phosphorylation had increased further, and high affinity IRE RNA binding activity had increased 3-fold above the control. Incorporation of [35S]Met into immunoprecipitable IRE-BP was not altered in cells treated with PMA for 30 or 90 min. PMA also stimulated IRE-BP phosphorylation in rat fibroblasts. Taken together, our studies begin to define a novel mechanism by which hormones, growth factors, and other agents may regulate cellular iron utilization through specific phosphoregulation of the IRE-BP."
https://openalex.org/W1607521051,"To evaluate the effects of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) on apoB-containing lipoproteins, we analyzed plasma lipoproteins from three different lines of human CETP transgenic mice, with plasma CETP concentration ranging from low (1.5 microgram/ml) to high levels (8.5 micrograms/ml). With increasing CETP concentration, very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesteryl ester (CE) and apoB were progressively increased, and high density lipoprotein CE was decreased. To investigate the mechanism of accumulation of lipoproteins containing apoB (lipoprotein B), the abundance of hepatic LDL receptor mRNA was determined. LDL receptor mRNA was reduced as a result of CETP expression, with maximum repression to about 48% of the level of non-transgenic mice. Among the different lines of CETP transgenic mice there was an inverse relationship between plasma CETP concentration and hepatic LDL receptor mRNA abundance (r = -0.94, p"
https://openalex.org/W1543785893,"Certain steroids having an oxo group at the C-17 or C-20 position such as pregnenolone and dehydroisoandrosterone inhibit the cholesterol transport from lysosomes to other cellular sites. Taking advantage of the fact that the inhibition is reversed upon removal of the steroids, we studied the factors that control the cholesterol transport from lysosomes to other cellular sites in macrophages. Macrophages that accumulated unesterified cholesterol in their lysosomes were prepared by incubating cells with liposomes containing cholesterol and phosphatidylserine in the presence of a steroid inhibitor. These cells were chased by means of steroid washout, and then the effects of various pharmacological agents on the subsequent metabolism of cholesterol were examined. When the cells were chased in the absence of the agents, some of the cholesterol was converted to cholesteryl esters in the cells, and others were desorbed into the medium as unesterified forms, suggesting recovery of lysosomal cholesterol trafficking. Among the agents tested, bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase, completely blocked both cholesterol esterification and cholesterol desorption at 10 nM. Moreover, agents that neutralize the lysosomal proton gradient, such as ammonium chloride and chloroquine, also reduced both of the processes. Fluorescent microscopic examination of bafilomycin A1-treated cells revealed extensive filipin-cholesterol staining of perinuclear lysosomes. From these data, we conclude that acidic pH is required for the efflux of cholesterol from lysosomes to other cellular sites."

Endothelin has been shown to activate phospholipase A2 and release arachidonic acid in isolated rat hearts. Endothelin also has a positive inotropic effect in cardiac muscle, suggesting that endothelin increases Ca2+ influx or the amount of Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We used suspensions of adult rat ventricular myocytes loaded with fura-2/AM to compare the effects of arachidonic acid and endothelin on Ca2+ transients evoked by extracellular ATP. We showed recently (Damron, D.S., and Bond, M. (1993) Circ. Res. 72, 376-386) that pretreatment of cardiac myocytes with arachidonic acid significantly potentiated the amplitude of the ATP-triggered Ca2+ transient. We now report that endothelin also enhances the ATP-triggered Ca2+ transient and that the effect of the combination of maximal doses of endothelin and arachidonic acid is additive. Neither endothelin nor arachidonic acid was found to affect the size of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store. The potentiating effects of both arachidonic acid and endothelin were sensitive to inhibitors of protein kinase C. Endothelin was also found to stimulate phospholipase C but not phospholipase A2. Application of arachidonic acid to individual cardiac muscle cells resulted in inhibition of the transient outward K+ current, whereas application of endothelin inhibited the delayed rectifier current. These effects of arachidonic acid and endothelin were additive, and both effects could be blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine. Similarly, staurosporine inhibited endothelin-induced increases in isometric contractions in ventricular papillary muscle. We conclude that arachidonic acid and endothelin may be involved in the modulation of inotropic activity in cardiac muscle by means of protein kinase C-dependent inhibition of two distinct K+ channels. This would result in a prolongation of action potential duration and thus an increase in Ca2+ influx across the sarcolemma."
https://openalex.org/W1573317982,"The Src-like protein-tyrosine kinase Fyn is associated with T-cell antigen receptor. Transient expression of actively mutated Fyn, having Phe-528 instead of Tyr-528 or Thr-338 instead of Ile-338, in Jurkat T-cells stimulated the serum response element (SRE), 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate response element, cyclic AMP response element, and c-fos promoter. The stimulation of SRE was particularly prominent not only with active Fyn but also with normal (wild-type) Fyn. SRE was also stimulated by both normal and active Lck. Furthermore, normal and active Fyn stimulated transcription from the IL-2 gene promoter when transfected cells were stimulated by concanavalin A plus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Under the same conditions, Lck did not stimulate IL-2 promoter unless it was activated by mutation. Interestingly, a mutant Fyn, which has deletions within the SH2 region and so is able to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts, did not stimulate either the c-fos or IL-2 promoter, suggesting the importance of this region in T-cell signaling. Csk, which phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the negative regulatory sites of Src family kinases, down-regulated Fyn- and Lck-mediated stimulation of the serum response element and Fyn-mediated enhancement of IL-2 promoter activity. These data suggest that Fyn and Lck, whose activities are regulated by Csk, are involved in different phases of T-cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1942858531,"Amino acid substitutions at Thr199 of human carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) (Thr199-->Ser, Ala, Val, and Pro) were characterized to investigate the importance of a conserved hydrogen bonding network. The three-dimensional structures of azide-bound and sulfate-bound T199V CAIIs were determined by x-ray crystallographic methods at 2.25 and 2.4 A, respectively (final crystallographic R factors are 0.173 and 0.174, respectively). The CO2 hydrase activities of T199S and T199P variants suggest that the side chain methyl and backbone amino functionalities stabilize the transition state by approximately 0.4 and 0.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The side chain hydroxyl group causes: stabilization of zinc-hydroxide relative to zinc-water (pKa increases approximately 2 units); stabilization of the transition state for bicarbonate dehydration relative to the CAII.HCO3- complex (approximately 5 kcal/mol); and destabilization of the CAII.HCO3- complex (approximately 0.8 kcal/mol). An inverse correlation between log(kcatCO2/KM) and the pKa of zinc-water (r = 0.95, slope = -1) indicates that the hydrogen bonding network stabilizes the chemical transition state and zinc-hydroxide similarly. These data are consistent with the hydroxyl group of Thr199 forming a hydrogen bond with the transition state and a non-hydrogen-bonded van der Waals contact with CAII.HCO3-."
https://openalex.org/W1577439701,"The gene YAT1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a protein of 688 amino acids which displays significant sequence similarity to vertebrate L-carnitine acyltransferases and yeast inner mitochondrial L-carnitine acetyltransferase. Steady state levels of the respective mRNA are low during growth on glucose or galactose, derepressed on glycerol, and significantly induced when ethanol or acetate are the only carbon sources. The YAT1 promotor region confers the identical carbon source dependence also on the expression of beta-galactosidase when cloned 5' to the Escherichia coli lacZ-coding region. An antiserum directed against a beta-galactosidase/Yat1p fusion protein recognizes a protein of 78-kDa molecular mass in the mitochondrial fraction from yeast. In vitro translated Yat1p, which lacks a cleavable presequence, binds to mitochondria in a protease-sensitive location in a standard in vitro import assay. Deletion of the single copy gene in a haploid yeast strain yields no obvious phenotype with any carbon source. Carnitine acetyltransferase activities of intact mitochondria from a YAT1 deletion mutant are slightly lower than wild type, but are approximately alike in lysed mitochondria from mutant and control cells. Thus, the novel gene is nonessential and likely to code for a minor mitochondrial outer carnitine acetyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W2017708517,"Lysin, a protein from abalone sperm, creates a hole in the envelope of the egg, permitting the sperm to pass through the envelope and fuse with the egg. The structure of lysin, refined at 1.9 angstroms resolution, reveals an alpha-helical, amphipathic molecule. The surface of the protein exhibits three features: two tracks of basic residues that span the length of the molecule, a solvent-exposed cluster of aromatic and aliphatic amino acids, and an extended amino-terminal hypervariable domain that is species-specific. The structure suggests possible mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W1514968181,"Our previous studies on alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated signaling suggested that Gh is a signal mediator. Gh consists of a 74-kDa GTP-binding alpha-subunit and a 50-kDa beta-subunit. Studies using the alpha 1-agonist-receptor-G-protein ternary complexes from various tissues and species revealed that the intensity (GTP-binding) of the [alpha-32P]GTP-labeled proteins resulting from activating the alpha 1-receptor was significantly attenuated by phentolamine. The molecular masses of GTP-binding proteins were 74 kDa in rat heart and liver, 77 kDa in dog heart, 78 kDa (Gh7 alpha) in bovine heart and liver, and 80 kDa in human heart. Supporting these observations, a specific antibody to Gh7 alpha not only recognized these GTP-binding proteins in the ternary complex preparations, but also co-immunoprecipitated alpha 1-adrenoceptors, indicating a tight association of these GTP-binding proteins with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor. These results also demonstrate that functional and structural similarities exist among these GTP-binding proteins. Additionally, one of the identified G-proteins (termed Gh7) was purified from bovine heart. Gh7 consisted of the 78-kDa GTP-binding protein and a 50-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1516802222,"P56lck is a protein tyrosine kinase of the Src family specifically expressed in T lymphocytes. Triggering of T cells with anti-CD3 or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) results in the appearance of slower migrating forms (shift) of p56lck. To investigate the phosphorylation sites on the shifted forms of p56lck and to assess the role of protein kinase C in this phosphorylation, Jurkat cells were treated with a selective inhibitor of this kinase (GF 109203X). This inhibitor completely reversed the shift induced by PMA but only partially reversed the one induced after triggering with anti-CD3. To analyze the shift further, p56lck was immunoprecipitated from in vivo labeled cells treated either with anti-CD3 or with PMA. Tryptic phosphopeptides were generated and analyzed by using a combination of thin layer chromatography, high reticulation polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reverse phase chromatography, and phosphopeptide sequencing. We identified serine 158 as a newly phosphorylated site after PMA treatment and tyrosine 192 and serine 194 in the major tryptic phosphopeptide obtained after anti-CD3 triggering. The three sites identified are located in the SH2 domain of p56lck; this suggests that their phosphorylation may regulate the interaction with other proteins or with other internal domains in p56lck."
https://openalex.org/W1503425505,"Our studies on the alpha 1-adrenoceptor signaling have demonstrated that the Gh family is a signal mediator. We report here that a 69-kDa phospholipase C (PLC) is the effector in this signal pathway. The enzyme was isolated by dissociating a Gh7-PLC complex which was induced in the bovine liver membranes incubating with (-)-epinephrine and GTP. The enzyme displayed a marked preference hydrolysis for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate over other phosphatidylinositides at micromolar calcium. Reconstitution of PLC with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor and Gh (Gh7) into phospholipid vesicles resulted in a lowered Ca2+ requirement for the substrate hydrolysis in the presence of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) when the receptor was activated with the alpha 1-agonist. The formation of inositol phosphate was hormone concentration dependent and reached maximal within 3 min which was faster than the formation in the presence of the alpha 1-antagonist. An Gh7 alpha antibody co-immunoprecipitated 80-85% of phospholipase C activity in the presence of GTP gamma S, but not in the presence of GDP or buffer, showing the association of PLC with the alpha-subunit of Gh family. Thus, our novel approaches to identify the effector involved in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor signaling, as well as the reconstitution studies, substantially demonstrate that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated transmembrane signaling involves the Gh family and a 69-kDa PLC."
https://openalex.org/W1529988378,"The microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP) was recently established as a discrete constituent of 10-nm microfibrils. We have characterized the primary structure of the mouse transcript, the structure and chromosomal localization of the murine gene, and the developmental pattern of gene expression. The transcript consists of 1,037 base pairs as determined by cDNA cloning, Northern blot analysis, S1 nuclease mapping, and primer extension mapping. Using a cDNA fragment as a probe, we isolated a single genomic clone that contained the entire mouse gene. Analysis of this clone indicated that Magp is fragmented into 9 exons, with the initiator Met codon located in exon 2. As determined by analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, the mouse gene was mapped to chromosome 4 at a location corresponding to region D3-E1. Genomic sequence immediately upstream of the transcription start site was found to be GC-rich but lacked TATA or CCAAT boxes as well as other cis-acting motifs known to regulate transcription. Promoters of this type are usually found in genes that exhibit broad temporal and spatial patterns of expression. Consistent with this idea, the Magp transcript appeared to be the widespread product of mesenchymal/connective tissue cells throughout mouse development. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of microfibril gene expression during mammalian development."
https://openalex.org/W1512540083,"The principal role of lysozyme is to prevent bacterial invasion at body surfaces. We are interested in how lysozyme is regulated at the surface of the respiratory tract, where the serous gland cell is regarded as the primary cellular source of this enzyme. Since the cow genome contains at least 10 lysozyme-like genes, our objective was to determine which of them are expressed in the cow tracheal gland serous cell. By screening tracheal cDNA libraries with a probe constructed from the cDNA encoding stomach lysozyme 2, we obtained 3 lysozyme cDNAs: 5a (1023 base pairs (bp)), 7a (1060 bp), and 14d (1249 bp). cDNA 7a corresponds to a previously reported gene (showing sequence identity to the stomach 2 lysozyme gene), whereas cDNAs 5a and 14d correspond to lysozyme genes not previously reported. Northern blot analysis of cow tracheal RNA showed lysozyme mRNAs of three distinct lengths. Based on hybridization with probes specific for each cDNA, we determined that the longest transcript corresponded to cDNA 5a, the shortest to 7a, and the intermediate-length transcript to 14d. Cultured cow tracheal gland serous cell RNA, reverse transcribed and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with primers common to all three cDNAs, yielded a product that hybridized to oligonucleotide probes specific for all three cDNAs but most strongly to that for 5a. These results indicate that multiple lysozyme mRNAs are expressed in the cow trachea and that the lysozyme encoded by cDNA 5a is the major form expressed in the tracheal gland serous cell. This serous cell lysozyme is predicted to differ importantly in structure from both 7a and 14d lysozymes, with an arginine:lysine ratio almost 10-fold higher. The sequence differences may underlie functional differences, including variable resistance to proteolysis and variable affinity for large polyanions (e.g. mucins) found in the respiratory tract lumen."
