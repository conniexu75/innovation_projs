https://openalex.org/W2036081397,Circulating interferon was detectable in mouse serum within 1 hour after the intravenous injection of various types of virus and it reached maximum levels in about 4 hours. Rapidly produced interferon may play a role in the pathogenesis of viral infection and in viral interference.
https://openalex.org/W2054967693,This analysis provides the first precise molecular parameters for sucrose. All hydrogen atoms are included. Carbon-carbon distances are 1.51 1.53 A; carbon-oxygen 1.40 to 1.44 A; carbon-hydrogen 1.08 to 1.11 A; oxygen-hydrogen 0.94 to 0.99 A. The furanose ring conformation differs from that in sucrose sodium bromide dihydrate. Hydrogen bonds (two of them intramolecular) utilize every hydroxyl group except one.
https://openalex.org/W2019030518,"Six rats were exposed to a sequence of gunshot-like acoustical bursts during silence, during steady noise, and during pulsed noise. Assessment of their startle reactions to the bursts revealed that a background of steady noise enhanced the response, whereas a background of pulsed noise produced suppression of response. It is hypothesized that pulsed noise causes a relative refractory state in the mechanisms responsible for startle and that steady noise may enhance startle by masking uncontrolled punctiform acoustic stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W1970341886,"Nuclear bodies, averaging 0.8 to 1.2μ in diameter, were observed in various parenchymatous and interstitial cells of the calf. They were most prevalent and complex in structure in the parenchymatous cells of the adrenal cortex, and consisted of a fibrillar outer portion and a central or core area of varying size that was composed of electron-opaque particulate matter. These bodies, as far as the authors are aware, are of unknown significance."
https://openalex.org/W2082203073,"The loss of acquired immunological tolerance of mice to bovine gamma globulin depended on the presence of the thymus. Mice were repeatedly injected with bovine gamma-globulin from birth until the age of 5 to 10 weeks and then thymectomized or sham operated. After 130 to 160 days without antigen, an accelerated (immune) disappearance of I(125) bovine gamma-globulin could be uniformly induced in controls while thymectomized mice remained tolerant. Adult thymectomized mice made tolerant by a single injection of bovine gamma-globulin lost tolerance more slowly than sham-operated controls."
https://openalex.org/W1963969960,"Labeled DDD [ 1,1-dichlor-o-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane] was formed from C(14)-labeled DDT in the presence of yeast. The formation of DDD from DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene] was not observed, indicating that a reductive dechlorination of DDT occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1975808805,"The deformability of articular cartilage is increased by cations, more so by polyvalent than monovalent ones. Trivalent cations also depress elastic recovery. Failure of viscous solutions to alter the elastic behavior suggests ultra-filtration by cartilage as a possible mechanism in synovial lubrication."
https://openalex.org/W2090043619,"Rats were observed for the incidence of pulmonary edema after the placement of hypothalamic lesions by radio frequency thermocoagulation or d-c electrolysis. In the animals with electrolytic lesions, 31 percent died with pulmonary edema and marked signs were observed in another 20 percent. Moderate transient signs appeared in only 3.7 percent of the animals with radio-frequency lesions, and there were no deaths attributable to this syndrome in this group. These results suggest that this syndrome is an irritative consequence of the electrolytic lesion process rather than a ""release"" phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1986343037,"Tanning in the newly emerged fly is induced by a hormone secreted by neurosecretory cells situated in the pars intercerebralis of the brain. The same hormone is contained in the compound ganglion of the thorax, in concentrations six times as high as in the brain. This hormone is believed to act directly on the effector organ, and not through the secretion of ecdyson or a corpus allatum hormone; its release is effected through nervous impulses reaching the brain by way of the ventral nervous system a few minutes after the fly has emerged from the puparium. The hormone appears to be different from both the prothoracotropic and the gonadotropic hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2011210982,"Electroencephalographic sleep patterns of chimpanzees reveal greater similarities to human records than those of lower mammals. Flash-evoked responses in the midbrain reticular formation remain during ""paradoxical"" sleep, which does not appear to necessarily involve deep unconsciousness. Characteristic spindling occurs in the amygdala during a ""paradoxical"" type sleep while other areas were desynchronized. Telencephalic sleep-control mechanisms in higher primates are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2006008836,"X-irradiation administered in single doses of 10 to 40 r has a widespread effect on the developing rat brain. It first diminishes the formation of cytoplasmic basophilic material in the nerve cells and inhibits their growth. Single doses of 20 to 40 r cause permanent alterations of individual nerve cells, and interfere with their organization into neuronal assemblies, such as layers of the cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2153099725,Ribonuclease from pancreas releases nucleotide from Escherichia coli ribosomes while not altering significantly the base composition of the total ribosomal RNA. Ribonuclease hydrolyzes ribsomal RNA without destroying the structure of 70S or 30S and 50S ribosomes. The RNA in 30S and 50S ribosomes appears more sensitive to the action of ribonuclease. The data suggest that RNA may be a surface component of the ribosome.
https://openalex.org/W1999750721,"Evidence indicating that barley-stripe-mosaic virus has a mutagenic effect on maize is presented. The frequency of deficiencies of marker genes in F(1) seeds was significantly greater from pollinations involving viruis-infected males than from healthy controls. A small percentage of F(2) ears, involving virus-infected P(1) males, exhibited marked ratio distortions for marker genes. Such distortions persisted in subsequent back-cross generations."
https://openalex.org/W1982731437,Developing chick embryos from the stage of primitive-streak formation make ribosomal (28S and 16S) RNA. The size and composition of the RNA appears to be constant throughout the first 7 days of development.

https://openalex.org/W2087041157,"Sustained viability of the primate brain, as a totally isolated organ preparation, was achieved by utilizing an extracorporeal (compatible donor) circulation. Five rhesus monkey brains, completely isolated neurogenically and vascularly, were perfused in vitro for 30 to 180 minutes. Retention of biological activity was evidenced by: (i) persistent electrocortical activity, and (ii) significant mean A-Vo(o2) (5.8 volumes percent) and V-Aco(co2) (5.0 volumes percent) differences across the isolated brain."
https://openalex.org/W2008529569,"Early gastrulae of Rana pipiens exposed to actinomycin D for 2 days were then cultured in saline. The resulting larvae were immotile; histological examination revealed impaired development of axial nerve and muscle tissues, but normal differentiation of sensory, pronephric, heart, and digestive tissues; this suggests sequential synthesis of the different tissue-specific molecules of DNA-dependent RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2072433404,"Rats stressed by unilateral hind-leg ligation show a significantly decreased pharmacological response to the effects of hexobarbital, meprobamate, and pentobarbital. This effect is dependent upon an intact pituitaryadrenal axis, since it is absent in both hypophysectomized and adrenalectomized animals. It can be simulated by intravenous administration of adrenocorticotrophic hormone or corticosterone. The effect of stress on drug response is not noted with barbital, a compound which is not metabolized; this effect is inhibited by treatment of the animal with a drug metabolism inhibitor such as SKF 525-A (diethylaminoethyl 2,2-diphenylpentanoate). Compounds which can stimulate adrenocorticotrophic hormone secretion or act directly on the adrenals to produce corticosteroids should thus be able to stimulate their own metabolism or that of other drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2013673703,"Some auditory discriminations cannot be acquired by the cat after large bilateral ablations of auditory cortex at maturity. However, if such ablations are sustained during infancy, these discriminations are readily learned. The function of the cortex in auditory discrimination depends on the age of the nervous system at the time of injury."
https://openalex.org/W2051765529,"The impedance of the human skin decreased from approximately 130 to 30 Kohm as the frequency of a-c input increased from 1 to 1000 cycles per second. Over this same range of frequencies, the phase angles changed from -2 to -58 degrees. Changing the peak-to-peak current through the subject from 14 to 62 microamperes had no effect or the phase angles."
https://openalex.org/W2074048789,"Chromatography, on methylated-albumin columns, of DNA from calf thymus, mouse testis, and Bacillus subtilis, yielded, on elution by a sodium chloride gradient, fractions differing in density. The fractions eluted by higher sodium chloride concentrations had lower densities in a CsCl density gradient. Since DNA with higher guaninecytosine content is eluted from the column with lower concentration of sodium chloride and has higher density, the density heterogeneity of DNA is best interpreted as a result of heterogeneity of base composition. An extra band observed in calf-thymus DNA had a higher density than that of the main DNA; it was eluted at a lower concentration of NaCl, indicating a higher content of guanine and cytosine. On the other hand, an additional DNA component in the mouse-testis DNA had a lower density and also it was eluted at a lower salt concentration, possibly an indication of an unusual base component in its structure."

https://openalex.org/W2115140590,"In host bacteria resistant to the antibiotic, streptomycin inhibits phage replication by inhibiting the process of injection. This effect is competitively reversed by certain divalent cations, polyamines, and streptidine. It is proposed that streptomycin inhibits injection by attaching to the phage DNA while it is still folded within the phage head, and in this way it prevents the unfolding which is essential for the injection process. The reversal agents probably function by displacing the antibiotic from the phage, but they also promote injection themselves."
https://openalex.org/W1982114755,A halogenated butene has been isolated from commercially available halothane (Fluothane). Its concentration increases under the conditions in which halothane is commonly used in clinical work.
https://openalex.org/W2087761114,"A virus with characteristics similar to the pox group was isolated in tissue culture from bovine skin and oral lesions typical of pseudocowpox. The properties of this agent, certain of which differ from vaccinia virus, suggest that the isolate is the etiologic agent of the pseudocowpox syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2028375296,"The administration of tremogenic doses of Tremorine, 1,4-dipyrrolidino-2-butyne, is followed by a significant decrease in the concentration of norepinephrine in the brain stem of three common laboratory species. The change in the concentration proceeds at a rate which coincides with the occurrence of the tremor in each of these species. In the rat, the change in norepinephrine is followed by a progressive increase in the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain stem. Bilateral adrenalectomy in the rat enhances the Tremorine-induced changes in the concentration of norepinephrine and antagonizes the increase in the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine."
https://openalex.org/W2062820219,"With histamine release as an indicator, consistent passive sensitization of normal human leukocytes to specific anligen could be achieved with human serum, fresh or stored at -70 degrees C, from allergic individuals. With certain sera, dilution slowed the rate of sensitization but increased eventual histamine release."
https://openalex.org/W1989180529,The relationship between aging and organizational redundancy in biological systems was investigated from the standpoint of information theory. A mortality rate function derived for a randomly deteriorating redundant system approximates observed mortality rates more closely than does the Gompertz function and indicates that variations in redundancy among various mammalian species could account for their widely different rates of aging.
https://openalex.org/W1998117016,"As a part of the waterquality surveillance activities of the National Water Quality Network at 101 sampling stations, insecticides were identified in 38 samples from ten rivers during the period May through December 1962. Both DDT and dieldrin were identified by infrared and gas chromatographic analysis of carbon adsorption extracts."
https://openalex.org/W2075879051,"Radiopaque dye injected directly into the intervillous space of the placenta of the rhesus monkey may be observed, by cineradiography, as it spreads throughout the space and drains into the veins of the uterine wall and eventually into the systemic circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2055331150,"Bradykinin infusion causes an increase in cardiac output in rats whether the autonomic nervous system is blocked or not. After autonomic blockade, bradykinin causes a lesser decrease in the total peripheral resistance but a greater increase in cardiac output, resulting in an elevation of arterial pressure. The increase in cardiac output is caused by a small increase in heart rate and a substantial increase in stroke volume. The fact that these increases are observed after autonomic blockade suggests that bradykinin increases cardiac output by direct stimulation of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2028977075,"IT has been shown that the fowl plague virus, which belongs to the influenza A group, can be inactivated by an ethylene-iminoquinone (Bayer A 139, a gift of the Bayer-Werke, Leverkusen, Germany)1 or by hydroxylamine2,3 without losing its antigenic, neuraminidase, or hæmagglutinating activities. Bayer A 139 mainly reacts with the phosphate groups of nucleic acids, and in this way the sugar-phosphate ‘backbone’ is broken4,5. Hydroxylamine attacks the pyrimidines of the nucleic acids without breaking the RNA-strand6. Since during inactivation of the fowl plague virus with both compounds a phenomenon interpreted as multiplicity reactivation was observed1,3, one should still expect viral RNA-synthesis in cells which were infected with partially or totally inactivated virus. Experiments designed to clarify this point are described here."
https://openalex.org/W1990470069,"Photooxidation reactions, which were inhibited by high concentrations of oxygen, were affected by the addition of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (CMU), but the response varied with the substrate being oxidized. With ascorbic acid and 2,3-diketogulonic acid, CMU reversed the inhibition caused by high concentrations of oxygen. With ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), tetraethylene tetramine, or Mn(++) as reductant, CMU itself inhibited the reactions. The photoreduction of flavins by EDTA and the bleaching of flavin mononucleotide under anaerobic conditions were also inhibited by CMU. Corresponding photoreactions sensitized by phthaleine dyes or methylene blue were completely insensitive to CMU. This compound therefore seems to change specifically the reactivity of excited flavin molecules."

The most active site of hydrolytic action is the midgut, followed by the foregut, hindgut, salivary gland tissue, and Malpighian tubules."
https://openalex.org/W2016293173,"Temperatures above those normally present in larval sites of certain mosquitoes (for example, Aedes stimulans) cause larvae of potential males to be feminized in all degrees. Certain combinations of temperatures will affect these larvae so that an abnormal pair of genital appendages consistently appears in addition to the usual pair. These appendages appear to be masculine and are presumed to come from imaginal discs that are latent in present-day Diptera."

https://openalex.org/W1974568650,"During the period April 1962 to April 1963, 28 newborn infants, 7 stillborns, and 21 children from 4 to 15 years of age were examined for emission of gamma activity in a low-background, high-sensitivity, total-body counting facility. The 21 children contained traces of combined Zr(95) and Nb(95), Ru(103), (106), and Cs(137) in addition to the normal K(40). The greatest concentration of Cs(137) observed was 80 picocuries per kilogram of body weight, or about 4 percent of the natural K(40) radioactivity. Four of the seven stillborns, each counted for 10 hours, shoWed K(40) and traces of Zr(95), Nb(95), and Ru(103), (106). The ratios of Zr(95) to Nb(95) were lower in the stillborns than in their placentas which suggested placental discrimination against Zr(95). The ratios of Cs(137) to K(40) were lower in infants than in children or adults. Thyroid glands obtained atautopsy from 24 infants during April to September 1962 contained no detectable radioiodine ( less than 30 pc)."
