https://openalex.org/W2036326152,"A method has been developed for the preparation of uniform palladium particles of diameter from 55 to 450 angstroms. Uniform particles of gold layered on palladium were also synthesized. Hydrothermal treatment of aluminum hydroxide sol was used to prepare rods of alumina with uniform cross section from 100 to 500 angstroms and of varying lengths. The palladium was adsorbed as individual particles on alumina rods, both present in aqueous suspension. Then the suspension was dried to give a catalyst containing metal particles of uniform size dispersed in open pores produced by the intermeshing of the alumina rods. This procedure guaranteed the absence of diffusion control in the rate of reactions observed experimentally. All stages of the preparation were monitored with the electron microscope. The kinetics of the ethylene-hydrogen reaction were examined by means of a pulse technique. The number of active sites determined by carbon monoxide titration of the surface was equal to the number of surface atoms as determined by the calculation of the quantities of compounds involved in the synthesis and electron microscope examination. Furthermore, the activity per site depended on the method of preparation, being four times smaller when sodium formate was used as a reducing agent instead of sodium citrate. This may be due to the fact that the shape of particles makes certain crystallographic planes more favorable. Decrease in the size of particles to 56 angstroms produced no effect on catalytic activity beyond that due to the increase in the number of surface atoms. The activity of commercial 5 percent palladium on alumina diluted 100-fold with alumina gave 80.4 percent conversion with propylene and 82.7 percent conversion with ethylene. Thus there was little difference in the behavior of the two olefins."

https://openalex.org/W2024720226,Erythrocyte suspensions were subjected to hydrodynamic forces generated by a partially submerged tungsten wire set into transverse oscillation at 20 kilohertz. Free hemoglobin appears in solution when the oscillation amplitude exceeds a critical threshold value. The hemolysis probably results from stresses exerted on cell by a microstreaming field established near the wire.
https://openalex.org/W2137672930,Diamond powder is rapidly sintered into molded shapes at a pressure of about 65 kilobars and a temperature of 2500 degrees Kelvin. Other conditions of pressure and temperature are also suitable. The product compares favorably with natural carbonado in its properties.

https://openalex.org/W2014991390,"The spectral reflectivity (0.30 to 2.50 microns) of several lunar areas was measured with ground-based telescopes. A narrow absorption band centered at 0.95 micron was revealed for the first time. No other absorption bands appear in the spectrum. The reflectivity continues to rise at longer wavelengths throughout the spectral region studied. A comparison of the telescope measurements of an area 15 kilometers in diameter that includes Tranquillity Base with laboratory measurements of Apollo 11 soil samples reveals remarkable agreement, an indication that properties determined for fairly large lunar areas are relevant to local conditions. The spectra are interpretable in terms of surface mineralogy. The absorption band varies in both depth and shape and the overall slope of the curve changes with lunar area, an indication of differences in the composition and opacity of surface material. However, the lack of variety in the band position suggests there are no major differences (say, from mostly pyroxenes to mostly olivines) in the mineralogy at those sites studied."

https://openalex.org/W2077100458,"Both intrinsic (spin-canted) ferromagnetism and defect ferromagnetism occur in hematite. Because defect ferromagnetism is sensitive to structure, it is altered by stress or heating and could give spurious paleomagnetic information. Annealing experiments now suggest that the defect remanence of fine-grain hematites and red sediments, unlike that of single crystals, is magnetically softer than the spin-canted remanence and can be erased by partial demagnetization."

https://openalex.org/W2001728446,"Rock fragments consisting of orthopyroxene-calcic plagioclase assemblages appear to be more common in Apollo 12 soil samples than in the breccias or soil from Apollo 11 and are mineralogically and chemically different from any of the crystalline rocks returned by either Apollo 11 or Apollo 12. Compositionally, these fragments are orthopyroxenites and feldspathic orthopyroxenites. They are probably not fragments of meteorites; other considerations point to a near-surface lunar origin."
https://openalex.org/W2009494759,"Information diagnostic of general rock type is available as a well-defined emission maximum (related to the Christiansen frequency), rather than as contrast-depleted minima, in the infrared spectra of particulate solids. The amount of spectral information varies directly with the sharpness of the thermal gradient at the sample surface. Lunar thermal conditions optimize this gradient, making the moon an excellent target for remote sensing."
https://openalex.org/W1992904776,"Nuclear engineers have a vision whose fulfillment will make plutonium-239 and uranium-233 the ""dirty, cheap"" fuels and will make coal the fuel of esteem. It will be valued for derivative chemicals and clean fuels and for metallurgical and electrochemical uses of its fixed carbon. In a coal technology devised to exploit these values, the recovery of sulfur will be a mere incidental. An immediate, properly financed effort to develop means for coping with sulfur can give us clean air with profit, help to conserve our limited supply of vital uranium-235, and take us a large step toward a coal technology for the 21st century."

https://openalex.org/W2003017152,"Plastic pellets were fired into sand targets at a launch angle of 4 degrees and a velocity of 1.68 kilometers per second, the conditions of the Apollo 12 lunar module impact. Shallow elliptical or doublet craters were formed, similar to certain lunar craters. Analysis of the ejecta suggests (i) that lunar module debris skipped and, with some crater ejecta, reimpacted far downrange, but (ii) this ballistic rain does not account for the anomalous seismic signal."
https://openalex.org/W2021342325,"A plant population from an interspecific cotton hybrid produces flowers with exposed ovules on petal margins. The variability of these abnormal flowers suggests the possibility that angiosperms may have evolved by accumulating regulator genes which narrow the range of response to fluctuations in the environment. Progressive canalization of development within a population like the ""carpelloid petal"" plants could have resulted in both angiospermy and speciation."

The record was analyzed in terms of the transfer functions between tidal elevations and gravitational driving. Off California, the semidiurnal tide attenuates considerably faster than the diurnal tide. Neither species satisfies the rate of decay expected from a Kelvin wave."
