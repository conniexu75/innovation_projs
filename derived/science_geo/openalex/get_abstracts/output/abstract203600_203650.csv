https://openalex.org/W2001391235,"During the last twenty years much
progress has been made in the determination
of the molecular structure of
living organisms and the understanding
of biological phenomena in terms of
the structure of molecules and their
interaction with one another. The progress
that has been made. in the field of
molecular biology during this period
has related in the main to somatic and
genetic aspects of physiology, rather
than to psychic. We may now have
reached the time when a successful
molecular attack on psychobiology, including
the nature of encephalonic
mechanisms, consciousness, memory,
narcosis, sedation, and similar phenomena,
can be initiated. As one of the
steps in this attack I have formulated
a rather detailed theory of general
anesthesia, which is described in the
following paragraphs (1)."

In similar circumstances, however, small bubbles derived from animal lungs are stable. This is due1 to their surface tension being reduced to 0.05 dyne/cm. or less by an insoluble surface film. This film is derived from the original film lining the lung alveoli; its (oven-dry) mass is about 6.4 × 10−7 gm./cm.2. In situ it annuls the tension of the sharply curved alveolar surface, which would otherwise give rise to transudation from the blood or to atelectasis2. For various reasons the film was at first thought to consist of mucoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W173574571,"Despite the availability of many excellent analytical procedures, no convenient method has been described for the separation and isolation of small amounts of the oxidized and reduced pyridine nucleotides from mixtures. This surprising situation became apparent when we were faced with the problem of preparing a micromole of pure tritium-labeled reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for use in stereochemical studies related to folate metabolism. This communication describes a method which makes possible the separation and quantitative recovery of diphosphopyridine nucleotide, reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide, triphosphopyridine nucleotide, and reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide from diethylaminoethyl-cellulose columns. Quantities of the order of 1 pmole or less can be manipulated with ease. The method has been used for the preparation of enzymatically reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide labeled with tritium."

https://openalex.org/W1579856871,"Growing populations of Pneumococcus were found to release into the culture medium deoxyribonucleate-containing material with genetic transforming activity. Active material was maximally produced at the time when the culture was most responsive to added deoxyribonucleate. Since mixed cultures thus give rise to recombinants, it may be that transformation provides a natural mechanism of genetic recombination for Pneumococcus."

https://openalex.org/W25036280,"Criteria pertaining to biochemical applications of neutron activation analysis were formulated and dealt with experimentally. An ultramicromethod was described which permits the determination of the essential microconstituent, manganese, in biological samples, including small pools with low concentrations. Samples containing, on the average, 0.261 m mu g of manganese were analyzed with a variance of plus or minus 3.4%. The mean concentration of manganese in human plasma was 2.69 mu g per liter. The plasma concentration remained constant in the rabbit after injections of manganous sulfate whereas that of whole blood increased. Manganese concentrations were determined in some tissues and in some reagents. (auth)"

https://openalex.org/W2071447549,Starch gel electrophoresis of human transferrin treated with neuraminidase revealed a pattern of five bands whose intensities varied with neuraminidase concentration. Sialic acid analysis after starch block electrophoresis suggested that the bands represented the stepwise removal of sialic acid from the transferrin molecule. Evidence was also obtained for the purification of a particular genetic transferrin variant

https://openalex.org/W2108559139,"PREVIOUS work1 showed that in mammalian and avian muscle fibres there was a reciprocal relationship between phosphorylase and the oxidative enzymes, as shown by histochemical techniques. Two groups of fibres were described. In the histologically larger group, there was high phosphorylase activity and low activity of oxidative enzymes. (These included succinate, lactate, malate, isocitrate, β-hydroxy-butyrate, alcohol and glutamate dehydrogenases, and also the DPN-linked α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase.) In the group of histologically smaller fibres the converse activities were present."

The strains so recovered were identified as Toxoplasna gondii by morphological, serological, cultural, and pathogenic criteria. These findings strongly suggest that toxoplasmosis may be contracted through the eating of raw or undercooked infected eggs."

https://openalex.org/W2046409261,"DURING the investigation of the toxicology of griseofulvin, it was shown1 that the antibiotic when given parenterally is a mitotic poison, in some respects similar to colchicine. Clinical investigation2,3 showed that this did not represent an acute toxic hazard in clinical use. Nevertheless, interference with mitosis seems to us to imply a greater possibility of carcinogenic action on long-term administration than is the case with compounds devoid of this property. Colchicine has not yet been studied adequately from this point of view, and it was decided to include a group treated with this drug in a study of the long-term effects of griseofulvin."

https://openalex.org/W1996641504,COMPLEMENT-fixation and mouse neutralization tests are the two techniques so far employed in serological work with African horse-sickness virus. It was thought worth while to study the hæmagglutinating properties of this agent with the view of obtaining yet another tool for epidemiological (epizootiological) studies of this dreaded horse disease.

The membrane potential can be measured with coventional glass micro-pipettes filled with 2.5 M potassium chloride, but satisfactory recordings have only been obtained with electrodes possessing tips of about 0.5µ or less in external diameter. Very few such electrodes are free from large tip potentials; but some satisfactory recordings have been obtained from the muscle in situ, using selected electrodes."
