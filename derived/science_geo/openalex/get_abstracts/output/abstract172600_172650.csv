Akt activity and HIF-1 are both essential for development and implicated in tumor growth. Upon activation by products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt phosphorylates downstream targets that stimulate growth and inhibit apoptosis. Previous reports suggest that Akt may achieve its effects on angiogenesis and glucose metabolism by stimulating HIF-1 activity. We report here that, whereas serum stimulation can induce a slight accumulation of HIF-1α protein in a PI3K/Akt pathway-dependent fashion, hypoxia induces much higher levels of HIF-1α protein and HIF-1 DNA binding activity independently of PI3K and mTOR activity. In addition, we find the effects of constitutively active Akt on HIF-1 activity are cell-type specific. High levels of Akt signaling can modestly increase HIF-1α protein, but this increase does not affect HIF-1 target gene expression. Therefore, the PI3K/Akt pathway is not necessary for hypoxic induction of HIF-1 subunits or activity, and constitutively active Akt is not itself sufficient to induce HIF-1 activity.

Oxygen (O2) is critical for mammalian cells, which have evolved a variety of molecular mechanisms to sense and respond to both physiologic and pathophysiologic changes in O2 (1.Zhu H. Bunn H.F. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). From the standpoint of cellular survival, lack of O2(hypoxia) requires a metabolic switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism coupled with corresponding changes in the vasculature that compensate for reduced ATP-generating efficiency. To accomplish this, cells respond to low O2 by transactivating genes that increase glucose uptake (GLUT1), glycolysis (glycolytic enzymes), red blood cell production (erythropoietin), and vasodilation (inducible nitric-oxide synthase). However, these responses are short term survival strategies and do not address the fundamental problem of O2 deficiency. To restore O2 delivery to starved tissues, new blood vessel growth, known as angiogenesis or neovascularization, is required. Angiogenesis, the sprouting and growth of new vessels from existing ones, is activated primarily by vascular endothelial growth factor, a potent and highly endothelial cell-specific mitogen, whose expression is induced by hypoxia (2.Ferrara N. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The transcriptional response to hypoxia is regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), 1The abbreviations used are: HIFhypoxia-inducible factorPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasemTORmammalian target of rapamycinbHLH-PASbasic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim homologyHREhypoxia response elementmHREmutant HREwHREwild type HREE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseVHLvon Hippel-LindaupVHLVHL tumor suppressor proteinmyrmyristoylatedFBSfetal bovine serumtettetracyclineEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPGKphosphoglycerate kinaseβ-galβ-galactosidaseLYLY294002EF1αelongation factor 1αMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase1The abbreviations used are: HIFhypoxia-inducible factorPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasemTORmammalian target of rapamycinbHLH-PASbasic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim homologyHREhypoxia response elementmHREmutant HREwHREwild type HREE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseVHLvon Hippel-LindaupVHLVHL tumor suppressor proteinmyrmyristoylatedFBSfetal bovine serumtettetracyclineEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPGKphosphoglycerate kinaseβ-galβ-galactosidaseLYLY294002EF1αelongation factor 1αMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase heterodimeric transcription factors consisting of a regulated α subunit (HIF-1α or HIF-2α/EPAS1) and a constitutive β subunit (ARNT/HIF-1β or ARNT2), all of which are bHLH-PAS proteins. The bHLH-PAS superfamily contains many proteins involved in sensing and responding to changes in environmental conditions (3.Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), and the HIF family exemplifies this role (4.Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The HIF-α subunits are constitutively transcribed and translated, but protein levels are controlled by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. HIF-α subunits are ubiquitinated in direct proportion to cellular O2 concentrations, providing a molecular rheostat whereby levels of hypoxia-responsive genes are finely and expeditiously regulated by O2. Stabilized HIF-αs translocate to the nucleus where they dimerize with a β subunit, usually ARNT, and the heterodimer then binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) (5.Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W.

This modification allows HIF-α to be recognized by a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex containing pVHL, a tumor suppressor that recognizes hydroxylated HIF-α and allows it to be targeted to the 26 S proteasome (18.Ivan M. Kaelin W.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this fashion, low O2 leads to the accumulation of HIF-α subunits. The HIF-prolyl hydroxylases are among many proposed oxygen sensors, including the mitochondria (19.Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

While the mechanism of HIF-α degradation is becoming clear, the signaling pathways that influence HIF-α stability and nuclear translocation and, subsequently, HIF-1 transcriptional activity remain somewhat confusing and controversial. Many published reports suggest that the regulation of HIF-1α stabilization and nuclear translocation and HIF-1 transcriptional activity are distinct events that are coordinately controlled by hypoxia (4.Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), although evidence also exists that hypoxic signal transduction is not necessary for HIF activity when HIF-1α is overexpressed (21.Hofer T. Desbaillets I. Hopfl G. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 15Crossref Google Scholar) or constitutively stable (16.Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Particular scrutiny has been focused on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Akt (also known as protein kinase B or PKB), a proto-oncogene, is a major downstream effector of growth factor signaling and has a wide array of progrowth, antiapoptotic effects when activated by growth factors through PI3K (for review, see Ref. 22.Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Most intriguingly Akt shares with HIF-1 the ability to induce vascular endothelial growth factor and angiogenesis (23.Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In certain cell types, positive stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway using constitutively active molecules can induce or enhance HIF activity. Conversely inhibition of the pathway using dominant negative peptides, small molecule inhibitors, or overexpression of PTEN, a phosphatase that reverses PI3K-catalyzed phosphorylation, can block HIF activity (24.Zundel W.

Harris A.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1263-1272PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports suggest that PI3K and Akt are central in the regulation of HIF activity. We set out to test this link using a variety of different cell types and assays and to test both the necessity and sufficiency of Akt or PI3K activity to lead to HIF-1α stability or HIF-1 activity. We report here that, although inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway can block serum-induced accumulation of HIF-1α, they do not block hypoxic induction. In transient transfections, constitutively active (myristoylated) Akt (myrAkt) is able to increase HIF-dependent transcription in glioblastoma cells but not in hepatoma cells, suggesting a fundamental difference in the way these two cell lines respond to constitutive Akt activity. In addition, we show in a murine pro-B cell line (FL5.12) that even at elevated levels of Akt signaling, HIF-1α protein levels are only slightly affected, and target gene expression is not induced, indicating that Akt activity itself is not sufficient in these cells to stimulate HIF-1 target gene transcription. The murine hepatoma lines 1c1c7 and BpRc1 (obtained from ATCC), endothelial line MS-1 (generously supplied by M. Gee and W. Lee), rat fibroblast line Rat-1a (generously supplied by N. Hay), and human glioblastoma line U373 (obtained from the University of California San Francisco Neurosurgery Tissue Bank, Ref. 41.Ponten J. Westermark B. Med. Biol. 1978; 56: 184-193PubMed Google Scholar) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro), 10% FBS, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 nm nonessential amino acids (all from Invitrogen). The murine pro-B cell line FL5.12 (42.Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B.

Creation of the tet-on myrAkt-expressing clones has been described previously (26.Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12041-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Tet-on clones and controls were induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) overnight prior to experimental treatments. Hypoxia was defined as 1.5% O2 and generated using anIn Vivo2 hypoxic work station (Ruskinn Technologies, Leeds, UK) in the case of Western blots and EMSA analyses or an IG750 variable O2 tissue culture incubator (Jouan Inc.) for reporter and Northern analyses. LY294002, rapamycin, and wortmannin (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO (Sigma) to make stocks of 50 mm, 100 μm, and 200 μm, respectively. Cell cultures were pretreated with the indicated drug and concentration for ∼30 min prior to serum or hypoxia treatment. Drugs were diluted into medium to the appropriate concentration before adding to cells to ensure that all treated dishes received the same concentration, and Me2SO was added to control or untreated dishes at a final dilution of 1:1000. For all Western blot and EMSA analyses, 3.5–4 × 106 (1c1c7) or 2 × 106(U373) cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture dishes such that the density of the cells at the time of lysis was ∼60–70% confluent. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight and were then starved for 3 h in 0% FBS and pretreated for 30 min with the indicated drug or Me2SO control. Cells were then stimulated with either 10% FBS, 20% O2 or 0% FBS, 1.5% O2 for the indicated times. For hypoxic extracts, cells were manipulated inside a hypoxic chamber using phosphate-buffered saline that had been equilibrated to the hypoxic environment. Lysis was performed immediately at the bench in ambient air. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modified Dignam protocol (44.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar) with Buffer C further modified to contain 300 mm NaCl (45.Chilov D. Camenisch G. Kvietikova I. Ziegler U. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared using WCE buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 250 μm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Extracts were electrophoresed, transferred, and immunoblotted according to standard protocols or the manufacturer's instructions using 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20. Blots were stained with Ponceau S to ensure equal loading. α-Mouse HIF-1α antibody was purchased from Novus (NB100-105 or -123), and α-human HIF-1α was from Transduction Laboratories (H72320). Antibodies against total and phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473), p70 (Thr-389), and FKHRL1 (Thr-32) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-rabbit and α-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies and were used at dilutions of 1:2000. ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Blots were stripped in 61.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 1 h before being blocked and reprobed according to standard protocols. EMSA analyses have been described previously (46.Maltepe E. Keith B. Arsham A.M. Brorson J.R. Simon M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In brief, nuclear extracts were incubated in binding buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol to which 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 or 7.5 μg of nuclear extract, 100-fold excess of unlabeled cAMP-response element-binding protein competitor oligonucleotide, 104 cpm labeled probe, and, where indicated, 0.5 μl of polyclonal α-ARNT antiserum (Novus 100-110). The probe consisted of a 24-mer derived from the erythropoietin HRE (47.Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar). Adherent cells were plated at 2.5 × 106 (1c1c7) or 2 × 106 (U373) cells/10-cm tissue culture dish and allowed to recover overnight. They were then starved in 0% FBS for 7 h and subsequently incubated in hypoxia for 16 h unless otherwise indicated. FL5.12 cells were seeded at 1 × 105/ml and incubated overnight with or without doxycycline before hypoxic treatment. All cells were lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen) at the bench in ambient air. 10–20 μg of total mRNA per lane were run on 1.5% agarose denaturing (formaldehyde) gels and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Murine PGK and GLUT1 (7.Maltepe E. Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) probes and pan-reactive α-tubulin probe (26.Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. J. Biol.

Human GLUT1 and PGK probes were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from 786-O renal cell carcinoma total RNA with the following primers: GLUT1-A, 5′-cctaaggatctctcaggagcacagg; GLUT1-B, 5′-tgagcaagaggacactgatgagagg (996 bp); PGK-A, 5′-gttgaccgaatcaccgacctctctc; PGK-B, 5′-ccatgctgagtagtgaaacagtgac (1654 bp). Blots were imaged using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager, and quantitations were performed using ImageQuant software. HRE-luciferase reporter constructs (wHRE) consisted of a trimerized 24-mer containing 18 bp of sequence from the PGK promoter including the HRE (5′-tgtcacgtcctgcacgactctagt, HRE underlined; Ref. 5.Firth J.D.

The mutant HRE (mHRE) had the ACG of the HIF-1 binding site mutated to CAT, abolishing binding, as well as a point mutation that abolished aBsgI restriction site for diagnostic purposes. The pCDNA3/myrAkt was a kind gift of A. Edinger and S. Talapatra and contains the same hemagglutinin-tagged myrAkt insert described previously (26.Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C.

Transfection efficiency was assessed by cotransfection of a β-gal gene under the control of the elongation factor 1α (EF1α) promoter. ARNT point mutants were constructed using a primer extension method followed by methyl-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion. Oligonucleotides that spanned the site to be mutated were synthesized changing threonine 251 or threonine 251, serine 252, and serine 253 to alanines. Oligonucleotides were as follows (mutations underlined): T251A sense, 5′-gccgcatgaggtgtggtgctagctccgtggaccctgtttccatg; T251A antisense, 5′-catggaaacagggtccacggagctagcaccacacctcatgcggc; TSS251AAA sense, 5′-gccgcatgaggtgtggtgcggccgccgtggaccctgtttccatg; TSS251AAA antisense, 5′-catggaaacagggtccacggcggccgcaccacacctcatgcggc. Full-length murine ARNT cDNA was cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) using XbaI and HindIII sites, and the above oligonucleotides were used to amplify pcDNA3/ARNT plasmids by PCR (TaKaRa LA kit) using the following cycle times and temperatures: 94 °C for 1 min; 10 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 68 °C for 10 min; 72 °C for 10 min. PCRs were then digested in DpnI, which only cuts methylated and, therefore, template DNA, leaving only the newly synthesized, unmethylated mutant plasmids that were then transformed into DH5αEscherichia coli, grown up, and isolated. For transient transfections, cells were plated at 1 × 107 (1c1c7 and BpRc1) or 3.75 × 106(U373)/well of six-well plates in 10% FBS medium minus penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight and were transfected the next morning using either LipofectAMINE2000 (1c1c7 and BpRc1) or LipofectAMINE Plus (U373) transfection reagents (Invitrogen) in 10% FBS minus penicillin/streptomycin. After transfection, cells were washed and allowed to recover for at least 30 min in 10% FBS minus penicillin/streptomycin, and each well was then washed, trypsinized, and replated on two 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS with penicillin/streptomycin. After overnight incubation, all dishes were switched to 0% FBS for 6 h and then placed in either a hypoxic chamber or a normal tissue culture incubator. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was analyzed after 20 h of treatment using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hepatocytes were transfected using 12.5 μl of LipofectAMINE2000, 15 ng of pCDNA/myrAkt or empty pCDNA3 vector, 2 μg of either wHRE or mHRE, and 0.5 μg of EF1α/β-gal. U373 cells were transfected with 15 μl of LipofectAMINE, 20 μl of plus reagent, 1 μg of wHRE or mHRE, 250 ng of pCDNA/myrAkt or empty vector, and 2 μg of EF1α/β-gal. To determine whether various steps in the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway are required for hypoxic or nonhypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α, as has been suggested previously, we used pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002 and wortmannin) and of mTOR (rapamycin), a downstream target of Akt previously implicated in the control of HIF-1α (35.Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We used the 1c1c7 mouse hepatocyte cell line in which we and others have extensively characterized HIF-1-dependent hypoxic responses. In 1c1c7 cells, LY294002 was able to modestly inhibit hypoxia-induced HIF-1 DNA binding activity and HIF-1α protein accumulation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Wortmannin is as effective as LY294002 in blocking serum-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, and all three drugs effectively block serum-stimulated phosphorylation of p70 (Fig. 2 C), which lies downstream of both Akt and mTOR and acts as a mediator of PI3K/Akt modulation of protein translation (for review, see Ref. 48.Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). While rapamycin may modestly inhibit HIF-1α accumulation, possibly due to its general effects on protein translation, neither rapamycin nor wortmannin had any dose-dependent effect on HIF-1 DNA binding activity or HIF-1α levels, suggesting that the effects of LY294002 were PI3K-independent. It therefore seems likely that the effects of LY294002 on HIF-1α are due to its effects on kinases other than PI3K. Differential effects of LY and wortmannin on cells have been observed previously (49.Adi S. Wu N.Y. Rosenthal S.M.

It becomes enzymatically active at the end of mitosis. The activation of the cyclosome is initiated by its phosphorylation, a process necessary for its conversion to an active form by the ancillary protein Cdc20/Fizzy. Previous reports have implicated either cyclin-dependent kinase 1-cyclin B or polo-like kinase as the major protein kinase that directly phosphorylates and activates the cyclosome.

To examine this problem, we have purified cyclosome from HeLa cells by a combination of affinity chromatography and ion exchange procedures. With the use of purified preparations, we found that both cyclin-dependent kinase 1-cyclin B and polo-like kinase directly phosphorylated the cyclosome, but the pattern of the phosphorylation of the different cyclosome subunits by the two protein kinases was not similar. Each protein kinase could restore only partially the cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity of dephosphorylated cyclosome. However, following phosphorylation by both protein kinases, an additive and nearly complete restoration of cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity was observed.

It was discovered as a ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets mitotic cyclins for destruction and whose action is essential for exit from mitosis (1Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J.

Subsequent studies have shown that it is also involved in the degradation of inhibitors of sister chromatid separation known as securins and of some other cell cycle regulatory proteins that are destroyed at the end of mitosis (reviewed in Refs. 4Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar and 5Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin ligase activity of the cyclosome/APC itself is intricately regulated. It is inactive in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and becomes active in mitosis. The activation of the cyclosome in mitosis is initiated by its phosphorylation, a process necessary for its subsequent conversion to the active form by the ancillary protein Cdc20/Fizzy (6Lahav-Baratz S.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1555-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Cdc20 is the target for inhibition of the cyclosome/APC by the spindle checkpoint system, a surveillance mechanism that monitors the correct attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle (reviewed in Refs. 10Amon A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholarand 11Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 997-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). While the role of cyclosome phosphorylation in its mitotic activation by Cdc20 is well established, there is some confusion concerning the identity of the protein kinases involved in this process. Using partially purified preparations of cyclosomes from clam oocytes (6Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Shteinberg M. Protopopov Y. Listovsky T. Brandeis M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 2000; 271: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we have shown that the major mitotic protein kinase, Cdk1-cyclin B, activates cyclosome derived from interphase cells or mitotic cyclosome that has been inactivated by phosphatase treatment. However, since these studies were done with partially purified cyclosome preparations, indirect effects such as a cascade of protein kinases initiated by the action of Cdk1-cyclin B could not be ruled out. Another candidate is polo-like kinase (Plk), known as Cdc5 in S. cerevisiae and Plx1 inXenopus, which is required at several stages of the cell cycle, including in exit from mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 13Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Indeed, depletion or inactivation of Plx1 in extracts of frog eggs blocks the degradation of cyclin B (14Descombes P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1328-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Kotani et al. (15Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.-M. Watanabe N. Hoog C. Hieter P. Todokoro K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 16Kotani S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have reported that Cdk1-cyclin B does not phosphorylate directly cyclosome/APC but phosphorylates and activates Plk1, which on turn phosphorylates cyclosome. In these experiments, immunoprecipitated cyclosome from mammalian cells was used, whose interactions with other proteins could be hampered by binding to immobilized antibody. More recently, Rudner and Murray (8Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) have studied the roles of Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of cyclosome/APC in the budding yeast. Three subunits of the yeast cyclosome (Cdc16, Cdc23, and Cdc27), which were directly phosphorylated by Cdk1-cyclin B in vitro, were also phosphorylated in vivo. Mutation of all potential Cdk phosphorylation sites of these three cyclosome subunits abolished their phosphorylation in vitro andin vivo and caused a delay in the degradation of substrates of Cdc20-activated cyclosome in vivo. It was also observed that Cdc5 (the yeast homologue of Plk) phosphorylated Cdc16 and Cdc27in vitro. However, the effects of cyclosome phosphorylation by Cdk1 or Cdc5 on its ubiquitin ligase activity have not been reported in this study (8Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we have examined this problem by the use of highly purified cyclosome preparation from HeLa cells. We find that both Cdk1-cyclin B and Plk1 can directly phosphorylate the cyclosome, but the pattern of the phosphorylation of the different cyclosome subunits by the two protein kinases is not similar. Each protein kinase activates only partially ubiquitin ligase activity, but an additive activation is observed following the phosphorylation of the cyclosome by both protein kinases. Ubiquitin from bovine erythrocytes, carboxymethyl bovine serum albumin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, dephosphorylated α-casein, staurosporine, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were obtained from Sigma, and okadaic acid was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. E1, E2-C, ubiquitin aldehyde, and Suc1-Sepharose were prepared as described earlier (17Sudakin V. Shteinberg M. Ganoth D. Hershko J. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18051-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). p13suc1 was expressed in bacteria and was purified as described (17Sudakin V. Shteinberg M. Ganoth D. Hershko J. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18051-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml for immunoblotting. Monoclonal anti-Cdc27 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, and polyclonal antibody against human Cdc27 was raised in rabbits and was affinity-purified as described (18Tugendreich S. Tomkiel J. Earnshaw W. Hieter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified α-Cdc27 antibody was covalently coupled to Protein A beads (Affi-Prep Protein A Support; Bio-Rad), as described (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), at a concentration of ∼4 mg/ml beads. Protein kinase Cdk1-glutathioneS-transferase-Δ88-cyclin B (referred to as “Cdk1-cyclin B”) was prepared and purified as described (17Sudakin V. Shteinberg M. Ganoth D. Hershko J. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18051-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Units of Cdk1-cyclin B activity were as defined previously (17Sudakin V. Shteinberg M. Ganoth D. Hershko J. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18051-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The baculovirus expression vectors of His6-Plx1 (referred to as “Plk”) and of its enzymatically inactive mutant N172A were generously provided by Dr. W. Dunphy. They were expressed in insect cells as described (20Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This included incubation of insect cells with okadaic acid prior to harvesting, to phosphorylate and activate the kinase (20Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and mutant His6-Plk were purified by chromatography on nickel-agarose. Examination of these purified Plk preparations by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining showed the expected ∼70-kDa proteins, both of which were >95% homogenous. Activity of Plk was assayed by phosphorylation of α-casein, as described (21Qian Y.-W. Li E. Erikson C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). One unit of Plk activity is defined as the casein-phosphorylating activity of 25 pg of purified recombinant Plk. Extracts from nocodazole-arrested HeLa S3 cells were prepared as described previously (12Yudkovsky Y. Shteinberg M. Listovsky T. Brandeis M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography on Suc1-Sepharose was carried out by a modification of a previously described procedure for the isolation of cyclosomes from mitotic clam oocytes (17Sudakin V. Shteinberg M. Ganoth D. Hershko J. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18051-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Extracts form mitotic HeLa cells were first incubated with ATP to hyperphosphorylate cyclosomes by endogenous mitotic protein kinases. The reaction mixture contained the following in a volume of 4 ml: 250 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm ATP, 50 mm phosphocreatine, 500 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, ∼20 mg of protein extract (100,000 × g supernatant) from mitotically arrested HeLa cells, and 1 μm okadaic acid. Following incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, the sample was mixed with 1 ml of Suc1-Sepharose beads (approximately 14 mg Suc1/ml of beads) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 1 mm DTT (Buffer A). The sample was mixed with beads for 1 h at room temperature and then was transferred to a column (0.7-cm diameter). All subsequent operations were at 0–4 °C. The column was washed with 45 ml of Buffer A that contained 300 mm KCl and then with 15 ml of Buffer A. Cyclosome was eluted from Suc1-Sepharose beads with 20 ml of Buffer A that contained 50 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate and 0.2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The eluate was concentrated to ∼1 ml by centrifuge ultrafiltration (Centriprep 10; Amicon), diluted 10-fold with Buffer A that contained 20% (v/v) glycerol, and concentrated again to a volume of ∼1 ml. Recovery of activity in this step was about 30%. The preparation was further purified by ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ as follows. A sample of 2 ml of the affinity eluate, containing about 200,000 units of cyclosome activity (see below), was applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The column was washed with 15 ml of the above buffer and then was subjected to a linear gradient of NaCl (100–700 mm) in the same buffer, for 35 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected into tubes containing 0.2 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor carrier protein. Fractions were concentrated by centrifuge ultrafiltration with Centricon-30 concentrators (Amicon), diluted 10-fold in Buffer A, and concentrated again to a volume of 100 μl. Glycerol was added to 20% (v/v). The central peak fractions of the purified cyclosome preparation were pooled and were stored at −70 °C in small samples. Recovery of activity in this step was around 25–30%. Reaction mixtures contained the following in a volume of 10 μl: 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mg/ml carboxymethyl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.5 mm ATP, 50 μm ubiquitin, 1 μmubiquitin aldehyde, 1 pmol of E1, 5 pmol of E2-C, 1 μmokadaic acid, 1–2 pmol of 125I-labeled cyclin B-(13–91)/protein A (referred to as 125I-cyclin; 1–2 × 105 cpm), source of cyclosome as specified, and 0.4 μl of Cdc20/Fizzy produced by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate, as described (7Shteinberg M. Protopopov Y. Listovsky T. Brandeis M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Following incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Results were quantified by PhosphorImager and were expressed as the percentage of125I-cyclin converted to ubiquitin conjugates. A unit of activity is defined as that converting 1% of 125I-cyclin to ubiquitinylated derivatives under the above described assay conditions, in the range of assay linear with cyclosome concentration. Reaction mixtures contained the following in a volume of 10 μl: 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 3–7 μl of purified cyclosome (containing ∼500–700 units of activity), and 10 units/μl λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Following incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, phosphatase action was stopped by the addition of EGTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. To rephosphorylate cyclosome, [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm, ∼200 cpm/pmol) was added, along with 5 mm MgCl2 10 μm p13suc1 and protein kinase as specified. Following a second incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, protein kinase action was stopped by the addition of staurosporine (10 μm). We have previously observed that incubation of partially purified preparations of cyclosome from clam oocytes or human cells with protein kinase Cdk1-cyclin B converted them to phosphorylated forms that could be activated by Cdc20/Fizzy (7Shteinberg M. Protopopov Y. Listovsky T. Brandeis M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Yudkovsky Y. Shteinberg M. Listovsky T. Brandeis M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, since these experiments were carried out with partially purified preparations, it was possible that Cdk1-cyclin B phosphorylated and activated another protein kinase, which in turn phosphorylated the cyclosome. Indeed, it has been suggested that Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) activates the latter to phosphorylate the cyclosome (15Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.-M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To examine this problem, we have highly purified cyclosome/APC from HeLa cells by a combination of affinity chromatography and fast protein liquid chromatography procedures. We preferred this type of purification to immunoprecipitation, as done by other investigators (8Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 9Kramer E.R. Scheuringer N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Peters J.-M. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because immunoprecipitated cyclosome/APC has very low enzymatic activity, and its interactions with protein kinases or other proteins may be sterically hindered by binding to immobilized antibody. Affinity purification of HeLa cyclosomes on p13suc1-Sepharose was adapted from a procedure developed previously for mitotic clam oocyte cyclosomes (17Sudakin V. Shteinberg M. Ganoth D. Hershko J. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18051-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The cell cycle regulatory protein p13suc1 contains, in addition to its Cdk binding site, also a phosphate-binding site (23Pines J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that preferentially binds proteins phosphorylated on Ser/Thr-Pro motifs (24Landrieu I. Odaert B.

Mitotically phosphorylated cyclosomes bind strongly to Suc1-Sepharose and can be eluted with a phosphate-containing compound such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate (17Sudakin V. Shteinberg M. Ganoth D.

HeLa cells were arrested in mitosis with nocodazole, and extracts of these cells were further incubated with MgATP and okadaic acid (see “Experimental Procedures”), to hyperphosphorylate cyclosome subunits. Affinity chromatography on Suc1-Sepharose resulted in a 50–70-fold enrichment of mitotic cyclosomes from HeLa cells with a recovery of ∼30% of activity. The eluate of the affinity column, which contains many other phosphorylated proteins, was subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography ion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column. As shown in Fig. 1A, phosphorylated cyclosome bound strongly to the anion exchange column and was eluted at a rather high salt concentration (∼500–520 mm NaCl). Chromatography on MonoQ separated the cyclosome from most other proteins from the previous purification step, which were eluted at lower salt concentrations. Thus, MonoQ chromatography separated the cyclosome essentially completely from residual Cdk1-cyclin B and Plk that were eluted at around 320 and 400 mm NaCl, respectively (data not shown). Several proteins in the molecular mass region of 60–220 kDa eluted in coincidence with the peak of cyclosome activity in fractions 39–40 (Fig. 1B). As shown and discussed in detail below, these bands are subunits of the cyclosome/APC. To examine whether all proteins present in the purified preparation are indeed subunits of the cyclosome, it was necessary to subject it to phosphatase treatment, since several phosphorylated subunits of the mitotic cyclosome have retarded and somewhat heterogeneous electrophoretic migration. Treatment of purified mitotic cyclosome preparation with λ phosphatase effectively dephosphorylated all subunits, as shown by the loss of all immunoreactivity with a mixture of anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies (Fig.1C, lane 2). In the untreated sample (Fig. 1C, lane 1), two prominently phosphorylated proteins with molecular mass of ∼125 and ∼70 kDa, were tentatively identified as phosphorylated Cdc27 and Cdc16, respectively. Silver staining showed that phosphatase treatment caused the conversion of four proteins to sharper bands of markedly more rapid electrophoretic migration (Fig. 1D). These were identified as APC1, Cdc27, Cdc16, and Cdc23 (lane 2), by the exact correspondence of their molecular mass to those reported for these subunits of unphosphorylated human cyclosome/APC (4Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 25Peters J.-M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Other protein bands present in the purified, phosphatase-treated cyclosome preparation were identified as APC2, APC5, and APC7 (Fig.1D, lane 2), again by the exact correspondence of their molecular mass to those of subunits of the human cyclosome/APC (4Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 25Peters J.-M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphatase treatment of the purified cyclosome preparation allowed us to conclude that the preparation is close to homogeneity, since all protein bands encompass those expected to be present in human cyclosome/APC. We next asked whether purified, dephosphorylated cyclosome preparation can be rephosphorylated by protein kinases Cdk1-cyclin B and/or Plk1. For this purpose, purified cyclosome preparation was subjected to treatment with λ phosphatase, as described above, and then phosphatase action was terminated by the addition of EGTA. This chelator effectively removes the Mn2+ ion, which is required for the activity of λ phosphatase (26Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Hakes D.J. Barford D. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17754-17761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, dephosphorylated cyclosome was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, in the presence of protein kinase Cdk1-cyclin B, Plk, or both. All incubations contained p13suc1, since this protein was shown to be required for the action of Cdk1-cyclin B to phosphorylate and activate the cyclosome (27Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2549-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Shteinberg M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Samples were precipitated with a polyclonal antibody directed against Cdc27 and were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation of cyclosomes was necessary to remove labeled, “autophosphorylated” cyclin B and Plk1 proteins. Without added protein kinase, there was no significant labeling of any protein band (data not shown), indicating the absence of protein kinases in the purified cyclosome preparation. Following incubation with Cdk1-cyclin B, several protein bands became labeled with32P-phosphate, most prominently a broad band that corresponds to the migration position of phosphorylated Cdc27 (Fig.2A, lane 1). The identification of this band was verified by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against Cdc27. As shown in Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and3, the incubation of purified, phosphatase-treated cyclosome preparation with Cdk1-cyclin B caused a marked retardation in electrophoretic mobility of the Cdc27 subunit. Cdk1-cyclin B also caused the phosphorylation of some other cyclosome subunits. As opposed to the robust phosphorylation of Cdc27 by Cdk1-cyclin B, this protein kinase phosphorylated to a much lesser degree some lower molecular mass subunits, such as a ∼70-kDa protein that corresponds to phosphorylated Cdc16 (Fig. 2A,lane 1). This is in contrast to the marked phosphorylation of the 70-kDa band (relative to that of Cdc27) in “naturally” phosphorylated, purified cyclosome preparation (Fig.1C, lane 1). These observations suggested that some other protein kinase(s) may be involved in the phosphorylation of Cdc16 and possibly of some other subunits of the cyclosome. In fact, incubation of purified, dephosphorylated cyclosome with Plk1 caused a much more prominent phosphorylation of Cdc16 and of a lower molecular mass subunit that corresponds to the expected position of Cdc23 (Fig. 2A, lane 2). By contrast, Cdc27 was phosphorylated by Plk1 to a much lesser degree, as shown either by the low incorporation of [32P]phosphate (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or by the less prominent electrophoretic mobility shift of the Cdc27 protein (Fig. 2B, lane 4). It thus seems that both protein kinases phosphorylate the same subunits of the cyclosome, but the relative degree of the phosphorylation of the different subunits is quite dissimilar. In addition, protein kinase Cdk1-cyclin B phosphorylates several proteins at the high molecular mass region of 200–250 kDa, which may represent different phosphorylated forms of APC1 (Fig. 2A,lane 1). These high molecular mass proteins are not phosphorylated significantly by Plk (Fig. 2A,lane 2). Incubation of dephosphorylated cyclosome with both protein kinases showed a phosphorylation pattern of the different subunits of the cyclosome expected by the additive action of the two kinases (Fig. 2A, lane 3). We have next examined the effects of cyclosome phosphorylation by the two protein kinases on its cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity in the presence of Cdc20. Purified, dephosphorylated cyclosomes were incubated with various protein kinases or their combination, and then protein kinase action was stopped by the addition of staurosporine. Subsequently, Cdc20 was added, and the cyclin-ubiquitin ligation activity of cyclosomes was determined in a further incubation. Using partially purified cyclosome preparations, we have previously observed nearly complete restoration of cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity by protein kinase Cdk1-cyclin B (6Lahav-Baratz S.

Commun. 2000; 271: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). With the purified preparation, we now find that Cdk1-cyclin B significantly increases the activity of dephosphorylated cyclosome. However, restoration of activity was only partial and did not exceed ∼40% of the control value even at high concentrations of Cdk1-cyclin B (Fig.3A). Incubation with Plk also significantly stimulated cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity, but the extent of maximal stimulation was even less than that observed with Cdk1-cyclin B and did not exceed ∼20% of the control value even at high concentrations of Plk (Fig. 3A). When dephosphorylated cyclosome was incubated with increasing concentrations of Cdk1-cyclin B in the presence of a constant amount of Plk, an additive activation could be seen, which greatly exceeded the limits observed with each separate protein kinase. Thus, up to 75% of cyclin-ubiquitin ligation activity was restored following incubation of dephosphorylated cyclosome with both Cdk1-cyclin B and Plk1 (Fig. 3B). This joint action of Cdk1-cyclin B and Plk required protein kinase activity, since restoration of cyclosome activity was completely prevented by the addition of the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (10 μm), prior to the supplementation of the two protein kinases (data not shown). Other control experiments showed that a similar preparation of catalytically inactive (N172A) mutant of Plk, when added in concentrations similar to those of wild-type Plk, had no significant action on either the phosphorylation or activation of dephosphorylated cyclosome (data not shown). This suggests that the observed effects of Plk are not due to some contaminating kinases, because such kinases would also contaminate the N172A mutant of Plk. A possible explanation for the joint action of the two protein kinases is that Cdk1-cyclin B phosphorylates and activates Plk, which in turn phosphorylates the cyclosome, as suggested by Kotani et al. (15Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.-M. Watanabe N. Hoog C. Hieter P. Todokoro K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 16Kotani S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, several observations argue against this possibility. (a) While these authors have used bacterially expressed, unphosphorylated Plk1, we have used enzymatically active, phosphorylated Plk1 produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells subjected to okadaic acid treatment (see “Experimental Procedures”). This preparation phosphorylates well at least some subunits of the cyclosome/APC (Fig. 2A). (b) casein is phosphorylated by polo-like kinases (21Qian Y.-W. Li E. Erikson C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) but not by Cdk1-cyclin B. We find that phosphatase treatment significantly reduced casein kinase activity of Plk1. However, subsequent incubation of this preparation with Cdk1-cyclin B did not restore casein kinase activity (Table I). (c) Qian et al. (29Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have identified two amino acid residues inXenopus Plk1, Ser-128 and Thr-201, as the phosphorylation sites responsible for the activation of this enzyme. These highly conserved phosphorylation sites are also present in human Plk1. Both residues are followed by a hydrophobic amino acid residue (and not by Pro) and thus cannot be targets for phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent kinase. The cumulative evidence thus strongly indicates that the joint action of protein kinases Cdk1-cyclin B and Plk1 on cyclosome activity is not due to the activation of Plk1 by Cdk1. It seems more reasonable to assume that it is due to the complementary pattern by which the different subunits of the cyclosome are phosphorylated by each protein kinase (see “Discussion”).Table IProtein kinase Cdk1-cyclin B does not stimulate the activity of polo-like kinaseIncubation 1Incubation 2Casein phosphorylated, percentage of control%Plk100Cdk1-cyclin B2Plk + phosphatase24Plk + phosphataseCdk1-cyclin B15In the first incubation, 200 units/μl Plk were incubated (or not) with 10 units/μl λ phosphatase, under conditions similar to those described for phosphatase treatment of cyclosome (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Samples were separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, and the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into α-casein was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. In this study, we have used highly purified preparations of cyclosome/APC from HeLa cells to define the roles of protein kinases Cdk1-cyclin B and Plk in the activation of its ubiquitin ligase activity. Following the last step of chromatography on MonoQ, the purified cyclosome preparation is well separated from most other proteins (Fig. 1) and has no detectable protein kinase or protein phosphatase activities. The purity of the preparation was indicated by the observation that following phosphatase treatment, the molecular mass of all proteins exactly corresponded to those of subunits of human cyclosome/APC (Fig. 1D). The development of this purification procedure was necessary because previous studies have used either partially purified preparations, in which indirect effects are possible, or immunoprecipitated cyclosome/APC preparations. We found that the cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity of cyclosome immunoprecipitated by a procedure similar to that used by other authors (8Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 15Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.-M. Watanabe N. Hoog C. Hieter P. Todokoro K. Mol.

This estimate agrees with the amounts of HeLa cell extracts (1.5–3 mg of protein) used by other workers for immunoprecipitation (8Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 22Yu G. Fang H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which yielded cyclin-ubiquitin ligation activity in immunoprecipitates comparable with that observed in ∼100-fold smaller amounts of crude extracts of HeLa cells (12Yudkovsky Y. Shteinberg M. Listovsky T. Brandeis M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that binding to immobilized antibody sterically hinders interactions of immunoprecipitated cyclosome/APC with ancillary proteins, substrates, or protein kinases. With the use of purified, dephosphorylated cyclosome preparations, we found that both protein kinases Cdk1-cyclin B and Plk directly phosphorylate different subunits of the cyclosome, but the pattern of phosphorylation of different subunits by the two protein kinases was not similar. Whereas Cdk1-cyclin B phosphorylated cyclosome subunits Cdc27 and APC1 to a much greater extent than did Plk, the opposite is the case with subunits Cdc16 and Cdc23 (Fig. 2). Each protein kinase can restore only partially cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity of dephosphorylated cyclosome, to limits that cannot be exceeded even at high concentrations of the protein kinases (Fig. 3A). However, following phosphorylation by both Cdk1-cyclin B and Plk, an additive and nearly complete restoration of cyclin-ubiquitin ligase activity was observed (Fig. 3B). It appears reasonable to assume that this joint action is due to complementary phosphorylation of the different subunits of the cyclosome by the two protein kinases, probably at different phosphorylation sites. Alternative explanations, such as the activation of Plk by Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation (15Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.-M. Watanabe N. Hoog C. Hieter P. Todokoro K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 16Kotani S. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), have not been confirmed (Table I). The present report clears up some of the confusion in the literature concerning the identity of the protein kinases involved in the activation of the cyclosome/APC at the end of mitosis. In agreement with our previous results with partially purified preparations (6Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Shteinberg M. Protopopov Y. Listovsky T. Brandeis M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 2000; 271: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as well as with recent genetic and biochemical data of Rudner and Murray in yeast (8Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), it seems that Cdk1-cyclin B has a direct and major (Fig. 3A) role in the phosphorylation and activation of the cyclosome. This provides a negative feedback loop, by which Cdk1-cyclin B triggers its own inactivation at the end of mitosis. An additional regulatory mechanism is provided by synergistic action of Plk. It is notable that levels of Plk also oscillate in the cell cycle, with a peak in mitosis (13Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus, the timely activation of cyclosome/APC in exit from mitosis may be ensured by its complementary phosphorylation by both mitotic protein kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2074920283,"E2F1 induces apoptosis via both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. The direct targets in the p53-independent pathway remain enigmatic; however, the induction of this pathway does not require the transactivation domain of E2F1. Using cells that are defective in p53 activation, we show that E2F1 potently represses the expression of Mcl-1 – an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member whose depletion results in apoptosis. We also show that this transcriptional repression is direct and dependent upon E2F1's DNA-binding domain, but does not require the transactivation domain of E2F1. Consistent with this DNA binding requirement of E2F1 to repress Mcl-1, we show that E2F1 binds to the Mcl-1 promoter both in vitro and in vivo, and have identified the DNA element (−143/−117) within this promoter that is required for E2F1 binding and repression. Additionally, cell lines constitutively expressing Mcl-1 are resistant to E2F1-mediated apoptosis – suggesting that Mcl-1 downregulation is a necessary event in the p53-independent apoptotic process. Thus, we identify a p53 family-independent mechanism of E2F1-induced apoptosis in which E2F1 directly represses Mcl-1 expression."

Using rational design, two 36-residue peptides, N36Mut(e,g) and N36Mut(a,d), were derived from the parent N36 peptide comprising the N-terminal helix of the gp41 ectodomain (residues 546–581 of HIV-1 envelope), characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation and CD, and assessed for their ability to inhibit HIV fusion using a quantitative vaccinia virus-based fusion assay.

In the context of the fusion process, the trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices in the pre-hairpin intermediate state may also exist as a monomer-trimer equilibrium (4.Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J.

If this is indeed the case, blocking the formation of the fusion-competent, homotrimeric coiled-coil of N-helices may provide another molecular target for inhibiting HIV cell fusion. In this article, we present the design and characterization of a peptide, derived from the N-helix of gp41, in which the sites of interaction with the C-helices have been mutated, but the sites of intermolecular contacts between the N-helices have been preserved. This peptide, which we term N36Mut(e,g), is about 50-fold more effective in inhibiting HIV Env-mediated cell fusion than the N36 peptide (residues 546–581 of HIV-1 Env) of gp41 from which it was derived. These data strongly suggest that the homotrimeric coiled-coil of N-helices in the pre-hairpin state can be disrupted. viral envelope glycoprotein(s) human immunodeficiency virus surface envelope glycoprotein of HIV transmembrane subunit of HIV envelope peptides encompassing residues 546–581 and 628–661 of HIV-1 Env, respectively g), peptide derived from N36 that contains nine substitutions at positionse and g of the helical wheel (defined in the context of the gp41 trimer of hairpins structure) corresponding to residues 549, 551, 556, 558, 563, 565, 570, 572, and 577 of HIV-1 Env d), peptide derived from N36 that contains nine substitutions at positions a and d of the helical wheel (defined in the context of the gp41 trimer of hairpins structure) corresponding to residues 552, 555, 559, 562, 566, 569, 573, 576, and 580 of HIV-1 Env viral envelope glycoprotein(s) human immunodeficiency virus surface envelope glycoprotein of HIV transmembrane subunit of HIV envelope peptides encompassing residues 546–581 and 628–661 of HIV-1 Env, respectively g), peptide derived from N36 that contains nine substitutions at positionse and g of the helical wheel (defined in the context of the gp41 trimer of hairpins structure) corresponding to residues 549, 551, 556, 558, 563, 565, 570, 572, and 577 of HIV-1 Env d), peptide derived from N36 that contains nine substitutions at positions a and d of the helical wheel (defined in the context of the gp41 trimer of hairpins structure) corresponding to residues 552, 555, 559, 562, 566, 569, 573, 576, and 580 of HIV-1 Env All peptides (Fig. 2b), purchased from Commonwealth Biotechnologies (Richmond, VA), were synthesized on a solid phase support, purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and verified for purity by mass spectrometry and amino acid composition. All peptides bear an acetyl group at the N terminus and an amide group at the C terminus. Concentrations of peptides were determined spectrophotometrically: the calculatedA280 values (1-cm path length) for a concentration of 1 mg/ml N36, N36Mut(e,g), N36Mut(a,d), and C34 are 1.35, 1.31, 1.34, and 2.90, respectively. The corresponding molecular masses are 4160, 4293, 4182, and 4286 Da, respectively. CD spectra of peptides (at a concentration corresponding to 0.7–0.8 A280) were recorded at 25 °C on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.05-cm path length cell. Quantitative evaluation of secondary structure from the CD spectrum was carried out using the program CDNN (www.bioinformatik.biochemtech.uni-halle.de/cd_spect/index.html; Ref. 24.Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 20.0 °C and three different rotor speeds (16,000, 20,000, and 24,000) on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Peptide samples were prepared in 50 mmsodium formate buffer (pH = 3) and loaded into the ultracentrifuge cells at nominal loading concentrations of ∼0.2 and 0.7–0.8A280. Data were analyzed in terms of a single ideal solute to obtain the buoyant molecular mass, M(1 − vρ), using the Optima XL-A data analysis software (Beckman). The value for the experimental molecular mass Mwas determined using calculated values for the density ρ (determined at 20 °C using standard tables) and partial specific volumev (calculated on the basis of amino acid composition (25.Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar)). Inhibition of HIV Env-mediated cell fusion by peptides was carried out as described previously (19.Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using a modification (26.Salzwedel K. Smith E. Dey B. Berger E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) of the vaccinia virus-based reporter gene assay (using soluble CD4 at a final concentration of 200 nm). B-SC-1 cells were used for both target and effector cell populations. Target cells were co-infected with vCB21R-LacZ and vCBYF1-fusin (CXCR4), and effector cells were co-infected with vCB41 (Env) and vP11T7gene1 at a multiplicity of infection of 10. For inhibition studies, peptides were added to an appropriate volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (2.5%) and phosphate-buffered saline to yield identical buffer compositions (100 μl) followed by addition of 1 × 105 effector cells (in 50 μl of medium) per well. After incubation for 15 min, 1 × 105 target cells (in 50 μl) and soluble CD4 were added to each well. Following 2.5 h of incubation, β-galactosidase activity of cell lysates was measured (A570; Molecular Devices 96-well spectrophotometer) upon addition of chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The curves for %fusion versus peptide inhibitor concentration were fit by nonlinear least-squares optimization using the program FACSIMILE (27.Chance E.M. Curtis A.R. Jones I.P. Kirby C.R.

Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Each C-helix interacts with two N-helices (one intra- and the other intersubunit): these contacts involve positions e andg of the N-helices and positions a andd of the C-helix (5.Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of the HIV-1 gp41 ectodomain core consisted of a complex of N36 and C34 peptides comprising residues 546–581 and 628–661, respectively, of HIV-1 Env (5.Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Using the N36 and C34 peptides as starting points, we designed two peptides: N36Mut(e,g), which can only undergo self-association but cannot interact with C34, and N36Mut(a,d), which can no longer self-associate but could potentially still interact with C34 (Fig. 2b). In the case of N36Mut(e,g), the residues at positions e andg of N36 have been replaced by residues at positionse and g of C34. Since the latter residues are located on the external surface of C34 in the context of the ectodomain gp41 core (4.Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Covell D.G. Gronenborn A.M.

Clore, unpublished data. this set of substitutions will prevent any interaction between N36Mut(e,g) and the C-region of gp41 in its pre-hairpin intermediate state while preserving the intermolecular contacts required to form the trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices. In the case of N36Mut(a,d), the residues at positions a andd of N36 have been substituted by residues at positionsf and c of C34, which are located on the solvent-exposed face of the ectodomain core of gp41 (4.Caffrey M.

The results of analytical ultracentrifugation on N36Mut(e,g) and N36Mut(a,d) are presented in Fig. 3a. N36Mut(e,g)behaves as a single monodisperse species at concentrations of ∼36 μm (in monomer; A280 ∼ 0.2) and ∼124 μm (in monomer; A280 ∼ 0.7) with a molecular mass of ∼12,000–12,500 Da, corresponding to a trimer. In this context it is worth noting that N36 on its own aggregates and does not form a well defined trimer (12.Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11187-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar),2presumably due to further self-association involving the predominantly hydrophobic residues at positions e andg, which have been substituted by predominantly hydrophilic residues in N36Mut(e,g) (Fig. 2b). N36Mut(a,d) also behaves as a single monodisperse species at a concentration of ∼140 μm(A280 ∼ 0.8), but its molecular mass is only ∼3700 Da, corresponding to a monomer. CD spectra of N36Mut(e,g) and N36Mut(a,d) are shown in Fig. 3b. N36Mut(e,g) displays a double minimum at 208 and 222 nm, characteristic of an α-helix; and quantification of the CD data (24.Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) indicates a helical content of ∼80%. N36Mut(a,d), on the other hand, is largely random coil (characterized by a minimum around 200 nm) with a small amount of α-helix (∼20%). We were unable to detect any evidence of interaction between either N36Mut(e,g) or N36Mut(a,d) and C34 by either analytical ultracentrifugation or CD. The absence of interaction between N36Mut(e,g) and C34 is exactly as predicted from the design since the points of contact with C34 have been mutated (cf. Fig. 2). The absence of interaction between N36Mut(a,d) and C34 was initially somewhat surprising since the residues that contact C34 in the context of the fusogenic/postfusogenic state of the gp41 ectodomain were preserved. This result therefore indicates that C34 can only form a complex with a stable trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices. From a structural standpoint, this is readily understood since each C-helix contacts two N-helices of the trimeric coiled-coil (one intramolecular and the other intersubunit; cf. Fig. 2a), and the buried surface area for each of the two interactions is comparable. To exclude the remote possibility that N36Mut(e,g) could behave in a manner analogous to C34 and bind to the surface of the trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices in the pre-hairpin intermediate of gp41, we also examined the interaction of N36Mut(e,g) with the engineered protein NCCG-gp41. NCCG-gp41 is a chimeric protein that features an exposed trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices that is stabilized both by fusion to a minimal thermostable ectodomain of gp41 and by engineered intersubunit disulfide bonds (19.Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The exposed trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices in NCCG-gp41 mimics that of the pre-hairpin intermediate of gp41, but in contrast to native gp41, the N-helices cannot dissociate since they are covalently tethered by disulfide bonds. Analytical ultracentrifugation on various mixtures of N36Mut(e,g) and NCCG-gp41 in ratios of 4.5:1 and 11.7:1 (24 μm N36Mut(e,g) plus 5.3 μmNCCG-gp41 and 51 μm N36Mut(e,g)plus 4.4 μm NCCG-gp41, respectively, with concentrations expressed in trimer) provided no evidence of any interactions between these two molecules, and the data were readily accounted for by a mixture of two ideal species. The results of a quantitative vaccinia virus-based reporter gene assay (26.Salzwedel K. Smith E. Dey B. Berger E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) for HIV Env-mediated cell fusion are shown in Fig. 4. N36 inhibits fusion with an IC50 of 16 ± 2 μm in agreement with previous results (19.Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). N36Mut(e,g) inhibits fusion with an IC50 308 ± 22 nm. Thus N36Mut(e,g) is ∼50-fold more active in inhibiting fusion than N36. N36Mut(a,d), on the other hand, fails to inhibit fusion even at concentrations as high as 0.1 mm. The lack of any fusion-inhibitory activity for N36Mut(a,d) is exactly as predicted from the biophysical data since N36Mut(a,d) does not self-associate and does not interact with C34. Since N36Mut(e,g) forms a well defined trimeric species that does not interact with either C34 or the chimeric protein NCCG-gp41 (in which the N-helices of the solvent-exposed trimeric coil-coil are covalently linked by interhelical disulfide bonds), it must target the N-region of the pre-hairpin intermediate by forming fusion-incompetent heterotrimers (Fig. 1b). Analytical ultracentrifugation on the ectodomain of gp41 indicates the presence of only monomer and trimer species in equilibrium (21.Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Zlotnick A. Hyde C.C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1653-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22.Caffrey M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1904-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); that is, assembly of the trimer is a highly cooperative process. The fusion-inhibitory activity of N36Mut(e,g) therefore indicates the presence of a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and trimeric forms of membrane-bound gp41 that allows subunit exchange to take place in the pre-hairpin intermediate state. The rate of exchange between these species must be sufficiently fast to permit efficient heterotrimer formation within the lifetime (∼15 min) of the pre-hairpin intermediate (13.Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 30.Jones P.L. Korte T. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31.Muñoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The inhibition curve for N36Mut(e,g) is well fit by a simple Langmuir isotherm given by %fusion = 100/(1 + [N36Mut(e,g)]/IC50) (Fig. 4). Yet, mechanistically, the interaction of N36Mut(e,g) with the pre-hairpin intermediate of gp41 is far more complex, involving multiple species in different homo- and hetero-oligomerization states. The simplest scheme describing the situation is presented in Fig. 5a. L and M represent N36Mut(e,g) and the pre-hairpin intermediate of gp41 in their monomeric forms, respectively; LL and MM are homodimers; ML is a heterodimer; LLL and MMM are homotrimers; and MML and MLL are heterodimers. We assume that only the homotrimer MMM is fusion-active, and the fraction fusion activity is given by the ratio of [MMM]LT/[MMM]LT = 0. The interactions between ligand (in its various oligomerization states) and membrane-bound protein (in its various homo- and hetero-oligomeric states) are described by their respective bulk solution concentrations. The interactions involving only membrane-bound species, however, are dependent on their concentrations in the two-dimensional membrane (i.e. number of molecules per unit area) that are much higher than their concentrations in bulk solvent. In terms of thermodynamics, all equilibria in Fig. 5a can be related to the species concentrations in bulk solvent by multiplying the relevant equilibrium constants by a factor λ to yield appropriate apparent equilibrium constants (Fig. 5a, middle panel). The measured equilibrium association constant Kreftrimerfor the ectodomain of HIV-1 gp41 in free solution (i.e. the trimer of hairpins) is 4.8 × 1011m−2 and is given by the product of the equilibrium association constantsK1 (monomer-dimer equilibrium) andK2 (dimer-trimer equilibrium) (Fig. 5a, bottom panel). Since trimerization of the gp41 ectodomain is highly cooperative (21.Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Zlotnick A. Hyde C.C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1904-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar),K2 ≫ K1. Taking Kreftrimeras a reference point, the overall equilibrium association constant between monomeric and homotrimeric species of L is given by α Kreftrimer, between monomeric and homotrimeric species of M by λ Kreftrimer(note that λ also subsumes any difference in the energetics of trimerization between the pre-hairpin intermediate in the membrane and the ectodomain of gp41 in free solution), and between monomeric species of L and M and heterotrimeric species of M and L by 3β Kreftrimer(where the factor 3 is a statistical factor). The scheme in Fig. 5a has three unknowns: α, β, and λMT, where MT is the total protein concentration (in monomer units). The data, however, are insufficient to determine all three parameters independently. Nonlinear least-squares fitting to the experimental data, optimizing the values of α and β, was carried out for values of λMT ranging from 1.5 × 10−7 to 1.5 × 10−3m (which corresponds to values of λ of 1.5 × 104–1.5 × 108 for MT = 10 pm, the probable concentration of protein in bulk solution, estimated on the basis of a concentration of 5 × 103cells/μl and ∼5000 gp41 trimers/cell). (Note that the concentrations of the various species in the scheme shown in Fig. 5a as a function of total ligand concentration, LT, were calculated numerically by integration of the differential equations describing the reactions to essentially infinite time.) The optimized values of α and β depend on the product λMT, and the results are therefore equally valid for a wide range of MT concentrations. The data can be equally well fitted for values of λMT ranging from 10−7 to 10−3m with α varying from ∼10 to 0.1 and β varying from 1 to 10 (Fig. 5b). Best fits to the experimental fusion inhibition data for λMT = 1.5 × 10−5 and 1.5 × 10−4m are shown in Fig. 5c; the optimized values of α are 1.07 and 0.34 (with error estimates of ∼40%), respectively, and of β are 2.97 and 5.76 (with error estimates of 10%), respectively. The resulting curves are essentially indistinguishable from each other as well as from that obtained with a Langmuir isotherm. The occupancy of the various species relative to MT and LT are shown in Fig. 5, d ande, respectively. For this set of parameters, the fraction M in the trimeric state in the absence of ligand is ∼86% for λMT = 1.5 × 10−5m and ∼97% for λMT = 1.5 × 10−4m; the value of LT at which 50% of L is monomeric is ∼2 × 10−6 and 5 × 10−6m, respectively. The occupancy of homodimeric ligand is less than 1% of LT; likewise the occupancy of homodimeric (MM) and heterodimeric (LM) protein is less than 1% of MT for all values of LT. Both MML and MLL heterotrimers are formed with the MML heterotrimer peaking at concentrations of LT slightly less than that at which 50% of the ligand is monomeric. The above calculations reveal two important findings. First, despite the complexities introduced by multiple homo- and hetero-oligomerization states, which might lead one to predict a complex relationship between fusion and total ligand concentration, a scheme such as that depicted in Fig. 5a can still yield rather simple inhibition data that is readily characterized by a Langmuir isotherm. Second, the values for the various equilibrium constants for trimerization required to best fit the experimental fusion data are entirely compatible with the experimentally measured value for the equilibrium constant for trimerization of the ectodomain of HIV-1 gp41 in solution. In the best fit calculations described above and depicted in Fig. 5, only the homotrimeric form of the pre-hairpin intermediate of gp41, MMM, is considered to be fusion-active. If the calculations are repeated assuming that the heterotrimer, MML, containing only one molecule of N36Mut(e,g), is also fusion-active, the resulting theoretical curves do not reproduce the experimental data. One can therefore conclude that the energetics of formation of a five-helix bundle comprising a heterotrimeric internal coiled-coil consisting of two N-helices of gp41 and one N36Mut(e,g)helix surrounded by two C-helices of gp41 is not sufficiently favorable to bring the target and viral membranes into sufficiently close proximity for fusion to take place. Using rational design, we have engineered two peptides derived from the N-helix of the ectodomain of gp41. The parent peptide, N36, corresponds to residues 546–581 of HIV-1 Env and encompasses the N-terminal helix of gp41. The N36Mut(a,d)peptide was designed to remove interactions leading to self-association and the formation of a trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices while preserving those residues that interact with the C-helix of the ectodomain of gp41. The absence of any fusion-inhibitory activity of N36Mut(a,d) leads us to conclude that the C-region of gp41 can only interact with a trimeric coiled-coil of N-helices. The N36Mut(e,g) peptide was designed to preserve the interactions leading to self-association while replacing those residues that interact with the C-region. N36Mut(e,g) forms a monodisperse trimer in solution that does not interact with the C-region of gp41 and yet still inhibits fusion about 50-fold more effectively than the native gp41 sequence (i.e. N36) from which it was derived. These results can only be explained by the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and trimeric coiled-coil forms of the N-region of gp41 in the pre-hairpin intermediate on a time scale sufficiently fast to permit subunit exchange and the consequent formation of heterotrimers of the N-helices of gp41 and N36Mut(e,g). Thus, N36Mut(e,g)disrupts the homotrimeric coiled-coil of N-helices in the pre-hairpin intermediate state of gp41 and represents a novel third class of gp41-targeted fusion inhibitor. The other two classes of inhibitors bind to either the homotrimeric coiled-coil of N-helices (e.g. C34 and T20) or to the exposed C-region (e.g. NCCG-gp41 and 5-helix) of gp41 in the pre-hairpin intermediate state. Since C34 (and presumably T20) also binds to NCCG-gp41 and 5-helix (19.Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20.Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), these two classes of inhibitors antagonize each other. In contrast, one would predict that the N36Mut(e,g) class of inhibitors should act either additively or synergistically with either of the other two classes. Therefore, N36Mut(e,g) may represent a promising lead for the design of clinically effective, novel fusion inhibitors. We thank A. Szabo for stimulating discussions, I. Nesheiwat and L.C.

To test this idea, we examined whether CT action in human intestinal T84 cells depends on membrane cholesterol. Chelation of cholesterol with 2-hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin or methyl β-cyclodextrin reversibly inhibited CT-induced chloride secretion and prolonged the time required for CT to enter the cell and induce toxicity.

Structurally, CT consists of two components. The pentameric B-subunit binds stoichiometrically to five GM1 gangliosides on the apical (lumenal) surface of intestinal epithelial cells, and the enzymatic A-subunit activates adenylyl cyclase inside the cell by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of the heterotrimeric GTPase Gs (1Lencer W.I. Hirst T.R. Holmes R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Activation of adenylyl cyclase in intestinal crypt epithelial cells leads to Cl− secretion, the fundamental transport event in secretory diarrhea. To induce disease, both A- and B-subunits must enter the host epithelial cell as a fully assembled holotoxin by moving retrograde through the biosynthetic pathway into the ER, 2Y. Fujinaga and W. I. Lencer, unpublished data.2Y. Fujinaga and W. I. Lencer, unpublished data. where the A-subunit unfolds, dissociates from the B-pentamer, and translocates to the cytosol, presumably by dislocation through the protein conducting channel sec61p (2Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The time between CT binding to GM1 at the cell surface and induction of toxicity has been termed the “lag phase.” The lag phase corresponds to the time required for trafficking CT into the ER, unfolding of the A-subunit by interaction with protein-disulfide isomerase, and finally dislocation of the A-subunit into the cytosol (2Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 3Lencer W.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G781-G786PubMed Google Scholar). In the model polarized intestinal epithelial cell line T84, CT function depends on B-subunit binding to (and possibly clustering) ganglioside GM1. Binding to GM1 anchors CT to the host cell membrane and associates CT with cholesterol-rich detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains, termed DIGs (detergent-insolubleglycosphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains) or lipid rafts (4Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Ferguson-Maltzman M. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). GM1 exhibits specificity for CT action in human intestinal epithelial cells, as the ganglioside GD1a does not substitute for GM1 as a receptor for toxin action or for association with lipid rafts in this cell type (4Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Ferguson-Maltzman M. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 5Badizadegan K. Dickinson B.L. Wheeler H.E. Blumberg R.S. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G895-G904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric toxins, for example, containing the A-subunit of CT assembled with the B-subunit of Escherichia coli toxin LTIIb, bound only to GD1a, did not associate with lipid rafts, and did not lead to a functional response (4Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Ferguson-Maltzman M. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we have recently proposed that the B-subunit-GM1 complex represents the sorting motif necessary for toxin trafficking retrograde into the Golgi apparatus and possibly ER of host eukaryotic cells. We have also proposed that such trafficking depends on association with lipid rafts and lipid raft function. To test this idea, we now examine whether CT action depends on membrane cholesterol. Lipid rafts are highly enriched in cholesterol, GPI-linked proteins, and glycosphingolipids, including ganglioside GM1, the receptor for CT. Abundant evidence indicates that raft structure and function in cellular metabolism, including certain forms of ligand-induced signal transduction, protein and lipid sorting, endocytosis, and transcytosis, depend critically on cholesterol (4Wolf A.A.

Demonstration of such sensitivity to membrane cholesterol has been taken widely as evidence for dependence on raft function in these cellular processes. With respect to CT and aerolysin toxin, another bacterial enterotoxin that binds membrane receptors located in lipid rafts, disruption of membrane cholesterol by the sterol-binding molecule filipin or by chelation with β-cyclodextrin has been shown to effect endocytosis and toxin action (16Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). On the other hand, whether lipid rafts function directly in CT endocytosis has recently been questioned (18Shogomori H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9182-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In some cellular systems, clathrin-mediated endocytosis displays sensitivity to disruption of membrane cholesterol (19Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 20Subtil A.S. Giadarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and although CT binds GM1 located both in lipid rafts and clathrin-coated pits, the toxin enters hippocampal neurons and A431 epithelial cells by clathrin-mediated mechanisms (18Shogomori H.

In the current study, we utilize 2-hydroxy and methyl β-cyclodextrin to examine CT trafficking and function in model epithelial cells acutely depleted in cholesterol (22Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancy P.G.

To control for general effects of cholesterol depletion on membrane dynamics, we utilize anthrax edema toxin (EdTx). Like CT, anthrax EdTx is a two component toxin. Both CT and EdTx enter polarized monolayers of intestinal T84 cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and both toxins induce an identical cAMP-dependent Cl− secretory response, but by different mechanisms. The enzymatic component of EdTx, termed edema factor, is itself a potent calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase that, unlike CT, translocates to the cytosol directly across the endosome membrane. Membrane translocation of edema factor and the induction of toxicity depend critically on entry of EdTx into an acidic endosomal compartment. Retrograde transport into Golgi cisternae or ER is not required (25Beauregard K.E. Wimer-Mackin S. Collier R.J. Lencer W.I. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3026-3030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, unlike CT, the membrane-binding component of EdTx, termed protective antigen, recognizes a receptor on T84 cell membranes that displays strict basolateral polarity, and the EdTx-receptor complex does not fractionate with lipid rafts (25Beauregard K.E. Wimer-Mackin S. Collier R.J. Lencer W.I. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3026-3030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that endocytosis and trafficking of CT into Golgi cisternae, as well as CT-induced Cl− secretion, depend on membrane cholesterol. Cholesterol depletion altered lipid raft structure and presumably function, and only partially displaced the CT-GM1 complex from lipid raft microdomains. Cholesterol depletion had no detectable affect on entry of anthrax EdTx into acidic endosomes, as assessed as an EdTx-induced Cl− secretory response. These data indicate that CT trafficking depends on toxin association with lipid rafts and imply that cholesterol may function in lipid raft structure to couple the CT-GM1 complex with raft domains and with other membrane components involved in membrane sorting or downstream signal transduction required for CT entry into the cell. Cholera toxin and cholera toxin B-subunit coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were obtained fromCalbiochem (San Diego, CA) or were recombinantly expressed. Anthrax edema toxin was a kind gift from Dr. R. John Collier (Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). 2-Hydroxy β-cyclodextrin, methyl β-cyclodextrin, cholesterol, and cholesterol analogues were obtained from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibody to pp60src was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) rabbit polyclonal antibody to caveolin-1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse monoclonal antibody to ecto-5′-nucleotidase from Linda Thompson (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to CT B-subunits were previously described (26Lencer W.I. Moe S. Rufo P.A. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. T84 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) were cultured and passaged as previously described (27Lencer W.I. Constable C. Moe S. Jobling M. Webb H.M. Ruston S. Madara J.L. Hirst T. Holmes R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Passages 80–92 were used for these studies. Monolayers used for electrophysiology and for toxin binding studies were grown on 0.33-cm2 polycarbonate filters (Costar, Corning, NY) and used 12–14 days after plating. Monolayers used for isolation of lipid rafts were grown on 45-cm2 filters and used 21 days after plating. Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) to which 10 mm HEPES was added and pH adjusted to 7.4 was used for all assays unless otherwise noted. Initial studies showed that cyclodextrins induced a progressive concentration- and time-dependent decrease in transepithelial resistance. We thus defined conditions for acute cholesterol depletion that preserved monolayer resistance using either 16.5 mm2-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (2OHβ-CD) or 4 mm methyl β-cyclodextrin (mβ-CD) applied to apical or basolateral cell surfaces of T84 cell monolayers for 1 h. To assay for cholesterol depletion, total cell lipids from T84 cell monolayers were extracted in chloroform, dried, and then resuspended in minimal volume (3 μl) of chloroform. Cholesterol content was analyzed per milligram of total cell protein by colorimetric assay using the Infinity cholesterol reagent according to the manufacture’s directions (Sigma Diagnostics). Absorbance was read at 500 nm on a Spectronic21D spectrophotometer (Milton Roy Products). For assessment of Cl− secretion (measured as a short circuit current, Isc), cells were treated as above with the appropriate cyclodextrin analogue for 1 h at 37 °C before adding CT (20 or 1 nm) to apical or basolateral reservoirs, respectively, in the continued presence or absence of cyclodextrin. The time course of toxin-induced Cl− secretion (Isc) and transepithelial resistance were measured as previously described (28Lencer W.I. Delp C. Neutra M.R. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To provide two point calibration for all studies, the cAMP agonist vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP, 10 nm) was applied to basolateral reservoirs at the end of each experiment (either 60 or 85 min after application of toxin). To replete monolayers with cholesterol, cholesterol and related sterols were complexed with mβ-CD as previously described and used at a final concentration of 0.2 mm sterol (29Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Specific toxin binding to apical membranes of T84 cell monolayers treated or not treated with 16.5 mm2OHβ-CD at 37 °C was measured. All incubations were done in buffer made of HBSS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After pretreatment, monolayers were cooled to 4 °C, and incubated with buffer alone or 100 nm CT B-subunit (to measure nonspecific binding) in buffer for 20 min. Monolayers were then washed and incubated apically with 20 nm CT B-subunit-HRP in buffer for 30 min on ice. Unbound toxin was removed by three washes with ice-cold HBSS. Cell surface-bound CT B-HRP was assessed by colorimetric assay using 30% hydrogen peroxide in 1 mm2,2′-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid in 100 mmcitrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.2, as previously described (4Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Ferguson-Maltzman M. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Specific binding of toxin to the cell surface was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total surface-bound toxin. T84 cells grown for 2 weeks on 0.33-cm2 filter supports were treated with 4 mmmβ-CD or buffer alone for 1 h at 37 °C, brought to 4 °C in HBSS, and incubated with 20 nm CT in the presence of 4 mm mβ-CD or buffer alone for 45 min at 4 °C. Monolayers were then warmed to 37 °C in the presence of apical 20 nm CT 16.5 mm mβ-CD or buffer for the indicated times, or kept at 4 °C for the duration of the experiment. All monolayers were then washed in ice-cold buffer to remove unbound toxin. Where indicated, cell surface-bound CT was removed by immersing each monolayer in HBSS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 10 s (to further release unbound toxin at the cell surface) and then immediately transferred to HBSS, pH 2.5, at 4 °C for 5 min. Each monolayer was then immersed for 5 min in HBSS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, and incubated again in HBSS, pH 2.5, at 4 °C for an additional 5 min. 97.5% ± 16.5% (n = 4) of CT was stripped from the cell surface using this procedure. After removal of cell surface-bound toxin, monolayers were cut from their filter supports, immersed in 5% SDS, and boiled for analysis of total cell-associated CT B-subunit. Sucrose equilibrium density centrifugation was performed as described previously (4Wolf A.A. Jobling M.G. Wimer-Mackin S. Ferguson-Maltzman M. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). One or two confluent 45-cm2 monolayers of T84 cells were used for isolation of detergent-insoluble membranes. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were scraped into 2 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-buffered saline containing 16.5 mm Tween 20 and a protease inhibitor tablet (containing EDTA, pancreas extract, Pronase, thermolysin, chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and homogenized by five strokes in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer on ice. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by adding 2 ml of 80% sucrose in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20, layered under a continuous 5–30% sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in a swinging bucket rotor (model SW41; Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The presence of a floating membrane fraction was noted visually, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the top. For step gradients, the cell homogenates in 4 ml of 40% sucrose were layered first under 5 ml of 30% sucrose, and then 5 ml of 5% sucrose was added to the top of the gradient. The step gradients were centrifuged as described above. Raft fractions were collected from the 30–5% interface and combined. Soluble material remained in the 40% sucrose fraction at the bottom of the gradient. For all gradients, fractions were normalized for protein content (Pierce BCA protein assay), analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted for the indicated proteins as previously described (30Lencer W.I. Constable C. Moe S. Rufo P.A. Wolf A. Jobling M.G. Ruston S.P. Madara J.L. Holmes R.K. Hirst T.R. J. Biol.

All signals were in the linear range. Raft and soluble fractions from some experiments were analyzed for 5′-nucleotidase (CD73) activity as previously described (31Resta R. Hooker S.W. Hansen K.R.

CT holotoxin was engineered to contain the sulfation consensus motif SAEDYEYPS at the C terminus of its B-subunits.2 Recombinant toxins were produced and purified as previously described (32Rodighiero C.

For in vivo sulfation experiments, T84 cells were first washed, incubated in sulfate-free HBSS for 30 min at 37 °C, and then incubated again for an additional 1 h in fresh sulfate-free HBSS. The monolayers were then incubated with 0.5 mCi/ml Na235SO4 in the same buffer for 30 min. The CT-variant toxin containing the sulfation motif was added to T84 cells both apically and basolaterally to a final concentration of 20 nm, incubated for 50 min at 37 °C, and then washed twice with ice-cold HBSS. Following total cell lysis, an immunoprecipitation using rabbit anti-CT-B antibodies as described previously (33Rodighiero C. Fujinaga Y. Hirst T.R. Lencer W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36939-36945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was performed. Samples were run on 10–20% denaturing Tris·HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were analyzed using Statview 512+ software (Brainpower, Inc., Calabasa, CA) We utilized the cyclodextrin analogues 2OHβ-CD and mβ-CD to determine whether the mechanism of CT action depends on membrane cholesterol. Initial studies showed that treatment of T84 cell monolayers with 2OHβ-CD caused a dose- and time-dependent loss of transepithelial resistance (TER), presumably because of direct effects of cholesterol depletion on tight junction structure (34Francis S.A. Kelly J.M. McCormack J. Rogers R.A. Lai J. Schneeberger E.E. Lynch R.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Verkade P. Foley C.S. Liang T.W. Innis-Whitehouse W. Eastburn K.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1771-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions were thus defined that depleted ∼50% of total cell cholesterol but maintained monolayer resistance intact throughout the time course of each experiment. Under optimal conditions, however, transepithelial resistance still fell progressively to 15% of initial values by the end of each time course (from 1035 ± 54 to 151 ± 22 Ω, n = 10), and the cAMP agonist VIP was used in all studies to calibrate measurement of Isc. Like CT, VIP increases intracellular cAMP in T84 cells by activating the heterotrimeric GTPase Gs. All subsequent events in the Cl− secretory response are identical. The alternative sterol-binding agent filipin could not be used in these experiments to deplete membrane cholesterol, as short 15-min incubations with filipin (7.6 μm) caused complete loss of monolayer resistance that prevented assessment of cell function by electrophysiology. T84 cells treated with 2OHβ-CD exhibited an attenuated response to apically applied CT. Fig. 1Ashows a representative time course of CT-induced Cl−secretion in monolayers depleted or not depleted in cholesterol. VIP was applied at 90 min to control for the effect of 2OHβ-CD on monolayer resistance as described above. 2OHβ-CD prolonged the “lag phase” by nearly 2-fold (Fig. 1, A and B) and diminished the apparent rate of toxin-induced Cl−secretion by >60% (ΔIsc = 0.98 ± 0.10 versus0.39 ± 0.08 μA/cm2/min, n = 8, control versus 2OHβ-CD-treated monolayers,p < 0.05). Peak Isc responses to apically applied CT were inhibited by 50% when calibrated against that induced by VIP (Fig. 1, A and C). 2OHβ-CD, however, had no detectable effect on the time course of Isc induced by basolaterally applied CT (data not shown). Two lines of evidence indicated that treatment with 2OHβ-CD did not inhibit CT action by depleting the toxin’s receptor ganglioside GM1 from cell membranes. First, T84 monolayers treated or not with 2OHβ-CD exhibited nearly identical densities of apical membrane receptors for CT (Fig.2A). Second, the effects of 2OHβ-CD were reversed completely by treatment with cholesterol alone (Fig. 2B). For these studies, 2OHβ-CD-treated monolayers were washed free of 2OHβ-CD and incubated for an additional 90 min in the presence or absence of excess cholesterol or the cholesterol analogues 25-hydroxycholesterol or cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol. Monolayers depleted in cholesterol and subsequently allowed to recover in buffer alone exhibited strongly attenuated CT-induced peak Isc values equal to that of T84 monolayers treated continuously with 2OHβ-CD (Fig. 2B, column 3 versus column 2). In contrast, monolayers pretreated with 2OHβ-CD and then allowed to recover in the presence of cholesterol exhibited peak secretory responses equal to that of control monolayers not treated with 2OHβ-CD (Fig.2B, column 6 versus column 1). Cholesterol-treated monolayers also exhibited recovery of the lag phase, consistent with the idea that depletion of membrane cholesterol affected a rate-limiting step required for toxin trafficking into the ER (lag phase = 31 ± 4 versus 48 ± 7 versus 37 ± 5 min, means ± S.E., n = 7–8, control versuscholesterol-depleted versus cholesterol-replete monolayers). Monolayers treated with the inactive cholesterol analogues cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol or 25-hydroxycholesterol exhibited only partial or no recovery (Fig. 2B, columns 5 and 4 versus control columns 1 and 6). Thus, the effect of 2OHβ-CD on CT-induced Cl− secretion was fully reversible and specific to cholesterol. Nonspecific effects of 2OHβ-CD on GM1 receptor density, if any, cannot explain these results. Taken together, these initial studies indicate that CT action on T84 cells, presumably because of toxin entry into the cell or trafficking retrograde into Golgi cisternae and ER, depends on membrane cholesterol.Figure 2Effect of 2OHβ-CD on GM1 receptor density and reversibility of inhibition by treatment with exogenous cholesterol.

E. coli possesses a type II fatty acid synthase system, and the double bond is introduced into the growing acyl chain at the ten-carbon β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP1intermediate (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Early genetic studies identified two genes, fabA and fabB, that were essential for olefin formation. Inactivating mutations in either one of these genes leads to an absolute requirement for unsaturated fatty acids for growth (1Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 612-636Google Scholar). FabA introduces the double bond into the acyl chain through its dual activities as a β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP dehydratase and a trans-2,cis-3-decanoyl-ACP isomerase (3Bloch K. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1971: 441-464Google Scholar). Because there is a second β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (FabZ) that only produces the trans-2 isomer (4Mohan S. Kelly T.M. Eveland S.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), unsaturated fatty acid formation also depends on the ability of the type II system to efficiently divert the cis-3 intermediate to the unsaturated branch of the elongation pathway. The FabB-condensing enzyme fulfills this function presumably by efficiently catalyzing the elongation of cis-3-decenoyl-ACP (1Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

ThefabA and fabB genes are always found together in bacterial genomes (6Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that these two gene products work in tandem to generate unsaturated fatty acids. FadR is a transcriptional regulator that modulates the expression of the fabB and fabA genes. FadR was discovered through the analysis of a mutation that results in the constitutive induction of the β-oxidation enzymes (7Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and led to its characterization as a repressor of fatty acid β-oxidation genes (8DiRusso C.C. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FadR is released from its DNA binding sites by long-chain acyl-CoAs (9DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which bind to the carboxyl terminus of the protein and release the amino-terminal winged helix domain from the DNA (13van Aalten D.M. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Xu Y. Li R.J. Heath Z. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). An interesting twist in the FadR story began with the observation thatfabA(Ts) fadR double mutants were unable to grow at the permissive temperature without an unsaturated fatty acid supplement (16Nunn W.D. Giffin K. Clark D. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 554-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested a positive effect of FadR onfabA expression, and it was soon demonstrated that FadR is a transcriptional activator that binds to the −40 region of thefabA gene, a site common for activators of σ70-responsive promoters (17Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). FadR is also a positive regulator of the fabB gene, although the changes infabB expression in fadR mutants are not as great as with fabA (19Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5982-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, FadR acts as a repressor of β-oxidation genes and an activator of the two genes required for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis (20Cronan Jr., J.E. Subrahmanyam S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The promoter regions of the fabA and fabB genes are highly related, suggesting that their expression is similarly regulated. The FadR binding site is not the only region of sequence similarity in the fabB and fabA promoters, and their alignment is shown in Fig. 1 with the sites of transcription initiation indicated by the arrows for both fabA(18Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and fabB (21Kauppinen S. Siggaard-Anderson M. van Wettstein-Knowles P. Carlsberg. Res. Commun. 1988; 53: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recently, McCue et al. (22McCue L. Thompson W. Carmack C. Ryan M.P. Liu J.S. Derbyshire V. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 774-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) used a bioinformatic “phylogenetic footprinting” method to identify putative transcription factor binding sites in bacterial genomes and located a strongly predicted site in the promoter regions of thefabA and fabB genes. They went on to show that a protein, YijC, specifically bound to a DNA affinity column carrying the predicted transcription factor palindrome (Fig. 1). The oligonucleotide 5′-GGCGTACAAGTGTACGCT was used to isolate YijC protein from E. coli cell-free extracts (22McCue L. Thompson W. Carmack C. Ryan M.P. Liu J.S. Derbyshire V. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 774-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The YijC binding sequence onfabB consists of a central CGTACAXXTGTACG palindrome, whereas the predicted site in fabA has a 2-bp mismatch (Fig. 1). Based on the location of these binding sites, McCue et al. (22McCue L. Thompson W. Carmack C. Ryan M.P. Liu J.S. Derbyshire V. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 774-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) proposed renaming the yijC gene fabR for FattyAcid Biosynthesis Regulator. However, there are no direct data demonstrating that FabR actually influences the levels of fabA or fabB mRNA or alters the production of unsaturated fatty acids by the pathway. The goal of this study was to determine whether FabR (YijC) regulates unsaturated fatty acid formation by examining the effects of deleting this gene on fatty acid metabolism. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc..

Open table in a new tab The gene targeting strategy shown in Fig. 2A was used to generate afabR deletion strain of E. coli. The 813-bp fragment upstream of fabR was amplified by PCR with primers PS (5′-CGCGAGCTCACATCTGTTGGATGATATGG, aSacI site is underlined) and PBr(5′-CGCGGATCCCATCACGATGTCTGAATCC, a BamHI site is underlined). The SacI-BamHI-digested 813-bp fragment was cloned into SacI-BamHI site of pUC19. The 788-bp fragment downstream of fabR was amplified similarly by PCR with primers PBf(5′-CGCGGATCCATGTGAAGGACGAGTAATG, a BamHI site is underlined) and PH (5′- CCCAAGCTTATACAACATCGCAGCTAAC, a HindIII site is underlined). Then the BamHI-HindIII-digested 788-bp fragment was inserted into theBamHI-HindIII site of the plasmid harboring the 813-bp upstream fragment. The BamHI-digested kanamycin-resistant gene fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of the plasmid harboring both the upstream (813-bp) and downstream (788-bp) PCR fragments, yielding plasmid pUCFabRK. This plasmid was digested with SacI and AflIII. The 3.3-kb fragment, containing both PCR fragments, kanamycin gene-replacingfabR and a 350-bp fragment of pUC19, was purified from 1% agarose gel. The 3.3-kb linear DNA (25 ng) was transformed into strain PDJ1 (recD) by electroporation, and kanamycin-resistant transformants were isolated. ThefabR::kan strain grew with the same doubling time as the wild type on both rich and minimal media. PCR and Southern blot analyses were used to confirm the genotype of the fabRdeletion strain. PCR experiments were performed with a primer pair, P1 (5′-GATCACTCCAGCACCATAG) and P2 (5′-TTACTGGAGCTGTACTGCG), to amplify a fragment encompassing 1 kb both upstream and downstream offabR. The PCR products from both wild type andfabR::kan strains were digested with enzymes NcoI, BamHI, and HindIII individually. Two other primer pairs, P1 and PK1(5′-ATCTTGTGCAATGTAACATCAGAG), PK2(5′-AGTCAGCAACACCTTCTTCACG) and P2, were used to amplify two 1-kb fragments in fabR::kan strain. The PCR products were purified from 1% agarose gel, and DNA sequencing was performed in the Hartwell Center with ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer. Southern blots were performed on genomic DNA isolated from both wild type and fabR::kan strains by the phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction method (26Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9099) Google Scholar). Three different restriction enzymes, NdeI, EcoRI, andScaI, were used to digest 5 μg of genomic DNA. The digested genomic DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. The probe was the 230-bp ClaI-ScaI fragment downstream of fabR (Fig. 2A), and was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Southern transfer, hybridization, and washing were carried out by standard procedures (27Brown T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 2.9.1-2.10.16Google Scholar). Bands were detected with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 imager, and their intensity was determined using the ImageQuaNT 5.1 program. Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells, both wild type andfabR::kan, using a MasterPure RNA purification kit (Epicentre Technologies). The same RNA sample was used for Northern blot, Affymetrix array, and TaqMan RT-PCR analyses. Briefly, cell pellets from 40-ml cultures were resuspended in lysis buffer (containing 0.17 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min. After removing the debris and proteins by centrifugation, the RNA was precipitated with isopropanol. The remaining DNA was removed by treating RNA preparations with DNase I (0.025 unit/μl) at 37 °C for 20 min. RNA samples were isopropanol-precipitated, washed twice with 75% ethanol, and redissolved in TE. Northern blots were performed with 10 μg of total RNA separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel. The probes were the 320-bp HincII-MunI fragment of plasmid pSJ21 (forfabA) and the 280-bp EcoRI-ClaI fragment of pDM4 (for fabB). Northern transfer, hybridization, and washing were performed using standard procedures (28Brown T. Mackey K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 4.9.2-4.9.8Google Scholar). Detection and quantitation of the blot was performed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 imager. Staining the membrane with methylene blue assessed equal loading of the samples, and the intensity of the bands was consistent in all lanes. Affymetrix array analyses were performed using messenger RNA species enriched by the specific degradation of the 16 S and 23 S ribosomal RNAs, which constitute 90% of the total prokaryotic RNA population. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Epicentre Technologies) and primers specific to 16 S and 23 S rRNA were used to synthesize the complementary cDNAs. Then rRNAs were removed enzymatically by treatment with RNase H. The cDNA molecules were degraded by DNase I digestion, and the enriched mRNAs were purified using Qiagen RNeasy columns. The RNA was fragmented by heat and ion-mediated hydrolysis, and the 5′-end RNA termini were enzymatically modified by T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATPγS. A biotin group was then conjugated to the thiolated RNA. After purification of the product (using the RNA/DNA mini kit, Qiagen), the efficiency of the labeling was assessed using a gel-shift assay based on the retardation of the biotinylated RNA upon addition of NeutrAvidin molecules. 1.5–4.0 μg of fragmented RNA (biotin-labeled target) was hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C to E. coli oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix) containing all known E. coli genes together with more than 2700 probe sets designed to intergenic sequences. Arrays were washed at 25 °C with 6 × SSPE (0.9 m NaCl, 60 mmNaH2PO4, 6 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20) followed by a stringent wash at 50 °C with 100 mm MES, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20. The arrays were then stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes), and the fluorescence intensities were determined using a laser confocal scanner (Hewlett-Packard). The scanned images were analyzed using Microarray software (Affymetrix). Sample loading and variations in staining were standardized by scaling the average of the fluorescence intensities of all genes on an array to a constant target intensity for all arrays used. The expression data were analyzed as previously described (29Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar). The signal intensity for each gene was calculated as the average intensity difference, represented by the formula, ∑(PM − MM)/number of probe pairs, where PM and MM denote perfect-match and mismatch probes. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for real-time RT-PCR were designed with Primer Express 1.0 software (ABI Prism, PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems), and the probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The probes consisted of an oligonucleotide labeled at the 5′-ends with the reporter dyes, 3FAM or VIC, and at the 3′-ends with the quencher dye TAMRA (PE Applied Biosystems) and are listed in Table II.Table IITaqMan primers and probes (5′ → 3′)GeneForward primerProbe, 5′-VIC or FAM and 3′-TAMRAReverse primeracpPAGCTGGTAATGGCTCTGGAAGAVIC-AGTTTGATACTGAGATTCCGGACGAAGACTGAACGGTGGTGATTTTCTCAfabACTCTGGTCGCGGTGAACTGTFAM-TGGCGCTAAAGGCCCGCAATTGGGTCCATCATCAGCATGTTCGfabBCTGGCGCGTGGTGCTCFAM-TGAAATCGTTGGCTACGGCGCAACAACCATGTCTGCACCATCAG Open table in a new tab The reverse transcription was performed on total RNA prepared as above after a second step of DNase I treatment (DNA-free, AMBION). The reverse transcription mixture (20 μl) contained 500 ng of total RNA, 10 ng/μl random hexamers (Invitrogen), 33 units of RNAguard Ribonuclease inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and 20 units/μl Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Aliquots (1 μl) of the reverse transcription reaction were added to the real-time PCR reaction (30 μl) containing 600 nm of each forward and reverse primer and 166 nm of probe. Amplification and detection of specific products was performed with the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems) with the following profile: 1 cycle at 50 °C, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. The critical threshold cycle (CT) is defined as the cycle at which the fluorescence becomes detectable above background and is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the initial template molecules. The CT values were used to calculate the relative number of fabA and fabB cDNA molecules in wild type and fabR::kanmutant. The quantity of cDNA for each experimental gene was normalized to the quantity of acpP cDNA in each sample. Cultures (10 ml) ofE. coli strains were grown to mid-log phase in M9 minimal medium (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 0.01% methionine, 0.0005% thiamin, and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in 1 ml of water, and the lipids were extracted as described by Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) and fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by the addition of 2 ml of HCl/methanol to the dry extract. The fatty acid methyl esters were fractionated using a Hewlett-Packard Model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a glass column (2 m by 4 mm, internal diameter) containing 3% SP2100 coated on Supelcoport (100/120 mesh) operated at 190 °C. Fatty acid methyl esters were identified by comparing their retention times with standards (Matreya). The condensing enzyme activity assay was essentially the same as described previously (31Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures (20 ml) of E. coli strains (fabF1 andfabR::kan fabF1) were grown to mid-log phase in M9 minimal medium (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 0.01% methionine, 0.0005% thiamin, and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French press cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The total cell lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell-free extract, a supernatant from ultracentrifugation, was saved for the assay. Protein content in the cell-free extract was determined with the Bradford assay using γ-globulin as the standard (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The condensation assay contained 45 μm myristoyl-ACP, 50 μm[2-14C]malonyl-CoA, 100 μm ACP, 25 ng of FabD (malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase) and the indicated concentrations of cell-free extract (0.1–1 μg) in a final volume of 40 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then reduced with borohydride, extracted into toluene, and quantitated by scintillation counting. One unit of condensing enzyme activity corresponds to the formation of 1 μmol of β-[14C]ketohexadecanoyl-ACP per minute. A targeting construct was prepared that replaced the fabR(yijC) gene with a kanamycin-resistance cassette as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the linearized fragment was transformed into strain PDJ1 (recD). Kanamycin-resistant transformants were selected, and a combination of PCR and Southern blot analysis were used to verify that the kanamycin gene was inserted in place of fabR in the correct position in the genome. Primers P1 and P2 were designed outside the sequence that was used in the targeting construct for linear transformation (Fig. 2A). Substitution of the kanamycin gene for fabR increased the size of the PCR product from these two primers by 600 bp. Thus, the PCR product from the fabR::kan strain with P1 and P2 was 3 kb in length (Fig. 2B, lane 2) compared with the 2.4-kb product from wild type cells (Fig. 2B, lane 1). When these two PCR products were digested with three restriction enzymes (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and6, NcoI; lanes 4 and 7,BamHI; and lanes 5 and 8,HindIII), the products were of the predicted sizes (Fig.2B). Sequence results of the PCR products read through the junction regions where the kanamycin gene was inserted (data not shown). PK1 and PK2 were designed from sequence of the kanamycin gene. PCR reactions with the two primer pairs, P1 and PK1, PK2 and P2, produced products of the correct size (1 kb) in the fabR::kanstrain indicating the presence of the kanamycin gene in the correct locations, whereas no products were detected with these two primer sets in wild type cells (data not shown). Results from Southern blot analysis with the 230-bpClaI-ScaI fragment corroborated the PCR results confirming that the kanamycin gene-replaced fabR gene in strain MWF1 was in the correct location without compromising the neighboring genes. The probe hybridized with a 650-bp fragment of wild type genomic DNA digested with NdeI (Fig. 2C,lane 5). The NdeI restriction site in thefabR gene disappeared in the fabR deletion strain, resulting in the probe hybridizing with a 3.2-kb fragment (Fig.2C, lane 6). The probe also recognized bands of the correct sizes in the EcoRI and ScaI digests (Fig. 2C). In the case of thefabR::kan strain, the fragments were larger by 600 bp due to the presence of the kanamycin gene in place offabR. The effect of FabR deletion on the production of the major membrane fatty acids of E. coli was determined. Strain PDJ1 synthesized slightly more saturated fatty acids (SFA) than unsaturated fatty acids (UFA). The UFA:SFA ratio was 0.87, and the amount ofcis-vaccenate (C18:1Δ11) and palmitoleate (C16:1Δ9) was approximately the same (TableIII). 2The fatty acids are abbreviated as: 18:1Δ11, number of carbon atoms:number of double bonds; Δ, the location of the double bond.Strain MWF1 (fabR::kan) produced significantly more UFA increasing the UFA/SFA ratio to 1.77. Unlike the wild type cells, C18:1Δ11 was the predominant UFA species in thefabR::kan strain. A similar alteration of fatty acid composition was observed in cells that expressedfabB from a multicopy plasmid (pDM4) (Table III). In both cases, the 18:1/16:1 ratio was significantly increased (Table III). The similarity between the fatty acid composition alterations due to FabB overexpression (Table III and Ref. 24de Mendoza D. Klages Ulrich A. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2098-2101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the composition of thefabR::kan strain pointed to an increased level of fabB expression as the underlying cause for the increased UFA and altered 18:1/16:1 ratio in strain MWF1. In contrast, increased expression of the fabA gene actually slightly elevated the amounts of SFA in the membranes (Table III) consistent with previously reported results (33Clark D.P. de Mendoza D. Polacco M.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5897-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The activity of FabF regulates the cellular content of 18:1Δ11 (24de Mendoza D. Klages Ulrich A. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2098-2101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

Sci. 1983; 8: 49-52Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar), therefore, we transduced the fabR::kan allele into strain SJ109 (fabF1) and examined the fatty acid composition to test if the regulation of FabB alone was responsible for the elevation in UFA. As expected, the fabF1 mutant had reduced amounts of C18:1Δ11. The 18:1Δ11 levels in thefabR::kan fabF1 double mutant were elevated compared with the fabF control and were similar to the amount of C18:1Δ11 in the wild type cells (Table III). These compositional data strongly support the conclusion that FabR acts as a repressor of fabB, which in turn, modifies the membrane fatty acid composition.Table IIIFabR regulation of fatty acid compositionStrain (genotype)/plasmidC16:03-aFatty acids that comprised less than 1.5% of the total are not listed.C18:0C16:13-bThe contributions of the respective cyclopropane derivatives were included in these percentages.C18:13-bThe contributions of the respective cyclopropane derivatives were included in these percentages.UFA/SFA18:1/16:1PDJ148.41.923.220.60.870.89MWF1 (fabR::kan)32.02.215.045.41.773.03JT10 (UB1005/pDM4(fabB))31.44.913.045.11.603.47MWF2/pSJ21 (f"
https://openalex.org/W2046604039,"The intracellular signals driving the proliferation of breast carcinoma (BC) cells have been widely studied. Both the mitotic and metastatic potential of BC cells have been linked to the frequent overexpression of ErbB family members. Other signaling molecules, including the estrogen receptor, the tyrosine kinases c-Src and Syk, and STAT proteins, especially STAT3, have also been implicated in BC tumor growth. Here we have examined ErbB and STAT protein expression and activation in six BC-derived cell lines. ErbB expression and tyrosine phosphorylation varied considerably among the six cell lines. However, STAT protein expression and activation were more consistent. Two levels of STAT3 activation were distinguished in DNA-binding assays: an epidermal growth factor-inducible, high level that requires both ErbB1 and Janus kinase (JAK) activity and an elevated serum-dependent level that is maintained by autocrine/paracrine signaling and requires JAK activity but is independent of ErbB1 kinase activity. BC cell growth could be inhibited by dominant-negative versions of STAT3 and the JAK inhibitor AG490 but not by PD153035 or PD168393, inhibitors of ErbB1 kinase activity. This indicates that BC cell proliferation may be a consequence of STAT3 activation by autocrine/paracrine signals."

Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of bcl-2expression is a general response of the cell to apoptotic stimuli (2Suzuki A. Matsuzawa A. Igushi T. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar,3Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wand H.-G. Lin H.-K. Hoffman B. Lieberman D. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Bcl-2 exerts a protective activity against apoptosis are still unclear, but the mechanism by whichbcl-2 expression is regulated has recently been partially elucidated. A large amount of evidence indicates that up- and down-regulation of bcl-2 expression is modulated both at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, the latter of which includes mRNA stability and protein activity control. Expression of the bcl-2 gene was known to be regulated transcriptionally by a negative regulatory element (4Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Two estrogen-responsive elements within the coding region involved in transcriptional regulation ofbcl-2 have also been characterized recently in a breast cancer cell line (5Perillo B. Sasso A. Abbondanza C. Palumbo G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2890-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). One of the posttranscriptional control mechanisms of bcl-2 expression has been described to be mediated by phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein at different amino acid positions (6Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3431-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,7Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1886-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Another posttranscriptional mechanism of bcl-2regulation has been identified in our laboratory. This mechanism modulates bcl-2 mRNA stability and involves a cis-acting A + U-rich element (ARE)1 located in the 3′-UTR of bcl-2 mRNA (8Schiavone N. Rosini P. Quattrone A. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Citti L. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that binds to a number of ARE-binding proteins (AUBPs) whose pattern undergoes modifications during apoptosis in association with bcl-2 mRNA decay (9Donnini M. Lapucci A. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Brewer G. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. Schiavone N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). AREs represent a class of cis-acting elements that modulate mRNA stability (10Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). They are present in a variety of mRNAs of genes required to be rapidly and finely modulated under particular conditions, such as response to growth factors, serum starvation, and apoptosis (8Schiavone N.

Compared with the AREs of these genes (16Winstall E. Gamache M. Rayamond V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3796-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the bcl-2 ARE possesses a moderate, constitutive, destabilizing activity that is dramatically enhanced upon application of apoptotic stimuli (8Schiavone N.

The mechanism of action of ARE-mediated mRNA decay is under investigation by many laboratories. A number of AUBPs acting as trans-acting factors are known. In particular, some AUBPs belonging to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family are involved in mRNA localization and stability control (17Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 18Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Among them, AUF1 and the embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like protein HuR are able to enhance or inhibit mRNA degradation, respectively. For example, there is evidence for binding and stabilization of c-fos, plasminogen activator inhibitor 2, and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNAs by HuR (19Peng S.S. Xu C.Y. Chen N. Shyu A.B.

Carcinog. 2000; 28: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This protein has also been implicated in the increase of p53-induced p21waf1 mRNA after apoptotic stimuli (24Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). AUF1 was first identified as an mRNA-binding protein with selective affinity for AREs located within mRNAs such as c-myc, c-fos, and GM-CSF (25Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 26Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Although its destabilizing function is well documented, some studies suggest that AUF1 may have a role in the stabilizing complex on the α-globin mRNA (27Kiledijian M. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 11: 4870-4876Crossref Google Scholar) and, more recently, as a parathyroid hormone mRNA-binding protein that modulates mRNA stability (28Sela-Brown A. Silver J. Brewer G. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7424-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). AUF1 is comprised of four isoforms of 37, 40, 42, and 45 kDa (25Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell.

DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although the role of each isoform has yet to be fully characterized, a direct correlation has been observed between each AUF1 isoform’s binding affinity and its RNA-destabilizing activity toward different AREs, with isoforms p37 and p42 being the most effective (31De Maria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that AUF1 is a bcl-2 mRNA-binding protein and that potentially all its isoforms are able to form complexes with the bcl-2 ARE. At doses able to induce apoptosis, UVC irradiation induced an increase of cytoplasmic levels of the p45 AUF1 isoform, which was paralleled by enhancement of a bcl-2 mRNA-AUF1 complex and mediated by a mechanism that requires caspase activation. These results indicate that ARE-mediated bcl-2 mRNA down-regulation during apoptosis involves AUF1 and suggest different roles for its four isoforms. The schematic diagram of bcl-2 mRNA and the sequences of ARE segments used for either in vitrotranscription or cell transfection are shown in Fig. 1.

Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) as template, with 5′-TCAGCTATTTACTGCCAAAG-3′ forward and 5′-GATTTCCAAAGACAGGAG-3′ reverse primers. The bcl-2 ARE product was cloned in pCRII as described above, yielding pCRII/bcl-2 ARE to synthesize thebcl-2 ARE riboprobe. The remaining polylinkers of pCRII/bcl-2 ARE+, pCRII/bcl-2 ΔARE, and pCRII/bcl-2 ARE were removed by ApaI digestion and religation. Plasmids pBBB4 (obtained by Dr. Ann-Bin Shyu, University of Texas, Houston Health Science Center, Houston, TX) and pBBB-U1 have been described previously (8Schiavone N. Rosini P. Quattrone A. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Citti L. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBBB-U2 was obtained by cloning the BglII/BamHI segment of pCRII/bcl-2 ΔARE into the unique BglII site of plasmid pBBB4. Plasmids pBBB4, pBBB-U1, and pBBB-U2, used for RNase protection analysis of mRNA stability, contain the rabbit β-globin gene transcriptionally driven by the serum-inducible c-fos promoter (pBBB4) with inserted the bcl-2ARE (pBBB-U1) or bcl-2 ΔARE (pBBB-U2). The Jurkat T-cell leukemia line (clone E61; European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere, 5% CO2, at 37 °C. The two mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 polyclonal cell lines transfected with plasmids pBBB4 or pBBB-U1 have been described previously (8Schiavone N. Rosini P. Quattrone A. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Citti L. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The third NIH 3T3 polyclonal cell line was obtained upon transfection with plasmid pBBB-U2 described above. All NIH 3T3 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented as described above for RPMI 1640 medium. Reporter β-globin mRNA stability was determined by the serum-inducible transcriptional pulse system reported previously (8Schiavone N. Rosini P. Quattrone A. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Citti L. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The plasmids pCRII/bcl-2ARE+, pCRII/bcl-2 ΔARE, and pCRII/bcl-2 ARE were linearized with SmaI and used for in vitrorun-off transcription from the T7 promoter using an RNA labeling Kit (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) to obtain three radiolabeledbcl-2 ARE riboprobes (Fig. 1). The isoforms of AUF1 were prepared from 1 μg of each of four different pcDNA-AUF1 plasmids (p45, p42, p40, and p37). Templates p45 and p42 were prepared byNotI digestion, whereas templates of p37 and p40 were prepared by ApaI digestion. The cDNAs were in vitro-transcribed/translated in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) with the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells (107) induced to apoptosis by irradiation with UVC (15 J/m2, 254 nm), with or without a 2-h pretreatment with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk (Bachem AG), were collected at various time points, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 s in a microcentrifuge, and extracts were processed immediately or stored at −70 °C. REMSAs were performed by incubating the radiolabeledbcl-2 ARE+, bcl-2 ΔARE, and bcl-2ARE riboprobes (5 × 105 cpm) with cytoplasmic protein extracts (30 μg, determined by BCA reagent; Pierce) or with in vitrosynthesized AUF1 isoforms in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 15 units of RNasin (Promega), and 50 μg of heparin for 20 min at room temperature, followed by digestion for 20 min at room temperature with 5 units of RNase T1 (La Roche Ltd.), which cuts RNA downstream to guanosine residues in a number of fragments. Samples were separated on a native polyacrylamide gel (6% polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide, 60:1). In REMSA/supershift experiments, RNase T1 was added after incubation of samples with 50 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-AUF1 antibody (Ab) or with nonspecific control anti-transketolase (TK) polyclonal Ab, a kind gift of Prof. F. Paoletti (University of Florence), for 20 min at room temperature, electrophoresed as described above, and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Cytoplasmic proteins (50 μg, prepared as described above) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted (Miniprotean apparatus; Bio-Rad) onto Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and detected with ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences) with 300 ng/ml anti-AUF1 Ab. Each isoform was identified on the basis of molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of cytoplasmic proteins (50 μg, prepared as described above) were incubated with the 32P-labeled bcl-2 ARE riboprobe (109 cpm/μg, 5 × 105 cpm) in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml heparan sulfate and 2 μg of tRNA in a microplate (total volume, 10 μl) at room temperature for 10 min. RNA-protein complexes were cross-linked on ice by exposure to UVC for 5 min with 3000 μW/cm2 in a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). Samples were incubated with RNase A (1 μl, 1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C to digest unbound RNA. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by a 1-h incubation with polyclonal anti-AUF1 rabbit Ab (10 μg/ml), followed by overnight incubation with protein A-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, autoradiographed, and analyzed by a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The molecular mass of each complex was evaluated on the basis of the in vitro-synthesized radiolabeled isoforms used as external standards and molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad). The yeast strain L40-coat and plasmids pIIIA/MS2-1, pIIIA/IRE-MS2, pAD-IRP1, and pACT2 (34Kraemer B. Zhang B. Sen Gupta D. Fields S. Wickens M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 297-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. M. Wickens (University of Wisconsin). The plasmid pRevR2 (35Putz U. Skehel P. Kuhl D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4838-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. U. Putz (University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany). The hybrid RNA vector pIIIA/MS2-B2ARE harbors the 107-nucleotide sequence of the bcl-2 ARE region. The sequence was PCR-amplified from pBS-SK-H-Bcl-2, with 5′-GACCCGGGTCAGCTATTTACTGCCAAAG-3′ forward and 5′-GACCCGGGGATTTCCAAAGACAGGAG-3′ reverse primers, subcloned in pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and inserted into the SmaI site of plasmid pIIIA/MS2-1. The resulting plasmid, pIIIA/MS2-bcl2, was transformed into L40-coat, and the chimeric RNA levels were assayed by Northern analysis (data not shown). To prevent transcription termination due to an RNA polymerase III termination signal in the poly-U stretch, a mutation at nucleotide 981 was introduced by PCR. The mispaired primers 5′-CATTTATTTgTTACATTATTAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTAATAATGTAAcAAATAAATG (reverse) were used to insert a single-base substitution (T→G, as indicated by lowercase letters), and the resulting segment was cloned into the pIIIA/MS2-1 plasmid as described previously. The AUF1 cDNA corresponding to the first 257 amino acids of p37 was amplified from pBAD/HISB-p37AUF1 (36Wilson G. Brewer G. Methods. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with the 5′-GAGGATCCGAATGTCGGAGGAGCAG-3′ forward and 5′-GACTCGAGTCTTCCTGCAAATCCTCC-3′ reverse primers to test the interaction between AUF1 and bcl-2 ARE. The PCR product was digested and inserted into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pACT2, in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain. In previous work (9Donnini M. Lapucci A. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Brewer G. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. Schiavone N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the mRNA-destabilizing ARE of bcl-2 binds specifically to cytoplasmic AUBPs, whose pattern undergoes modifications during apoptosis. The observation that proteins ranging from 30–50 kDa underwent the most noticeable increase led us to hypothesize that AUF1 could be a bcl-2 ARE-binding protein. To examine this possibility, REMSA supershift analysis of cytoplasmic protein complexes with bcl-2 ARE radiolabeled riboprobes (Fig.1) has been carried out using an anti-AUF1 Ab and a nonspecific control anti-TK Ab (Fig.2). When bcl-2 ARE+ orbcl-2 ARE riboprobes are used, the anti-AUF1 Ab (lane 3 of each panel), but not the nonspecific anti-TK Ab (lane 4 of each panel), is able to produce a supershifted complex, indicating AUF1 binding. By contrast, when the bcl-2 ΔARE riboprobe (in which the 107-nt ARE core was deleted) was used, supershift did not occur, indicating no AUF1 binding. Other REMSA experiments have been carried out with each AUF1 isoform (p37, p40, p42, and p45) synthesized in vitro. As shown in Fig.3, all AUF1 isoforms shiftbcl-2 ARE+ and bcl-2 ARE riboprobes but not thebcl-2 ΔARE riboprobe, indicating that binding of thebcl-2 mRNA to AUF1 requires the ARE core.Figure 3Binding of all AUF1 isoforms to thebcl-2 ARE. All AUF1 isoforms synthesized in vitro were assayed in REMSA experiments for RNA binding activity with the three ARE riboprobes.

Complexes are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the possibility that mRNA destabilizing activity and AUF1 binding of the bcl-2 ARE are two related events, analysis of mRNA half-life in cells expressing a reporter gene with or without the bcl-2 ARE was performed. For this purpose, three NIH 3T3 cell lines stably expressing a rabbit β-globin gene transcriptionally driven by the c-fos serum-inducible promoter with either bcl-2 ARE+ (pBBB-U1) or the ARE-deletedbcl-2 ΔARE (pBBB-U2) or without insert (pBBB4) were used. Following serum addition to induce a pulse of transcription of each reporter gene, total RNA was extracted at various times, and β-globin mRNA levels were quantitated by RNase protection using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard (Fig.4). With respect to the β-globin transcript without insert (BBB4), the insertion of bcl-2ARE+ (BBB-U1), which binds AUF1, reduces the half-life of reporter mRNA by 6-fold (from >12 h to 2 h). The insertion ofbcl-2 ΔARE (BBB-U2), which does not bind AUF1, does not affect the half-life of β-globin mRNA. All these results clearly indicate that the 107 nt of the ARE ofbcl-2 (shared by bcl-2 ARE and bcl-2ARE+), but not its flanking regions (bcl-2 ΔARE), contain the binding site for AUF1 and are also required for mRNA destabilizing activity. Thus, we have used the bcl-2 ARE as a riboprobe in further experiments. We assumed that the smallest isoform, p37, was the prototype of AUF1 because its entire sequence, harboring two RNA recognition motifs, is contained in the other three isoforms. The yeast RNA THS was used to demonstrate that recombinant p37 binds to the ARE of bcl-2 in vivo (Fig. 5). The reporter gene activation of the host yeast was tested in parallel with the indicated positive and negative controls. The 1–257-amino acid segment of p37 containing the two RNA recognition motifs of AUF1 elicited the activation of both LacZ and HIS3 genes, clearly demonstrating that binding of AUF1 to the bcl-2 ARE also occurs in vivo (Fig. 5). The possibility that enhanced decay of bcl-2 mRNA during apoptosis (8Schiavone N. Rosini P. Quattrone A. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Citti L. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Donnini M. Lapucci A. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Brewer G. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. Schiavone N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is associated with changes of AUF1 levels was evaluated. Jurkat cells were irradiated with UVC at a dose previously established to commit cells to apoptosis (data not shown). REMSA experiments demonstrated an increase of the supershifted AUF1-bcl-2 ARE complex at 8 h compared with no UVC (Fig. 6, comparelane 3 with lane 4). To establish the involvement of the AUF1 isoforms in the increase of supershifted complex, we carried out time course Western blot analyses and immunoprecipitation experiments of UV-cross-linked complexes with anti-AUF1 Ab (Fig.7, a and b, respectively). Each AUF1 isoform was identified by immunodetection and comparison with standard molecular mass markers. During the time course (0–10 h) after apoptotic stimulation (Fig. 7a), the cytoplasmic p45 isoform markedly increased within 2 h after UVC irradiation, peaking at 10 h. Pretreatment with Z-VAD-fmk attenuated this increase by 2–3-fold. The increase of p37 and p40/p42 isoforms after UVC irradiation was very low and was not affected by Z-VAD-fmk pretreatment. To determine whether the AUF1 variations observed during apoptosis are accompanied by an increase of some isoform-specific ARE binding activity, immunoprecipitation analyses of UV-cross-linked complexes were performed (Fig.7b). Standard molecular mass markers and labeled AUF1 isoforms translated in vitro and run in the same gel were used for comparison. During the time course, the AUF1 isoform-bcl-2 ARE complex with an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kDa underwent a marked increase, which paralleled the increase of p45 AUF1 (Fig. 7a) in Western analysis and, analogously, is attenuated by pretreatment with Z-VAD-fmk. Another complex with lower molecular mass (about 37 kDa) was detected as a very faint band. No other complexes have been detected within the molecular mass range of the AUF1 isoforms. The additional bands with higher molecular masses observed in the immunoprecipitate (indicated bydouble-headed arrows) may represent AUF1 isoform dimers or multimers stabilized by UV-cross-linking. From all described results, we conclude that AUF1 is a bcl-2 AUBP and that an isoform-specific mechanism is involved in ARE-mediated bcl-2mRNA decay during apoptosis. Furthermore, our results suggest that the p45 AUF1 isoform is the most likely candidate to play a pivotal role in this mechanism.Figure 7Effect of UVC irradiation on AUF1 levels andbcl-2 ARE/AUF1 binding. Western blots (a) and immunoprecipitations (b) were carried out with cytoplasmic extracts from Jurkat cells obtained at various time points after UVC irradiation that had been pretreated or not pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk, as indicated. In Western blot analysis, immunodetection and molecular mass markers run in the same gel were used to identify each AUF1 isoform. In immunoprecipitation experiments, the extracts were cross-linked with the bcl-2 ARE riboprobe before incubation with the anti-AUF1 Ab. The molecular mass of the complexes was evaluated on the basis of labeled, in vitro-synthesized AUF1 isoforms and molecular mass markers run in the same gel.Double-headed arrows in b indicate other complexes with higher molecular masses than the 45-kDa complex. Quantitations of Western blots and immunoprecipitations are shown to the right in each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) bcl-2 is one of the most studied apoptosis-related genes and is also implicated in cell cycle progression and cell differentiation. The expression of bcl-2 can be finely tuned by a variety of environmental or endogenous stimuli and regulated at both transcriptional (5Perillo B. Sasso A. Abbondanza C. Palumbo G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2890-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 33Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J.

Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The diverse modes of regulation of bcl-2 expression probably reflect different requirements for down- or up-regulation in different physiological conditions or in pathological processes. We described a posttranscriptional level of regulation ofbcl-2 expression that is mediated by an ARE in the 3′-UTR ofbcl-2 mRNA. Under normal conditions, this element has a moderate destabilizing activity toward the bcl-2 transcript. This activity increases following apoptotic stimuli, leading to enhanced bcl-2 mRNA degradation (8Schiavone N. Rosini P. Quattrone A. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Citti L. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).

AUF1 is a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein protein implicated in mRNA stability regulation, and it shuttles dynamically between the nucleus and cytoplasm (43Arao Y. Kuriyama R. Kayama F. Kato S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the four isoforms of AUF1, namely, p45, p42, p40, and p37 (29Sheflin L.G. Spaulding S.W. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 278: E50-E57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), are present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of Jurkat cells (data not shown), all our experiments have been carried out using cytoplasmic extracts because the cytoplasm is the compartment of mRNA degradation. The binding of AUF1 to the ARE of bcl-2 was demonstrated in vitro by means of supershift REMSA experiments. The cytoplasmic extracts were incubated simultaneously with bcl-2 ARE radiolabeled riboprobes and either anti-AUF1 or anti-TK Ab. In these experiments, only the specific anti-AUF1 Ab was able to supershift the bcl-2 ARE-protein complex. All AUF1 isoforms (p37, p40, p42, and p45) have the potential to bind to the bcl-2 mRNA, as indicated in vitro by results obtained in REMSA experiments carried out with each single in vitro-synthesized isoform. Using p37, considered as the AUF1 prototype, in the yeast RNA THS we demonstrated that the AUF1 RNA binding motifs common to all four isoforms are also able to bind to the bcl-2 ARE in vivo. Deletion of the evolutionary conserved ARE segment particularly rich in AU motifs (and therefore considered as the ARE core) not only abolishes the ability of the bcl-2 ARE to bind AUF1 but also abolishes its mRNA destabilizing activity. This indicates that the deleted segment harbors the binding site for AUF1 and that AUF1 is required as a trans-acting factor for functional activity of the bcl-2ARE. The implication of AUF1 as a trans-acting factor involved in ARE-mediated, bcl-2 mRNA degradation during apoptosis was further demonstrated by results obtained in supershift REMSA experiments carried out after UVC irradiation of cultured cells. Furthermore, we found that the level of the p45 isoform, as evaluated by Western blot, increased markedly until 10 h after UVC irradiation. In the same extracts, the level of one AUF1-bcl-2 ARE complex paralleled the increased level of p45 AUF1, and its molecular mass was also about 45 kDa. This complex was also the only one to undergo a clear decrease in Z-VAD-fmk-treated cells compared with untreated cells. This decrease also parallels the decrease in the 45-kDa isoform observed by Western blot of extracts from cells pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk with respect to untreated cells. Whereas these data are suggestive, the specific AUF1 isoform(s) involved in bcl-2 ARE binding and mRNA degradation during apoptosis could not be precisely identified on the basis of its molecular mass. Nevertheless, our results indicate that at least one AUF1 isoform is a candidate to play a pivotal role in this regulatory mechanism. Arao et al. (43Arao Y. Kuriyama R. Kayama F. Kato S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) found that p45 and p42 are predominantly nuclear proteins and that, consequently, the observed increase, if actually attributable to one of these isoforms, could be explained by nuclear to cytoplasm shuttling. This possibility is supported by our previous observation that the apoptotic stimulus by cycloeximide (50 μm), utilized to block protein synthesis, resulted in an analogous increase in bcl-2 ARE-bound, cytoplasmic AUBPs (9Donnini M. Lapucci A. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Brewer G. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. Schiavone N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In our model, the relative balance of the AUF1 isoforms seems to determine the fate of the bcl-2 mRNA in response to apoptotic stimuli. We speculate that this balance could be affected in response to other types of endogenous and environmental stimuli. Results obtained from Western blot as well as immunoprecipitation assays suggest that binding of AUF1 isoforms to bcl-2mRNA in cellular extracts could also depend on the other amino acid sequence motifs by which the isoforms differ. We also speculate that the scarce signal of the relatively low molecular mass complex (about 37 kDa), the absence of other complexes in the range of the AUF1 molecular masses, and the presence of higher molecular mass complexes in immunoprecipitates could result from the AUF1 isoform ability to multimerize as reported by Wilson et al. (44Wilson G.M. Lu Y. Sun H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our results also strengthen the hypothesis that the various isoforms of AUF1 may reflect the need of cells to differentially modulate ARE-containing mRNAs during apoptosis. Furthermore, mRNA turnover of ARE-containing genes has already been demonstrated to be a finely tuned process. For example, Wang et al. (24Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the ARE-containing mRNA ofp21waf1, a p53-inducible gene responsible for cell cycle inhibition upon UVC irradiation, was stabilized by the AUBP HuR. This would account for the arrest of cell growth that occurs at the first stages of apoptosis. Other conditions, such as hemin-induced erythroid differentiation, are able to impair ARE activity by sequestration of AUF1 into a complex of proteins (45Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B.

Of these, microbial lipases from fungi and bacteria have attracted special attention for various industrial applications because most microbial lipases can be extracellularly produced in large quantities, have broad substrate specificity, and are quite stable under non-natural conditions (1.Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Reetz M.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 315-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 2.Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua L. Schmid R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 284: 194-220Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The bacterial thermoalkalophilic lipases, which have important potential in applications for enzymatic processing of lipids at elevated temperatures and in an organic solvent phase (3.Rúa M.L. Atoni H. Schmidt-Dnanert D. Schmid R.D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 49: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), are found from various thermophilic bacterial strains includingBacillus stearothermophilus, 1S. Sinchailul, S. Phutralul, and B. Sookkheo, GenBank™ accession number AF237623. Bacillus thermocatenulatus (4.Schmidt-Dannert C. Sztajer H. Stockein W. Schmid R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), Bacillus thermoleovorans (5.Cho A.-R. Yoo S.-K. Kim E.-J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 235-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), B. stearothermophilus, andBacillus sp. TP10A. 2P. J. L. Bell, H. Nevalainen, H. W. Morgan, and P. L. Bergquist, GenBank™ accession number AF141874. These thermoalkalophilic lipases have about 95% amino acid sequence identity among them and show a significant homology of 30–35% with the mature lipases from other Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcusstrains, some of which are pathogenic, and their lipases are involved in the pathogenic processes as reviewed previously (8.Rosenstein R. Götz F. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast to the homology with staphylococcal lipases, the thermoalkalophilic lipases exhibit no sequence homology with other microbial lipases (2.Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua L. Schmid R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 284: 194-220Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). They are also characterized by their molecular sizes of 40–45 kDa that are significantly larger than those of other microbial lipases (usually under 35 kDa). Thus, the thermoalkalophilic lipases and staphylococcal lipases were grouped together as one family of lipases named the lipase family I.5 (1.Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Reetz M.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 315-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) or Staphylococcus family (2.Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua L. Schmid R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 284: 194-220Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the thermoalkalophilic lipases and staphylococcal lipases are grouped as the same family, they show many differences in biochemical characteristics such as optimal temperature, optimal pH, and substrate specificity. The thermoalkalophilic lipases reach maximum activity at 60–75 °C and pH 8–10, whereas staphylococcal lipases show low optimal temperatures and pH optimum of 6–9 (8.Rosenstein R. Götz F. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9.Simons J.-W.F.A. Kampen M.D. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Cox R.C. Santos C.M.A. Egmond M.R. Verheij H.M.

In the case ofStaphylococcus haemolyticus L62 lipase, the optimum temperature is 28 °C and retains more than 30% activity at 4 °C (10.Oh B.-C. Kim H.-K. Lee J.-K. Kang S.-C. Oh T.-K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 385-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the thermoalkalophilic lipases, some staphylococcal lipases show preference for acidic conditions (8.Rosenstein R. Götz F. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of various lipases have been determined from mammalian, yeast, fungi, and bacterial origin (1.Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Reetz M.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 315-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). They include structures of four different bacterial lipases from Burkholderia glumae (11.Nobel M.E.M. Cleasby A. Johnson L.N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31219-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All of the four bacterial lipases belong to thePseudomonas group (2.Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua L. Schmid R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 284: 194-220Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and have a temperature optimum of 30–50 °C. The core structure of these lipases consists of a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, exhibiting a common α/β-hydrolase fold (1.Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Reetz M.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 315-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The active site involves a catalytic triad consisting of serine, aspartic (or glutamic) acid, and histidine residues. The active site is exposed to the solvent in the open conformation structures (B. glumae, B. cepacia, and P. aeruginosa), whereas the active site in the closed conformation structure (C. viscosum) is covered by a lid-like helix. The conformational change from the closed to open conformation is important for the activation of lipases (16.Grochulski P. Li Y. Schrag J.D. Bouthillier F. Smith P. Harrison D. Rubin B. Cygler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12843-12847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of the structural information of Pseudomonaslipases, the available structures do not provide clues to the mechanism of enzyme characteristics of the thermoalkalophilic lipases and staphylococcal lipases because Pseudomonas lipases have no sequence homology with either the thermoalkalophilic lipases or staphylococcal lipases. The thermoalkalophilic lipase from B. stearothermophilus L1 (L1 lipase) is one of the well characterized lipases (17.Kim H.-K. Park S.-Y. Lee J.-K. Oh T.-K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 18.Kim M.-H. Kim H.-K. Lee J.-K. Park S.-Y. Oh T.-K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19.Kim M.-H. Kim H.-K. Oh B.-C. Oh T.-K. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 10: 764-769Google Scholar). The mature form of L1 lipase, which consists of 388 amino acids (43 kDa), is highly thermostable and has the unfolding temperature of 74 °C (18.Kim M.-H. Kim H.-K. Lee J.-K. Park S.-Y. Oh T.-K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to the thermostability, L1 lipase exhibits a unique thermoactivity, by which the enzyme is most active at 68 °C for the hydrolysis of olive oil (18.Kim M.-H. Kim H.-K. Lee J.-K. Park S.-Y. Oh T.-K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19.Kim M.-H. Kim H.-K. Oh B.-C. Oh T.-K. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 10: 764-769Google Scholar). Other thermostable lipases from mesophiles show only low activity at temperatures above 60 °C (2.Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua L. Schmid R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 284: 194-220Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar,20.Chung G.H. Lee Y.P. Yoo O.J. Rhee J.S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 35: 237-241Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21.Sugihara A. Ueshima M. Shimada Y. Tsunasawa S. Tominaga Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The thermostability and thermoactivity of L1 lipase are critically important for many industrial applications because the industrial lipase reactions often require high temperatures (50–80 °C) due to the high melting points of some lipids. L1 lipase shows high preference for saturated fatty acid (C3–C16) and natural solid lipid such as beef tallow and palm oil, which are usually bad substrates for mesophilic lipases. We report here the crystal structure of the thermoalkalophilic lipase from B. stearothermophilus L1 (L1 lipase) determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method. The crystal structure of L1 lipase reveals the detailed mechanisms of thermostability and thermoactivity that are interconnected to each other and provides a framework in understanding the function of the thermoalkalophilic and staphylococcal lipases. The L1 lipase structure shows a novel zinc-coordinated extra domain that is conserved among members of the lipase family I.5. The extra domain appears to control the lipase activation through interactions with the loop connected to the helical lid. The temperature-mediated dissociation of hydrophobic interactions between the helical lid and the enzyme active site and the rigidity in the packing of the active site residues explain the unique thermoactivity of L1 lipase. A structural gene corresponding to the mature L1 lipase (residues 1–388) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli by using the pET22b(+) expression vector, and the protein was purified by CM-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite chromatographies as described previously (19.Kim M.-H. Kim H.-K. Oh B.-C. Oh T.-K. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 10: 764-769Google Scholar). Extensive crystallization trials produced two different crystal forms belonging to C2 and P212121 space groups (22.Jeong S.T. Kim H.K. Kim S.J. Pan J.G. Oh T.K. Ryu S.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1300-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Among the two crystal forms, the C2 crystals (a = 119.95 Å, b = 85.37 Å, c = 98.60 Å, and β = 99.71°) were used for the structure determination based on their higher resolution diffraction limits and radiation stability. Isomorphous heavy-atom derivative crystals were prepared by soaking the native crystals into mother liquor containing heavy-atom compounds. X-ray diffraction data of native and all heavy-atom derivative crystals were collected at room temperature by using a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode generator (40 kV and 100 mA) equipped with an R-AXIS IV++ detector and an Osmic mirror. Data for phasing and refinement were processed with the program CrystalClear (Rigaku).

Open table in a new tab The structure of L1 lipase was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method by using two good heavy-atom derivatives. We obtained the first derivative by soaking native crystals into the mother liquor containing 5 mm of Sm(OAc)3 for 5 days. The second heavy-atom derivative was obtained with a 2-day soaking in 10 mm of Hg(OAc)2. The heavy-atom parameter refinement and the phase calculation were carried out at 2.3-Å resolution by the program SHARP (23.de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The solvent flipping by using the program SOLOMON (24.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Sect. Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) further improved the phases. The resulting electron density map was of excellent quality and allowed us to build unambiguously most residues of two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. The program O (25.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) was used in the manual rebuildings. The subsequent model refinement was carried out using the program CNS 0.9 (26.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) (Table II). The randomly selected 5% of total reflections were set aside for theR free calculation. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained during the refinement cycles with data to 2.5 Å and released for subsequent refinement with higher resolution data. Water molecules were gradually added in the model with the waterpick routine in the program CNS 0.9. The 89.9% of all residues in the two asymmetric molecules are in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot drawn by the program PROCHECK (27.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and there is no residue in the disallowed region. The final model includes residues 1–388 in the first monomer, 4–388 in the second monomer, 2 calcium atoms, 2 zinc atoms, and 257 water molecules.Table IIRefinement statisticsNativeResolution range (Å)99–2.0R cryst (%)18.5R free(%)21.8Atoms in model Protein (non-hydrogen)6,086 Metal atoms4 Water molecules257Root mean square deviations from ideal Bond lengths (Å)0.006 Bond angles (°)1.17 Impropers (°)0.74 Dihedrals (°)23.6R cryst = Σ‖F o −F c‖/ΣF o, whereF o and F c are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.

TheR free value was calculated from 5% of all the data that were not used in the refinement. The zinc ion was identified by anomalous diffraction of L1 lipase crystal. Bijvoet data were collected using a frozen crystal of L1 lipase at the beamline BL18B of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The crystal was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after soaking in the buffer containing 100 mmsodium acetate (pH 4.6), 1.0 m sodium formate, and 20% glycerol. Under the frozen condition, cell constants of the crystal were a = 117.78 Å, b = 84.59 Å,c = 97.78 Å, and β = 99.32°, which are similar to those of native crystals. Before the data collection, we performed a fluorescence scanning to determine an experimental absorption edge of the crystal. To obtain sufficient Bijvoet mates, the data covering the entire reciprocal space (360° rotation) were collected. The diffraction data were processed with the program MOSFLM (28.Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Bijvoet data with over 99% coverage at 2.3-Å resolution were obtained for wavelengths slightly before (λ = 1.281 Å) and after (λ = 1.286 Å) the observed absorption edge (λ = 1.283 Å). R merge values for the data at λ = 1.281 Å and λ = 1.286 Å were 5.4 and 8.6%, respectively. The figures were drawn by using the programs MOLSCRIPT (29.Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), RASTER3D (30.Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (31.Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graphics Mod. 1997; 15: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar), and RIBBONS (32.Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The L1 lipase structure reveals a globular enzyme with approximate dimensions of 45 × 50 × 55 Å. A central β-sheet consisting of seven strands (β3–β9) is surrounded by α-helices and loops, resulting in an overall topology of the α/β hydrolase fold (Fig. 1 a). One side of the central sheet is covered by helices α1 and α13, and the other by helices α2, α4, and α10. Two L1 lipase molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit are almost identical except for the C-terminal end of helix α6 and the loop following the helix (residues 193–204) where the two molecules exhibit alternative conformations. The flexibility of the 193–204 region seems to play a role in the enzyme activation (see below). When the L1 lipase structure is compared with that of C. viscosum lipase, a Pseudomonas family enzyme, structural similarities mainly reside in the central sheet and some of flanking helices. However, there are significant structural differences in other regions because of numerous insertions and deletions throughout the structure (Fig. 1 b). Most notably, L1 lipase exhibits an extra domain consisting of helices α3 and α5, strands b1 and b2, and connecting loops (Fig. 1 b and Fig. 2). These insertions result in a significant increase in overall size of the enzyme compared with thePseudomonas family enzymes (388 and 319 amino acids for L1 lipase and C. viscosum lipase, respectively). In addition to the extra domain, helices α6-α9 of the L1 lipase and connecting loops form a unique structure that cannot be aligned with the C. viscosum lipase structure. Helix α6 seems to function as the lid during enzyme activation (see below), and helices α7–α9 surround helix α6 forming a tightly packed structure above the active site of the enzyme. Based on the structural alignment of L1 lipase with other structurally known lipases, the catalytic triad residues of L1 lipase can be assigned to Ser-113, His-358, and Asp-317 (Fig. 2). The catalytic triad residues reside in the regions that are highly conserved throughout lipase families: a turn following strand β5, loop β9–α13, and loop α12–β8, respectively. The main- and side-chain conformations of these residues are well aligned with those of C. viscosum lipase. The identities of the active site residues are in agreement with the prediction by a recent modeling study (33.Sinchaikul S. Sookkheo B. Phutrakul S. Wu Y.T. Pan F.M. Chen S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The active site residues are covered by a long helix (α6) and not accessible to solvent, indicating that the L1 lipase structure is in a closed conformation. Despite the similarity of the catalytic residue conformations, the neighbors of the catalytic triad in L1 lipase exhibit important structural differences in comparison to those of C. viscosumlipase. In L1 lipase, there are characteristic substitutions in the residues close to the catalytic triad, resulting in a more rigid structure through tight side-chain packing. For example, Phe-16 (close to Ser-113), Ile-319 (close to His-358), Thr-269, and Met-325 (close to Asp-317) substitute for Leu-17, Leu-265, Gly-211, and Ser-271 ofC. viscosum lipase, respectively (Fig. 3). Most lipases and serine proteases have the conserved Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif near the catalytic serine (Ser in the motif). The thermoalkalophilic lipases have a glycine to alanine substitution in the first glycine of the motif, which results in the new Ala-X-Ser-X-Gly motif (17.Kim H.-K. Park S.-Y. Lee J.-K. Oh T.-K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The side chain of the corresponding alanine (Ala-111) in L1 lipase is toward a hydrophobic core made of residues in the catalytic serine loop and stabilizes the loop conformation. The increased stability of the active site region by the tight packing and the stabilization of the catalytic serine loop should contribute to the thermostability of the L1 lipase. Staphylococcal lipases, which lack a significant thermostability, do not exhibit the glycine to alanine substitution in the catalytic serine motif. The substitutions to bulk residues around the catalytic Asp-317 of L1 lipase (Thr-269 and Met-325) also do not appear in staphylococcal lipases. The tight packing of the active site residues and extra hydrophobic cores observed in the current structure of L1 lipase should contribute to the unique thermoactivity of the enzyme as well as the overall stability of the enzyme at elevated temperatures. At low temperatures, the rigidity in the catalytic triad region prohibits the enzyme activity because enzymes require certain flexibility in the active site for an efficient catalysis. The temperature increase should provide the required flexibility in the catalytic triad region. An isolated density of ∼6ς was found to be octahedrally coordinated with neighboring main- and side-chain atoms and water molecules, indicating that the density represents the calcium ion as predicted from a calcium-dependent thermostability of L1 lipase (17.Kim H.-K. Park S.-Y. Lee J.-K. Oh T.-K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The coordination includes interactions with two carboxyl oxygen atoms of Glu-360 and Asp-365, two main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly-286 and Pro-366, and two water molecules (Fig. 2). The distances of the calcium coordination with four protein atoms range from 2.24 to 2.44 Å. Glu-360 is at an equivalent position to Asp-357 of Staphylococcus hyicus lipase whose mutation resulted in a decreased enzyme activity (9.Simons J.-W.F.A. Kampen M.D. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Cox R.C. Santos C.M.A. Egmond M.R. Verheij H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The residue corresponding to Asp-354 of S. hyicus lipase (Asp-357 in L1 lipase), another residue predicted to bind the calcium ion (9.Simons J.-W.F.A. Kampen M.D. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Cox R.C. Santos C.M.A. Egmond M.R. Verheij H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), is not involved in the calcium binding of L1 lipase. In Pseudomonasgroup lipases, the calcium ion was found to form hydrogen bonds with the region of the active histidine, and loss of the calcium ion results in enzyme inactivation (34.Deveer A.M. Ph.D. thesis, Mechanism of Activation of Lipolytic Enzymes. Rijksuniversiteitte, Utrecht1992Google Scholar). Although the calcium ion of L1 lipase also stabilizes the conformation of the active His-358 loop, the calcium ion of L1 lipase is a little more displaced from the active His-358 compared with that of Pseudomonas group lipases. In addition, helix α8 of Pseudomonas group lipases, which covers the calcium-binding site, is missing in L1 lipase. These differences make the calcium-binding site of L1 lipase more accessible to solvent, suggesting that the calcium binding in L1 lipase may not be as critical as in Pseudomonas group lipases. In agreement with the structural observation, the abstraction of calcium ion by EDTA results in a modest decrease in the unfolding temperature of the L1 lipase (by 8–10°) and no significant loss of enzyme activity (17.Kim H.-K. Park S.-Y. Lee J.-K. Oh T.-K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition to the calcium site, L1 lipase exhibits another putative metal-binding site. A strong (∼12ς height) and isolated electron density map was located in the 2F o − F c electron density map. The density is tetragonally coordinated by the O-δ1 atom of Asp-61 (helix α2), the N-ε2 atom of His-81 (helix α3), the N-ε1 atom of His-87 (loop α3-b2), and the O-δ2 atom of Asp-238 (loop α8-α9) (Fig. 4 a). The coordination distances are 2.14, 2.13, 2.26, and 2.07 Å, respectively. Considering the intensity of the electron density and its coordination geometry, we propose that the density is a zinc ion. To analyze the nature of the metal site, we characterized anomalous diffraction of the L1 lipase crystal (Fig. 4 b). First, we determined the absorption edge of the crystal, which revealed that the crystal has an absorption edge close to the theoretical value for zinc (λ = 1.283 Å). The Bijvoet difference Fourier map calculated from the data at a wavelength (λ = 1.281 Å) slightly before the edge clearly shows the zinc site, whereas the map at a wavelength (λ = 1.286 Å) slightly after the edge does not show a peak at the site, indicating that the metal site is indeed occupied by a zinc ion. There are no other metals that have absorption edges significantly close to the wavelength range of our data collection. In comparison, EDTA exerts a mild effect in the thermoactivity of the enzyme as discussed above, and an incubation of the enzyme with a strong zinc chelator, N,N,N′,N,-tetrakis(2-pyridyl-methyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) (35.Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), decreases the thermotolerance of the enzyme significantly (by about 20 °C), indicating the existence of the tightly bound zinc ion in the enzyme. 3H.-K. Kim and T.-K. Oh, unpublished data. The unusual zinc-binding site of L1 lipase is the first example among all known lipases. The novel zinc site stabilizes the characteristic extra domain consisting of helices α3 and α5, strands b1 and b2, and associated loops by forming coordination bonds with residues from both the extra domain (His-81 and His-87) and the core domain of the protein (Asp-61 and Asp-238). The extra domain and zinc-coordinating residues are well conserved in other members of the lipase family I.5 (Fig. 2). The thermoacidophilic archaeal ferredoxin fromSulfolobus species also contains a novel zinc-binding site at an extra domain that was attributed as an important factor for the thermostability of the protein (36.Fujii T. Hata Y. Wakagi T. Tanaka N. Oshima T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 834-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In Sulfolobusferredoxins, the zinc-coordinated extra domain stabilizes two β-sheets of the core domain. The zinc-coordinated extra domain of L1 lipase provides tight interactions with the core domain as well as the characteristic cluster of helices (α8 and α9) and loops around the lid helix (α6). These interactions may contribute to the thermostability of the enzyme as in the Sulfolobus ferredoxins. In addition to the stabilizing effects, the zinc-coordinated extra domain of L1 lipase appears to play an important role in the regulation of the lid opening. The region of the zinc-binding site makes tight contacts with a long loop (residues 194–221) that is extended from the C terminus of the lid helix (Fig. 1). The opening of the lid helix during enzyme activation is likely to involve a conformational transition of the loop region, and the lid opening may be affected by the strength of the loop interactions with the zinc-coordinated extra domain. The zinc-coordinated extra domain is conserved also in Staphylococcus lipases that do not exhibit thermostability. However, the C terminus of the lid helix and the following loop are significantly shortened in Staphylococcuslipases (Fig. 2), supporting that the tight interactions of the loop with the extra domain may be important in the thermostability and activity regulation. The helical lid of L1 lipase (helix α6, 19 amino acids) is significantly longer than that of the closed-form structure of C. viscosum lipase (12 amino acids) (Fig. 5 a). The inner face of the lid helix of the L1 lipase points toward the active site and consists of mainly hydrophobic residues. In particular, a characteristic array of phenylalanines (Phe-176, Phe-180, and Phe-181) makes strong hydrophobic interactions with the active site region and the groove formed by neighboring helices and loops (Fig. 5 b). Side chains of the three phenylalanines interact with Trp-234 of helix α8, Val-171 and Leu-170 of loop β6-α6, Phe-16 of loop β3-α1, and Leu-56 of loop β4-α2. Other hydrophobic residues in the lid helix (Leu-183, Val-187, Leu-188, Ala-190, Ala-191, Ala-192, and Ala-194) also form strong interactions with neighboring hydrophobic residues (Phe-16, Trp-19, and Phe-27 of loop β3-α1; Tyr-199 and Tyr-204 of loop α6-α7; Phe-221 and Phe-225 of helix α7; Phe-290 of helix α11; Ile-319 of loop α2-β4; and Val-364 of loop β9-α13) (Fig. 5 b). In the closed-form structure ofC. viscosum lipase, there is a small opening between the lid helix and the active site in the C-terminal region of the helix. However, the extended lid helix of L1 lipase completely blocks the opening with tight hydrophobic interactions. In addition, the lid helix is surrounded by extra helices (α7–α9) that are not present inC. viscosum lipase. The lid helix ofStaphylococcus lipase also does not have the extended C-terminal region, which is consistent with the lack of thermostability in the enzymes (Fig. 2). The tight hydrophobic interactions and extra helices near the lid helix of the L1 lipase seem to contribute to the stability of the lid helix. The enzyme activity of B. subtilis lipase can be completely inhibited by a 10-min incubation with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 30 °C. However, L1 lipase retains 90 and 77% of the control enzyme activity after 10 and 30 min of incubation under the same conditions (17.Kim H.-K. Park S.-Y. Lee J.-K. Oh T.-K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). About 80% of the control activity remains even after a 10-min incubation at 55 °C with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (17.Kim H.-K. Park S.-Y. Lee J.-K. Oh T.-K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the strong interaction of the lid helix with the catalytic site in L1 lipase, which may protect the catalytic serine from the phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride modification at low temperatures. The lid helix may move from the active site only when the temperature is increased to a certain value, providing a temperature switch in the activation of the L1 lipase. The tight association of the lid helix at temperatures below the activation temperature may be important for protection of the hydrophobic active site region from nonspecific aggregation of the enzyme. In the lid helix of the C. viscosum lipase, there are two adjustable loops flanking the helix that allow a lateral movement of the helix as shown in the open-form structures of B. cepaciaand P. aeruginosa lipases (Fig. 5 a). However, the N terminus of the lid helix of L1 lipase is connected to the core of the protein with a tight turn, missing the N-terminal adjustable loop observed in C. viscosum lipase. Instead, the loop C-terminal to the lid helix (residues 194–221) in L1 lipase is unusually extended and makes interactions with the zinc-coordinated extra domain (see below). Interestingly, the N-terminal half of the helix has residues with bulky side chains (Phe-176, Arg-179, Phe-180, Phe-181, and Leu-183), whereas the C-terminal half is composed of residues with short side chains (Ala-186, Val-187, Ala-190, Ala-191, Ala-192, Val-193, and Ala-194) (Fig. 2). The existence of an adjustable loop only at one end of the helix and the bipartite distribution of hydrophobic residues in the lid helix indicate that the lid opening is likely to occur mainly in the C-terminal side. The start region of the C-terminal loop (residues 193–204) has alternative conformations between two independent lipase molecules in the asymmetric unit, supporting the possible lid opening in the C-terminal side (Fig. 5 a). Together with the strong hydrophobic interactions of the lid helix, the unidirectional opening mechanism of the lid also may contribute to the stability of the lid helix in the closed conformation, providing another control in the temperature-mediated activation of L1 lipase. Due to the strong hydrophobic interactions of the lid helix with the catalytic triad region, the lid may not be opened at low temperatures even in the presence of lipid substrates. The increased kinetic energy at high temperatures should allow the movement of the lid by effective solvation of the residues involved in the hydrophobic interactions (37.Caflisch A. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 672-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interactions play an important role in the temperature-mediated structural switches of other proteins also. The temperature- and redox-mediated activation of Hsp33 involves a reversible dissociation of two domains attached by hydrophobic interactions as well as zinc ligation (38.Kim S.-J. Jeong D.-G. Chi S.-W. Lee J.-S. Ryu S.-E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The temperature-mediated monomer-to-trimer transition of HSF1 also involves reversible dissociation of hydrophobic interactions in leucine zipper helices (39.Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, the reversible dissociation of hydrophobic interactions seems to be a common mechanism utilized in proteins for the temperature-mediated control of protein activities. We thank N.

https://openalex.org/W1992206511,"Heterozygosity for mutations in the BRCA1 gene in humans confers high risk for developing breast cancer, but a biochemical basis for this phenotype has not yet been determined. Evidence has accumulated implicating BRCA1, in the maintenance of genomic integrity and the protection of cells against DNA double strand breaks (DSB). Here we present evidence that human cells heterozygous for BRCA1 mutations exhibit impaired DNA end-joining, which is the major DSB repair pathway in mammalian somatic cells. Using an in vivo host cell end-joining assay, we observed that the fidelity of DNA end-joining is strongly reduced in three BRCA1+/− cell lines in comparison to two control cell lines. Moreover, cell-free BRCA1+/− extracts are unable to promote accurate DNA end-joining in an in vitro reaction. The steady-state level of the wild type BRCA1 protein was significantly lower than the 50% expected in BRCA1+/− cells and thus may underlie the observed end-joining defect. Together, these data strongly suggest that BRCA1 is necessary for faithful rejoining of broken DNA ends and that a single mutated BRCA1 allele is sufficient to impair this process. This defect will compromise genomic stability in BRCA1 germ-line mutation carriers, triggering the genetic changes necessary for the initiation of neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2400803738,"Blockade of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway suppresses growth of colon cancer in vivo. Here we demonstrate a direct link between the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK2 and the growth-promoting cell adhesion molecule, integrin alphavbeta6, in colon cancer cells. Down-regulation of beta6 integrin subunit expression inhibits tumour growth in vivo and MAP kinase activity in response to serum stimulation. In alphavbeta6-expressing cells ERK2 is bound only to the beta6 subunit. The increase in cytosolic MAP kinase activity upon epidermal growth factor stimulation is all accounted for by beta6-bound ERK. Deletion of the ERK2 binding site on the beta6 cytoplasmic domain inhibits tumour growth and leads to an association between ERK and the beta5 subunit. The physical interaction between integrin alphavbeta6 and ERK2 defines a novel paradigm of integrin-mediated signalling and provides a therapeutic target for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2013907250,"IL-6 is an established growth factor for multiple myeloma tumor cells, stimulating proliferative and survival responses. Recent work indicates that IL-6 can activate the AKT kinase in myeloma cells. Thus, to test a potential role for AKT in IL-6-induced cellular responses, we transfected myeloma cell lines with an active 'E40K' or dominant negative'PH AKT construct using an adenoviral vector. Transfection of the E40K into myeloma cells resulted in enhanced tumor cell growth and expression of the PH dominant negative AKT resulted in both inhibition of the IL-6-dependent proliferative response and a decrease in S phase distribution. While transfection of E40K protected myeloma cells from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, the dominant negative PH had no effect on the ability of IL-6 to protect these cells from dexamethasone. These results clearly demonstrate that AKT activation is critical for the IL-6 proliferative response. In addition, although the level of AKT activation can regulate sensitivity to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, additional cytokine-induced AKT-independent pathways can mediate IL-6 protection against dexamethasone.

https://openalex.org/W2005146179,"The structure and expression of the human Rad53 homologue Chk2 was analysed in breast cancer. The previously described silent polymorphism at nucleotide 252 in codon 84 (GAA>GAG) was observed in 5/141 cases. Somatic Chk2 coding mutations were detected in 7/141 cases, these occurring in 4/18 BRCA1-associated breast cancers, 1/78 sporadic breast cancers and 2/25 typical medullary carcinomas. Each of the BRCA1-associated cancers with Chk2 mutations also contained mutations in p53, whereas the single sporadic cancer with Chk2 mutation was wild-type for p53. Expression of Chk2 was ubiquitously detected in normal ductal epithelium of the breast, but there was loss of expression in a significant proportion of breast carcinomas, and this occurred in cancers both with and without p53 mutation. A CpG island was identified 5' of the Chk2 transcriptional start site, but there was no evidence of cytosine methylation in any of the cancers with down-regulated Chk2 expression. Analysis of the germ-line of 45 individuals with hereditary or early onset breast cancer revealed wild-type Chk2 sequence in all cases. Thus, despite the rarity of somatic mutations in Chk2 in sporadic breast carcinomas, our results nevertheless reveal that concomitant loss of function in Chk2 (via down-regulation of expression) and p53 (via mutation) occurs in a proportion of sporadic cases. However, consistent with other studies, we show that germ-line mutations in Chk2 are unlikely to account for a significant proportion of non BRCA1-, non BRCA2-associated hereditary breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1999245096,"Replication protein A (RPA) participates in many cellular functions including DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair. A direct interaction between RPA and the xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein (XPA) facilitates the assembly of a preincision complex during the processing of DNA damage by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. We demonstrate here the formation of a ternary RPA, XPA, and duplex cisplatin-damaged DNA complex as is evident by electrophoretic supershift analysis. The RPA-XPA complex displays modest specificity for damaged versus undamaged duplex DNA, and the RPA-XPA complex displays a greater affinity for binding duplex cisplatin-damaged DNA when compared with the RPA or XPA proteins alone, consistent with previous results. Using DNA denaturation assays, we demonstrate that the role of XPA is in the stabilization of the duplex DNA structure via inhibition of the strand separation activity of RPA. Rapid kinetic analysis indicates that the bimolecular k(on) of the RPA-XPA complex is 2.5-fold faster than RPA alone for binding a duplex cisplatin-damaged DNA. The dissociation rate, k(off), of the RPA-XPA complex is slower than that of the RPA protein alone, suggesting that the XPA protein stabilizes the initial binding of RPA to duplex DNA as well as maintaining the integrity of the duplex DNA. Interestingly, XPA has no effect on the k(on) of RPA for a single-stranded 40-mer DNA."

Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). The 5-HT2 subtype comprises three closely related receptors, which are 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. Amino acid sequences of the rat (2.Foguet M. Hoyer D. Pardo L.A. Parekh A. Kluxen F.-W. Kalkman H.O.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) 5-HT2B receptors (5-HT2BRs) are highly similar at the level of the predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs); they exhibit 88, 82, and 79% homology upon comparison of mouse and rat, human and mouse, and human and rat receptors, respectively (5.Choi D.-S.

Moreover, significant correlations were established between the pharmacological profiles of human and rat (or human and mouse) 5-HT2BRs but not between those of mouse and rat (5.Choi D.-S. Loric S. Colas J.-F. Callebert J. Rosay P. Kellermann O. Launay J.-M. Maroteaux L. Behav. Brain Res. 1996; 73: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some compounds (e.g. certain ergolines and benzoylpiperidines) can be used to discriminate pharmacologically between human and rat 5-HT2BRs (6.Wainscott D.B. Lucaites V.L. Kursar J.D. Baez M. Nelson D.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 720-727PubMed Google Scholar).Structural descriptions of these receptors and of their binding interactions are required to rationalize the above findings. In the absence of any 5-HT receptor three-dimensional structure, computer modeling studies were undertaken in the present study. Our aim was to explain the different 5-HT pK D values measured for the rat, mouse, and human 5-HT2BRs (7.5, 5.8, and 7.9, respectively) and to better understand the mechanism of 5-HT2BR activation.Two main strategies have already been used to build GPCR three-dimensional models. The first one relied on the use of the structure of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) at a 3-Å resolution as a homology template (7.Hibert M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The second strategy, already used for three-dimensional-modeling of the 5-HT2A (9.Almaula N. Ebersole B.J. Zhang D. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 306: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), aimed at constructing modelsde novo by only using the ∼9-Å structure of bovine rhodopsin (RH) as a guide to orient the TMDs. These studies were the starting point in the elucidation of the conformational switch between the inactive and active states of GPCRs. A key feature of these approaches involved the replacement of the network of constraints in the inactive ground state of the receptor by a ligand-induced set of interactions in the activated state (12.Shapiro D.A. Kristiansen K. Kroeze W.K. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13.Lu Z.-L. Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. J. Biol.

Sci. 2001; 22: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).In the present work, the construction of three-dimensional models of the mouse and human 5-HT2BRs was carried out using either the high resolution BR structure or the recently described crystal structure of bovine RH (15.Palczewski K.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) as templates. Structural models of the native receptors liganded or not with 5-HT could be derived. In a second step, site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed to validate the models. Residues predicted to participate to 5-HT binding in either the human or the mouse 5HT2BR were changed. 5-HT binding affinity and 5-HT-induced inositol triphosphate (IP3) production were systematically assessed with each mutated receptor. As a result, the involvement in 5-HT binding of several amino acid residues could be established. Moreover, a two-amino acid permutation in the TMD5 of the human receptor was performed to introduce a mouse-like sequence. This modification resulted in a lowering of the 5-HT affinity and in a change of the IP3production to values similar to those measured with the mouse 5-HT2BR. We conclude that the TMD5 region encompassing the mutated residues participates in the species signature of the 5-HT2BRs.DISCUSSIONIn this report, three-dimensional computer modeling of the TMD bundle of human and mouse 5-HT2BRs was undertaken on the basis of (i) sequence alignment (17.Oliveira L. Paiva A.C.M. Vriend G. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 649-658Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), (ii) fitting to the BR and RH structures, and (iii) side-chain rotamer probability distributions (31.Ghinea G. Padron G. Hooft R.W.W. Sander C. Vriend G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Based on the theoretical models obtained, mutated receptors were expressed and assessed for 5-HT binding affinity and 5-HT-induced IP3 production. This functional approach allowed us to estimate the relevance of several predictions made on the basis of the sole computations of theoretical models and to propose structural models of 5-HT2BRs (Figs. 3 and4). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments also offered the possibility to go deeper into the mechanism of receptor activation (32.Hulme E.C. Lu Z.-L. Ward S.D.C. Allman K. Curtis C.A.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by giving particular attention to the conformational switch between the inactive and active states of the receptor. Finally, this work allowed us to define common features between receptors of the 5-HT2 family and to consider the specificity of each 5-HT2BR in their capacity to accommodate the 5-HT ligand.Modeled 5-HT2BR Structures Share Similarities with Other Members of the 5-HT2R FamilyAs previously described in the 5-HT2AR (8.Trumpp-Kallmeyer S.

The huge decrease observed upon mutation in both 5-HT binding and signaling efficacy parameters (Table II) confirms its interaction with the agonist in the activated state of the native forms of both human and mouse 5-HT2BRs.Undoubtedly, Ser3.36(h139,m138) binds 5-HT in a way similar to that reported for the rat 5-HT2CR (11.Kristiansen K. Dahl S.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 306: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the human 5-HT2AR (9.Almaula N. Ebersole B.J. Zhang D. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

Substitution of Ser by Ala did significantly decrease the affinity of human 5-HT2BR for 5-HT (Table II). It is likely that Ser3.36 stabilizes 5-HT in the receptor binding site by H-bonding through the OH group of the neurotransmitter.In the rat 5-HT2CR model (11.Kristiansen K. Dahl S.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 306: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it was reported that Asn6.55 plays a role in the antagonist binding selectivity. In our proposed 5-HT2BR models, Asn6.55 is also likely to be involved in 5-HT binding. However, the nature of the interaction between this residue and the neurotransmitter depends on the template used for the modeling.Despite controversial data in the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor (35.Barak L.S. Mennard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15407-15414Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), Asp2.50 and Asn7.49 were reported crucial for the interaction with most agonist molecules that bind to GPCRs and for the related couplings. This is especially clear with the human 5-HT2AR (28.Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16683-16688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In 5-HT2BRs, the 5-HT binding affinity and the signaling efficacy were similarly affected upon introduction of the D100N and N376D mutations. The double conservative mutation D100N/N376D restored the properties of the wild-type receptor (Table II). This behavior strongly indicates that a TMD2/TMD7 helix-helix interaction is required for the human 5-HT2BR to adopt an active conformation.Originalities of the 5-HT2BR Structural ModelsMost of the structural and experimental data collected here suggest that the network of interactions with 5-HT in the 5-HT2BRs structural models significantly differs from that in 5-HT2A/2CRs. In particular, the H-bond network that stabilizes 5-HT in the binding site appears characteristic of the 5-HT2BR subtype.First, the 4.57 locus has unique properties. In the 5-HT2AR, Ser4.57 was shown to favor the interaction between 5-HT and Ser3.36 by contributing to the formation of a stable complex. In the 5-HT2BR sequence, an Ala residue replaces Ser4.57. This change may explain the rather weak interaction between 5-HT and Ser3.36(h139,m138)in the RH-based models of 5-HT2BRs. Moreover, in 5-HT2BRs, none of the residues belonging to TMD4 seem to be involved in the 5-HT binding.Secondly, the 5-HT hydroxyl group interacts with Ser5.43 of rat 5-HT2A (8.Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 34.Donnelly D. Findlay J.B. Blundell T.L. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 61-78PubMed Google Scholar) and 5-HT2C (11.Kristiansen K. Dahl S.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 306: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) receptors. RH-based models of 5-HT2BRs also predicted an H bonding of 5-HT to Ser5.43(h222). However, this polar interaction could not be evidenced by site-directed mutagenesis (Table II).Last, the packing of TMDs 1, 2, and 7 in 5-HT2BRs appears different from that in 5-HT2CR. Indeed, Kristiansen and Dahl (11.Kristiansen K. Dahl S.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 306: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) report that Asnl.50(72) interacts with both Asp2.50(100) and Asn7.49(371), whereas in the present models, the interaction involving Asp2.50(h100,m99)and Asn7.49(h371,m370) excludes a participation of Asnl.50(h72,m71). The TMD2/TMD7 helix-helix interaction in combination with the pointing of the Asn7.49(h376,m375)side chain toward the central core of the receptor allows Glu7.36(h363,m362) to interact with 5-HT. The E363A mutation reduced the ligand affinity without changing the signaling efficacy (Table II). This result indicates that Glu7.36(h363,m362) favors intermolecular contacts with the ligand in the ground state of the receptor. The presence of a short Asn side chain at locus 7.36 in the other members of the 5-HT2R family suggests that the longer the side chain of the amino acid at this precise locus, the fewer the interactions between 5-HT, on the one side, and residue 7.36 and TMD2/TMD7, on the other side, can be simultaneously established. Furthermore, MD simulations indicated that the interaction between 5-HT and Glu7.36(h363,m362) is stronger with the mouse than with the human. This result supports the idea of an “easier” mechanism of activation in the case of the human receptor.The 5-HT2BR Model Validates the “Aromatic Box” HypothesisHibert et al. (7.Hibert M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar) report that the two highly conserved aromatic residues, Trp6.48 and Phe6.52, are directly involved in the binding of several neurotransmitters (5-HT, dopamine, and adrenaline) to their corresponding receptors. They also speculate that the side chain conformations of these hydrophobic residues probably changed during the binding process. Such changes could directly affect the conformation of the adjacent helices, in particular in the vicinity of proline residues, and of other helices by propagation along the backbone of interacting conserved aromatic residues. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments also support the crucial role of the two above aromatic residues (36.Wang C.D. Gallaher T.K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 931-940PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Choudhary M.S. Sachs N. Uluer A. Glennon A. Westkaemper R.B. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 450-457PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Roth B.L. Shoham M. Choudhary M.S. Khan N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).In all 5-HT GPCRs, six conserved aromatic residues (Trp3.28, Phe3.35, Trp4.50, Phe6.44, Trp6.48, and Trp7.40) are in hydrophobic interaction. In addition, Trp3.28, Phe3.35, Phe6.52, and Phe7.38define an aromatic box that surrounds 5-HT. In our BR-based models of 5-HT2BRs as well as in models of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors (21.Roth B.L. Willins D.L. Kristiansen K. Kroeze W.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 231-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), this box maintains the 5-HT indole ring in a favorable orientation to interact with Asp3.32. The hydrophobic interaction between Phe6.52 and the indole ring of 5-HT is crucial for the geometry of the binding cavity. Upon 5-HT binding, a shift of Phe6.52(h341) induces a displacement of the Trp6.48(h337) side chain. Consequently, the other aromatic amino acids in the hydrophobic core of 5-HT2BRs are submitted to conformational changes. The 5-HT docking also induces van der Waals contacts to occur between Pro5.50(h229) and both the Phe6.44(h333) and Trp6.48(h337) side chains. Such contacts are in agreement with the binding model of 5-HT to the rat 5-HT2CR (11.Kristiansen K. Dahl S.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 306: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). According to the above observations, mutations of either Phe6.52(h341) and Trp6.48(h337) into Ala decreased by almost 10 times the K D value for 5-HT binding to the human receptor. We conclude that each of these two point mutations affects the ground state of the receptor through rearrangement of the “aromatic network” upon 5-HT binding. Such a rearrangement triggers the switch of the receptor to its active conformation.Human and Mouse 5-HT2BR Structures Display Distinct Aromatic BoxesThe BR- and RH-derived structural models of the human and mouse 5-HT2BRs cannot per se fully account for the 100-fold difference in 5-HT binding affinity observed between these two receptors. Upon 5-HT binding, as already suggested by Hibert et al. (7.Hibert M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar), the rearrangement of the hydrophobic aromatic core induces proline-mediated motions of TMDs 5 and 6. These motions are of smaller amplitude in the mouse 5-HT2BR model than in the human receptor. Such differences may sustain the species specificity for 5-HT binding. Consistent with this view, simultaneous substitution of Thr5.49(h228,m227) and Ala5.52(h231,m230) on both sides of Pro5.50(h229,m228) in the human sequence by the corresponding residues in the mouse sequence (T228A/A231T) induces a rearrangement of the aromatic network involving 5-HT and the aromatic ring of Phe6.52(h341). Moreover, our computer modeling strongly indicates that the 5-HT binding pocket in the human receptor, which is larger than that in the mouse, becomes smaller upon these amino acid substitutions. We also noticed that a H bond occurs between the hydroxyl group of Thr5.49(m227) and the peptidic bond oxygen of Ala5.52(m230). This intra-helix interaction forms in the course of all MD simulations of the 5-HT/mouse 5-HT2BR complexes. It may provide an explanation for the relatively lower r.m.s.d. values obtained for the mouse 5-HT2BR three-dimensional models. This H bond may reduce the TMD5 motion amplitude and may constrain the aromatic network to accommodate 5-HT at its binding site. Finally, with the human double mutant, both the binding and the signaling parameters reach values similar to those measured with the wild-type mouse 5-HT2BR.In summary, the present study allowed us to predict that the 5-HT binding site of 5HT2BRs primarily involves residues belonging to TMDs 3, 6, and 7. The BR-based structures appear more reliable than those RH-based for the modeling of 5-HT2BRs structures. Indeed, the mutations of residues predicted to be in interaction with 5-HT according to the BR-based models systematically led to relevant results. With the help of site-directed mutagenesis, we show that 5HT2BRs differ from 5-HT2A/2CRs and are singular in the 5-HT2R family. This work also provides a structural basis to explain the difference in 5-HT binding specificity between human and mouse 5-HT2BRs. In conclusion, the enhanced structural knowledge on 5-HT2BRs may help in designing specific therapeutic drugs, which may find medical applications in the field of neuroendocrine tumors (39.Brouland J.-P.

The 5-HT2 subtype comprises three closely related receptors, which are 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. Amino acid sequences of the rat (2.Foguet M. Hoyer D. Pardo L.A. Parekh A. Kluxen F.-W. Kalkman H.O.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) 5-HT2B receptors (5-HT2BRs) are highly similar at the level of the predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs); they exhibit 88, 82, and 79% homology upon comparison of mouse and rat, human and mouse, and human and rat receptors, respectively (5.Choi D.-S.

Moreover, significant correlations were established between the pharmacological profiles of human and rat (or human and mouse) 5-HT2BRs but not between those of mouse and rat (5.Choi D.-S. Loric S.

Nevertheless, some compounds (e.g. certain ergolines and benzoylpiperidines) can be used to discriminate pharmacologically between human and rat 5-HT2BRs (6.Wainscott D.B. Lucaites V.L. Kursar J.D. Baez M. Nelson D.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In the absence of any 5-HT receptor three-dimensional structure, computer modeling studies were undertaken in the present study. Our aim was to explain the different 5-HT pK D values measured for the rat, mouse, and human 5-HT2BRs (7.5, 5.8, and 7.9, respectively) and to better understand the mechanism of 5-HT2BR activation. Two main strategies have already been used to build GPCR three-dimensional models. The first one relied on the use of the structure of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) at a 3-Å resolution as a homology template (7.Hibert M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The second strategy, already used for three-dimensional-modeling of the 5-HT2A (9.Almaula N. Ebersole B.J. Zhang D. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 306: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), aimed at constructing modelsde novo by only using the ∼9-Å structure of bovine rhodopsin (RH) as a guide to orient the TMDs. These studies were the starting point in the elucidation of the conformational switch between the inactive and active states of GPCRs. A key feature of these approaches involved the replacement of the network of constraints in the inactive ground state of the receptor by a ligand-induced set of interactions in the activated state (12.Shapiro D.A.

In the present work, the construction of three-dimensional models of the mouse and human 5-HT2BRs was carried out using either the high resolution BR structure or the recently described crystal structure of bovine RH (15.Palczewski K.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) as templates. Structural models of the native receptors liganded or not with 5-HT could be derived. In a second step, site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed to validate the models. Residues predicted to participate to 5-HT binding in either the human or the mouse 5HT2BR were changed. 5-HT binding affinity and 5-HT-induced inositol triphosphate (IP3) production were systematically assessed with each mutated receptor. As a result, the involvement in 5-HT binding of several amino acid residues could be established. Moreover, a two-amino acid permutation in the TMD5 of the human receptor was performed to introduce a mouse-like sequence. This modification resulted in a lowering of the 5-HT affinity and in a change of the IP3production to values similar to those measured with the mouse 5-HT2BR. We conclude that the TMD5 region encompassing the mutated residues participates in the species signature of the 5-HT2BRs. DISCUSSIONIn this report, three-dimensional computer modeling of the TMD bundle of human and mouse 5-HT2BRs was undertaken on the basis of (i) sequence alignment (17.Oliveira L. Paiva A.C.M.

We identified a conserved sequence (Y537LEL) within the α1-subunit that represents an AP-2 binding site. Binding of AP-2 to the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit in response to dopamine (DA) was increased in OK cells stably expressing the wild type rodent α-subunit (OK-WT), but not in cells expressing the Y537A mutant (OK-Y537A). DA treatment was associated with increased α1-subunit abundance in clathrin vesicles from OK-WT but not from OK-Y537A cells. In addition, this mutation also impaired the ability of DA to inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Because phorbol estersincrease Na+,K+-ATPase activity in OK cells, and this effect was not affected by the Y537A mutation, the present results suggest that the identified motif is specifically required for DA-induced AP-2 binding and Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis.

The resulting conformational changes within the N-terminal segment of the α1-subunit (as a consequence of Ser18 phosphorylation) favor the activation of class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), possibly by promoting its interaction with a proline-rich motif located upstream of the PKC phosphorylation site (10.Chibalin A.V.

While phosphorylation of the α1-subunit is important for activation of PI 3-kinase, AP-2/clathrin recruitment, and endocytosis, the reversal of this effect by other agonists does not appear to be controlled by dephosphorylation of the α-subunit (12.Ogimoto G.

In contrast, G protein-coupled receptor signals that oppose Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis, such as α-adrenergic agonists, do so by increasing the levels of inositol hexakisphosphate, thereby preventing the interaction of AP-2 with the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (12.Ogimoto G.

Thus, regulation of the α1-subunit-AP-2 interactions appears to be an important on/off mechanism for regulating Na+,K+-ATPase activity and its availability at the plasma membrane in response to G protein-coupled receptor signals. The present study was therefore performed to identify the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit recognition domain(s) that interacts with AP-2. Antibodies against GFP were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Clathrin antibody was from Oxford Biotechnology (Kidlington, UK). AP-2 antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Dopamine was purchased from Solvay Pharmaceuticals GmbH (Hannover, Germany). All other reagents were of highest available grade. To obtain plasmid pCMV.GFP-Na+,K+-ATPase we first introduced aNruI site into the 5′-untranslated region of the α-subunit of the rat Na+,K+-ATPase in pCMVouabain (PharMingen) by site-directed mutagenesis. The GFP0 cDNA, which lacks the stop codon, was obtained from pB.CMV.GFP0 (13.Moede T. Leibiger B. Pour H.G. Berggren P.-O. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and was inserted in-frame in pCMVouabain-NruI following digestion with NruI and ClaI. Mutants of the un-tagged and the N-terminally GFP-tagged Na+,K+-ATPase were created by site-directed mutagenesis by exchanging nucleotides as follows: Y50F (TACversus TTC), Y255F (TAC versus TTC), Y469F (TACversus TTC), Y537F (TAC versus TTC), Y537A (TACversus GCC), Y679F (TAC versus TTC), L499A (CTGversus GCT), and L554A (CTT versus GCT). All mutations were introduced by employing the QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene, and oligonucleotides bearing the respective nucleotide exchanges were synthesized at Genset. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. OK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively) and 2 mm glutamine in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with various expression constructs using the LipofectAMINE technique (LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen) (14.Rose J.K. Buonocore L. Whitt M.A. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 520-525PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.M. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection the cells were transferred to a medium containing 5 μmouabain (Sigma). Because the native Na+,K+-ATPase is inhibited by this concentration of ouabain, only OK cells expressing the transfected rodent α1-subunit survive. Therefore, the resistant clones (expressing the transfected rat α1-subunit mutants) were expanded and grown in DMEM supplemented with 5 μm ouabain. Expression of the native Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit was negligible (7.Chibalin A.V. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8814-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Na+,K+-ATPase activity was determined from the ouabain-inhibitable 86Rb+transport (nmol of Rb/mg of protein/min). To assess the effect of DA, cells were preincubated with 5 μm monensin (Sigma) for 30 min as described by Seri et al. (16.Seri I. Kone B.C. Gullans S.R. Aperia A. Brenner B.M. Ballerman B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F52-F60PubMed Google Scholar) and then with 1 μm DA (5 min) before assay. Measurements of Na+,K+-ATPase-mediated86Rb+ transport were performed as described previously (5.Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pressley T.A. Rousselot M. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.M. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Vesicles were isolated as described previously (2.Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. Majewski R.R. Muse K.E. Oberley T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F516-F527PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with 1 μm DA or vehicle (Hanks' medium), OK cells were homogenized using a motor pestle homogenizer (Kimble-Kontes, Vineland, NJ) in 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1m Mes, and 0.2 mg/ml NaN3, titrated to pH 6.5 with NaOH. The homogenate was centrifuged at 85,000 ×g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and applied to a discontinuous sucrose gradient (w/v): 60%, 50%, 40%, 10%, and 5%. Samples were then centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 75 min and collected from the 10–40% interface; they were then washed in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 85,000 × g for 1 h. Wheat germ agglutinin was added to a concentration of 1 mg:10 mg of protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The agglutinated material was sedimented at 20,000 × g for 15 min. OK cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm DA for 2 min at 25 °C. Thereafter, the medium was replaced by immunoprecipitation buffer (in mm: 100 NaCl, 50 Tris-HCl, 2 EGTA, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain), 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5)), and the samples were transferred to ice. The cells were disrupted by homogenization with a motor pestle homogenizer. Immunoprecipitation of AP-2 was performed as described previously (12.Ogimoto G. Yudowski G.A. Barker C.J. Köhler M. Katz A.I. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, aliquots (500 μg protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 6 μg of a polyclonal antibody raised against the αC subunit of AP-2 and the simultaneous addition of excess protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Protein content was determined according to Bradford (18.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA), and Western blots were performed using an antibody against the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit (20.Pietrini G. Matteoli M. Banker G. Caplan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8414-8418Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and developed with an ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) detection kit. Monitoring of GFP fluorescence was performed as described previously (21.Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Kohler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9307-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, OK cells expressing the GFP-tagged Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit were grown on 24-mm glass coverslips in supplemented DMEM. For fluorescence imaging, the coverslip was placed in a perfusion chamber and mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope Leica DMIRB (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The cells were maintained throughout the experiment in Hanks' medium at 37 °C. The fluorescence of GFP-tagged Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was monitored by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy using an argon/krypton laser at 488 nm (Leica TCS NT, Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The following filter settings were used: dichroic mirror TK 500, emission filter BP525/50, and 63× lens (Leica PL APO 63×/1.32–0.6 oil). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Comparison between two experimental groups was made with the nonpaired Student's t test.p < 0.05 was considered significant. Using site-directed mutagenesis in intact cells we identified a sequence within the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit that interacts with AP-2 and demonstrated that this interaction is essential for DA-dependent regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and endocytosis. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules in response to G protein-coupled receptor signals requires the interaction of AP-2 with the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit (13.Moede T. Leibiger B. Pour H.G. Berggren P.-O. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,14.Rose J.K. Buonocore L. Whitt M.A. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 520-525PubMed Google Scholar). The AP-2 molecules recognize and bind to short consensus motifs present in membrane proteins to be internalized (22.Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and thereby participate in the recruitment of clathrin to the site of endocytosis. Many AP-2-target interactions involve the AP-2 μ-chain binding to a consensus NPXY or YppØ motif (23.Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), where Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, p are preferentially positively charged residues, and Ø is a residue with a bulky hydrophobic chain. Analysis of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit sequence revealed several intracellular sites for possible interaction with AP-2 (Fig. 1, left panel), whereas the β-subunit has one consensus motif that is located within the putative transmembrane domain. The tyrosine residues identified in all those potential AP-2 binding motifs were initially mutated to phenylalanine. This mutation eliminates only the hydroxyl groups but keeps the aromatic characteristic of the amino acid side chain. OK cell lines stably expressing the Na+,K+-ATPase bearing either of these mutations were generated, and determination of Na+,K+-ATPase activity (a reflection of endocytosis, Ref. 9.Chibalin A.V. Ogimoto G. Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1920-1927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) in response to DA was used as read-out. Whereas nonstimulated Na+,K+-ATPase activity was similar in all groups (mutants and wild type), only OK cells expressing the Na+,K+-ATPase-Y537F mutant demonstrated a significant, although not complete, reduction in the inhibitory response to DA (Fig. 1, right panel). We studied this motif further by introducing a different mutation, Tyr537 → Ala (Y537A); since alanine is an aliphatic amino acid the mutation, Tyr → Ala should totally eliminate any possible interaction between AP-2 and the amino acid side chain. The experiments were performed in OK cells stably expressing the rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1-isoform carrying a GFP tag at the N terminus (α-WT). The presence of this tag did not affect the basal nonstimulated Na+,K+-ATPase activity (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, DA decreased enzyme activity (Fig. 2 A), enhanced the interaction of the α1-subunit with AP-2 (Fig. 2 B), and promoted the endocytosis of active molecules in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) (Fig. 2 C). Introduction of the Y537A mutation (α-Y537A) did not affect the level of α1-subunit expression, as evident from images of the intrinsic GFP fluorescence using confocal microscopy (Fig. 3 A) and Western blot analysis using a GFP- or α-subunit antibody (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Effect of DA on OK cells expressing the Na+,K+-ATPase bearing the Y537A mutation in the α-subunit. A, confocal images of OK cells transfected with the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit bearing the Y537A mutation (α-Y537A) or the wild type (α-WT). B, Western blot analysis of cell homogenates (30 μg) performed with a GFP antibody (1:500). C, determination of Na+,K+-ATPase activity (nmol of Rb/mg of protein/min) in OK cells treated with 1 μm DA for 5 min at 23 °C (closed bars) or vehicle (Hanks' medium,open bars).

D, OK cells transfected with the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit wild type (α-WT) or Y537A mutant (α-Y537A) were incubated with DA as indicated inC. Western blot analysis was performed with an antibody against the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit in the immunoprecipitated material obtained with an AP-2 antibody (left panel). Western blot was performed with an AP-2 antibody in the immunoprecipitated material with a Na+,K+-ATPase antibody (right panel). E, Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit abundance in clathrin vesicles prepared from cells that have been treated with 1 μm DA (5 min at 23 °C) or vehicle (Hanks' medium). Western blots were developed with an antibody against GFP (1:500). Data are representative of five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells expressing either the wild type or mutated GFP-tagged Na+,K+-ATPase isoforms both had comparable catalytic activity, determined as the rate of ouabain-sensitive Rb+ transport in intact OK cells (Fig. 3 C). However, while DA inhibited Na+,K+-ATPase in OK cells expressing the wild type α1-subunit, it failed to induce a significant change in enzyme activity in OK cells expressing the α-Y537A mutant (Fig. 3 C). This mutation, contrary to α-Y537F, completely blocked the inhibitory effect of DA on Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to further establish whether the Y537A mutation has indeed rendered the Na+,K+-ATPase catalytic α1-subunit unable to recognize AP-2 molecules, thus leading to deficient endocytosis in response to DA (Fig. 3 D). Incubation with DA increased the amount of Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit immunoprecipitated with an AP-2 antibody in α-WT, and, as predicted, this interaction was absent in α-Y537A cells (Fig. 3 D,left panel). In another set of experiments, using the same strategy, we demonstrated an increase in AP-2 from the immunoprecipitated material with a Na+,K+-ATPase antibody in DA-treated α-WT, but not α-Y537A, cells (Fig. 3 D, right panel). The sequence identified (Y537LEL) is highly conserved among several species and Na+,K+-ATPase isoforms. Because the two amino acids adjacent to Tyr are not positively charged residues, the motif YLEL cannot be considered a typical “Tyr-based” consensus sequence. Thus, it is possible that its interaction with AP-2 in intact cells and in response to a physiological agonist (dopamine) may be facilitated by, or involve the presence of, other accessory proteins present in the endocytic machinery. At present it is difficult to establish the AP-2/Na+,K+-ATPase structural relationship, although some predictions can be made. Whereas the crystal structure of the Na+,K+-ATPase is still unknown, the structure of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) α1-subunit (which appears to share many common structural features with the Na+,K+-ATPase) has recently been determined (24.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The amino acids of SERCA corresponding to the Na+,K+-ATPase sequence Y537LEL are on the exterior of the molecule N-domain, which contains the nucleotide binding site. If the site within the Na+,K+-ATPase is as exposed as in the SERCA molecule, it may suggests that it is the activation of AP-2 and not the exposure of the “endocytic sequence” that is regulated by the action of dopamine. Because the decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity elicited by DA is exclusively mediated by internalization of active Na+,K+-ATPase molecules (9.Chibalin A.V. Ogimoto G. Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1920-1927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we further examined whether the absence of Tyr537 within the α1-subunit resulted in its deficient clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit abundance in clathrin vesicles was determined in vesicles prepared from α-WT or α-Y537A cells that were previously treated with DA. Characterization of CCV preparations was performed, and the results were similar to the ones previously described in our laboratory (2.Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation time chosen (2.5 min) reflects the maximal incorporation of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules in CCV obtained from renal proximal tubule cells incubated with DA (2.Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DA treatment significantly increased the Na+,K+-ATPase abundance in α-WT, whereas it failed to do so in CCV derived from α-Y537A cells (Fig. 3 E). Na+,K+-ATPase immunoreactivity was present in CCV prepared from the α-Y537A mutants despite lacking the ability to bind AP-2. This could represent a population of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules present in CCV that originate from the recruitment pathway (recycling endosomes) in their way to the plasma membrane (25.Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because the latter is a process that is mediated by AP-1, its interaction site within the Na+,K+-ATPase appears not to be shared with the AP-2 binding motif. In contrast to DA, phorbol esters stimulateNa+,K+-ATPase activity in OK cells (5.Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pressley T.A. Rousselot M. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.M. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and this effect is mediated by increasing the number of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules within the plasma membrane (5.Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pressley T.A. Rousselot M. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a phorbol ester (PMA) also stimulated enzyme activity (nmol of Rb/mg of protein/min) in OK cells bearing the Y537A mutation (α-WT, vehicle: 9.9 ± 0.6 versus 1 μm PMA, 16.3 ± 1.2 and α-Y537A; vehicle: 9.7 ± 0.7 versus 1 μm PMA, 14.0 ± 0.8,n = 3 in all groups), indicating that the stimulatory mechanisms remained intact and that the Y537A mutation appears to affect specifically the inhibitory response to DA. Additionally, these results suggest that the interaction of AP-1 with the Na+,K+-ATPase molecule that is needed for its recruitment to the plasma membrane in response to phorbol esters (5.Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pressley T.A. Rousselot M. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) requires a different recognition sequence within the α1-subunit. Whereas the AP-2 μ-chain interacts with a NPXY or YppØ motif, the β-chain of AP-2 recognizes instead dileucine motifs (−)(2–4)xLL, where (−) is usually a negatively charged residue and x a polar residue (22.Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit sequence revealed the presence of two possible interacting dileucine motifs (EPKHLL499 and L554LLPDE). Na+,K+-ATPase activity was determined in α-WT cells and in cells stably expressing the α1-subunit carrying a mutation Leu499 → Ala (α-L499A) or Leu554 → Ala (α-L554A). The presence of these mutations within the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit neither affected the inhibitory action of dopamine nor the stimulatory effect of phorbol esters (Table I).Table INa,K-ATPase activity (nmol Rb/mg of protein/min) in response to dopamine or PMA in OK cells transfected with the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit bearing a mutation within two different dileucine motifsα-WTα-L499Aα-L554AnVehicle10.9 ± 0.79.6 ± 1.010.0 ± 0.9(4)Dopamine, 1 μm6.0 ± 0.91-ap < 0.01.6.9 ± 0.91-ap < 0.01.5.9 ± 0.61-ap < 0.01.(4)PMA, 1 μm16.3 ± 1.21-ap < 0.01.15.2 ± 0.91-ap < 0.01.15.8 ± 0.51-ap < 0.01.(4)1-a p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab In summary, the present study demonstrates the Y537LEL motif as the recognition site within the Na+,K+-ATPase molecule (catalytic α-subunit) for its interaction with AP-2, a mandatory link in the signaling cascade that translates G protein-coupled receptor activation into clathrin-dependent endocytosis of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules. Moreover, our data indicate that this motif is not involved in the stimulation/recruitment of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules (AP-1-dependent) to the plasma membrane induced by phorbol esters and supports the concept that endocytosis and recruitment are two processes involving separate target motifs within the Na+,K+-ATPase. We thank M. J. Caplan for the gift of Na+,K+-ATPase antibody and T. Moede for useful discussions."

Hormone binds to the exodomain, and the resulting hormone-exodomain complex modulates the endodomain to generate signals. There are mutations that impair either hormone binding or signal generation. We report that the coexpression of a binding defective mutant and a signal-defective mutant rescues signal generation to produce cAMP. This rescue requires both types of mutant receptors and is dependent on the human chorionic gonadotropin dose, the surface concentration of mutant receptors, and the amino acid position of mutations. Furthermore, random collisions among mutant receptors are not involved in the rescue. Our observations provide new insights into the mechanisms of the functional and structural relationship of the exo- and endodomain, signal transduction, and receptor genetics, in particular for defective heterozygotes.

LH receptor luteinizing hormone human chorionic gonadotropin human embryonic kidney follicle-stimulating hormone receptor wild type The luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR)1 plays a crucial role in the development of the gonads in both sexes and ovulation in females. Defective mutations of the receptor often cause infertility (1McGee E.A. Hsueh A.J. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Gain of function mutations are generally dominant, whereas loss of function mutations are recessive. The genetic prediction of mutations is not straightforward, because the effects of some mutations are partial and some patients are defective heterozygotes. For example, there are patients with two defective heterozygous LHR mutations (2Wu L.L. Laue S.M. Kudo M. Bourdony C.J. Cutler Jr., G.B. Hsueh A.J. Chan W.Y. Mol.

This is particularly relevant for LHR, which has two distinct domains, one for hormone binding and the other for signal generation (4Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 5Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol.

We raise the question of whether the exodomain of an LHR can modulate the endodomain of another LHR. As a first step toward understanding this novel and intriguing question, we have investigated the relationship of two different LHR mutants, one with defective hormone binding and the other with normal hormone binding but defective signal generation. LHR belongs to the structurally unique glycoprotein hormone receptor subfamily of the G protein-coupled receptor family (5Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol.

These findings are consistent with the observations that signal generation is generally impacted by endodomain mutants (23Kosugi S. Van Dop C. Geffner M.E. Rabl W. Carel J.C. Chaussain J.L. Mori T. Merendino Jr., J.J. Shenker A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas mutations in the exodomain tend to affect hormone binding (24Bhowmick N. Huang J.

Hsueh A.J. Chan W.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 987-997PubMed Google Scholar,3Wu S. Hallermeier K.M. Laue L. Brain C. Berry A.C. Grant D.B. Griffin J.E. Wilson J.D. Cutler J.G.B. Chan W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1651-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we wondered about the relationship between the two alleles as to whether they would be dependent on or independent of each other. Particularly, there is the intriguing possibility that two heterozygous mutants, one defective in hormone binding and the other with normal hormone binding but defective signal generation, might interact with each other to rescue hormone action. Obviously, this would require the novel intermolecular interaction of the exodomain of one LHR with the endodomain of another LHR. Although it has never been described, it would have significant impact on the interpretation of receptor genetics and provide new insights into clinical treatments. To test the hypothesis, we co-expressed various pairs of heterozygous defective LHRs and tested for their functional rescue. Mutant rat LHR and FSHR cDNAs were prepared in a pSELECT vector using the non-polymerase chain reaction-based Altered Sites Mutagenesis System (Promega), sequenced, and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (27Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14953-14957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After subcloning pcDNA3, the mutant cDNAs were sequenced again. Varying concentrations of plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4814) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected cells were assayed 60–72 h after transfection. Stable cell lines were established in minimum essential medium containing 8% horse serum and 500 μg/ml G-418. All assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated three to four times. Means and standard deviations were calculated. hCG and human follicle-stimulating hormone, provided by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, were radioiodinated as described previously (29Ji I. Ji T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7167-7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were assayed for125I-hormone (150,000 cpm) binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive hormone.Kd values were determined by Scatchard plots. For intracellular cAMP assay, cells were washed twice with minimum essential medium and incubated in the medium containing isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mg/ml) for 15 min. Increasing concentrations of hCG were then added, and the incubation was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. After the medium was removed, the cells were rinsed once with fresh medium without isobutylmethylxanthine, lysed in 70% ethanol, freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen, and scraped. After pelleting cell debris at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 10 μl of the cAMP assay buffer provided by the manufacturer. cAMP concentrations were determined with a125I-cAMP assay kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s instruction and validated for use in our laboratory. Flag-LHR was prepared by inserting the Flag epitope, Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (5-GAC TAC AAG GAC GAT GAC GAT AAG-3), between the C terminus of the signal sequence and the N terminus of mature receptors. Mouse anti-Flag monoclonal M2 antibody (Sigma) was iodinated with 125I according to the published procedure for radioiodination of hCG (29Ji I. Ji T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7167-7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and 125I-anti-Flag antibodies were purified on a Sephadex G-150 column. Binding of 125I-anti-Flag (150,000 cpm) to HEK 293 cells expressing Flag-LH receptors was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive anti-Flag antibody in minimum essential medium containing 3 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin for 8–10 h at 4 °C. To investigate the interaction of heterozygous mutant LHRs, we chose the K583R mutant (LHRK583R) in which Lys583 was substituted with Arg. This mutant receptor is normally processed and targeted to the cell surface and is capable of binding hCG but incapable of inducing cAMP production (30Ryu K.-S. Ji R.L. Gilchrist I. Kim S.-J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7301-7304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mutant receptor is referred to as LHR+hCG/−cAMP. In addition to the LHR+hCG/−cAMP, other mutant LHRs were selected that were expressed on the cell surface but were incapable of binding hCG (LHR−hCG). They are L20A, C22A, P479A, and P479G mutants (31Hong S. Oh K.-S. Ji M.-O. Ryu I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Hong S. Ji T. Phang I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with the LHRK583R plasmid showed hCG binding with the wild type affinity but did not produce cAMP in response to increasing doses of hCG (Fig. 1). Cells transiently transfected with the plasmid for LHRL20A, LHRC22A LHRP479A, or LHRP479G did not show hCG binding or cAMP induction, consistent with previous reports (31Hong S. Oh K.-S. Ji M.-O. Ryu I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Hong S. Ji T. Phang I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cells transfected with the blank plasmid, pcDNA3, failed to bind hCG and produce cAMP, indicating that the vector itself was not involved in hCG binding. Next, cells were cotransfected with a pair of LHR+hCG/−cAMP and LHR−hCG, for example, K583R and L20A mutants or K583R and C22A mutants. The cells that were cotransfected with either LHRK583R and LHRL20Aor LHRK583R and LHRC22A were capable of binding hCG, and the Kd values were similar to the wild type value (Fig. 2, A andB). In addition, these cells induced cAMP production in an hCG dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The maximal levels of cAMP were approximately one-third of the wild type value, and their EC50 values were 15–25-fold higher than the wild type value (Fig. 2, table), suggesting the rescue of cAMP induction with lower potency. The data shown in Fig. 2 suggest that the nonbinding receptors were expressed on the cell surface, as rigorously demonstrated by different methods in previous reports (31Hong S. Oh K.-S. Ji M.-O. Ryu I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Hong S. Ji T. Phang I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, to validate the surface expression, cells were transfected with the mutant receptors that carry the Flag epitope at the N terminus (Flag-LHRC22A) and assayed for binding of anti-Flag monoclonal antibody as described previously (32Hong S. Ji T. Phang I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Ji Y.S. Song I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N.W. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with125I-anti-Flag monoclonal antibody with increasing concentrations of nonradioactive antibody. The cells showed specific binding of the 125I-antibody, which was gradually displaced by nonradioactive antibody, as did the cells transfected with Flag-LHRwt (Table I). However, there was no specific antibody binding to the cells transfected with the LHRWT, LHRC22A, or LHRL20A plasmid as previously reported (32Hong S. Ji T. Phang I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results show that the Flag-LHRs were indeed expressed on the cell surface in these experiments. To determine whether Flag-LHRC22A can rescue cAMP induction, it was co-expressed with LHRK583R. As expected, the cells bound hCG and produced cAMP (Fig.3).Table ISurface expression of Flag-LHRs125I-anti-Flag binding%LHRWT5 ± 3Flag-LHRWT100 ± 9Flag-LHRL20A91 ± 17Flag-LHRC22A60 ± 15Cells were transfected with various Flag-LHR plasmids and assayed for125I-monoclonal anti Flag-antibody binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specific antibody bindings were determined and compared with the specific binding of the Flag-LHRwt. Open table in a new tab Cells were transfected with various Flag-LHR plasmids and assayed for125I-monoclonal anti Flag-antibody binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specific antibody bindings were determined and compared with the specific binding of the Flag-LHRwt. It is unclear whether cAMP was induced by accidental collisions between the endodomains of two different mutant receptors. To test this possibility, several pairs of two different LHR−hCGmutants were co-expressed. As shown in Fig.4, none of the co-expressed pairs (LHRC22A and LHRL20A, LHRC22A and LHRP479A, LHRC22A and LHRP479G, LHRL20A and LHRP479A, and LHRL20Aand LHRP479G) was capable of inducing cAMP or binding hCG. These results show that one of the mutant pairs has to be capable of binding hCG to rescue cAMP induction. To test the dependence of the rescue on hCG binding, cells were co-transfected with varying concentrations (6, 12, and 18 μg) of the LHRK583R plasmid and a constant amount (6 μg) of the LHRL20A or LHRC22A plasmid. The cells were assayed first for hCG binding to determine the relationship of the surface concentration of LHRK583R with the plasmid concentration (Fig. 5). The results show that the surface concentration of LHRK583R increased in parallel to the plasmid concentration used for transfection. The range of the LHRK583R concentration was 5,000–21,000 receptors/cell, which compares favorably with the in vivoLHR concentration on porcine granulosa cells, several thousand per cell. 2C. Lee, I. Ji, and T. H. Ji, unpublished observation. In addition, the variation in the receptor concentration does not appear to impact the hormone binding affinity. However, the maximum cAMP levels show an interesting trend. When 6 μg of the LHRL20A plasmid was cotransfected with 6, 12, or 18 μg of the LHRK583Rplasmid, the maximum cAMP levels were 52.3, 71.1, and 36.5 fmol/1000 cells, respectively. The differences among the three values are statistically significant with p values of <0.05 to <0.001. Therefore, the maximum cAMP level increased by 36% at 12 μg and then decreased by 30% at 18 μg as compared with the cAMP level at 6 μg of the plasmid. The result was similar when 6 μg of the LHRC22A plasmid was co-transfected with 6, 12, or 18 μg of the LHRK583R plasmid. These observations suggest that the cAMP rescue requires LHRK583R and is dependent on the concentration of this mutant receptor. One may question whether the surface expression levels of the LHR−hCG mutants shown in Fig. 5 were constant, although 6 μg of the plasmids was used for transfection of the cells throughout the experiment. To address this problem, we took another approach to keep the expression level of LHR−hCG mutants constant. Cell lines were established after stably transfecting them with the LHRL20A plasmid or LHRC22A plasmid. These cell lines were transfected again with varying concentrations (6, 12, and 18 μg) of the LHRK583R plasmid. The doubly transfected cells showed increasing concentrations of LHRK583R (Fig. 6). Transfection with 12 μg of the LHRK583R plasmid increased the maximum cAMP level by 29–58% over that of the cells transfected with 6 μg of the plasmid. Transfection with 18 μg of the plasmid resulted in a 3-fold increase in the EC50 value for the cAMP rescue, although the maximum cAMP levels remained high. The observations described in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that the cAMP rescue is dependent on the LHRK583R concentration. However, there is a notable difference in the results of Figs. 5 and 6. In Fig. 5 the maximum levels of cAMP peaked as the LHRK583R concentration increased, whereas it plateaued in Fig. 6. The difference in the two experiments was LHR−hCG, which was transiently expressed in the Fig. 5 experiment and stably expressed in the Fig. 6 experiment. A molecule is expressed in stable cell lines generally more than in transiently expressing cells because of the associated antibiotic selection. Therefore, another experiment was performed using the stable cell line expressing Flag-LHRC22A, which appears to express less than 12,800 receptors/cell. It was transiently transfected with increasing concentrations of the LHRK583R plasmid from 3 to 18 μg. The cells produced cAMP in response to hCG, and the maximum cAMP levels peaked (Fig. 3). These results taken together with the data shown in Figs. 5 and 6 show that there are optimal concentrations of LHRK583R to pair with LHR−hCG and rescue cAMP induction. They indicate the importance of the number of the hCG binding receptor and/or the ratio of the hCG binding receptor to the nonbinding receptor. The nonbinding receptors tested so far have mutations in the exodomain that impair hormone binding. In addition to these nonbinding receptors with a defective exodomain, there are nonbinding receptors that have a normal exodomain but mutation in the endodomain, such as P479A and P479G of the transmembrane helix 4 (31Hong S. Oh K.-S. Ji M.-O. Ryu I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These mutations in the endodomain block hCG binding to the exodomain by constraining the exodomain although the exodomain itself is intact (34Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C. Ji N.W. Isaacs I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Ryu K. Gilchrist R.L. Ji C. Tung I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28953-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To test whether these mutants could pair with LHRK583R and induce cAMP production, LHRK583R was co-expressed with LHRP479A or LHRP479A. The cells co-expressing LHRK583R and LHRP479A or LHRK583Rand LHRP479A failed to induce cAMP production although they were capable of binding hCG (Fig. 7). These results indicate that not all of the mutant pairs of LHR−hCG and LHR+hCG/−cAMP are capable of rescuing the hCG dependent cAMP induction, suggesting a specificity for pairing. Furthermore, these results suggest that LHR−hCGwith a mutation in the exodomain, but not in the endodomain, could be rescued. In addition, we tested the affect of another receptor species on the activity of wild type LHR. When LHRwt was co-expressed with FSHRwt, the functional FSHR did not impact the hCG binding affinity or the EC50 value and maximum level of cAMP induction by LHRwt (data not shown). These results show that the cAMP induction by LHR−hCG and LHR+hCG/−cAMP was not rescued by accidental collisions between them or with different hormone receptor species. Our observations described in this work show that cells co-expressing a pair of two differently defective mutants, one defective in hCG binding at the exodomain (LHR−hCG) and the other defective in signal generation at the endodomain (LHR+hCG/−cAMP), can induce cAMP production. This successful rescue of cAMP induction requires both types of mutant receptors. However, not all LHR−hCG were capable of pairing with LHRK583R, an LHR+hCG/−cAMP, and rescuing cAMP induction. Rescue is observed when hormone binding of an LHR−hCG is impaired by a mutation in the exodomain but not by mutations in the endodomain. These results suggest specificity for the rescue of cAMP induction. For example, the rescue is dependent on hCG dose, the surface concentration of the mutant receptors, and the amino acid positions of the mutations. Furthermore, random collisions among mutant receptors are not involved in the rescue. It is known that LHR binds hCG first at the exodomain (12Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19385-19388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Xie Y.B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ji I.

Based on these observations and the results described in this work, the cooperation between the two types of mutant LHRs includes the exodomain of LHRK583R and the endodomain of LHRL20A or LHRC22A. Furthermore, the two domains most likely interact with each other. Therefore, our results suggest an intermolecular interaction between the exodomain of one receptor and the endodomain of another receptor and implicate at least partial substitution of the hCG-functional exodomain complex of a receptor for the defective exodomain of another receptor. This is supported by several pieces of evidence. The rescue is observed when hormone binding of an LHR−hCG is impaired by a mutation in the exodomain but not by mutations in the endodomain. The exodomain and endodomain are dependent on each other before (34Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C. Ji N.W. Isaacs I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the endodomain constrains hormone binding at the exodomain through exoloops and transmembrane helices (31Hong S. Oh K.-S. Ji M.-O. Ryu I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C. Ji N.W. Isaacs I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

The interaction between the exodomain and endodomain involves exoloop 2 of the endodomain and the hinge region of the exodomain (22Nishi S. Nakabayashi K. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3958-3964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Zeng H. Phang T. Ji Y.S. Song I.I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28953-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The intermolecular exodomain-endodomain interaction is also consistent with the dependence of the rescue on receptor concentrations and the existence of optimal concentrations. The observation that too few or too many LHR+hCG/−cAMP can interfere with the collaboration between LHR+hCG/−cAMP and LHR−hCG is of interest and reminiscent of the antibody and antigen interaction. One wonders whether too many LHR+hCG/−cAMP might nonproductively compete for a limited number of LHR−hCG, which could lead to less effective induction of cAMP. It also suggests the intriguing possibility of pleiotropic activation of other LHRs by a liganded LHR, in addition to intramolecular activation of its own endodomain. The intermolecular exodomain-endodomain interaction would allow a heterozygote consisting of LHR+hCG/−cAMP and LHR−hCG to rescue the LHR activity. The rescue observed in this study differs from experiments performed by the Hsueh group (20Osuga Y. Hayashi M. Kudo M. Conti M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25006-25012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). They have elegantly demonstrated the rescue of two defective mutant LHRs: one with the exodomain connected to the transmembrane domain 1 and lacking the rest of the transmembrane helices; and the other possessing the first five transmembrane helices without an exodomain (20Osuga Y. Hayashi M. Kudo M. Conti M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25006-25012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The first transmembrane helix played a crucial role in the cAMP rescue, apparently by its interaction with the five transmembrane helices. Perhaps because of the different mechanisms of rescue in the previous report (20Osuga Y. Hayashi M. Kudo M. Conti M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25006-25012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and this study, the maximum cAMP levels rescued differ considerably; it was 12% of the wild type value in the previous study and 50% in this study. This is also substantially (∼9-fold) higher than the normal basal cAMP level. This is a significant difference when compared with the maximum cAMP level of activating mutant LHRs, which is 5–8-fold greater than the normal cAMP basal level (41Kosugi S. Mori T. Shenker A. J.

For another round of initiation, the GDP in the eIF2 binary complex must be exchanged for GTP in a reaction catalyzed by the multimeric protein factor eIF2B (previously called guanine nucleotide exchange factor) (6.Price N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1051-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has shown that unphosphorylated eIF2α also meditates nucleotide exchange. The rate of eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange increases in the absence of the α-subunit compared with wild type, which suggests that nucleotide exchange requires direct interaction between eIF2α and eIF2B and that phosphorylation strengthens this interaction. There are no structural data on any of the eIF2 monomers to provide a structural context for these important regulatory interactions.Here we report the structure of human eIF2α determined by x-ray crystallography using multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) on a selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled baculovirus-expressed eIF2α at 1.9 Å resolution. The crystallization of eIF2α was achieved only by using limited proteolysis techniques, and the final structure comprises residues 3–182, roughly the N-terminal two-thirds of full-length human eIF2α.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe structure of an ∼21.4-kDa N-terminal fragment of human eIF2α was determined using x-ray crystallography at 1.9 Å resolution. The crystal structure contains residues 3–182 with a disordered loop from residues 51 to 68 (Fig. 2). The final model, with approximate dimensions of 57 × 36 × 35 Å, is divided into two major domains: the OB domain and the helical domain.OB DomainThe first 87 N-terminal residues have an oligonucleotide-binding fold (OB fold) (32.Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), with a five-stranded antiparallel β-barrel arranged with a Greek key topology capped by a turn of 310 α-helix located between β3 and β4 (Fig. 2).A β-hairpin connects β1 and β2; β2 and β3 are linked by a four-residue loop and β4 and β5 by a three-residue loop. The loop connecting β3 and β4 is longer by 17 residues, and it was not completely modeled due to a lack of interpretable electron density. The visible part, residues 48–50, begins with a turn of 310 helix that is stabilized through a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Leu-46 and nitrogen of Glu-49. Serine 51 comes just after this 310 helix (Fig. 2). Residues 63 and 64 at the end of the loop are also visible with a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Arg-63 and the main chain nitrogen of Arg-66. β1 contains a β-bulge at residue Val-23, and a left-handed Gly-65 (φ and ψ have the same absolute values as the right-handed Gly but with opposite signs) is present at the beginning of β4; both are standard features of the OB fold.The eIF2α N-terminal domain is the latest example of the large oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold. The structural classification of the protein data base (SCOP (34.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5568) Google Scholar)) counts at present 61 different structures containing an OB fold, divided into seven superfamilies. Using the DALI server software (35.Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar), the OB domain of human eIF2α was identified as a member of the nucleic acid-binding superfamily. Examples of members of this family are: S1 RNA-binding domain from the Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (33.Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G.

The main differences are restricted to loop regions, especially the length of the loop connecting β3 and β4 containing the phosphorylation site. Among the eIF2α sequences, the β3 to β4 residues are highly conserved (Fig. 3); in human eIF2α, this region contains a turn of a 310 helix (Fig. 2) as observed in the NMR structure of E. coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (33.Bycroft M.

In most cases RNA interaction seems to involve solvent-exposed aromatic residues and positively charged residues on the surface of the protein. The only structure available for this group of proteins bound to nucleic acids is the complex of the N-terminal fragment of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase with the anti-codon loop of its cognate tRNA (41.Ruff M. Krishnaswamy S. Boeglin M. Poterszman A. Mitschler A. Podjarny A. Rees B. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Science. 1991; 252: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) where there is a π-stacking interaction between one of the bases and a conserved Phe residue. In eIF2α the corresponding region contains two tyrosine residues, Tyr-32 and Tyr-81, clustered with non-polar residues Met-44, Leu-46, Ile-82, and Gly-43 and two residues, Glu-42 and Asp-83, with negatively charged side chains (Fig. 2).The OB domain of human eIF2α does not have any of the clustered positive charges that are observed for the other members of this family. This structural feature is consistent with the observation that, unlike other family members in which biochemical and genetic experiments and limited structural data support the idea of direct interaction with nucleic acids (36.Schindelin H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1051-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Most cross-linking and genetic experiments suggest that β- and γ-subunits of eIF2 are the subunits involved in initiator tRNA and ribosomal RNA binding (8.Gaspar N.J. Kinzy T.G. Scherer B.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3065-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Helical DomainThe helical domain comprises residues 88–182. In contrast to the highly conserved architecture of the OB domain, the helical domain adopts a previously unreported fold consisting of a 28-residue-long α-helix (α1), a series of small α-helices (α2, α3, α4, and α6), and one 310 helix folded into a very compact domain (Fig. 2). The OB and helical domains are linked by a disulfide bridge between Cys-69 in β4 and Cys-97 in α1 (Fig. 2). Alignment of eIF2α sequences suggests that this disulfide bridge is only possible in mammalian eIF2α (Fig. 3). The last residue in our model, Arg-182, is solvent-exposed, and some uninterpretable electron density can be observed around this region, suggesting that proteolytic attack may not be specific.Groove between the OB and Helical DomainsA negatively charged cavity is formed where the OB and helical domains come together (Fig. 4). The residues defining this groove come from several secondary structural elements: Tyr-8, located at the beginning of the OB domain; Asp-17 at β1; Asp-37 and Tyr-38 in the loop connecting β2 and β3; and Asp-138 on α3. Interestingly, all of the residues found in this region are highly conserved among the species (Fig. 4). The β-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2β (12.Laurino J.P. Thompson G.M. Pacheco E. Castilho B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 173-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) contains a polylysine motif. The negatively charged groove in eIF2α might serve as the direct interaction site for the polylysine repeat.Figure 4A view of the highly conserved pocket between α1 of the helical domain (upper right) and the OB domain (lower left).The molecular surface was calculated with SPOCK (47.Christopher J.A.

Phosphorylation of eIF2α converts eIF2 from a substrate into a competitive inhibitor for the guanine exchange factor eIF2B. The eIF2 binding experiments demonstrate that eIF2B binds to phosphorylated eIF2 with a higher affinity than to unphosphorylated eIF2.It has been suggested that eIF2α is required for the interaction between eIF2 and eIF2B (8.Gaspar N.J. Kinzy T.G. Scherer B.J. Hümbelin M. Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3415-3422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high affinity interaction between eIF2α and the regulatory domain composed of α- and δ-subunits of eIF2B is required for the proper binding of eIF2 to the catalytic domain of eIF2B, allowing normal rates of nucleotide exchange (43.Kimball S.R.

The phosphorylation site of eIF2α lies on the long loop connecting β3 and β4 of the OB domain, and it is close to the nominal RNA-binding site (Fig. 2). The lack of electron density suggests that this region is very mobile. Not surprisingly, the NMR structure of the translational initiation factor IF1 from E. coli shows considerable flexibility for the corresponding loop (40.Sette M. van Tilborg P. Spurio R. Kaptein R. Paci M. Gualerzi C.O. Boelens R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1436-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).The simplest way for eIF2B to detect and respond to phosphorylation at Ser-51 would be for eIF2B to make direct contact with eIF2 in the Ser-51-containing loop region. An interesting feature of the highly conserved loop sequence is the predominance of positively charged residues (Arg-52, Arg-53, Arg-54, Arg-56, Lys-60, Arg-63) following Ser-51 (Fig. 3). This proximity and conservation, combined with the recent results that eIF2α and the regulatory domain eIF2B interact independently of phosphorylation, suggest a model in which the positively charged residues participate in an interaction that is enhanced by phosphorylation.In summary, the present study provides the first structural analysis of any member of the eIF2 heterotrimeric complex and provides a framework for further genetic, biochemical, and structural analyses of protein-protein interactions involving eIF2α.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of a conserved serine (Ser-51) in the α-subunit is the major regulator of protein synthesis in eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 2.Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-51 shuts off protein synthesis (14.Pathak V.K. Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Cell. 1998; 54: 633-639Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Three protein kinases, HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor), PKR (RNA-dependent protein kinase), and GCN2, have been identified that specifically phosphorylate Ser-51 in response to a variety of cellular stresses including viral infection, heat shock, heavy metals, and deprivation of amino acids or serum. The phosphorylated eIF2·GDP complex released during protein synthesis initiation binds eIF2B with much higher affinity than does eIF2·GTP, and binding to eIF2B does not allow the exchange GDP for GTP that is necessary for further rounds of initiation (reviewed in Refs 15.Clemens M.J.

A recent paper by Nika and co-authors (18.Nika J. Rippel S. Hannig E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1051-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has shown that unphosphorylated eIF2α also meditates nucleotide exchange. The rate of eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange increases in the absence of the α-subunit compared with wild type, which suggests that nucleotide exchange requires direct interaction between eIF2α and eIF2B and that phosphorylation strengthens this interaction. There are no structural data on any of the eIF2 monomers to provide a structural context for these important regulatory interactions. Here we report the structure of human eIF2α determined by x-ray crystallography using multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) on a selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled baculovirus-expressed eIF2α at 1.9 Å resolution. The crystallization of eIF2α was achieved only by using limited proteolysis techniques, and the final structure comprises residues 3–182, roughly the N-terminal two-thirds of full-length human eIF2α. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe structure of an ∼21.4-kDa N-terminal fragment of human eIF2α was determined using x-ray crystallography at 1.9 Å resolution. The crystal structure contains residues 3–182 with a disordered loop from residues 51 to 68 (Fig. 2). The final model, with approximate dimensions of 57 × 36 × 35 Å, is divided into two major domains: the OB domain and the helical domain.OB DomainThe first 87 N-terminal residues have an oligonucleotide-binding fold (OB fold) (32.Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), with a five-stranded antiparallel β-barrel arranged with a Greek key topology capped by a turn of 310 α-helix located between β3 and β4 (Fig. 2).A β-hairpin connects β1 and β2; β2 and β3 are linked by a four-residue loop and β4 and β5 by a three-residue loop. The loop connecting β3 and β4 is longer by 17 residues, and it was not completely modeled due to a lack of interpretable electron density. The visible part, residues 48–50, begins with a turn of 310 helix that is stabilized through a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Leu-46 and nitrogen of Glu-49. Serine 51 comes just after this 310 helix (Fig. 2). Residues 63 and 64 at the end of the loop are also visible with a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Arg-63 and the main chain nitrogen of Arg-66. β1 contains a β-bulge at residue Val-23, and a left-handed Gly-65 (φ and ψ have the same absolute values as the right-handed Gly but with opposite signs) is present at the beginning of β4; both are standard features of the OB fold.The eIF2α N-terminal domain is the latest example of the large oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold. The structural classification of the protein data base (SCOP (34.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5568) Google Scholar)) counts at present 61 different structures containing an OB fold, divided into seven superfamilies. Using the DALI server software (35.Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar), the OB domain of human eIF2α was identified as a member of the nucleic acid-binding superfamily. Examples of members of this family are: S1 RNA-binding domain from the Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (33.Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Fr"

Here we report the identification and functional characterization of a mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP) from Trypanosoma brucei, the firsttrans-acting factor involved in kinetoplast mitochondrial transcription to be identified. Using sequences conserved among the catalytic domains of the single-subunit mtRNAPs, we were able to obtain a full-length sequence for a candidate mtRNAP from T. brucei. Sequence comparison indicates that it shares homology in its catalytic domain with other single-subunit mtRNAPs, including functionally conserved residues that are identical in all single-subunit RNAPs. We used RNA interference to functionally knock out the gene product to determine whether the candidate gene represents an mtRNAP. As predicted for a mitochondrial specific RNA polymerase, reduction of the gene product resulted in a specific decrease of mitochondrial versus nuclear transcripts. Additionally, similar to the mtRNAP of other organisms, the mtRNAP characterized here is involved in replication of the mitochondrial genome. Thus, based on sequence comparison and functional studies, we have cloned an mtRNAP from trypanosomes.

The mitochondrial genome of kinetoplastids is unusual in that it is comprised of large and small circular DNAs, maxicircles and minicircles, respectively, catenated into a giant network called kinetoplast DNA (1.Klingbeil M.M.

Little is known of the mechanisms regulating gene expression of either maxicircles or minicircles. InTrypanosoma brucei, the 23-kb maxicircles represent the typical mitochondrial DNA, coding for rRNAs and several proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration. Similar to other organisms, numerous polycistronic transcripts have been detected, indicating that maxicircles are transcribed polycistronically (4.Feagin J.E. Jasmer D.P. Stuart K.

No maxicircle promoter has yet been identified, although a precursor extending at least 1200 nucleotides upstream of the 12 S rRNA has been detected and may represent an initiation site for transcription (7.Michelotti E.F. Harris M.E. Adler B. Torri A. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Many maxicircle genes encode cryptic transcripts that require the post-transcriptional insertion or deletion of uridines to produce a functional mRNA, which is a process known as RNA editing (Ref. 8.Benne R. van den Burg J.

Despite some conserved features, they are heterogeneous in sequence and provide the 250–300 sequence classes necessary to edit maxicircle transcripts (15.Steinert M. van Assel S.

McManus M.T. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5525-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Like maxicircles, no promoter has been identified for minicircles. However, each gRNA transcription unit is flanked by 18-bp imperfect inverted repeats that have been proposed to function in gRNA expression, because transcription initiates 31–32 bp downstream of the 5′ inverted repeat at the conserved sequence 5′-RYAYA-3′ in the gRNA gene (12.Pollard V.W. Rohrer S.P. Michelotti E.F. Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 783-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The function of the 18-bp inverted repeats in transcriptional initiation, termination, or processing remains to be determined. In addition to a lack of knowledge concerning cis-acting sequences within the mitochondrial genome, neither the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP) nor any transcription factor has been identified in trypanosomes. The search for cis-elements ortrans-acting factors involved in kinetoplastid mitochondrial transcription has been hindered by the lack of a functional assay to either test putative promoter elements or purify the transcriptional complex. In contrast to the multisubunit RNAPs of the nucleus, the catalytic domains of mtRNAPs in all organisms identified to date are related to the single-subunit RNA polymerases, similar to the T7 bacteriophage polymerase (18.Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 19.Cermakian N. Ikeda T.M. Cedergren R. Gray M.W.

Evol. 1997; 45: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Using conserved sequences in the catalytic domains of single-subunit RNA polymerases, a sequence was identified in the trypanosome genome data base as a candidate fragment of mtRNAP (21.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). As expected because mtRNAP would be required in active mitochondria, functional knockout of the candidate gene was lethal in procyclic form trypanosomes. Recently, a full-length sequence has been reported that represents the same candidate mtRNAP (22.Clement S.L. Koslowsky D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, there remains no functional demonstration that it is a mtRNAP. In this paper, we report the sequence of the full-length gene for a candidate mtRNAP in T. brucei. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the putative T. brucei mtRNAP with those of other organisms provides evidence that we have identified an mtRNAP and that it is the same candidate mtRNAP reported earlier (21.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar,22.Clement S.L. Koslowsky D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the gene is in fact a mitochondrial specific RNA polymerase through functional analyses using RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is a phenomenon by which the introduction of double-stranded RNA results in the specific degradation of a transcript sharing the same sequence. Although the mechanism of RNAi is a subject of intense study, RNAi is also rapidly becoming a convenient method of genetic manipulation (for reviews see Refs. 23.Fire A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 358-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 24.Bass B. Nature. 2001; 411: 235-238Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25.Hammond S.M.

As predicted for an mtRNAP, functional knockout resulted in a specific decrease of mitochondrial transcripts versus nuclear RNAs. Additionally, we find a corresponding decrease in maxicircle abundance, suggesting that as in other organisms, the T. brucei mtRNAP also functions in replication of the mitochondrial genome. With the identification of a mtRNAP, functional assays can now be developed to determine promoter sequences and other trans-acting factors involved in mitochondrial transcription of the kinetoplast. Procyclic T. brucei TREU 667 cells were grown at 26 °C in Cunningham medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (28.Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated using TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and poly(A)+ RNA was selected using a Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Dynal A. S.) according to manufacturer's instructions. The RNAi vector and cell line has been described previously (21.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Briefly, procyclic T. brucei strain 29-13 (a gift from Drs. Elizabeth Wirtz and George Cross), which harbors integrated genes for T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor, were transfected with the stem-loop vector into which a 470-bp fragment of the mtRNAP was cloned in opposite orientation separated by a ∼550-bp irrelevant stuffer region. Transcription from a tetracycline-inducible procyclin promoter then produces a dsRNA as a stem-loop structure. The cells were adapted to Cunningham medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated at 55 °C for 30 min) and maintained with 15 μg/ml G418, 50 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. The cells were induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline and harvested at indicated times post-induction. Total RNA was isolated using TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RT-PCR was performed as previously described using 0.6–1.0 μg of total RNA/reaction (17.Grams J. McManus M.T. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5525-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To map the 5′ splice site, 5′ spliced leader (5′-CGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′) and 3′ KIP (5′-CTTTATCGGTGCCAGACTCAACCG-3′) primers were used. Another primer set was also tested, 5′ spliced leader 2 (5′-CGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTGTAC-3′) and 3′ GVE (5′-CCCCACCTCCACGTACGG-3′), followed by nested PCR with primer 3′ KIP. All PCR reactions to map the 5′ splice site were performed at an annealing temperature of 50 °C. To map the 3′ polyadenylation site, 3′ poly(T) (5′-AGCTCGGATCCGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) and 5′ AIE (5′-GCAATAGAAATGCAAAACCTTGG-TCT-3′) primers were used at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. The Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used in all PCR reactions. PCR products were cloned into TA vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing was performed with [α-35S]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Sequenase (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA (5 or 10 μg) was run on 1% methyl mercury-agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. RNAs were transferred via capillary blot to GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) nylon membranes in 10× SSC (1.5m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were cross-linked using a Bio-Rad GS Gene Linker according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.9m NaCl, 5× Denhardt's, 10% dextran sulfate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 40% formamide, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 2–6 h. Probes were added, and hybridization was overnight. The filters were washed with 2× SSC at room temperature; 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 60 °C; and 0.1× SSC at room temperature. the oligonucleotides were used in PCR reactions with 2 ng of genomic DNA to generate PCR products for use in random primer labeling reactions: mtRNAP, 5′ mtRNAP (5′-AGCTCGGATCCCCCATTATGACTCAAGTGTATGGC-3′) and 3′ mtRNAP (5′-AGCTCGGATCCAGACCAAGGTTTTGCATTTCTATTGC-3′); α-tubulin, 5′ tub (5′-CCGTGGCATATGGCAAG-3′) and 3′ tub (5′-GGGGGTCGCACTTTGTC-3′); RNAP II, 5′ RNAP II (5′-TACGGCGAAGACGGTCTT-3′) and 3′ RNAP II (5′-CATTTGTGTGGCAGGTTC-3′); ISP, 5′ ISP (5′-AAGCAACTTGAAGGTTCC-3′) and 3′ ISP (5′-GTCCGTTTCGGGATGC-3′); COI, 5′ COI (5′-ATATCATAATTCTACCTG-3′) and 3′ COI (5′-TACAAACTGGTACTCATG-3′); COII, 5′ COII (5′-GATATTTTTAATGGATTC-3′) and 3′ COII (5′-AATAGGCATAAAACCGTG-3′); and Cyb, 5′ Cyb (5′-TTTGATTTGGGTTTTGTG-3′) and 3′ Cyb (5′-CCAATTTATAAATATAACATAC-3′). The probes were generated using 25 ng of gel-purified PCR products with the Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation was carried out using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Mid-log phase cells (∼5 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested and washed once with NET-100 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA) and resuspended in NET-100 at a density of 2 × 108 cells/ml. The cells were lysed in 0.5% SDS containing 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K (56 °C, 4 h) and then treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (37 °C, 15 min). The cell lysate was extracted with phenol/chloroform, DNA was precipitated with 2-propanol, and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. DNA from 1 × 106 cell equivalents was treated with 0.15 m HCl for 10 min, denatured in 0.4 m NaOH, 25 mm EDTA, and then transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membranes using a dot blot apparatus. 32P-Radiolabeled probes were made by random priming PCR products specific for minicircles (30.Ntambi J.M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5574-5579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), maxicircles (31.Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), or nuclear DNA (trypanosome hexose transporter 1 gene family). DNA amounts were determined by phosphorimaging. Mitochondrial RNA polymerases share significant sequence homology in their catalytic domains with the single-subunit RNA polymerases such as that of T7 bacteriophage (18.Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Using conserved sequences in the catalytic domain, we identified a 470-bp sequence in the trypanosome genome data base (www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb) as a candidate fragment of the T. brucei mtRNAP. Using the combined methods of RT-PCR and genomic PCR, we were then able to identify an open reading frame of 3,828 nucleotides, preceded by a stop codon ∼200 nucleotides upstream and terminating with a pair of stop codons (Fig. 1). There are a number of potential candidates for the initiating methionine downstream of the 5′ end stop codon. Because a 39-nucleotide spliced leader RNA istrans-spliced onto the 5′ end of all trypanosome nuclear encoded mRNAs, we used RT-PCR with spliced leader RNA and gene-internal primers to identify the initiating methionine. The splice site mapped to 29 nucleotides upstream of a methionine, resulting in a relatively short 5′-untranslated region. Only one site was obtained in three clones, and this site agrees with the consensus splice acceptor site, containing an upstream polypyrimidine-rich tract and being preceded immediately by an AG dinucleotide (Fig. 1,underlining and dots beneath sequence, respectively). Two sites of polyadenylation at 9 and 50 nucleotides after the 3′ end stop codon were mapped using RT-PCR with poly(T) and gene internal oligonucleotides (Fig. 1, arrows). Using the original 470-bp fragment in Southern mapping suggests the gene is single-copy, and an ∼4 kb transcript detected by Northern blot is in congruence with the predicted open reading frame (data not shown). The full-length protein has a predicted molecular mass of 144 kDa. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the putativeT. brucei mtRNAP with those of other organisms supports that we have identified a mitochondrial specific RNA polymerase (Fig. 2 A). First, because the gene is encoded by the nucleus, we would expect the protein to contain a mitochondrial localization signal to be imported into the mitochondrion. Indeed, the amino acid sequence of the candidate mtRNAP contains a predicted mitochondrial localization signal of 30 amino acids at the N terminus. Other than containing a mitochondrial localization signal, mtRNAPs do not share homology in their N termini, and this region accounts for most of the size variability among them. Similarly, the N terminus of the T. brucei protein accounts for its size variability when compared with other mtRNAPs. Second, the mtRNAPs of all organisms identified to date are conserved in their catalytic domains, delineated as subdomains III–X (18.Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 32.Li J. Maga J.A. Cermakian N. Cedergren R. Feagin J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The putative T. brucei mtRNAP shares overall amino acid sequence homology (∼50% identity and ∼70% similarity) with other mtRNAPs in these subdomains, including many residues that are identical (Fig. 2 B). In addition to overall sequence homology, amino acids that are present in the active site and are thought to be involved in catalytic function of the single-subunit RNAPs have been mapped for T7 RNAP (33.Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.-C. Nature. 1993; 364: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These are identical in all mtRNAPs and are present in the T. brucei sequence (Fig. 2 B). For example, Asp537 and Asp812 of T7 RNAP are involved in binding metal ions at the active site (34.Osumi-Davis P.A. de Aguilera M.C. Woody R.W. Woody A.-Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 35.Woody A.-Y.M. Eaton S.S. Osumi-Davis P.A. Woody R.W.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, sequence comparison with other mtRNAPs supports that the gene is aT. brucei mtRNAP. It is also apparent from sequence analysis that we have, using an independent method, identified an identical candidate mtRNAP recently reported by another group (22.Clement S.L. Koslowsky D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). RNAi is a recently discovered phenomenon in which introduction of a specific dsRNA into cells results in the degradation of the specific cellular mRNA (for reviews see Refs. 23.Fire A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 358-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 24.Bass B. Nature. 2001; 411: 235-238Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25.Hammond S.M.

As such, it is rapidly becoming a powerful tool for the genetic manipulation of trypanosomes (21.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 39.Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A major advantage of using RNAi to produce functional knockouts is that only partial sequence is necessary to induce the specific degradation of any given target mRNA. Hence, Wang et al. (21.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) cloned the 470-bp sequence obtained from the data base into an RNAi vector and subsequently integrated it into a nontranscribed region of the genome to produce a stable cell line. Expression of the dsRNA is regulated by a tetracycline-inducible promoter. After induction of dsRNA with tetracycline, there is a ∼95% reduction in transcript abundance of an ∼4-kb mRNA after 24 h, and there is growth inhibition 6 days after induction followed by cell death (21.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To determine whether our candidate gene was in fact the mtRNAP, we wanted to further analyze the phenotype of these cells. Similar to what has been reported, we find the cells stop dividing 3–4 days after tetracycline induction, eventually succumbing to cell death ∼6 days after induction (Fig. 3 A). A lethal phenotype was expected because mitochondrial function is required in procyclic cells. Likewise by Northern blot analysis, the ∼4-kb transcript of the candidate mtRNAP had decreased by ∼80% after 24 h of tetracycline induction, whereas dsRNA production was already near its maximal levels (Fig. 3 B). Reduction of the ∼4-kb transcript occurs rapidly after tetracycline induction as seen in a time course, with 50% reduction in transcript abundance as early as 7 h post-induction (data not shown). After 3 days of tetracycline induction, there is a 95% reduction in transcript abundance. On days 1–3 after RNAi induction we observed faint bands migrating slightly faster than the full-length mtRNAP transcript that may represent partially degraded mtRNAP mRNA (Fig. 3 B). If the candidate gene is a mtRNAP, we would predict that a functional knockout of the mtRNAP would result in a specific decrease in mitochondrial transcripts versus those of the nucleus. To test this, RNA was isolated from cells after 0–3 days of tetracycline induction and analyzed by Northern blot. For nuclear transcripts, the mRNA levels of α-tubulin, the nuclear RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), and a protein that is imported into the mitochondrion, the Rieske ISP, were assayed (Fig. 4 A). The steady-state abundance of all three nuclear transcripts remained comparable with preinduction with tetracycline (0 days of tetracycline induction). In contrast to the nuclear transcripts, the abundance of all mitochondrial transcripts, cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II (COI and COII, respectively), Cyb, NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1 and 4 (ND1 and ND4, respectively) decreased over 3 days after tetracycline induction (Fig. 4 B). The kinetics of mRNA decrease were variable for the different maxicircle genes. The simplest pattern occurred for COI and ND1, with mRNA steadily decreasing over the course of 3 days. Transcript levels of Cyb and ND4 are not as straightforward, as they actually increase by 36 and 85%, respectively, after 1 day of tetracycline induction. The cause for this increase is unknown. The steady-state abundance of COII only modestly increases by 6%, so that the profile of COII may result from a slower turnover rate of the COII mRNA versus that of COI and ND1 mRNAs. A larger COII transcript also increases after tetracycline induction. This larger transcript has previously been described as either a polycistronic precursor or the result of the addition of a long poly(A) tail (41.Michelotti E.F. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 927-932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Feagin J.E. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). That this transcript increases with overall declining mRNA levels may indicate a coordination of transcription and RNA processing. Despite the differences in the rate of decline, the steady-state abundance of all mitochondrial mRNAs examined decreased considerably with functional knockout of the candidate mtRNAP. The difference in the reduction rates of the candidate mtRNAP transcript (Fig. 3 B)versus that of the mitochondrial transcripts (Fig. 4 B) probably reflects the active degradation of the ∼4-kb transcript by RNAi versus the variation in mRNA turnover rates for the other transcripts following loss of mtRNAP function. The finding that functional knockout of the ∼4-kb transcript results in the specific decrease in mitochondrial versus nuclear transcripts is consistent with the gene representing an mtRNAP ofT. brucei. The mtRNAP of other organisms functions in the transcription of the mitochondrial genome as well as in initiation of DNA replication. In both humans and yeast, replication of one mitochondrial DNA strand utilizes an RNA primer made by the mtRNAP, whereas replication of the other strand uses primers generated by a mitochondrial primase (for review see Ref. 43.Lecrenier N. Foury F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine whether the T. brucei mtRNAP is also involved in replication of the kDNA, the abundance of minicircles and maxicircles was determined using dot blot analysis with specific probes. After 3 days of tetracycline induction, the abundance of minicircles remains relatively unchanged at 97.9% of preinduction levels, whereas maxicircle abundance decreases to 57% of preinduction levels (Fig. 5). After 4 days of tetracycline induction, both minicircle and maxicircle abundance continues to decrease reaching 85.6 and 30.7% of preinduction levels, respectively. However, after 4 days of tetracycline induction, the level of nuclear transcripts also decreases (data not shown), suggesting that the cells have become compromised so that the decrease in minicircle abundance may not be directly attributable to loss of the mtRNAP. Taken together, these results suggests that the mtRNAP is involved in maxicircle replication but not minicircle replication. To understand mitochondrial gene regulation in trypanosomes, we must understand transcription of the unusual kinetoplast DNA. However, no cis-elements ortrans-acting factors had been characterized for the transcription of either component of kinetoplast DNA. Using conserved sequences among mtRNAPs, we identified a 470-bp fragment in theT. brucei genome data base representing a portion of a candidate mtRNAP. RT-PCR and genomic PCR then enabled us to obtain full-length sequence of the gene. Sequence analysis indicates that it shares overall homology in its catalytic domain, including functionally conserved residues, with other single-subunit RNA polymerases. As expected for an mtRNAP, functional knockout of the gene product using RNAi resulted in the specific decrease of mitochondrialversus nuclear transcripts. Additionally, functional knockout of the mtRNAP resulted in a decrease in maxicircle abundance. This suggests that as in other organisms, the T. bruceimtRNAP also functions in replication of the mitochondrial genome, specifically that of maxicircles. Thus, sequence comparison and functional studies indicate that we have cloned an mtRNAP in trypanosomes. In the simplest model of kinetoplastid mitochondrial transcription, maxicircles and minicircles would share promoter elements and transcriptional complexes. Alternatively in a more complicated system, different promoter elements could vary in their ability to recruit a transcriptional complex or could recruit differenttrans-acting factors, utilizing distinct mtRNAPs or transcription factors. We show that the mtRNAP described here transcribes numerous genes on the maxicircle, but we were unable to analyze minicircle transcription, probably because of the relatively low abundance of gRNAs. Thus, we were unable to determine whether the mtRNAP described here functions in minicircle transcription. However, we were able to demonstrate that this mtRNAP is involved in replication of the maxicircles but not of the minicircles. This suggests that replication of minicircles may involve a different mtRNAP or perhaps the mtDNA primase previously reported (48.Li C. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20787-20792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that two mtRNAPs transcribe the two distinct components of the kinetoplast, this would be unprecedented in mitochondria. However, it has been shown that chloroplasts contain both an eubacteria-like RNAP, coded by the chloroplast genome (PEP for plastid-encoded polymerase) and a single-subunit RNAP, coded by the nucleus (NEP for nuclear-encoded polymerase) and imported into the chloroplast (for reviews see Refs. 44.Igloi G.L. Kossel H. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1992; 10: 525-558Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar and 45.Gray M.W. Lang B.F. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Reduction of the maxicircle transcripts results in cell death after 6 days of tetracycline induction. This suggests that, if there is another RNAP, the two are not functionally redundant, and any minicircle-specific RNA polymerase cannot compensate in transcription of the maxicircle. Furthermore, data base searches using the conserved catalytic domain failed to identify other candidate sequences, and Southern analysis has indicated a single-copy gene. Thus, if there is an additional mtRNAP, it may not be related to the single-subunit RNAP we describe here. It is possible that a second mtRNAP would resemble the multi-subunit eubacterial RNAP as in the chloroplast. In fact, genes for the multi-subunit eubacteria-like RNAP have been found in the mitochondrial genome of jakobid flagellates (46.Lang B.F. Burger G. O'Kelly C.J. Cedergren R. Golding G.B. Lemieux C. Sankoff D. Turmel M. Gray M.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 47.Lang B.F. Seif E. Gray M. O'Kelly C.J. Burger G. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1999; 46: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, this is based solely on genetic data, and it is unknown whether these produce a functional mitochondrial polymerase and/or whether these organisms also contain a single-subunit mtRNAP. Regardless of whether there is more than one RNAP in the trypanosome mitochondrion, we have demonstrated the specific reduction of several maxicircle transcripts and in maxicircle abundance following functional knockout of the putative mtRNAP. Kinetic analysis suggests that the reduction of mitochondrial transcripts is not simply a result of a decrease in the maxicircle abundance. With a decrease in maxicircle abundance to 87% after 1 day of tetracycline induction, there is a decrease of COI and ND1 transcripts to 65.4 and 53.6%, respectively. After 2 days of tetracycline induction, maxicircle abundance has decreased to 77.5%, whereas COI and ND1 transcripts have decreased to 17.4 and 29%, respectively. Furthermore, the transcript levels of Cyb and ND4 surprisingly increase by 36 and 85%, respectively, after 1 day of tetracycline induction. We cannot explain the initial increase in the abundance of these transcripts. However, during the first 24 h post-induction of RNAi, the transcript abundance of mtRNAP is reduced ∼80% (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that there remains a potentially active pool of mtRNAP. The initial increase in these transcripts may then reflect a preferential recruitment of residual transcriptional complexes to the Cyb or ND4 promoters over the promoters utilized in the transcription of COI, COII, and ND1. We do not know how the mtRNAP is involved in maxicircle replication. One possibility is that the mtRNAP synthesizes nascent transcripts that serve as leading strand primers at the origin of maxicircle replication. Alternatively, the mtRNAP may synthesize the primers for Okazaki fragments for lagging strand replication. Another mitochondrial protein was isolated, from a related kinetoplastid, with primase activity in vitro (48.Li C. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20787-20792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The biological function of this protein and its possible relationship to the mtRNAP has not been established. Finally, it is possible that the mtRNAP is not a primase but that maxicircle transcription may stimulate DNA replication as reported for bacterial lambda (49.Learn B. Karzai A.W. McMacken R. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Identification of cis- and trans-acting factors in the transcription of kinetoplast DNA is the requisite first step toward understanding kinetoplast gene expression. With identification of the first factor involved in mitochondrial transcription, functional assays may now be developed to aid in the search for promoter elements and other trans-acting factors and to begin to dissect how transcription and RNA processing are coordinated in the regulation of gene expression.

To achieve a high rate of acceleration, enzymes rely on charged groups in their active site that stabilize the transition state or function as acid or base catalysts in the reaction. The kinetic parameters of enzymes therefore display a significant pH dependence, which is determined by the pKa values of the active site groups.Catalysis depends on intricate electrostatic interactions, which may be noticeable over distances that are large compared with short range of interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Thus, larger parts of an enzyme may be involved in optimizing its catalytic center than previously thought. The long range character of electrostatic effects is illustrated by a, very limited, number of examples in the literature, showing that changes in surface charge at locations as far as 15 Å from a catalytic center may affect enzyme activity (1Russell A.J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13909-13916Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, electrostatic interactions are hard to handle theoretically not only because of their long range character but also because of intrinsic theoretical difficulties. For example, most electrostatic models still use a single rigid protein structure and, at most, two dielectric constants to account for all the dynamics of the protein. This clearly is an oversimplification of reality (3Nielsen J.E. Andersen K.V. Honig B. Hooft R.W.W. Klebe G. Vriend G. Wade R.C. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).We have studied the contribution of long range electrostatic interactions to catalysis by analyzing the effects of a series of charge mutations scattered over a larger part of the surface of a thermolysin-like protease from Bacillus stearothermophilus(TLP-ste).1 Thermolysin-like proteases (TLPs) are members of the peptidase family M4 (4Beaumont A. Beynon R.J. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 350-369Google Scholar) of which thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27) is the prototype. One of their characteristics is a zinc ion bound in the catalytic center. The amino acid sequences of several TLPs have been determined (see Ref. 4Beaumont A. Beynon R.J.

Recently, an alternative mechanism has been proposed that has gained some support (16Mock W.L. Aksamawati M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Mock W.L. Stanford D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7369-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In both proposed mechanisms residues Glu-143, His-231, Tyr-157, and a Zn2+ bound water play important roles during catalysis.Mutations were introduced at six surface positions in TLP-ste, located at 10–15 Å from the catalytic center. The single and multiple mutants that were obtained displayed varying effects on catalytic efficiency, including considerable increases in activity. Double-mutant cycle analysis (18Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) was used to study the additivity of mutational effects, revealing remarkable interdependence of the mutated residues. The results provide insight in the complexity of predicting and interpreting electrostatic effects in catalysis.DISCUSSIONModification of the surface charge should, according to electrostatic theory, lead to a change in the active site electrostatics (1Russell A.J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Therefore, the catalytic performance of an enzyme may be modified without structurally disturbing the active site. Here, we have engineered a considerable increase in activity by modifying surface charges in TLP-ste. The most active mutants were approximately four times more active than the wild type. It is noteworthy that this increase was achieved by mutations that are all far from the active site. The distances between the catalytically important Zn2+ and the mutated residues varies from 10 to 15 Å.Mutational effects on the activity toward tripeptide substrate were more pronounced than mutational effects on specific activity toward casein (Tables I and II). The latter effects were marginal in most cases, but two of the mutants that were most active toward the tripeptide also displayed increased specific activity toward casein (Table II). The pH optimum of these mutants was the same regardless of the substrate used, 2A. de Kreij, unpublished observations.indicating that there are no fundamental differences in the ways in which the different substrates are hydrolyzed. In most published studies on engineering protease activity, only peptide substrates were used for mutant characterization. In the few cases in which proteinaceous substrates were used (e.g. Refs. 37Veltman O.R. Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. de Kreij A. Venema G. van den Burg B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5305-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38de Kreij A. van Den B.B. Veltman O.R. Vriend G. Venema G. Eijsink V.G. Eur. J.

Anna. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 673: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) one generally observed that the results differed considerably from those obtained with peptide substrates. Usually, mutational effects were much less pronounced for proteinaceous substrates, as is also the case in the present study. One possible explanation may be that the contribution of binding to catalysis is much larger for complex substrates, thus veiling effects ofe.g. subtle changes in active site electrostatics. Analysis of mutational effects on activity toward complex proteinaceous substrates is intrinsically complex, due to the large number of titratable (ionized) groups in the substrate and the fact that the substrate has many different productive binding modes. Clearly, analysis of mutational effects on active site electrostatics requires the use of short substrates that have only one productive binding mode and whose binding to the enzyme has a marginal (and constant) effect on the dielectric constant and charge in the active site.Several elements in the results indicate that the effects of surface charge mutations on catalysis result from factors that are independent of the changes in charge per se. In general, with few exceptions, the observed changes in the pH-activity profile and activity do not correlate with expected changes in the pKa values. This suggests that values other than those of Δcharge-induced ΔpKa effects, that is, effects that are not accounted for in the software used for calculating pKa values, are important.One indication for the occurrence of other than charge effects comes from the studies on additivity of mutational effects. A priori, one may expect the effects of surface charge mutations to be additive as long as the residues do not have direct interactions (2Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13909-13916Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,41Russell A.J. Thomas P.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed increased effects upon combination of several mutations. However, the mutational effects were far from additive, as shown by the double-mutant cycle analysis. This observation is not surprising for residues 116 and 119, which share a hydrogen bond in the wild type enzyme. However, it is highly surprising to find that all residues mutated in this study affect each other, that is, they seem to interact over distances as long as 25 Å. The fact that the interdependent residues are so far apart excludes the possibility of direct contacts and also makes it unlikely that charge effects alone account for the mutational effects.Another indication of the occurrence of non-charge effects is the discrepancy between the observed effects on activity, and the observed effects on the pH optimum. If the change in activity is a result of a change in active site electrostatics, then a change in the pH optimum would also be expected, at least in some cases. Although changes in the shape of the pH profile were observed, the pH optimum itself was not changed in the most active enzyme variants.The notion that complex long range interactions may affect activity without having direct effects on the pKa values of reactive groups is supported by earlier work in which replacing uncharged residues with other uncharged residues resulted in changes in activity and in the pH-activity profile that were similar to, or larger than, the changes observed after introducing or removing charges (42Nielsen J.E. Beier L. Otzen D. Borchert T.V. Frantzen H.B. Andersen K.V. Svendsen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that changes in active site dynamics are in part responsible for such counter-intuitive results. Alternatively, the electrostatic network on the surface (and throughout) an enzyme may be of an unappreciated complexity that cannot yet be properly described, making the effects of a surface charge mutation unpredictable.One might argue that changes in active site dynamics would cause changes in thermal stability and the temperature optimum for activity. However, none of the mutants described in this study displayed large changes in thermal stability or temperature optimum (results not shown). The lack of effects on thermal stability is not surprising, because it is known that the thermal stability of thermolysin-like proteases is mainly determined by local unfolding in a surface-located region in the N-terminal domain (Refs. 36Vriend G.

None of the mutations described here are located in this surface region. The lack of stability effects does not necessarily mean that the mutations did not affect flexibility. We have previously made a series of Gly → Ala mutations in the enzyme that were aimed at reducing flexibility (37Veltman O.R. Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. de Kreij A. Venema G. van den Burg B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5305-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Some of these mutations (e.g.G135A and G136A) had profound effects on activity, but the mutations (eight in total) did not significantly affect stability, apart from one that was located in the stability-determining region in the N-terminal domain (37Veltman O.R. Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. de Kreij A. Venema G. van den Burg B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5305-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These mutations did not significantly affect the temperature optimum of the enzyme either. 3B. van den Burg, O. R. Veltman, and V. G. H. Eijsink, unpublished observations. Interestingly, there is recent evidence in the literature suggesting that an increase in catalytically relevant flexibility does not necessarily result in decreased stability (47Hernandez G. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. LeMaster D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3166-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).The fact that residues 25 Å apart are coupled has serious consequences for modeling and calculation of the effects of charge mutations, because it implies that the effect of any mutation on the surface of an enzyme is dependent on the rest of the surface residues. The coupling also implies that larger parts of an enzyme are involved in optimizing its catalytic center. If this is true, then nature probably optimized considerably more than just the active site of enzymes during evolution. The large size of enzymes could be explained by the need to balance all the interactions on the surface of an enzyme and their influence on the catalytic center.Here we show that considerable increases in catalytic activity can be obtained by modification of surface charge. The most active mutant obtained was almost four times as active as wild type TLP-ste. However, the results show that this achievement cannot easily be rationalized,e.g. by correlating it to changes in the pKa values of active site residues. Factors that are not included in current electrostatic models, e.g.conformational dynamics and unknown complexities in electrostatic networks, probably play major roles. Reliable models and predictions as to how to modify the activity and pH-activity profile of an enzyme requires better understanding of these factors. The acceleration of reaction rates by enzymes is one of the essential prerequisites for life as we know it, and the multitude and diversity of enzymes shows that it should be possible to design an enzyme that will catalyze almost any reaction under almost any set of conditions. To achieve a high rate of acceleration, enzymes rely on charged groups in their active site that stabilize the transition state or function as acid or base catalysts in the reaction. The kinetic parameters of enzymes therefore display a significant pH dependence, which is determined by the pKa values of the active site groups. Catalysis depends on intricate electrostatic interactions, which may be noticeable over distances that are large compared with short range of interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Thus, larger parts of an enzyme may be involved in optimizing its catalytic center than previously thought. The long range character of electrostatic effects is illustrated by a, very limited, number of examples in the literature, showing that changes in surface charge at locations as far as 15 Å from a catalytic center may affect enzyme activity (1Russell A.J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13909-13916Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, electrostatic interactions are hard to handle theoretically not only because of their long range character but also because of intrinsic theoretical difficulties. For example, most electrostatic models still use a single rigid protein structure and, at most, two dielectric constants to account for all the dynamics of the protein. This clearly is an oversimplification of reality (3Nielsen J.E. Andersen K.V. Honig B. Hooft R.W.W. Klebe G. Vriend G. Wade R.C. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have studied the contribution of long range electrostatic interactions to catalysis by analyzing the effects of a series of charge mutations scattered over a larger part of the surface of a thermolysin-like protease from Bacillus stearothermophilus(TLP-ste).1 Thermolysin-like proteases (TLPs) are members of the peptidase family M4 (4Beaumont A. Beynon R.J. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 350-369Google Scholar) of which thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27) is the prototype. One of their characteristics is a zinc ion bound in the catalytic center. The amino acid sequences of several TLPs have been determined (see Ref. 4Beaumont A. Beynon R.J. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 350-369Google Scholar, or the Merops data base at www.merops.co.uk/merops/famcards/m4.htm), and the three-dimensional structures of TLPs isolated from several bacteria (Bacillus thermoproteolyticus (5Weaver L.H. Kester W.R. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), Bacillus cereus (6Stark W. Pauptit R.A. Wilson K.S. Jansonius J.N. FEBS Eur. J.

These two domains are connected by a central α-helix, which is located at the bottom of the active site cleft and which contains several of the catalytically important residues.

Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2506-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the active site residues have been identified and a mechanism has been proposed (13Kester W.R. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2506-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Hangauer D.G. Monzingo A.F. Matthews B.W.

Recently, an alternative mechanism has been proposed that has gained some support (16Mock W.L. Aksamawati M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Mock W.L. Stanford D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7369-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In both proposed mechanisms residues Glu-143, His-231, Tyr-157, and a Zn2+ bound water play important roles during catalysis. Mutations were introduced at six surface positions in TLP-ste, located at 10–15 Å from the catalytic center. The single and multiple mutants that were obtained displayed varying effects on catalytic efficiency, including considerable increases in activity. Double-mutant cycle analysis (18Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) was used to study the additivity of mutational effects, revealing remarkable interdependence of the mutated residues. The results provide insight in the complexity of predicting and interpreting electrostatic effects in catalysis. DISCUSSIONModification of the surface charge should, according to electrostatic theory, lead to a change in the active site electrostatics (1Russell A.J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Therefore, the catalytic performance of an enzyme may be modified without structurally disturbing the active site. Here, we have engineered a considerable increase in activity by modifying surface charges in TLP-ste. The most active mutants were approximately four times more active than the wild type. It is noteworthy that this increase was achieved by mutations that are all far from the active site. The distances between the catalytically important Zn2+ and the mutated residues varies from 10 to 15 Å.Mutational effects on the activity toward tripeptide substrate were more pronounced than mutational effects on specific activity toward casein (Tables I and II). The latter effects were marginal in most cases, but two of the mutants that were most active toward the tripeptide also displayed increased specific activity toward casein (Table II). The pH optimum of these mutants was the same regardless of the substrate used, 2A. de Kreij, unpublished observations.indicating that there are no fundamental differences in the ways in which the different substrates are hydrolyzed. In most published studies on engineering protease activity, only peptide substrates were used for mutant characterization. In the few cases in which proteinaceous substrates were used (e.g. Refs. 37Veltman O.R. Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. de Kreij A. Venema G. van den Burg B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5305-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38de Kreij A. van Den B.B. Veltman O.R. Vriend G. Venema G. Eijsink V.G. Eur. J.

Anna. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 673: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) one generally observed that the results differed considerably from those obtained with peptide substrates. Usually, mutational effects were much less pronounced for proteinaceous substrates, as is also the case in the present study. One possible explanation may be that the contribution of binding to catalysis is much larger for complex substrates, thus veiling effects ofe.g. subtle changes in active site electrostatics. Analysis of mutational effects on activity toward complex proteinaceous substrates is intrinsically complex, due to the large number of titratable (ionized) groups in the substrate and the fact that the substrate has many different productive binding modes. Clearly, analysis of mutational effects on active site electrostatics requires the use of short substrates that have only one productive binding mode and whose binding to the enzyme has a marginal (and constant) effect on the dielectric constant and charge in the active site.Several elements in the results indicate that the effects of surface charge mutations on catalysis result from factors that are independent of the changes in charge per se. In general, with few exceptions, the observed changes in the pH-activity profile and activity do not correlate with expected changes in the pKa values. This suggests that values other than those of Δcharge-induced ΔpKa effects, that is, effects that are not accounted for in the software used for calculating pKa values, are important.One indication for the occurrence of other than charge effects comes from the studies on additivity of mutational effects. A priori, one may expect the effects of surface charge mutations to be additive as long as the residues do not have direct interactions (2Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13909-13916Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,41Russell A.J. Thomas P.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed increased effects upon combination of several mutations. However, the mutational effects were far from additive, as shown by the double-mutant cycle analysis. This observation is not surprising for residues 116 and 119, which share a hydrogen bond in the wild type enzyme. However, it is highly surprising to find that all residues mutated in this study affect each other, that is, they seem to interact over distances as long as 25 Å. The fact that the interdependent residues are so far apart excludes the possibility of direct contacts and also makes it unlikely that charge effects alone account for the mutational effects.Another indication of the occurrence of non-charge effects is the discrepancy between the observed effects on activity, and the observed effects on the pH optimum. If the change in activity is a result of a change in active site electrostatics, then a change in the pH optimum would also be expected, at least in some cases.

These mutations did not significantly affect the temperature optimum of the enzyme either. 3B. van den Burg, O. R. Veltman, and V. G. H. Eijsink, unpublished observations. Interestingly, there is recent evidence in the literature suggesting that an increase in catalytically relevant flexibility does not necessarily result in decreased stability (47Hernandez G. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. LeMaster D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3166-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The fact that residues 25 Å apart are coupled has serious consequences for modeling and calculation of the effects of charge mutations, because it implies that the effect of any mutation on the surface of an enzyme is dependent on the rest of the surface residues. The coupling also implies that larger parts of an enzyme are involved in optimizing its catalytic center. If this is true, then nature probably optimized considerably more than just the active site of enzymes during evolution. The large size of enzymes could be explained by the need to balance all the interactions on the surface of an enzyme and their influence on the catalytic center. Here we show that considerable increases in catalytic activity can be obtained by modification of surface charge. The most active mutant obtained was almost four times as active as wild type TLP-ste. However, the results show that this achievement cannot easily be rationalized,e.g. by correlating it to changes in the pKa values of active site residues. Factors that are not included in current electrostatic models, e.g.conformational dynamics and unknown complexities in electrostatic networks, probably play major roles. Reliable models and predictions as to how to modify the activity and pH-activity profile of an enzyme requires better understanding of these factors."

However, the efficiency of TRF2-catalyzed t-loop formation on the model DNA was increased 2-fold in the presence of p53 although a variety of single strand or Holliday junction-binding proteins did not facilitate t-loop formation.

They observed that although the level of telomere-associated fluorescence in p53−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts was equivalent to that of wild type cells, there was an increased heterogeneity of telomere lengths with some telomeres being longer than those seen in wild type cells whereas others were very short or lost entirely.

The induction of p53 is not dependent on DNA replication, suggesting that inhibition of TRF2 function at the telomeres signals p53 directly. Our recent studies of telomere architecture provide a possible structural solution to how telomere ends are hidden from DNA break repair/recognition factors. These studies showed that mammalian telomeres are arranged into large duplex loops in vivo(t-loops) (9.Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). The formation of t-loops in vitro requires TRF2 and a telomeric junction, which consists of a 3′ ss overhang of at least one TTAGGG repeat adjacent to the ds portion of the telomere (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The termini of the micronuclear chromosomes of Oxytricha nova (11.Murti K.G. Prescott D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Griffith, unpublished studies. have been shown to form looped structures in vivo whereas S. cerevisiae telomeres appear to form fold-back structures (13.Grunstein M. Curr. Opin.

It is plausible that telomeric looping is a common mechanism for protecting the termini of linear chromosomes. It has been proposed that the t-loop structure is formed by strand invasion of the G-rich ss overhang into the preceding duplex TTAGGG tract (9.Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This invasion would generate a D-loop, which would effectively hide the natural end of the DNA to protect it from the machinery that scans DNA for broken ends. In addition, recent data support the possibility that some portion of the C-rich strand of the ss/ds telomeric junction may also invade the duplex, resulting in the formation of a Holliday junction-like structure at the base of the t-loop (Fig. 1A) (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). p53 tightly binds Holliday junctions in vitro and enhances their resolution by junction-cleaving enzymes (16.Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Further, p53 has a strong affinity for ss DNA (17.Jayaraman J. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and would presumably bind the ss telomeric overhang of the telomere. The affinity of p53 for these structures points to the importance of investigating p53 binding to both the telomeric overhang and the t-loop junction as well as examining the influence of p53 on t-loop assembly by TRF2 in vitro. Using electron microscopy (EM), we found that p53 was present at the t-loop junction both in the presence and absence of associated TRF2. In addition, localization of p53 to the 3′ ss overhang was observed. TRF2-mediated t-loop formation was increased 2-fold on a model telomere DNA by the addition of p53. These studies suggest that p53 may be involved in the maintenance of telomere structure. The model telomere contains 3 kb of plasmid sequences followed by 576 bp of duplex telomeric DNA, which terminates in a 54-nt telomeric overhang (5′-(TTAGGG)9-3′) (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The overhang was removed by treatment with mung bean nuclease to create a telomeric tract that terminates in a blunt end (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Linear DNA substrates containing the 576-bp tract located internally were generated by cleavage of pRST5 plasmid with AflIII (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), placing it 334 bp from the 5′ end and 2597 bp from the 3′ end. Human p53 protein was overexpressed in SF9 cells using a vector provided by Dr. Arnold Levine and purified as described previously (18.Wu L. Bayle J.H. Elenbaas B. Pavletich N.P. Levine A.J. Mol.

Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To examine the binding of p53 to telomeric DNA, 25 ng of DNA was incubated with purified p53 at a ratio of 2–8 tetramers of p53 per DNA molecule in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 50 mm KCl for 20 min at room temperature. The complexes were fixed by adding glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.6% for 5 min at room temperature followed by chromatography over a 2-ml column of Bio-Gel A-5m (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 1 mmEDTA. The samples were mixed with a buffer containing spermidine, adsorbed to glow-charged thin carbon foils, dehydrated through a series of water/ethanol washes, and rotary shadow cast with tungsten as described previously (9.Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). t-Loops were formed on the model DNA by TRF2 as previously described (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Protein-free t-loops were generated by cross-linking the DNA with 4′-aminomethyltrioxsalen (AMT; Sigma) and UV light followed by treatment with 0.5% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C. The DNA was purified by chromatography over a 2-ml column of Bio-Gel A-5m equilibrated with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. The absence of any residual TRF2 was verified by EM. All samples were examined in a Philips EM400 or CM12 instrument. Micrographs were scanned from negatives using a Nikon 4500AF multiformat film scanner. The contrast was optimized and panels were arranged using Adobe Photoshop. The location of p53 binding to the DNA molecules was measured using a Phillips CM-12 and Digital Micrograph software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). DNA (100 ng) was incubated with TRF2 (3 dimers per TTAGGG repeat) and either p53 (2–8 tetramers per DNA), E. coli SSB (6 tetramers per DNA), T4 gene 32 protein (2 heterotrimers per DNA), human RPA (2 monomers per DNA), human MSH2/6 (2–4 heterodimers per DNA), or HMG(I)Y (5–10 monomers per DNA) for 20 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 50 mm KCl. The complexes were then cross-linked with AMT/UV, deproteinized, and purified as previously described (9.Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To examine the binding of p53 to t-loops in the presence of TRF2, both proteins were incubated with the model telomere DNA in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 50 mm KCl for 20 min at room temperature. The complexes were then incubated with polyclonal rabbit IgG raised against p53 (0.5 μl;Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for 30 min at room temperature. Gold-conjugated protein A (10-nm particles; 0.5 μl; Amersham Biosciences) was added for an additional 30 min at room temperature followed by fixation and preparation for EM as described above. Recent data support a model of the t-loop junction in which both strands can insert to form a Holliday junction-like structure (Fig. 1A) (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). It was of interest to examine the ability of p53 to bind t-loop structures. t-Loops were generated by incubation of the model telomere with TRF2, stabilization by AMT/UV photocross-linking, and protein removal (see “Experimental Procedures”) (9.Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). p53 was incubated with the purified DNA, and the resulting complexes were examined by EM. The purified DNA contained both looped (10 ± 3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) and unlooped (90 ± 3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) molecules. Overall, 59% (±21%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) of the input DNA was bound by p53. The p53 binding occurred at one end of the DNA, internally along the duplex repeats, or at the t-loop junction. The p53 bound to the non-looped species showed a strong preference for the DNA ends (Fig. 2, A and B; see below). Of the t-loops observed, 88% (±11%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) showed p53 bound exclusively at the t-loop junction (the junction of the loop and the linear tail) (Fig. 2, C and D). The mass of the p53 complex at the t-loop junction appeared consistent with the presence of one or two tetramers with a small portion of the molecules containing larger complexes. Similarly, when TRF2 was incubated with the deproteinized, cross-linked DNA, binding was observed exclusively at the t-loop junction (100 ± <1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments). TRF1, however, rarely bound the junction, binding instead along the telomeric tract (data not shown). These results demonstrate that p53 has a high affinity for the t-loop junction. Based on the observation that p53 binds to the t-loop junction, it was of interest to determine whether the association of p53 with the loop is sequence-specific. It has been shown that p53 is capable of associating with DNA in both a sequence-dependent (reviewed in Refs. 23.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar, 24.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar, 25.Oren M. Rotter V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and sequence-independent manner (26.Steinmeyer K. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 501-507PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and EM were used to examine the affinity of p53 for duplex TTAGGG repeat tracts as well as for a model telomere containing a duplex tract adjacent to a ss 3′ overhang containing TTAGGG repeats. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with p53 and a 200-bp DNA fragment consisting of tandem TTAGGG repeats. Even with an input ratio of 30 tetramers per DNA molecule, p53 showed very low binding, and this was easily competed with nonspecific DNA (data not shown). The association of p53 with telomeric repeats was examined by EM. p53 was incubated with a 96-repeat TTAGGG tract located in the center of a 3-kb DNA molecule. At a ratio of 20 p53 tetramers per DNA molecule, 60% of the input template was bound by p53 with no molecule containing more than one p53 particle. The location of p53 molecules along the DNA was measured from the micrographs, and the results revealed that of the bound DNA, 12% had p53 located within the telomeric tract, and the remaining 88% contained p53 randomly distributed along the length of the DNA (n = 200). From these observations we conclude that p53 does not bind the TTAGGG repeat tract in a sequence-dependent manner. The binding of p53 to the natural telomeric overhang was examined by EM using a model telomere containing a terminal 576-bp duplex tract and an adjacent 54-nt 3′ ss TTAGGG overhang (Fig. 1B; see “Experimental Procedures”) (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Because p53 has been shown to bind ss DNA with high affinity, the non-telomeric end of the DNA terminated in a blunt end. Conditions were optimized so that each DNA showed no more than one p53 particle bound (20 tetramers per DNA) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Of the bound molecules, 68 ± 9% (n = 100/sample, three experiments) contained p53 localized to the end of the DNA whereas the remainder (32 ± 9% of the bound molecules, n = 100/sample, three experiments) showed p53 scattered at random along the length of the DNA (Fig. 2, C and D). Removal of the 3′ overhang decreased the fraction of end-bound p53 to 6%, demonstrating that the end localization of p53 is most likely because of its association with the ss overhang. Based on these data, we conclude that p53 binds to the ss telomeric overhang with strong affinity. It was of interest to examine the effect of p53 on the ability of TRF2 to form t-loops in vitro. It is possible that p53 binding to the ss DNA overhang would inhibit loop formation by preventing TRF2 from localizing to the ss/ds junction, a critical step in t-loop assembly (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Alternately, binding to the ss overhang might enhance t-loop formation by facilitating the strand invasion event. Studies from others have suggested that p53 has some strand transfer activity (28.Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Selivanova G. Magnusson K.P. Szekely L. Kiseleva E. Klein G. Terenius L. Wiman K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which might either assist in TRF2-mediated loop formation or catalyze loop formation in the absence of TRF2. Finally, p53 may stabilize loops once they are formed by binding to the t-loop junction either at the Holliday junction-like structure or the displaced ss portion of the D-loop. To investigate these possibilities, p53 and TRF2 were incubated together with the model telomere DNA. The number of t-loops assembled was monitored by EM. First, the possible interaction between p53 and TRF2 in the absence of DNA was examined. To our knowledge, no evidence of such an association has been reported. When p53 and TRF2 were coexpressed in SF9 cells and immunoprecipitated using standard techniques, no association was detected. Similarly, when purified TRF2 was incubated with purified p53, the proteins failed to coimmunoprecipitate (data not shown). When TRF2 and p53 were incubated together with the model telomere DNA, smaller loops could have been obscured because of the presence of a large protein mass at the junction. Thus, an alternative approach for scoring looped molecules was utilized. Following assembly of the complexes, the DNA molecules were photocross-linked, deproteinized, and prepared for EM examination using a classic surface-spreading method with cytochrome c (see “Experimental Procedures”). Looped structures were rarely seen on the DNA in the absence of TRF2 (3 ± 1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) or when treated with p53 alone (4 ± 1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments). When the incubations contained TRF2 and no p53, 13% (±3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) of the input DNA was assembled into t-loops. This number is slightly reduced from the number of t-loops usually observed (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), most likely because of the use of a buffer optimized for the binding of both proteins. When both p53 and TRF2 were added to the reaction (four p53 tetramers per DNA and three TRF2 dimers per TTAGGG repeat) the number of t-loops rose significantly (24 ± 3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments; p = 0.005). Reduction of the level of p53 (two p53 tetramers per DNA) eliminated this increase in t-loop assembly (14 ± <1%, n = 100/sample, two experiments). No further rise in efficiency was detected with either increased levels of p53 (six or eight p53 tetramers per DNA; 23 ± 1%, n = 100/sample, two experiments) or time of incubation (data not shown). One possible explanation for the increase in the number of t-loops observed in the presence of TRF2 and p53 is that the t-loops may be stabilized by p53. In vitro, t-loops may form and dissociate throughout the incubation. The association of p53 with the displaced ss or the Holliday junction-like portion of the t-loop junction might stabilize the looped form, thus increasing the fraction of loops present at any one time. In this case, any ss or Holliday junction binding protein would be expected to produce the same effect. Three ss binding proteins, E. coli SSB, T4 gene 32 protein, and human RPA, were separately incubated with the model DNA and TRF2, and the loops were stabilized by AMT/UV cross-linking, deproteinized, and prepared for EM. No increase in the number of t-loops was observed with the addition of SSB (14 ± 1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments), T4 gene 32 protein (14 ± 4%; n = 100/sample, three experiments), or human RPA (14 ± 2%; n = 100/sample, three experiments) to the reaction. Similarly two Holliday junction-binding proteins, human MSH2/6 and HMG(I)Y, were separately incubated with the model DNA and TRF2, the DNA prepared for EM. Neither MSH2/6 nor HMG(I)Y showed any ability to enhance TRF2-mediated t-loop assembly in vitro (13 ± 2 and 15 ± 1%, respectively;n = 100/sample, three experiments). These results suggest a more specific role for p53 in t-loop formation/stabilization. p53 may increase the numbers of t-loops by facilitating loop formation by TRF2. Once bound to the overhang, p53 might assist in the strand invasion process. Alternately, p53 might stabilize the assembled t-loops by binding directly to the t-loop junction (as contrasted to the displaced ss). If binding to the overhang is responsible for the increase in t-loops, preincubation with p53 might be expected to further increase the numbers of t-loops formed as compared with preincubation with TRF2. If, instead, p53 stabilizes the t-loop junction, preincubation with p53 would not be expected to further enhance t-loop formation. To test these possibilities, p53 or TRF2 were first incubated individually with the model telomere DNA for 5 min followed by addition of the second protein for 15 min. TRF2 assembled 13% (±<1%, n = 100/sample, two experiments) of the DNA into t-loops in the absence of p53. When the DNA was preincubated with p53 followed by addition of TRF2, the number of t-loops rose to 20% (±7%, n = 100/sample, two experiments). Similarly, 19% (±2%, n = 100/sample, two experiments) of the DNA molecules were looped when preincubated with TRF2 followed by addition of p53. Thus the order of addition of p53 and TRF2 with the model telomere DNA does not affect the ability of p53 to enhance loop frequency. Together, these data suggest that the p53-dependent increase in t-loop observed by EM is not due simply to binding of p53 to the ss overhang but instead may involve a more direct role of p53 on loop formation or stabilization. The larger mass of protein present at the base of the t-loop when both p53 and TRF2 were present in the reaction suggests that the proteins are capable of binding to the junction simultaneously. This possibility was examined using immunoelectron microscopy. TRF2 and p53 were incubated with the model telomere DNA. p53 was then detected by addition of an anti-p53 polyclonal rabbit IgG followed by incubation with 10-nm gold particles conjugated to protein A. There was no cross-reactivity of the antibody with TRF2 as seen by EM and Western blot; hence all labeled molecules must contain p53 (data not shown). Because p53 is unable to assemble t-loops in the absence of TRF2 and we have previously shown that TRF2 binds all t-loop junctions, the looped molecules must also contain TRF2 (10.Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). All t-loop junctions that are labeled with gold particles, therefore, are presumed to contain both p53 and TRF2. By this approach, 100 individual molecules were placed into five classes: protein-free DNA (38%), DNA with a single protein complex bound at the end (23%), DNA with a single protein complex bound along the DNA not at the end (7%), DNA with protein bound at the base of a t-loop (14%), and DNA aggregates held together by a large protein mass (17%). Each class was further divided into molecules that were gold-labeled (20%) and molecules that remained unlabeled (80%). In these studies, gold particles were only observed on end-bound molecules, t-loops, and aggregates. Of the t-loops detected, 86% were labeled with gold particles at the t-loop junction, demonstrating the association of both TRF2 and p53 (Fig. 3A). In addition, 43% of the end-bound molecules were tagged with gold labels (Fig. 3B). The labeled end bound complexes may contain both proteins or only p53. These results provide direct evidence for the presence of p53 at TRF2-bound t-loop junctions. The location of p53 binding within the junction, either to the displaced strand or the Holliday junction-like structure, could not be resolved using these methods. In this study we have used purified TRF2, p53, and a model telomere DNA to examine the binding of p53 to telomeric structures including the duplex repeats, the ss overhang, and a t-loop junction. No evidence for preferential binding of p53 to duplex telomeric DNA was observed. p53 does bind strongly to the ss overhang, as expected based on previous studies showing that p53 has a high affinity for ss DNA (17.Jayaraman J. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). p53 also associates with the t-loop junction with high affinity and was found to cooperate with TRF2 in formation of t-loops on the model telomere template. This produced a 2-fold increase in the frequency of t-loops as monitored by EM. p53 was detected at the t-loop junction in the presence of TRF2 binding, suggesting that both proteins are present in a complex at the t-loop junction. It remains possible that the enhancement of TRF2-mediated t-loop formation by p53 results from its interactions with the overhang or junction. Interactions of p53 with the junction may add stability and prevent t-loop loss in vitro. t-Loops could be lost because of migration of the junction along the duplex repeat tract or dissociation of TRF2. Association with the ss overhang may facilitate localization of TRF2 to the ss/ds overhang, which would result in an increase in loop assembly. Several biologically significant roles for p53 localization to the t-loop junction can be envisioned. Normally, p53 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the G1/S transition and is shuttled back to cytoplasm shortly thereafter. The presence of p53 at the t-loop junction just prior to DNA replication may promote resolution of the junction to facilitate telomere replication. It is also possible that p53 is sequestered at the t-loop junction to allow immediate recognition of any loss of end protection by p53. Cell cycle arrest or apoptosis then can be triggered. Additionally, other protein factors may be recruited to the chromosome end through interactions with p53. These factors may be essential for telomere structure and function. We thank members of the Griffith laboratory for helpful discussion, Drs. Arnold Levine, Titia de Lange, Richard Fishel, and Beverly Emerson for providing vectors for protein purification, and Drs. Nancy Nossal and Louise Chow for providing purified proteins."

Here we show that integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a 59-kDa serine-threonine protein kinase that interacts principally with β1 integrins, is highly expressed in human mononuclear cells and is activated by exposure of leukocytes to the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Biochemical inhibitor studies show that chemokine-triggered activation of ILK is downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. In functional assays under physiologically relevant flow conditions, overexpression of wild-type ILK in human monocytic cells diminishes β1integrin/vascular cell adhesion molecule-1-dependent firm adhesion to human endothelial cells.

These data implicate ILK in the dynamic signaling events involved in the regulation of leukocyte integrin avidity for endothelial substrates. Current models of leukocyte accumulation from the vasculature suggest that the process occurs through a series of sequential steps (1.Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6393) Google Scholar). The selectin family (E-, P-, and L-selectin) of adhesion molecules predominantly governs the initial rolling interaction between leukocytes and vascular endothelium. Subsequent firm arrest occurs via leukocyte integrin interactions with endothelial immunoglobulin superfamily members, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). 1The abbreviations used are: VCAM-1vascular cell adhesion molecule-1ssolubleILKintegrin-linked kinaseMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1PI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinaseGSK-3glycogen synthase kinase-3HUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellMOImultiplicity of infectionWTwild-typeKDkinase-deficientEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein1The abbreviations used are: VCAM-1vascular cell adhesion molecule-1ssolubleILKintegrin-linked kinaseMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1PI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinaseGSK-3glycogen synthase kinase-3HUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellMOImultiplicity of infectionWTwild-typeKDkinase-deficientEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein Chemokines enhance leukocyte accumulation by the rapid conversion of initial leukocyte tethering to firm adhesion.

Subsequently, there is rapid deactivation and release of the same integrin heterodimer from its counterligand, VCAM-1 (2.Weber C. Alon R. Moser B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In contrast to chemokines, nonphysiological leukocyte agonists such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate lock integrins into prolonged high affinity states (2.Weber C. Alon R. Moser B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways via which chemokines dynamically modulate integrin affinity for endothelial and matrix ligands to coordinate leukocyte adhesion and release are poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of integrin-linked kinase in chemokine-triggered signaling. ILK was originally identified in a search for proteins capable of interacting with β1integrins using a yeast two-hybrid screen with the β1integrin cytoplasmic domain as bait (3.Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). ILK expression has been documented in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (3.Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Sequencing of ILK revealed a 59-kDa protein serine-threonine kinase with four ankyrin repeats in its N terminus. The C terminus is the β integrin-interacting domain and also contains the kinase catalytic domain. Interposed between the ankyrin repeats and the kinase domain is a pleckstrin homology domain thought to be important for the binding of lipid second messengers such as those generated by PI3K (4.Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In vitro, ILK can phosphorylate synthetic peptides corresponding to β1 integrin cytoplasmic domains (3.Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Other potential substrates include the kinases Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) (5.Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). From a functional perspective, ILK overexpression in epithelial cells disrupts cell-extracellular matrix as well as cell-cell interactions. Recent data from studies in fibroblasts suggest a potential role for ILK in cell motility via its interaction with the focal adhesion protein PINCH (6.Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, physiologically relevant cellular ligands that modulate ILK activity remain poorly understood (7.Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dedhar S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a role for ILK in the dynamic processes involved in leukocyte recruitment has not previously been postulated. Based on evidence that ILK is associated with β integrins and is activated in a PI3K-dependent manner in other systems, we studied its role in leukocyte adhesion. Here we show that ILK is highly expressed in human mononuclear leukocyte subsets and is activated by exposure of leukocytes to chemokines. Chemokine-triggered activation is sustained for several minutes and is dependent on PI3K. Interestingly, overexpression of ILK in human monocytic cells diminishes β1 integrin/VCAM-1-dependent firm adhesion to human vascular endothelial cells. These data implicate ILK in the dynamic signaling events involved in the regulation of leukocyte integrin avidity for endothelial substrates. RPMI 1640 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with or without Ca2+ and Mg2+ were purchased from BioWhittaker, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Hyclone Inc. Recombinant MCP-1, interleukin 8, and sVCAM-1 were purchased from R&D Systems. Biochemical inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were obtained from Alexis Corp. HEK 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated and cultured in M199 with 20% fetal bovine serum, endothelial cell growth factor (25 μg/ml; Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA), porcine intestinal heparin (50 μg/ml; Sigma), and antibiotics. After infection with adenoviral vectors, HUVECs were cultured as described above, but the serum concentration was reduced to 10%. For experimental use in the flow plate apparatus, HUVECs (passage 1–2) were plated at confluence in 0.5-cm2 chambers on fibronectin-coated plastic tissue culture slides. On the day of the flow adhesion assay, a fluorescence immunoassay was performed on HUVECs infected in parallel to document transgene expression and to rule out nonspecific activation of the endothelial monolayer, as described previously (9.Gerszten R. Luscinskas F. Ding H. Dichek D. Stoolman L. Gimbrone Jr., M. Rosenzweig A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells (1 × 107) were infected at an MOI of 10–50 in 0.5 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in a 12-well dish for 2 h, and the volume was subsequently increased to 2.0 ml, and serum was added to reach 10%. Experiments were performed, and transgene expression was evaluated 24 h after infection. The wild-type (WT) and kinase-deficient (KD) ILK constructs were generated in the laboratory of Dr. Shoukat Dedhar (University of British Columbia) (3.Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L.

The adenoviruses carrying the adhesion molecules E-selectin (AdE-sel) and VCAM-1 (AdVCAM-1) as well as the adenoviral control (AdEGFP) have been described previously (9.Gerszten R. Luscinskas F.

ILK WT and KD adenoviruses were prepared via recombination inEscherichia coli as described by He et al. (12.He T. Zhou S. da Costa L. Yu J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Briefly, constructs were subcloned into the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV, and homologous recombination was performed in E. coli with the pAdEasy-1 adenoviral backbone plasmid. Recombinants were selected for kanamycin resistance, and recombination was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and PCR. The adenovirus packaging cell line (HEK 293) was transfected with recombinants, and lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. After screening for expression of the appropriate transgene, adenoviruses were then prepared as high-titer stocks. Stocks were titered in plaque assays on 293 cells, and wild-type adenovirus contamination was excluded by the absence of PCR-detectable E1 sequences. Signaling molecules were ILK (Upstate Biotechnology), phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) (Cell Signaling), and Akt/phospho-Akt-Ser473 (New England Biolabs). The epitope tag was anti-V5 (Invitrogen). Leukocyte epitopes were CD11b and CD49D (phycoerythrin-labeled; PharMingen). Adhesion molecules were 7A9 and H4/18 (to human E-selectin) (13.Bevilacqua M.P. Pober J.S. Mendrick D.L. Cotran R.S.

Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Science. 1991; 251: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar), and IgG1 and IgG2A control monoclonal antibody (PharMingen). Monocytes were washed once with RPMI 1640 medium/5% fetal calf serum, incubated with the indicated fluorescence-tagged (non-fluorescein isothiocyanate for EGFP-transduced cells) primary antibodies for 30–60 min on ice, washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium/5% fetal calf serum, and fixed with 1% formaldehyde. An isotype-matched, fluorescence-labeled, nonbinding antibody was included as a control. Fluorescence was then analyzed using a BD PharMingen fluorescence-activated cell sorter set to detect fluorescence, forward scatter, and size. Human leukocyte subsets were purified from healthy human donors by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation at 15 °C (LSM; Organon Teknika, Durham, NC). Neutrophils were purified from the lower fraction after dextran sedimentation and hypotonic lysis of red cells. Monocytes or lymphocytes were purified from the mononuclear band by magnetic bead purification, using a negative selection strategy (monocyte and lymphocyte isolation kits; Miltenyi Biotech) (11.Gerszten R.E.

Leukocyte subset suspensions were consistently >92% pure as determined by light scatter and cell surface antigen analysis. We employed a commercially available parallel plate laminar flow chamber (Immunetics, Cambridge, MA) (11.Gerszten R.E. Friedrich E.B. Matsui T. Hung R.R. Li L. Force T. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol.

For biochemical inhibitor studies, the monocytes were incubated with the indicated compound or vehicle (Me2SO) for 30 min at 37 °C and then diluted with perfusion media to 106 cells/ml. Where indicated, chemokines were added to the monocyte reservoir (room temperature). Monocyte firm adhesion (>3 s) was quantified for each coverslip 1 min before and 1 min after the addition of the chemokine. The cells were perfused at an estimated shear stress of 2.0 dynes/cm2 (flow rate, 0.78 ml/min). The entire period of perfusion was recorded on videotape. Human monocytic THP-1 cells or freshly isolated primary human leukocyte subsets were left untreated or stimulated with 100 nm human MCP-1 at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. Cells were lysed in an ice-cold buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 4 μm microcystein in the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Precleared cell lysates were incubated with a polyclonal anti-ILK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and protein A beads overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer followed by two washes with 1 ml of kinase buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mmMgCl2. Washed pellets were incubated with kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of the commercially available GSK-3 substrate peptide (Cell Signaling) for 30 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the supernatants were boiled for 5 min at 100 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE (10–12% gels). Membranes were probed with phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) antibody overnight at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical comparison of means was performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. The null hypothesis was rejected at p < 0.05. ILK expression has been documented by mRNA and protein analysis in a variety of cell types and tissues, including heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (3.Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). We first performed Western analysis to examine whether ILK protein is expressed in purified human leukocyte subsets. As seen in Fig. 1, human whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells, specifically the monocyte and T-cell subsets, prominently expressed the 59-kDa ILK protein. In contrast, resting human neutrophils appeared to have no ILK. In light of the association of ILK and β integrins in other cell types, we investigated the effects of chemokines on ILK activity in human leukocytes. We employed the monocytic THP-1 cell line that mimics much of the phenotype of human monocytes and is readily manipulated by somatic gene transfer techniques for signaling studies (11.Gerszten R.E. Friedrich E.B. Matsui T. Hung R.R. Li L. Force T. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26846-26851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2 a, the chemokine MCP-1 activated ILK at physiologically relevant concentrations. 10–100-fold higher doses of interleukin 8 also activated ILK, confirming that other chemokines can also activate ILK. Chemokine activation of ILK consistently peaked at ∼30 s, lessened, and then increased and became sustained for ∼3 min (Fig. 2 b). Importantly, we saw marked chemokine-triggered ILK activation in freshly isolated human monocytes as well (Fig. 2 c). Because cell-matrix interactions have been shown to activate ILK in other systems (3.Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), we next assessed ILK activation in THP-1 cells bound to VCAM-1, an important counterligand of β1 integrins in leukocyte recruitment. VCAM-1 binding transiently activated ILK in our model (Fig. 2 d), although to a far lesser degree than chemokine stimulation. As a readout of ILK activity for these studies, we employed an in vitro kinase assay using a GSK-3 fusion protein substrate because GSK-3 has been shown to be a target of ILK activation in other systems (5.Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 18.Persad S. Troussard A.A. McPhee T.R. Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1161-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To verify the specificity of the observed ILK activation by chemokines, we assessed lysates immunoprecipitated with the ILK antibody for potentially contaminating kinases such as Akt (19.Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Akt is present in whole cell lysates from THP-1 cells; importantly, however, Western blot analysis of the ILK immunoprecipitates revealed no Akt. In addition, pretreating ILK precipitates with anti-Akt antibody before the kinase assay had no effect on ILK phosphorylation of the GSK-3 fusion protein (data not shown). Chemokines activate several PI3K isoforms in leukocytes. These include the “classical” PI3K-α (p85/p110, IA) isoform as well as PI3K-γ (p101/p110, IB), which is thought to be activated exclusively by G protein-coupled receptors (11.Gerszten R.E.

A membrane-targeted, constitutively active PI3K construct stimulates ILK activity in NIH 3T3 cells (5.Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). We next tested whether chemokines such as MCP-1 activate ILK in a PI3K-dependent manner. As seen in Fig. 3, MCP-1 activated ILK, and pretreatment of monocytes with low-dose wortmannin or LY294002 markedly attenuated this activity. Pertussis toxin also abrogated ILK activation, consistent with Gαi-coupled chemokine receptor signaling. Because biochemical characterization suggested ILK activation by chemokines, we used somatic gene transfer to probe potential downstream targets and assess the functional effects on leukocyte recruitment. We manipulated THP-1 cell signaling using adenoviral constructs carrying the cDNAs for wild-type and kinase-deficient ILK, first confirming expression by Western blotting (Fig. 4 A). Protein analysis revealed both endogenous 59-kDA ILK and the slightly larger epitope-tagged ILK protein. We next assessed the in vitro ILK kinase activity of monocytic THP-1 cells transduced with these constructs. We also assessed phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 in whole cell lysates in chemokine-activated and ILK-transduced THP-1 cells. As noted previously, ILK can phosphorylate Akt and GSK-3 in other systems (5.Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As seen in Fig. 4 B, basal activity of uninfected THP-1 cells was low and was unaffected by control adenoviral infection. As compared with AdEGFP- and AdKDILK-transduced THP-1 cells, we saw increased ILK activity in the AdWTILK-transduced THP-1 cells, to levels comparable to that seen with MCP-1 stimulation. In whole THP-1 cell lysates, MCP-1 led to phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK-3, as did AdWTILK transduction. We performed flow cytometry experiments on transduced monocytic cells in parallel with biochemical and functional assays. We saw no effect of adenoviral gene transfer of control or ILK constructs on surface expression of β1 or β2 integrins that are critical for monocyte-endothelial interactions (Fig. 5). Having confirmed that the WT ILK construct conferred increased activity at an MOI of 50 as measured byin vitro kinase assays, we then investigated the functional consequences of this activity in monocytic cells in our vascular flow model. As seen in Fig. 6, uninfected and AdEGFP-transduced THP-1 cells show moderate baseline adhesion to HUVEC monolayers co-expressing E-selectin and VCAM-1. In this model, E-selectin enhances initial leukocyte-endothelial tethering, whereas firm adhesion is entirely blocked by monoclonal antibody blockade of α4β1 integrins interacting with their VCAM-1 counterligand. Firm adhesion of both uninfected and AdEGFP-transduced THP-1 cells was similarly enhanced by MCP-1 (100 nm). We saw a significant decrease in VCAM-1-dependent firm adhesion of the WT ILK-transduced THP-1 cells, whereas adhesion of KD ILK-expressing cells was comparable to that of uninfected and control adenovirus-transduced cells. MCP-1 stimulation did not overcome the inhibition conferred by AdWTILK transduction.Figure 6ILK overexpression inhibits VCAM-1-dependent adhesion. HUVECs were transduced with AdE-sel and AdVCAM-1 (MOI = 50 for each) and cultured for 48 h. THP-1 cells were left untransduced or infected with AdEGFP, AdWTILK, or AdKDILK in parallel with the biochemical analysis described above. Leukocyte-endothelial interactions were studied at 2.0 dynes/cm2. Interactions were quantified 1 min before and 1 min after the addition of MCP-1 (100 nm). For antibody blocking experiments, THP-1 cells were pretreated with anti-α4β1 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml, 10 min, 4 °C). Uninfected, AdEGFP-transduced, and AdKDILK-transduced THP-1 cell adhesion is comparably enhanced by MCP-1 (n= 4; ∗, p < 0.01 compared with baseline;p = nonsignificant compared with each other.) Adhesion of AdWTILK-transduced THP-1 cells, with and without chemokine, is decreased significantly (n = 4; ∗∗,p < 0.01) as compared with uninfected, AdEGFP-transduced, and AdKDILK-transduced THP-1 cells. Cumulative data from three experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The emigration of circulating blood leukocytes into subendothelial tissues involves multiple steps. Leukocyte firm attachment and transendothelial migration are mediated by integrins, immunoglobulin superfamily members, matrix proteins, and chemokines. The signaling processes by which chemokines dynamically modulate integrins to orchestrate leukocyte adhesion and cell release are poorly understood. Integrin-linked kinase is a focal adhesion serine-threonine kinase associated principally with β1 integrins. ILK is emerging as an important transducer of cell-matrix signaling in a number of physiological contexts. A role for ILK in the dynamic processes involved in leukocyte recruitment, however, has not previously been postulated. Our data show that ILK is highly expressed in human mononuclear subsets. Chemokines markedly activate ILK in both human monocytes and the THP-1 cell line, which faithfully recapitulates monocyte biology. Leukocyte engagement of the endothelial adhesion molecule VCAM-1 also activates ILK. MCP-1-triggered activation of ILK is dependent on PI3K in monocytes. Both MCP-1-activated THP-1 cells and AdILK-transduced THP-1 cells share Akt and GSK-3 as downstream substrates. Finally, a WT ILK construct diminishes baseline VCAM-1-dependent adhesion and strikingly inhibits the MCP-1-triggered augmentation of monocyte arrest. These data are consistent with a growing body of evidence associating ILK with integrin-triggered signaling (“outside-in signaling”) as well as intracellular signaling cascades that culminate in integrin activation (“inside-out signaling”) (25.Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In other systems, epithelial cell adhesion to matrix proteins triggers ILK activation (3.Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Consistent with these prior findings, leukocyte adhesion to VCAM-1 also activated ILK in our studies. Interestingly, however, MCP-1-triggered activation far exceeded that seen upon leukocyte-matrix interactions. PI3K is a key intermediary in cell motility, specifically in chemokine-triggered leukocyte recruitment (11.Gerszten R.E. Friedrich E.B. Matsui T. Hung R.R. Li L. Force T. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol.

Wymann M.P. Science. 2000; 287: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The obligate pathways downstream of PI3K remain poorly understood (23.Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 29.Jin T. Zhang N. Long Y. Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 2000; 287: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Very recent investigation in fibroblasts suggests a role for ILK in shape change and motility (6.Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the relevant cellular ligands remain undefined. The present work therefore extends prior studies because it implicates members of the chemokine superfamily as potent agonists of ILK in a PI3K-dependent cascade modulating leukocyte adhesion. Our functional data suggest that ILK may play a role in the sequential modulation of integrin affinity and avidity, which has been proposed as a crucial mechanism to facilitate leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration (2.Weber C. Alon R. Moser B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). CC chemokines such as MCP-1 transiently increase and then subsequently reduce VLA-4-mediated binding of monocytes to VCAM-1 (2.Weber C. Alon R. Moser B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and these data suggest a role for ILK in the latter process. Because ILK negatively modulates β1 integrin-dependent adhesion of epithelial cells, it is not entirely surprising that it plays a similar role in leukocyte adhesion in our system. Interaction between ILK and negative modulators of integrin avidity in other systems, such as H-ras (30.Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), is presently unclear. β1 Integrin-associated proteins that subserve similar functions in human neutrophils also merit investigation. An unanswered question of obvious interest is how the functional effects of other chemokines correlate with their effects on ILK stimulation. Finally, future investigations must address the relevant downstream targets of PI3K involved in leukocyte recruitment, particularly in the context of ILK. Whereas our studies suggest that phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 is seen by both chemokine-triggering and transduction with ILK, they do not prove the functional relevance of these observations. Precise definition of the contribution of specific pathways will require additional investigation by engineering new dominant negative constructs or perhaps in genetically manipulated murine models. Rapid pulses of stimuli, such as those seen with chemokine stimulation, may be important for activating the specific signaling pathways that coordinate cell adhesion and migration. A limitation of the present studies in evaluating a physiological role for ILK in leukocyte recruitment is the persistent signal conferred by the adenoviral constructs. We recognize that a number of potentially confounding pathways could be activated by persistent ILK stimulation in our studies. Newer systems that employ small molecule agonists of chimeric proteins turned on in seconds or minutes (31.Stockwell B.R. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 385-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or transgenic animals alluded to above will be helpful to further dissect a role for ILK in leukocyte recruitment. Our working model suggests that chemokines such as MCP-1 can convert initial monocyte tethering to firm arrest following a brief, potentially subsecond exposure (17.Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 32.Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C.

Once the leukocyte has engaged the endothelium, ILK activation persists over several minutes. Sustained ILK activation, in turn, may represent a counter-regulatory mechanism to decrease adherence via as yet uncharacterized effects on focal adhesions. This prepares the cell's response to subsequent directional cues. In summary, we conclude that ILK is involved in the dynamic signaling events by which chemokines control leukocyte integrin avidity for endothelial substrates.

We have devised an assay for 8-oxo-dGTP in bacterial extracts. Using this assay, which involves reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection, we have been unable to detect 8-oxo-dGTP in extracts of three different mutTmutants of E. coli, even after growth of the bacteria in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Our estimated upper limit for 8-oxo-dGTP content of these bacteria is about 200 molecules/cell, corresponding to a concentration of about 0.34 μm. When 8-oxo-dGTP was added at 0.34 μm to an in vitro DNA replication system primed with a DNA template that permits scoring of replication errors and with the four normal dNTPs at their estimated intracellular concentrations, there was no detectable effect upon the frequency of replication errors.

Thus, both bacterial and mammalian proteins are thought to play the same role in sanitizing the nucleotide pool. The bacterial and human enzymes differ somewhat in substrate specificity; hMTH1 acts upon two oxidized dATP derivatives as well as upon 8-oxo-dGTP (13Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Yakushiji H. Fujii Y. Nakabeppu Y. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18201-18205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the bacterial enzyme acts upon 8-oxo-GTP, the ribonucleotide analog of 8-oxo-dGTP (14Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M.-F. Cirinesi A.-M. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Although most published data support the nucleotide pool cleansing role for MutT in ridding the cell of 8-oxo-dGTP, two puzzling observations have been made. First, Fowler et al. (15Fowler R.G. Erickson J.A. Isbell R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7727-7729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that under certain growth conditions for E. coli the mutTmutator phenotype is expressed even when cells are grown anaerobically, and this is under conditions where no appreciable dGTP oxidation should be taking place. Second, Einolf et al. (16Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3764-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) showed 8-oxo-dGTP to be a poor substrate for several DNA polymerases when compared with dGTP. For four different polymerases (16Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), thekcat/Km was ∼105-fold higher for dGTP:C than for either 8-oxo-dGTP:A or 8-oxo-dGTP:C, suggesting that 8-oxo-dGTP levels in cells would have to be quite high in order for it to substitute for dGTP to a significant extent and hence to play a significant role in mutagenesis. Note that in studies with the in vitro DNA replication systems (10Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pavlov Y.I. Minnick D.T. Izuta S. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4695-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Minnick D.T. Pavlov Y.I. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), 8-oxo-dGTP was present at concentrations equal to or greater than those of dGTP, conditions that are unlikely to hold in living cells.To better understand the role of 8-oxo-dGTP in mutagenesis and the mechanism by which MutT minimizes the effects of oxidative DNA damage, it seemed important for intracellular levels of 8-oxo-dGTP to be measured directly under various conditions. For example, we would expect to see higher levels of 8-oxo-dGTP in mutT mutator mutant bacteria than in wild-type cells and lower levels in anaerobic than in aerobic growth conditions. Developing a protocol for extracting and analyzing the 8-oxo-dGTP pool in E. coli and carrying out such analyses were the goals of this investigation.DISCUSSIONWe have developed a separation and analytical system that allows the detection of as little as 6 pmol of 8-oxo-dGTP in a bacterial extract containing the normal nucleotides at their ordinary concentrations. However, when extracts of wild-type and mutTbacteria were compared, we were not able to detect the oxidized nucleotide even at this level in either wild-type or mutant cell extracts, whether or not the bacteria had been oxidatively stressed beforehand by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. To be sure, our electrochemical detection profiles did reveal the presence in mutant cell extracts of at least one electrochemically active substance (Fig.3, C and D) that is distinct from 8-oxo-dGTP. Identification of this material might provide a clue to understanding the mutator phenotype of mutT mutants. However, at present we do not even know whether the unknown material is a nucleotide; preliminary data indicate that it is not an oxidized derivative of one of the standard ribo- or deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Clearly, identification of this material, which is apparently present in quite small amounts, might provide a clue to additional biochemical functions of the MutT protein, and that is one of the directions our future research will take.Our observations with an in vitro replication error detection system are consistent with the results of Einolf et al. (16Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), who reported that 8-oxo-dGTP is a very poor substrate, as compared with dGTP, for four different DNA polymerases: E. coli polymerases I and II, T7 polymerase, and HIV reverse transcriptase. Three of those polymerases do not play their primary roles in chromosomal DNA replication. However, more recently Einolf and Guengerich (17Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3764-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) observed the same result when they analyzed 8-oxo-dGTP as a substrate for a mammalian replicative polymerase, DNA polymerase δ, in the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Ourin vitro experiments were done with a human cell extract system (22Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7064-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that carries out semiconservative replication initiating at normal replication origins. Using a mutational target in which most or all substitution mutations can be detected, we saw no significant increase over the control mutant fraction when replication was carried out in the presence of standard 8-oxo-dGTP at the experimentally determined upper limit of its intracellular concentration. These observations, coupled with expression of themutT mutator phenotype under anaerobic growth conditions (15Fowler R.G. Erickson J.A. Isbell R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7727-7729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the mechanism by which the MutT protein counteracts oxidative mutagenesis needs to be re-evaluated. The action of reactive oxygen species upon cells stimulates mutagenesis in large part by increasing the abundance in DNA of the oxidized guanine derivative, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG).1 This base efficiently pairs with adenine, leading, if unrepaired, to a transversion mutation (1Michaels M.L.

The bacterial and human enzymes differ somewhat in substrate specificity; hMTH1 acts upon two oxidized dATP derivatives as well as upon 8-oxo-dGTP (13Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Yakushiji H. Fujii Y. Nakabeppu Y. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18201-18205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the bacterial enzyme acts upon 8-oxo-GTP, the ribonucleotide analog of 8-oxo-dGTP (14Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M.-F. Cirinesi A.-M. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although most published data support the nucleotide pool cleansing role for MutT in ridding the cell of 8-oxo-dGTP, two puzzling observations have been made. First, Fowler et al. (15Fowler R.G. Erickson J.A. Isbell R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7727-7729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that under certain growth conditions for E. coli the mutTmutator phenotype is expressed even when cells are grown anaerobically, and this is under conditions where no appreciable dGTP oxidation should be taking place. Second, Einolf et al. (16Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3764-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) showed 8-oxo-dGTP to be a poor substrate for several DNA polymerases when compared with dGTP. For four different polymerases (16Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), thekcat/Km was ∼105-fold higher for dGTP:C than for either 8-oxo-dGTP:A or 8-oxo-dGTP:C, suggesting that 8-oxo-dGTP levels in cells would have to be quite high in order for it to substitute for dGTP to a significant extent and hence to play a significant role in mutagenesis. Note that in studies with the in vitro DNA replication systems (10Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pavlov Y.I. Minnick D.T. Izuta S. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4695-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Minnick D.T. Pavlov Y.I. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), 8-oxo-dGTP was present at concentrations equal to or greater than those of dGTP, conditions that are unlikely to hold in living cells. To better understand the role of 8-oxo-dGTP in mutagenesis and the mechanism by which MutT minimizes the effects of oxidative DNA damage, it seemed important for intracellular levels of 8-oxo-dGTP to be measured directly under various conditions. For example, we would expect to see higher levels of 8-oxo-dGTP in mutT mutator mutant bacteria than in wild-type cells and lower levels in anaerobic than in aerobic growth conditions. Developing a protocol for extracting and analyzing the 8-oxo-dGTP pool in E. coli and carrying out such analyses were the goals of this investigation. DISCUSSIONWe have developed a separation and analytical system that allows the detection of as little as 6 pmol of 8-oxo-dGTP in a bacterial extract containing the normal nucleotides at their ordinary concentrations. However, when extracts of wild-type and mutTbacteria were compared, we were not able to detect the oxidized nucleotide even at this level in either wild-type or mutant cell extracts, whether or not the bacteria had been oxidatively stressed beforehand by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. To be sure, our electrochemical detection profiles did reveal the presence in mutant cell extracts of at least one electrochemically active substance (Fig.3, C and D) that is distinct from 8-oxo-dGTP. Identification of this material might provide a clue to understanding the mutator phenotype of mutT mutants. However, at present we do not even know whether the unknown material is a nucleotide; preliminary data indicate that it is not an oxidized derivative of one of the standard ribo- or deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Clearly, identification of this material, which is apparently present in quite small amounts, might provide a clue to additional biochemical functions of the MutT protein, and that is one of the directions our future research will take.Our observations with an in vitro replication error detection system are consistent with the results of Einolf et al. (16Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), who reported that 8-oxo-dGTP is a very poor substrate, as compared with dGTP, for four different DNA polymerases: E. coli polymerases I and II, T7 polymerase, and HIV reverse transcriptase. Three of those polymerases do not play their primary roles in chromosomal DNA replication. However, more recently Einolf and Guengerich (17Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3764-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) observed the same result when they analyzed 8-oxo-dGTP as a substrate for a mammalian replicative polymerase, DNA polymerase δ, in the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Ourin vitro experiments were done with a human cell extract system (22Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7064-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that carries out semiconservative replication initiating at normal replication origins. Using a mutational target in which most or all substitution mutations can be detected, we saw no significant increase over the control mutant fraction when replication was carried out in the presence of standard 8-oxo-dGTP at the experimentally determined upper limit of its intracellular concentration. These observations, coupled with expression of themutT mutator phenotype under anaerobic growth conditions (15Fowler R.G. Erickson J.A. Isbell R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7727-7729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the mechanism by which the MutT protein counteracts oxidative mutagenesis needs to be re-evaluated.

We have proposed that the positively charged intermediate is stabilized by being sandwiched between the combined negative charges of the anionic uracil leaving group and a conserved aspartate residue that are located on opposite faces of the sugar ring. Here we establish that a duplex DNA oligonucleotide containing a cationic 1-aza-deoxyribose (I) oxacarbenium ion mimic is a potent inhibitor of UDG that binds tightly to the enzyme-uracil anion (EU−) product complex (KD of EU− = 110 pm). The tight binding of I to the EU− complex results from its extremely slow off rate (koff = 0.0008 s−1), which is 25,000-fold slower than substrate analogue DNA. Removal of Asp64 and His187, which are involved in stabilization of the cationic sugar and the anionic uracil leaving group, respectively, specifically weakens binding of I to the UDG-uracil complex by 154,000-fold, without significantly affecting substrate or product binding.

Snider M.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 938-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Such interactions may take the form of ground state destabilization or transition state stabilization, and the relative contributions of these two effects are a matter of considerable debate (2Jencks W.P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 219-410PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bruice T.C. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6267-6274Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Warshel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27035-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both catalytic mechanisms require that the enzyme interact differentially with the substrate as it is transformed along the reaction coordinate to product. The mechanisms by which enzymes achieve such remarkable differential binding of substrate, transition state, and product are still not well understood and have considerable bearing on the design of new catalysts and the rational development of tight binding enzyme inhibitors. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG)1is a powerful DNA repair enzyme that removes mutagenic uracil bases from DNA through hydrolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond (5Stivers J.T. Drohat A.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The enzyme has been remarkably amenable to crystallographic, NMR, and kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements, which together have revealed essential aspects of the catalytic mechanism (6Drohat A.C. Jagadeesh J. Ferguson E. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Drohat A.C. Xiao G. Tordova M. Jagadeesh J. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A.

Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14054-514064Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Most remarkably, the KIE studies revealed a surprising stepwise mechanism for glycosidic bond cleavage involving an enzyme-stabilized oxacarbenium ion-uracil anion intermediate (Fig. 1). The presence of such an unprecedented ionic intermediate was supported by NMR and Raman studies, which established the persistence of the N-1–O-2 uracil anion in the ternary product complex with abasic DNA (9Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1840-1841Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Dong J. Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13241-13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the basis of this body of work, it was proposed that UDG stabilized the intermediate using an “electrostatic sandwich” mechanism involving a conserved aspartate residue and the negative charge provided by the uracil anion leaving group. Another key player in this proposed mechanism is the active site residue, His187, which has been shown to form a strong hydrogen bond to uracil O-2 and thereby stabilizes the N-1–O-2 enolate by 5 kcal/mol in the ternary product complex as compared with solution (8Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The energetic role of the His187 hydrogen bond is likely to be of comparable importance in stabilizing the transition state and the subsequent ionic intermediate. To provide a rigorous test of the above catalytic proposal, we have constructed a stable bipartite mimic of the charged intermediate using a cationic 1-aza-deoxyribose (I) containing DNA and uracil (Fig. 1). If the electrostatic stabilization mechanism is correct, we predict that I will bind extremely tightly to the UDG-uracil anion binary complex and that the tight binding would be abolished when either the uracil base, His187, or Asp64 was removed by omission or mutagenesis. An additional rigorous test for the catalytic potential of this mechanism is to evaluate whether His187 and Asp64 are involved indifferential stabilization of the intermediate through their interactions with the uracil base and cationic sugar as shown in Fig.1. This requirement for catalysis may be tested by assessing whether the removal of His187 and Asp64 has a large effect on binding of I without a corresponding large effect on the binding of substrate or product analogue DNA. Here we test these predictions and report that UDG provides a large and differential electrostatic stabilization of the oxacarbenium ion-uracil anion intermediate analogue using the negative charge on the uracil anion and Asp64. The magnitude of the stabilization is on the order of −7 kcal/mol, which is a significant portion of the −16 kcal/mol decrease in the activation barrier provided by UDG. The nucleoside phosphoramidites were purchased from Applied Biosystems or Glen Research (Sterling, VA), except for the β anomer of the pyrene nucleoside phosphoramidite, the 2′-β-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine phosphoramidite, and the 1-aza-1,2-dideoxy-4α-carba-d-ribitol phosphoramidite, which were synthesized as described (12Makino K. Ichikawa Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 8245-8248Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A.

After synthesis and deprotection, the oligonucleotides were purified by anion exchange HPLC and desalted by C-18 reversed phase HPLC (Phenomenex Aqua column) (Torrance, CA). The size, purity, and nucleotide composition of the DNA was assessed by analytical reversed phase HPLC, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA strands were hybridized as previously described to form the duplexes used in the binding studies as shown in Fig. 2. The concentrations of the oligonucleotides were determined by UV absorption measurements at 260 nm, using the pair wise extinction coefficients for the constituent nucleotides and the measured extinction coefficient of 9.6 mm−1 cm−1 (260 nm) for the pyrene nucleoside in 40% methanol. As previously described, the recombinant UDG from Escherichia coli strain B was purified to >99% homogeneity using a T7 polymerase-based over expression system (6Drohat A.C. Jagadeesh J. Ferguson E. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Xiao G. Tordova M. Jagadeesh J. Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Gilliland G.L. Proteins. 1999; 35: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The concentration of the enzyme was determined using an extinction coefficient of 38.5 mm−1 cm−1. The D64N and H187G mutants were generated using the QuikChange double-stranded mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of the DNA. The His6-tagged mutant proteins were purified using nickel chelate chromatography as previously described (6Drohat A.C. Jagadeesh J. Ferguson E. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Werner R.M. Jiang Y.L. Gordley R.G. Jagadeesh G.J. Ladner J.E. Xiao G. Tordova M. Gilliland G.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12585-12594Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The His tag was removed by cleavage using biotinylated thrombin followed by purification using strepavidin beads and nickel chelate chromatography. One-dimensional proton NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C with a Varian mercury 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA). The sample included 2 mm 1-aza-deoxyribose and the internal standard p-toluenesulfonic acid in 1 ml of D2O. The spectra were recorded with the following acquisition parameters: a spectral width of 6390 Hz, a reference frequency set at 0 ppm relative to the methyl group of the standard, an acquisition time of 2 s, and a relaxation delay of 1 s. Titrations were performed by adding small aliquots of 0.1 mNaOD or DCl. The pKa value for the endocyclic nitrogen of the 1-aza-deoxyribose was determined by following the pH-dependent chemical shifts of the adjacent 2′ or 4′ protons (17Hansen S.U. Bols M. Acta Chem. Scand. 1998; 52: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The apparent electrode readings were not corrected for deuterium isotope effects, because the glass electrode effect is expected to approximately cancel the increased pKaof the phosphate groups in D2O (18Stivers J.T. Abeygunawardana C. Mildvan A.S. Hajipour G. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 814-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This may introduce an uncertainty of ± 0.1 unit in the true group pKa value in water, but this uncertainty has no impact on the conclusions in this work. The titration data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to Equation 1, where δ1and δ2 are the limiting chemical shifts at low and high pH, respectively. δ(ppm)=[δ1+δ2(10pH−pKa)]/(10pH−pKa+1)Equation 1 The dissociation constants (KD) for binding of UDG to the DNA molecules indicated in Table I were determined using three methods that we designate as methods A, B, and C. All measurements were performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 25 mm NaCl at 25 °C. With method A, direct binding measurements were made by following the increase in pyrene fluorescence upon titrating fixed concentrations of the pyrene-containing DNA (Fig. 2) with increasing amounts of UDG. Excitation was at 350 nm, and emission spectra from 370 to 450 nm were collected using a Spex Fluromax 3 spectrofluorimeter (19Jiang Y.L. Kwon K. Stivers J.T. J. Biol.

Further experimental details are reported in the figure legends. With method B, which was used for measuring the binding of AUFA/TYT to wtUDG, competitive kinetic inhibition measurements were performed using the substrate ApUpAp (19Jiang Y.L. Kwon K. Stivers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42347-42354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Conditions were chosen whereby [UDG]tot << [AUFA/TYT] and [ApUpAp], and [ApUpAp] << Km. Accordingly, Ki could be obtained directly from a plot ofk/ko against [AUFA/TYT] as shown in Equation 4, wherek is the observed rate constant (v/[UDG]tot) at a given [AUFA/TYT], and ko is the observed rate constant in the absence of the inhibitor.k/ko=1/(1+[AUFA/TYT]/Ki)Equation 4 For these measurements, a sensitive HPLC kinetic assay for monitoring the formation of the abasic product was employed (20Jiang Y.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7710-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With method C, the KD of AIA/TYT for the wtUDG-uracil anion complex was calculated from the ratio ofkoff to kon, which was obtained from stopped flow and steady state fluorescence measurements (see below). The observed rate constants for association of AIA/TYT with the UDG-uracil anion complex were obtained using an Applied Photophysics 720 stopped flow fluorescence instrument (Surray, UK) under pseudo-first-order conditions in which the concentration of the EU− complex was always more than 4-fold greater than the concentration of AIA/TYT. In these experiments a syringe containing a solution of UDG (200–1800 nm) and uracil (3 mm) was rapidly mixed with a solution of AIA/TYT (50 nm) delivered from a second syringe, and the fluorescence change as a function of time was recorded using a 360-nm cut-off filter with excitation at 333 nm. The traces were fitted to a first-order rate expression (Equation 5) to obtain the observed rate constants (kobsd) at each concentration of UDG. kobsd=Aexp(1−kt)+CEquation 5 The kobsd values were plotted against the concentration of the UDG-uracil anion complex, and the association rate was obtained from the slope of a linear regression best fit line to the data. The dissociation rate constant (koff) of AIA/TYT from the UDG-uracil anion complex was measured using irreversible conditions by manually mixing the complex with a large excess of nonfluorescent single-stranded trapping DNA and then following the time-dependent decrease in the pyrene fluorescence at 378 nm. The sequence of the trap DNA was the same as the AIA strand of the duplex AIA/TYT (Fig. 2). The experiments were performed by first incubating UDG (50 nm), AIA/TYT (40 nm), and uracil (3 mm) in the fluorescent cuvette for 60 min and then initiating the reaction by adding 2 μl of a 16.7 mm stock solution of AIA. The solution was mixed, and the fluorescence at 378 nm was monitored for 4000 s. The pH dependence of AIA/TYT binding to the EU complex was determined using the direct fluorescence method (method A, see above) in the pH range 6–10 using the following buffers (all 10 mm containing 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 20 mm NaCl): NaMES at pH 6.0, NaHEPES at pH 7 to 8, Tris-HCl at pH 8.8, and NaCAPS at pH 9.3 and 10. The uracil concentration was maintained at 3 mm so that the enzyme was nearly entirely in the EU form at all pH values (8Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The primary purpose of the current studies is to evaluate the magnitude and mechanism by which UDG stabilizes the putative oxacarbenium ion-uracil anion intermediate that was implicated in recent KIE studies (10Werner R.M. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14054-514064Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The experimental design involves measurement of the binding affinity of an oxacarbenium ion mimic to the UDG-uracil anion complex, as well as the uracil complex with the H187G and D64N mutants. The DNA construct contains a pyrene nucleotide fluorescent reporter group on the DNA strand opposite to the 1-aza-deoxyribose group. We have previously shown that pyrene (Y) has a slight beneficial effect on the kinetics of the wild-type UDG reaction and increases the binding affinity for the substrate by about 5-fold because of preorganization of the uracil base in an extrahelical conformation (19Jiang Y.L. Kwon K. Stivers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42347-42354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Most importantly for the work presented here, pyrene provides a strong fluorescence signal to monitor binding (19Jiang Y.L. Kwon K. Stivers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42347-42354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interpretation of the binding and mutagenesis results requires knowledge of the ionization states of the important residues of the enzyme, the free and bound uracil base, and the free and bound 1-aza-deoxyribose oxacarbenium ion mimic. Fortunately, thermodynamic, kinetic, and NMR studies of UDG provide most of the required information to design the current experiments without making assumptions about the ionization states of any of the free or bound species. We present our results by first establishing the ionization states of each key species and then describing the binding thermodynamics for the wild-type, H187G, and D64N enzymes. The N-1 pKa of free uracil is 9.8, which decreases to 7.5 when uracil forms a binary complex with UDG (8Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TheKD value of UDG for the neutral uracil base is 500-fold weaker than for the uracil anion (KD = 500 and 1 μm, respectively) (8Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These two results establish that at pH 8.8, the standard pH used in this work, UDG is essentially saturated with the uracil anion and not a mixture of the neutral and anionic forms. Thus the binding experiments with wild-type UDG measure the affinity of AIA/TYT and AφA/TYT for the enzyme-uracil anion complex. Interpretation of the mutagenesis tests of the electrostatic sandwich mechanism also requires knowledge of the ionization state of the uracil base in the complexes with the H187G and D64N mutants at pH 8.8. The crystal structure of the H187Q mutant bound to uracil has been solved at 1.2 Å resolution (7Drohat A.C. Xiao G. Tordova M. Jagadeesh J. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Gilliland G.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and shows that the uracil base is productively bound at pH 8.5 but provides no information as to its ionization state. However, based on the weak KD of uracil for binding to H187G or H187Q, and the absence of a 2-13C shift for uracil of 165 ppm that would indicate the presence of the N-1–O-2 uracil monoanion (9Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1840-1841Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we conclude that uracil is neutral in the binary and ternary product complexes with these mutants (8Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, the D64N mutant binds uracil with the same affinity as wild-type UDG (6Drohat A.C. Jagadeesh J. Ferguson E. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and retains the downfield-shifted proton in the ternary complex with abasic DNA that is diagnostic for the uracil anion (see below). 2A. C. Drohat and J. T. Stivers, unpublished results. To establish whetherI is a true oxacarbenium ion mimic, it is essential to establish its ionization state. The pKa value for the 1-nitrogen of the free 1-aza-deoxyribose (I) was determined using proton NMR by following the pH dependence of the chemical shift of the pro-R endocylic 4 proton that is adjacent to the nitrogen (pKa = 9.42 ± 0.03; Fig. 3). An identical pKa value was measured by following the 2′ proton resonances as well. Thus in the pH range 6.5–8.8 where the bulk of the current binding measurements are performed, free I is at least 80–100% in its cationic form. For comparison, the pKa value of isofagomine, the related 1-aza-pyranose, is 0.8 units lower than the 1-aza-furanose used here (pKa = 8.6) (21Bulow A. Plesner I.W. Bols M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8567-8568Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The pKa ofI in the context of DNA is likely to be even higher because of electrostatic stabilization of the cation by DNA phosphodiester groups. On the basis of the high pKa of freeI and the negatively charged groups in the vicinity of the anomeric position in the active site (Fig. 1), we conclude thatI likely remains cationic in the E·U−·AIA/TYT complex. Although we have no direct method to determine the ionization state ofI in the E·U−·AIA/TYT ternary complex, we can indirectly infer its protonation state by observing the effect of I on NMR observable features of this complex (8Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,9Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1840-1841Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The first NMR feature is the downfield-shifted Hɛproton of the active site electrophile His187. This resonance is only observed when the uracil base is in the N-1–O-2 enolate form (Fig. 1) and thus provides a useful probe of the ionization state of the bound uracil base (8Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1840-1841Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, this signal should indirectly report on the protonation state ofI because a positive charge on I should stabilize the uracil anion and thereby lower its pKa. We have previously used the decrease in intensity of the Hɛproton resonance as the pH is lowered to measure the pKa of uracil N-1 in a UDG ternary complex with DNA containing a neutral tetrahydrofuran abasic site analogue (pKa = 6.4) (8Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Importantly, the pKa determined by this method was identical to that measured in NMR experiments in which the 2-13C chemical shift of 2-13C-labeled uracil was followed as a function of pH (9Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1840-1841Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We performed the same one-dimensional proton NMR experiment with the E·U·AIA/TAT complex and observed no decrease in the intensity or change in shift of the Hɛ proton resonance as the pH was decreased from 10.1 to 5.6, and data in the range pH 8.8–5.6 are shown in Fig. 4. For comparison, the decrease in intensity of the Hɛ proton resonance in the E·U·AφA/TAT complex over a similar pH range is also shown. The absence of an intensity change of the Hɛ proton resonance in the E·U·AIA/TAT complex suggests that the uracil base is still fully anionic even at pH values as low as 5.6 with this complex. This result suggests that the positive charge on I has dramatically lowered the pKa of uracil N-1 as compared with the ternary complex with the neutral abasic site analogue (φ; Fig.2). 3It is not possible to completely exclude a mechanism involving direct hydrogen bonding of the 1-NH2+ group of I to the N-1 position of uracil. Such a mechanism might also explain the observed stabilization of the uracil anion in the E·U−·AIA/TYT complex. However, such a mechanism does not substantially alter the interpretation of the results, because the hydrogen bond still has an electrostatic component, as do all hydrogen bonds. This ambiguity reflects the more general problem that perfect chemical mimics of the oxacarbenium ion are not attainable. On the basis that no intensity change of the Hɛ resonance was observed at pH 5.6, we calculate an upper limit pKa for uracil N-1 of less than 4.5 in this complex. This corresponds to a ≥5.2 unit lowering of the pKa as compared with free uracil (pKa = 9.8) or, alternatively, a ≥7.5 kcal/mol stabilization of the uracil anion in the active site environment. Furthermore, the observation that the resonance at 15.15 ppm did not change in shift (<0.06 ppm) over the pH range 5.6–10.1 suggests thatI remains cationic over this pH range. This interpretation is supported by the sensitivity of this shift to mutation and DNA structure, which makes it unlikely that a change in the ionization state of I would escape detection (8Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Further strong evidence that I is cationic in the E·U·AIA/TYT complex is provided by the selective tight binding of AIA/TYT to the EU− complex, which can only reasonably be explained by the presence of positive charge on the sugar (see below). The electrostatic sandwich mechanism requires a negative charge on Asp64. The pKa value of Asp64 in the free enzyme and ES complex has been inferred from kinetic and mutagenesis studies to be 5.7 and 6.2, respectively (6Drohat A.C. Jagadeesh J. Ferguson E. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus it would be expected that binding of AIA/TYT would weaken as the pH is lowered below 6.2 because of a weaker interaction with the neutral form of Asp64. We do not have any method of determining the pKa value of Asp64 in the E·U·AIA/TYT complex, but we anticipate that its pKa would be lower than 6.2 because of electrostatic stabilization of the anion by the protonated nitrogen of the sugar (see “Discussion”). Using method A, B or C described under “Experimental Procedures,” we have determined the binding constant of AUFA/TYT substrate analogue DNA to free UDG and the binding constants of the intermediate and product analogue DNA molecules to the UDG-uracil anion complex (TableI). A representative binding experiment is shown in Fig. 5 in which a solution of AIA/TYT (12 nm) and uracil (3 mm) is titrated with increasing concentrations of wtUDG, which results in a saturable increase in pyrene fluorescence. The KD = 240 ± 160 pm obtained from this experiment measures the binding of AIA/TYT to the UDG-uracil anion binary complex. Because of the very tight binding of AIA/TYT to the binary complex and the signal-to-noise limitations of the fluorescence assay, we were unable to obtain a more precise measurement of this interaction using this direct titration approach. Therefore, to confirm thisKD estimate, we performed kinetic measurements of the association and dissociation rates using stopped flow and manual mixing methods and then calculated KD from the ratiokoff/kon (Fig.6 and Table I). The observed rate constants for association of AIA/TYT to the EU− complex were measured using four concentrations of UDG over the range 200–1600 nm (Fig. 6B), and kon = (7.5 ± 0.2) × 106m−1s−1 was determined from the slope of a linear regression fit of kobsd against UDG concentration (see legend to Fig. 5 for further details). The koff= (8 ± 0.1) × 10−4 s−1 was then measured in a trapping experiment in which irreversible dissociation of AIA/TYT from the ternary complex was monitored by the decrease in pyrene fluorescence (Fig. 6C). This off rate is 25000-fold slower than the previously measured koff = 20 s−1 for a substrate analogue DNA (13Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The ratio,koff/kon = 110 ± 10 pm, obtained from these kinetic measurements overlaps the estimated KD obtained from the titration experiment in Fig. 5 and confirms the tight binding of this analogue to the EU− complex. We also investigated the binding affinity of AIA/TYT to the free enzyme in the absence of uracil using method A. TheKD = 2500 nm for this interaction is 25,000-fold weaker than binding of AIA/TYT to the EU−complex, confirming the expectation that the complete ternary complex is required to realize the full binding affinity of the intermediate analogue. As shown in Table I, the KD of AIA/TYT for the EU− complex is 300-fold tighter than AUFA/TYT binding to the free enzyme and an enormous 172,000-fold tighter than the binding affinity of AφA/TYT to the EU− complex. This is remarkable given that the major difference between AIA/TYT and AφA/TYT is the replacement of the 1-methylene group with NH2+. To investigate the hypothesis that His187 and Asp64 serve to selectively stabilize the oxacarbenium ion-uracil anion intermediate without also contributing to the binding of the substrate and product, we measured the binding affinity of H187G, D64N, and H187G/D64N to the substrate, intermediate, and product analogues (Table I). As shown in Fig.7, the three mutants bind with similar affinity as wtUDG to the substrate analogue AUFA/TYT. In addition, all of the mutants bind to the product analogue AφA/TYT with affinity similar to that of wtUDG in the presence of 3 mm uracil. However, H187G and D64N bind 100- and 300-fold less tightly than wtUDG to the AIA/TYT intermediate analogue in the presence of 3 mm uracil, and the H187G/D64N double mutant binds 154,000-fold less tightly. The excellent agreement between the damaging effects of removing the positive charge on the sugar (i.e.binding of AφA/TYT to the EU− complex) and the deletion of both Asp64 and His187(i.e. binding of AIA/TYT to the double mutant) provides two independent measurements supporting the magnitude of electrostatic stabilization of the intermediate by wtUDG. The pH dependence of binding to form the E·U·AIA/TYT ternary complex would be expected to be extremely complex, reflecting the pKa values of the free and bound forms of uracil, AIA/TYT, His187, and Asp64. Despite this complexity, which precludes a rigorous analysis, we measured the apparent binding constants at six pH values in the range 6.0–10 (Fig.8). The apparent KDfor binding decreased with a roughly second-order dependence on proton concentration in the pH range 6.0–7.0, suggesting that protonation of two groups in this pH range was important for binding. As the pH was further increased from 7 to 9, the KD decreased with a first-order dependence before increasing sharply as the pH was raised above 9.3 (Fig. 8). This pH dependence is consistent with electrostatic sandwich mechanism that requires the uracil monoanion, the Asp64 anion, and the cationic 1-aza-deoxyribose for tight binding. These groups would be expected to titrate in this pH range, leading to the observed effects on binding. These results are in marked contrast with previous studies showing that the Kmfor substrate and the KD for substrate analogue DNA are pH-independent in the range 6.0–9.5 (6Drohat A.C. Jagadeesh J. Ferguson E. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The small measured 1′-13C KIE of UDG (1.01) and the large 1′-α-d (1.2) and 2′-β-d kinetic isotope effects (1.1) led to the conclusion that the UDG reaction followed one of the most dissociative mechanisms yet observed, with the likely formation of a discrete oxacarbenium ion-uracil anion intermediate (10Werner R.M. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14054-514064Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A subsequent computational study reached the same conclusion (22Dinner A.R. Blackburn G.M. Karplus M. Nature. 2001; 413: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Features of the active site that contributed to this surprising structure were the use of binding interactions with the 3′- and 5′-phosphodiester groups to enforce a flattened sugar pucker that maximizes stabilizing hyperconjugative effects in the transition state and electrostatic stabilization by Asp64 and the uracil anion leaving group. The present results are fully supportive of these proposals and provide estimates of the amount of specific stabilization of the intermediate that may be afforded by Asp64 and the uracil anion. The current study cannot address the magnitude of transition state stabilization provided by electrostatic interactions of the intermediate with the phosphodiester groups of the substrate. A recent computational study suggests that these effects may contribute an astonishing 22 kcal/mol to catalysis, which is in great excess of the upper limit energetic contributions of these groups measured in recent experimental studies (<13 kcal/mol) (20Jiang Y.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7710-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The role of the anionic phosphodiester groups in stabilization of the intermediate and transition state is under further investigation. The removal of Asp64 is expected to selectively impair binding of AIA/TYT to the EU− complex by abolishing the favorable ionic interaction with I. The apparent magnitude of this single interaction is 2.9 kcal/mol on the basis of the 118-fold damaging effect of removing Asp64 (Table I). The specificity of this interaction for the intermediate mimic and not the substrate and product is demonstrated by the observation that the D64N mutation actually increases the binding affinity for the substrate and product analogues by 3.4- and 21-fold, respectively. We have noted this effect of the D64N mutation before (20Jiang Y.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7710-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and speculate that it could arise from an unfavorable electrostatic interaction between Asp64 and the 3′-phosphodiester group of the deoxyuridine residue of the substrate or the tetrahydrofuran sugar of the product. The removal of His187 is expected to selectively impair binding of AIA/TYT to the E·UH complex by abrogating the negative charge on the uracil base (where UH is the N-1 protonated uracil). The magnitude of this interaction is 3.4 kcal/mol on the basis of the 318-fold damaging effect of removing His187 (Table I). The specificity of the His187interaction with the intermediate is demonstrated by the less than 1.6-fold difference in the binding affinity of H187G with the substrate and product analogues as compared with wtUDG (Table I). Consistent with approximately additive effects of the single mutations, the D64N/H187Q double mutant shows an enormous 154,000-fold detrimental effect on binding of the intermediate analogue (7.2 kcal/mol) and only a 2–3-fold effect on binding of the substrate and product analogues (Fig. 6). We conclude that electrostatic stabilization of the oxacarbenium ion intermediate involves His187, through its stabilization of the uracil anion, as well as Asp64, through its direct electrostatic interaction with the cationic sugar. Importantly, both of these interactions are catalytic by virtue of their selective stabilization of the intermediate mimic. For the 1-aza-deoxyribose inhibitors to be of general utility, the nitrogen must be protonated in the active site of the enzyme. The NMR titration in Fig. 3 establishes that the free I has a fairly high pKa value, insuring that it is cationic at neutral pH. In the active site, its pKa may be even higher because of the stabilizing effects of nearby phosphodiester groups, Asp64 and the uracil anion. Similarly, the cationic I would be expected to lower the pKa of Asp64and lower the pKa of uracil N-1, which is indeed observed (Fig. 4). Thus with the estimated pKavalues falling in the range ≤4.5 (uracil), ≤6.2 (Asp64), and ≥9.4 (I) the system is set so that proton transfer from the sugar nitrogen to uracil N-1 or Asp64 is thermodynamically unfavorable. This pKa balance is necessary to maintain the correct ionization state of the system required for tight binding, as indicated by the pH dependence in Fig.8. Specific inhibitors of uracil DNA glycosylase could serve as antiviral agents, because the pox viruses and type I herpesvirus require a UDG activity for viral DNA replication or escape from latency (23Prichard M.N. Duke G.M. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pyles R.B. Thompson R.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4963-4972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sekino Y. Bruner S.D.

Virol. 1993; 67: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, such inhibitors could have potential for inhibiting DNA glycosylases that counterproductively repair damaged bases that result from chemotherapy treatments with alkylating agents or radiation. To our knowledge, this is the first example where tight binding of a 1-azasugar derivative has been directly demonstrated for an enzyme that is known to proceed through a discreet oxacarbenium intermediate. If other DNA glycosylases are found to follow similar highly dissociative mechanisms as UDG, with the formation of discrete intermediates, then a general strategy for inhibitor design would be to incorporate the features of the bipartite intermediate into a unimolecular inhibitor. In the case of UDG, this would require attachment of the uracil base to the sugar in such a manner that ionization at N-1 is still possible, allowing the negative charge on the base to be retained. The syntheses of several inhibitors that may be able to mimic all of the features of the ionic intermediate are in progress, and this approach may provide a general strategy for specific inhibition of a variety of DNA repair glycosylases.

Also, data from immunocytochemistry and immunological analysis established that Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kvβ2.1 are the most abundant subunits found together in channel complexes (14.Coleman S.K.

These subunits are co-localized in the juxta-paranodal region of the nodes of Ranvier, as well as in the axons and terminals of cerebellar basket cells of rat brain (19.Rhodes K.J. Strassle B.W.

Thus far, heterologous expression of Kv1 α and β subunits has failed to mimic the characteristics of neuronal K+ currents, highlighting the need to reproduce native K+ channels. Additionally, certain neurological conditions are associated with changes in Kv1 channel multimers. For example, an increase in the number of αDTX binding sites occurs in demyelinated brain plaques from patients with multiple sclerosis (20.Keighley W.W. Newcombe J. Templeton D. Treherne J.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 480P: 68P-69PGoogle Scholar), whereas the content of αDTX and DTXk acceptors is decreased in hippocampus from aging patients or those with Alzheimer's disease (21.Cochran S.M. Pratt J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 256Google Scholar). Furthermore, several mutations in Kv1.1 are associated with human disorders (e.g. episodic ataxia I and myokymia) (1.Lehmann-Horn F. Jurkat-Rott K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1317-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 22.Browne D.L. Brunt E.R. Griggs R.C. Nutt J.G. Gancher S.T. Smith E.A. Litt M. Hum. Mol.

Functional K+ channels containing different numbers of Kv1.1 co-assembled with Kv1.2 in the presence of Kvβ2.1 were generated using Semliki Forest virus (SFV), yielding oligomers resembling those prevalent in neurons. Electrophysiological recording of their respective K+ currents in oocytes and analysis of the binding of 125I-labeled DTXk and αDTX to transfected mammalian cells revealed that varying proportions of Kv1.1 and 1.2 could subtly influence the biophysical and pharmacological properties of expressed channels. Such systematic profiling should allow identification of K+ channel counterparts in neurons and their altered phenotypes in diseases. All constructs were incorporated into pβut2pA for high expression in Xenopus oocytes (9.Akhtar S. McIntosh P. Bryan-Sisneros A. Barratt L. Robertson B. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16984-16992Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Monomeric cDNAs were prepared by PCR amplification of rat Kv1.1 and 1.2 subunits, using the respective primer pairs (a) 5′-CCCTCGAGCCACCATGGCGGTGATG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTCGACTTTTTAAACATCGGT-3′ and (b) 5′- ACTCCTCGAGCACCATGGCAG-3′ and 5′-AATAGGTCGACATCAGACATCAGT-3′ to introduce XhoI and SalI sites (underlined) with pAKS Kv1.1 or 1.2 cDNA as template (a gift from Prof. O. Pongs). After digestion, the products were ligated into pβut2pA similarly cleaved. The Kv1.2–1.2 construct was obtained by joining together the two cDNAs via the 5′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene. For the first position in this tandem, Kv1.2 was amplified from pAKS using primers 5′-CTGCAACTAGTATGACGGTGATGTCAGGGG-3′ and 5′-CAACTCGAGATCAGTTAACATTTTGGTAA-3′ to remove the stop codon and introduce SpeI and XhoI sites (underlined). After digestion, the PCR product was ligated into pβut2pA vector cut with XbaI and XhoI to generate pβut2pA Kv1.2 (without stop codon). To introduce the second constituent of the dimer, a His6 tag was inserted at the C terminus of Kv1.2, and its initiation codon was removed by PCR to give pβut2pA Kv1.2 (+His6, −ATG). The latter was amplified using the primer pair 5′-TTTGTCGACACTCAGAAAGAAACGCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ (antisense). After digestion with SalI (introduced by sense primer) andEcoRI (present downstream of coding sequence), the fragment was subcloned into pβut2pA Kv1.2 (without stop codon) cut withXhoI and EcoRI to generate pβut2pA Kv1.2–1.2 (+His6, −ATG, 16-amino acid linker, and a stop codon). pβut2pA Kv1.1–1.2 was designed on the same principle. The coding sequence of rat Kv1.1 was PCR-amplified from pAKS Kv1.1 cDNA using the primer pair 5′-CTGCAACTAGTATGACGGTGATGTCAGGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGGTGCTTCTCGAGAACATCGGTCAGGAG-3′ (antisense) to exclude the stop codon and introduceSpeI and XhoI sites (underlined). The digested product was ligated into pβut2pA (XbaI andXhoI) to generate pβut2pA Kv1.1 (without stop codon). This was cleaved (XhoI and EcoRI), and the PCR-amplified Kv1.2 (+His6, −ATG) fragment was subcloned downstream of Kv1.1 cDNA, after cutting with SalI andEcoRI. pβut2pA Kv1.1-(1.2)3 was obtained by joining Kv1.2–1.2 downstream of Kv1.1–1.2 after manipulations of the two constructs. A His6 sequence and stop codon were removed from the C terminus of the heterodimer and ligated in-frame to homodimer after deletion of ATG from the first Kv1.2 cDNA to yield pβut2pA Kv1.1-(1.2)3. To prepare a Kv1.2N–1.1C chimera, the N-terminal region of Kv1.1 (487 bp) was replaced with the equivalent domain of Kv1.2 (475 bp). pβut2pA Kv1.1 and 1.2 plasmids were digested with HindIII (outside the coding region) andSacI (487 or 475 bp downstream of Kv1.1 and 1.2, respectively). The isolated larger (∼4500 bp from pβut2pA Kv1.1) and smaller (∼475 bp from pβut2pA Kv1.2) fragments were ligated to yield pβut2pA Kv1.2N–1.1C. Every construct made above was verified by restriction digestion and dideoxy DNA sequencing. For expression in the SFV system, all Kv1 pβut2pA constructs were subcloned into pSFV1 vector, employingHindIII and BglII sites to cut out the cDNA fragments that were blunt-ended before ligation with pSFV1 vector (10.Shamotienko O.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16766-16776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). cRNAs for each Kv1 construct (in pβut2pA and pSFV1) and pSFVH1 (plasmid encoding viral packaging proteins) were prepared as described previously (10.Shamotienko O. Akhtar S. Sidera C. Meunier F.A. Ink B. Weir M. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16766-16776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Oocytes were isolated from matureXenopus laevis females (Xenopus I, Blades) and injected with Kv1.1 or 1.2 cRNA, as described by Main et al.(25.Main M.J. Brown J. Brown S. Fraser N.J. Foord S.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). K+ currents were recorded after 72 h, using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp amplifier (TEC-03; NPI) as described previously (26.McIntosh P. Southan A.P. Akhtar S. Sidera C. Ushkaryov Y. Dolly J.O. Robertson B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 435: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) during voltage steps to +20 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. DTXk was applied by superfusion (at a rate of 5 ml/min), and its concentration increased cumulatively. Addition of tetraethylammonium chloride (0.1–100 mm) was made with substitution of NaCl to maintain ionic strength. A membrane fraction from the injected and noninjected oocytes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Channels were expressed in BHK cells and analyzed in the native state by gel filtration, or by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (10.Shamotienko O. Akhtar S. Sidera C. Meunier F.A. Ink B. Weir M. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16766-16776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Saturable binding of 125I-labeled αDTX and DTXk to intact cells expressing the various constructs was measured in triplicate under established conditions (10.Shamotienko O. Akhtar S. Sidera C. Meunier F.A. Ink B. Weir M. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16766-16776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) by rapid filtration through GF/F glass microfiber filters that had been presoaked in 0.5% (v/v) polyethyleneimine. The radioactivity associated with the washed filters was quantified by γ-radiation counting; data presented (±S.E.) were analyzed using the Graph Pad software (Prism 3.0) based on a one-site model. α Subunit stoichiometries were predefined by linking their cDNAs in an open reading frame (Fig. 1), using a 16-amino acid sequence from 5′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene. In this way, the expressed Kv1.2–1.2 or Kv1.1–1.2 should assemble into the desired tetrameric proteins, Kv(1.2–1.2)2 and Kv(1.1–1.2)2, respectively, whereas the third construct would yield a channel consisting of one Kv1.1 subunit and three Kv1.2 subunits. Biochemical evidence was obtained for formation of the expected oligomers in oocytes, to validate the data subsequently obtained from electrophysiological analysis of the K+currents. Injection into oocytes of cRNAs for the pβutpA Kv1 constructs followed by Western blotting demonstrated that Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 cRNAs were translated into single subunits ofM r ∼60,000–64,000, whereas the dimers and tetramer gave proteins with M r ∼120,000 andM r 240,000, respectively (Fig. 2 A). A two-electrode voltage clamp was used to establish the effects of varying the ratio of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 in expressed tetramers. Because Kvβ2.1 has no appreciable effect on activation of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels (26.McIntosh P. Southan A.P. Akhtar S. Sidera C. Ushkaryov Y. Dolly J.O. Robertson B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 435: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it was omitted. Oocytes injected with equivalent amounts of cRNAs encoding each of the constructs yielded 1–10 μA K+ currents after 72 h, establishing that the expressed proteins were inserted into the plasmalemma as functional channels. Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.1–1.2, Kv1.2–1.2, and Kv1.1-(1.2)3 gave outward noninactivating K+ currents with characteristic voltage dependences (Fig. 2, B and C). Kv1.2 and Kv1.2–1.2 (homodimer) K+ currents exhibited a similar voltage dependence of activation (Table I) (threshold = −45 to −40 mV) and half-maximal activation voltage (V1/2 = −15.1 and −16.97 mV); the slope (k) values of 10.8 and 8.3, respectively, confirmed the near-identical activation kinetics. Therefore, the linker does not exert a significant influence. Kv1.1 elicited a fast-activating, slow-inactivating K+ current that had a more negative activation threshold (−60 to −50 mV) than Kv1.2 (Fig. 2, B and C) and V1/2 = −30.8 mV; these values for the homomeric channels are sufficiently different to allow them to be distinguished reliably. The heterodimer Kv1.1–1.2 cRNA yielded a current that had properties distinct from either parent (Fig. 2, B and C); interestingly, this showed a greater resemblance to Kv1.1 than Kv1.2 current (Table I), with an activation threshold between −55 and −50 mV and a V1/2 = −26.5 mV. Despite this, the Kv1.1–1.2 K+ current proved much less susceptible to blockade by external tetraethylammonium (IC50 = 100 mm) than Kv1.1 (IC50 < 1 mm). A delayed rectifying K+ current was observed with Kv1.1-(1.2)3 (Fig. 2 B), activating at a threshold of −55 to −50 mV (Table I); also, its V1/2 fell between that for the channels made from Kv1.1–1.2 and Kv1.2–1.2 or Kv1.2 constructs (Fig. 2 C; Table I), and had a slope similar to the other channels. Thus, Kv1.1 exerts a more dominant influence on K+ channel activation, with V1/2 shifting negatively upon increase in the number of Kv1.1 subunits; on the other hand, their slope factors (k), an indication of activation kinetics, are similar, as expected, because the slope values for the parents are close.Figure 2Analysis of molecular and electrophysiological properties of the different K+channels expressed in oocytes A, Xenopusoocytes were injected with the individual cRNAs (∼5 ng) and incubated at 16 °C for 48 h, and their crude membranes (lanes 1–3 and 6–8), along with synaptic membranes (lane 4), were subjected to SDS-PAGE (left panel, 9% gel; right panel, 6% gel). After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride, the membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) dried milk before overnight incubation with monoclonal anti-Kv1.2 (lanes 1–5; 1:1000 dilution) or rabbit polyclonal anti-Kv1.1 (lanes 6–8; ∼1 μg IgG/ml) and detection with the ECL system. Lane 1, Kv1.2–1.2; lane 2, Kv1.1–1.2; lane 3, Kv1.2; lane 6, Kv1.1–1.2;lane 7, Kv1.1; lane 8, Kv1.1-(1.2)3. Neither Kv1.2 (lane 5) nor Kv1.1 (data not shown) was detectable in the controls injected with water. B,K+ currents were recorded from oocytes 72 h after injection with cRNAs encoding Kv1.1 (I), Kv1.2 (II), Kv1.2–1.2 (III), Kv1.1–1.2 (IV), or Kv1.1-(1.2)3 (V). Voltage dependence of activation was measured by voltage pulses of 400 ms in duration, from a holding potential of −80 mV to +40 mV in 10-mV increments (VI).

Open table in a new tab To generate adequate amounts of the recombinant channels for biochemical analysis, pSFV1 Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.1–1.2, or Kv1.1-(1.2)3was expressed in BHK cells to generate four oligomers representing the majority of possible combinations of the most abundant subunits found in central neurons. The expression level was elevated by inclusion of Kvβ2.1, which promotes cell surface targeting; to obtain adequate quantities of the poorly expressed Kv(1.1)4 (10.Shamotienko O. Akhtar S. Sidera C. Meunier F.A. Ink B. Weir M. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16766-16776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the N-terminal part was replaced with an analogous moiety of Kv1.2 that regulates the efficiency of assembly (see “Introduction”). This construct gave increased surface expression in BHK cells (∼2-fold relative to the unmodified Kv1.1), yielding a subunit of the expectedM r ∼60,000–62,000 on immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A). The dimer was twice this size and was recognized by both anti-Kv1.1 and anti-Kv1.2 antibodies (Fig. 3, A−C), confirming the presence of both α subunits. Kv1.1-(1.2)3 construct gave a protein of the expected molecular weight (240,000) that was also reactive with anti-Kv1.1 and anti-Kv1.2 antibodies (Fig. 3, B andC). Thus, the dimer and tetramer cRNAs were correctly and fully translated, without any detectable proteolytic breakdown products; importantly, the channels were correctly assembled and inserted into the plasmalemma and functional (Table II; detailed later). Direct evidence for the formation of α/β subunit oligomers was provided by the oligomeric sizes of the channels extracted from BHK cells in nondenaturing detergent obtained from gel filtration on Superose 6HR (Fig. 3 D); the similar elution position for the monomer, dimer, and tetramer expressed with Kvβ2.1 gave an apparent molecular weight for the oligomer-detergent complex of ∼515,000 (Fig. 3 D, inset). Because this value is very similar to the size for Kv(1.2)4(β2.1)4 (10.Shamotienko O. Akhtar S. Sidera C. Meunier F.A. Ink B. Weir M. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16766-16776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it can be concluded that all the Kv1 constructs produced proteins that assembled into tetramers containing four α and four β subunits, as observed for neuronal K+ channel complexes (27.Parcej D.N.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11084-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Table IIBinding of 125I-DTXk or 125I-αDTX to various K+ channels co-expressed with Kvβ2.1 in BHK cells and the toxins' mutual antagonismConstruct (no. of Kv1.1 in the oligomers)K D (± S.E.)B max2-aBmax values for both radiolabeled toxins, for each construct, were calculated using the same batch of BHK cells.

Open table in a new tab BHK cells expressing Kv(1.2)4 proved unable to bind125I-DTXk (Table II); accordingly, the K+ current generated in oocytes was insensitive to blockade by 100 nm DTXk (Table I). In contrast, Kv(1.1)4 displayed high affinity for125I-DTXk (Fig. 4 A; Table II), consistent with its K+ current in oocytes being inhibited by low concentrations of DTXk (Table I). An avid interaction was reaffirmed for the latter channel by the K i values of DTXk competing for the binding of125I-DTXk (Fig. 4 G) and125I-αDTX (Fig. 4 I). Comparison of the binding of both toxins to Kv(1.1)4 showed that125I-αDTX displayed a 12-fold lower affinity than125I-DTXk (Table II). On the other hand,125I-αDTX exhibited a ∼5-fold higher affinity for Kv(1.2)4 than Kv(1.1)4 (Table II), in agreement with αDTX blocking Kv1.2 K+ current with greater potency than Kv1.1 or Kv1.6 (5.Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Decreasing the number of Kv1.1 subunits in oligomers from four to one caused minimal reduction in their affinity for 125I-DTXk; theK D values dropped only 2- and 3-fold, respectively, for Kv(1.1–1.2)2 and Kv1.1-(1.2)3 (Table II). Likewise, the modest changes in the K i values (Fig. 4 G) for DTXk antagonizing125I-DTXk binding to the latter oligomers relative to that for Kv(1.1)4 support the above deduction. These binding data were corroborated by the DTXksensitivities of the channels when expressed in oocytes; the IC50 values of the Kv(1.1–1.2)2 and Kv1.1-(1.2)3 K+ currents are only 2- and 9-fold lower than that for Kv(1.1)4 (Table I). Thus, based on both toxin binding and functional blockade, one copy of Kv1.1 is adequate to bestow near maximal affinity for DTXk and susceptibility to inhibition (see “Discussion”). Moreover, behavior of the channels in binding 125I-αDTX gave a similar trend with no major difference in theK D or K i values upon increasing the number of copies of Kv1.2 in the (α)4(β)4 multimers (Table II). Likewise, the similar K i values for αDTX antagonizing125I-DTXk binding to Kv(1.1–1.2)2and Kv1.1-(1.2)3 (Fig. 4 H) revealed that two Kv1.2 subunits are sufficient for binding αDTX with high affinity. Because αDTX has a lower affinity for Kv(1.1)4 than DTXk, it proved significantly less potent in antagonizing125I-DTXk binding, but this was increased substantially (14–34-fold) when Kv1.2 subunits were introduced to the channels (Fig. 4 H). As expected, DTXk was less effective in displacing 125I-αDTX from Kv1.2-containing multimers than Kv(1.1)4 (Fig. 4 I). Finally, it is noteworthy that not only can the two toxins discriminate channel subtypes, but the B max values for αDTX were 2–3-fold higher than for DTXk in the same batch of BHK cells (Table II; see “Discussion”). Kv1.1-, Kv1.2-, and Kvβ2.1-containing oligomers predominate in brain (13.Shamotienko O.G. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); Kv(1.2)4 is also present, but Kv1.1 always occurs in association with other members (14.Coleman S.K. Newcombe J.

Due to their abundance and functional importance (see “Introduction”), we profiled the characteristics of those with several different proportions of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 to encompass the subtypes found in neurons. All the linked Kv1 subunits were expressed in both amphibian and mammalian cells as single, intact proteins without premature translation or degradation products. Their functionality was documented by the K+ currents recorded after expression in oocytes, with characteristics matching those expected. When co-expressed with Kvβ2.1, each channel co-assembled into (α)4(β)4 complexes and was inserted correctly into the plasma membrane of BHK cells, as established from measurement of high affinity binding of DTXk and αDTX, which require α subunits to be assembled into tetramers (28.Tytgat J.

It has been suggested that the dissociation is not the immediate cause of termination but is preceded by catalytic inactivation of the elongation complex. In vitro reducing ionic strength can be used to stabilize very unstable and catalytically inactive complex at the point of termination; the previous biochemical characterization of this complex has led to important conclusions regarding termination mechanism.

At low ionic strength, the majority of elongation complexes fall apart upon reaching the terminator. Released RNA and DNA efficiently rebind RNA polymerase (RNAP) and form binary RNAP·RNA and RNAP·DNA complexes, which are indistinguishable from binary complexes obtained by direct mixing of the purified nucleic acids and the enzyme. A small fraction of elongation complexes that reach termination point escapes dissociation because RNA polymerase has backtracked from the terminator to an upstream DNA position. Thus, transcription elongation to a terminator site produces no termination intermediates that withstand dissociation in the time scale appropriate for biochemical studies.

Once formed on a promoter, EC can transcribe thousands of nucleotides and survive prolonged pausing and arrest within the transcribed genes (1.Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev.

The current view of EC structure, based on crystallographic and functional studies of eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and phage RNA polymerases, suggests that the enzyme holds the template with a clamp-like domain (3.Zhang G.

This interaction does not interfere with advancement of RNAP along the template but makes the complex resistant to high salt concentration and DNA competitors (3.Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L.

The minimal nucleic acid architecture that can support a stable bacterial EC and may allow the closure of the clamp around the DNA template, consists of 8–9 bp of an RNA:DNA hybrid at the 3′-end of the nascent RNA and a 9–12-bp DNA duplex located downstream from the hybrid (7.Nudler E.

Termination in Escherichia coli occurs at two classes of specific DNA signals; one depends on action of termination factor Rho, and another requires only cis-acting element in DNA. The latter terminators are called intrinsic, or Rho-independent transcription terminators, and they cause spontaneous dissociation of EC (2.von Hippel P.H. Science. 1998; 281: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Intrinsic terminators have a conserved structure consisting of a region of dyad symmetry followed by a stretch of 7–9 thymidine residues in nontemplate DNA strand (10.d'Aubenton Carafa Y. Brody E. Thermes C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 835-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Transcription through this sequence results in formation of a stable hairpin in the RNA 7–9 nt upstream from the termination point followed by a run of U residues (2.von Hippel P.H. Science. 1998; 281: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The mechanism of intrinsic termination has been studied for decades, and several models have been suggested to explain the disruption of ECs (for a review, see Ref. 11.Landick R. Science. 1999; 284: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). According to the established thermodynamic model, formation of the hairpin removes RNA from a putative single-strand RNA-binding site located on RNAP near the point where transcript branches from the RNA:DNA hybrid (12.Altmann C.R.

The model suggests that the hairpin formation also disrupts the 5′-proximal part of the RNA:DNA hybrid either directly, by displacing the RNA:DNA with the RNA:RNA pairing, or indirectly, by melting the hybrid in the region 3′ of the hairpin stem (2.von Hippel P.H. Science. 1998; 281: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 16.Wilson K.S. Conant C.R. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol.

These events, in combination with low stability of oligo(U):dA hybrid at the terminator, provoke EC dissociation (18.Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1097-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Another, recently reported model considers the hairpin formation behind RNAP as the driving force for physical extraction of the 3′-end of the nascent RNA from the RNAP active center accompanied by hypertranslocation of RNAP along the DNA and by collapse of the transcription bubble (19.Yarnell W.S. Roberts J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in RNAP, caused by allosteric contacts between the hairpin and the enzyme, were also suggested to trigger termination (20.Arndt K.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 79-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21.Toulokhonov I. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Science. 2001; 292: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition, direct destabilizing contacts between the termination hairpin and the protein clamp have been proposed, based on the results of protein/DNA and protein/RNA cross-linking experiments (15.Nudler E. Gusarov I. Avetissova E. Kozlov M. Goldfarb A. Science. 1998; 281: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Depending on biochemical tools that the researchers used, each model proposed a distinct sequence of events leading to termination. However, it is not clear yet whether these events constitute true steps in the termination mechanism. Dissecting the early steps in the termination pathway would be extremely helpful for the understanding of the detailed mechanism of termination. Several studies suggest that RNAP may stop at a terminator before it dissociates from the DNA and RNA. Indeed, RNA hairpins similar to those found in the terminators often induce pausing of transcription at 10–12 nt downstream from their stems (22.Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In the absence of hairpin, RNAP pauses at the end of 7–9-nt-long oligo(T) track (17.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 19.Yarnell W.S. Roberts J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, both the RNA hairpin and the oligo(T) track would be expected to cause pausing. Also, kinetic competition between dissociation and elongation at the termination point was shown to affect the efficiency of termination (23.McDowell J.C. Roberts J.W. Jin D.J. Gross C. Science. 1994; 266: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Single-molecule light microscopy studies further suggested that pausing of E. coliRNAP for about 1 min precedes dissociation at the intrinsic terminator (24.Yin H. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Gelles J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13124-13129Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The high rate of elongation and EC instability at the terminator hinder isolation and study of termination intermediates (17.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 20.Arndt K.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 79-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25.Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, the study of the termination mechanism was complicated by the absence of a characterized biochemical system to isolate catalytically inactive intermediates before they dissociate. Reduction of the ionic strength below physiological level has been used as a tool to “freeze” such intermediates (17.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 26.Fuller R.S. Platt T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4613-4623PubMed Google Scholar). The complexes that remained stable at terminator at low salt conditions were immobilized in solid phase on nickel-NTA-agarose through histidine-tagged RNAP and were biochemically characterized (17.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Footprinting analysis of this complex showed that the normally opened transcription bubble had closed. These findings suggested that the closure of the transcriptional bubble represented an initial step in the termination pathway that accompanies catalytic inactivation of EC prior to its dissociation. Other evidence argued that in low ionic strength conditions, transcription termination and transcript release occurred, but nonspecific rebinding of the dissociated nucleic acids to the enzyme formed separate binary RNAP·RNA and RNAP·DNA post-termination complexes (27.Berlin V. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1714-1719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immobilization through RNAP cannot separate ternary complexes from the binary adducts between the nucleic acids and the enzyme, imposing the problem of structural discrimination between a population of rebound complexes and an initial ternary intermediate in the termination process. Therefore, the conclusion that was made about the ternary nature of the termination complex rested heavily upon some assumptions that we believed needed to be fully verified. Here, we performed systematic analysis of the complexes formed between RNA, DNA, and E. coli RNAP in the course of termination in low salt conditions. To immobilize these complexes in solid phase, we utilized affinity tags introduced either to the protein or to the template DNA. We found no ternary termination complex. Instead, we found a small fraction of the polymerase in a ternary complex, which escaped dissociation by backtracking from the point of termination; all other polymerase complexes resulted from post-termination binding of the released template or transcript back to the enzyme. These findings are discussed in light of the current models of the mechanism of intrinsic transcription termination. The standard template for transcription was a 156-bp DNA fragment (DNA156) carrying the A1 promoter of bacteriophage T7 and the tR2 terminator of bacteriophage λ. It was a product of PCR amplification and was purified by PAGE. The template for transcription was 3′-biotinylated in the template DNA strand as follows. The PCR product contained a uniqueBamHI site 70 nt upstream from the +1-position of the T7A1 promoter. Following digestion with BamHI, the 3′-end was filled in by Klenow enzyme in the presence of 1 mm dGTP, dCTP, TTP, and 100 μm biotinylated dATP (Sigma) for 15 min at 25 °C. The biotinylated DNA156 was purified by phenol extraction, precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in transcription buffer (TB40 (numerical index indicates concentration of KCl in the buffer expressed in mm); 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and used for EC11 formation in solution as described below. E. coli RNAP bearing a hexahistidine tag genetically fused to the carboxyl terminus of the β′ subunit was purified as described (28.Kashlev M. Nudler E. Severinov K. Borukhov S. Komissarova N. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) from extracts of the RL916 strain (obtained from Dr. R. Landick). Stable EC stalled at position +11 (EC11) was obtained by preincubating 2 pmol of the template with 2 pmol of the enzyme (unless indicated otherwise) in regular TB40 for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequently adding 10 μm trinucleotide RNA primer ApUpC and 20 μm rATP and rGTP for 5 min at 25 °C. The EC11 was next immobilized either on Ni2+-NTA-agarose or on sreptavidin-agarose beads (see below). 20 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen) prewashed in TB40 was added to EC11 formed in solution as described above. After a 5-min incubation at 25 °C the immobilized EC11 was repeatedly (five times) washed with TB40. Then EC11 was either chased with the four rNTPs (100 μm rATP, rCTP, rGTP, and 10 μm of UTP unless indicated otherwise) or walked to a desired position by repeated alterations of washing (four washing steps with 1 ml of TB40 each) and incubation with a subset of rNTPs (10 μm each) for 5 min at 25 °C. The KCl concentration was adjusted to 500 mmduring the walking (TB500) to suppress pausing and arrest of RNAP. The transcripts were labeled by the incorporation of an appropriate [α-32P]rNTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 40 μCi of the labeled rNTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 5 min at 25 °C)). The position of labeling was cytosine +12 unless stated otherwise. All reactions were stopped with an equal volume of gel loading buffer (50 mm EDTA, 10 m urea) unless indicated otherwise, and the products were separated on denaturing PAGE. 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose suspension (Sigma) were washed with TB40 and mixed with EC11 for 10 min at 25 °C with constant shaking. The DNA-immobilized complex was washed with 1 ml of TB40. All other manipulations were the same as described for transcription on Ni2+-NTA-agarose. Ten microliters of washed immobilized EC, containing either full-size or GreB-cleaved RNA, was incubated for 1 min (unless indicated otherwise) in TB containing 1 m KCl (TB1000). After 20 s of centrifugation (VWRbrand Mini Centrifuge; 6000 rpm, 2000 g), 5 μl of the supernatant was removed and combined with an equal volume of gel loading buffer (“S” fraction). The remaining pellet was washed with 1 ml of TB40, the volume of the sample was adjusted to 5 μl and combined with an equal volume of gel loading buffer (“Pw ” fraction). The “Total” fraction contained 10 μl of the nonfractionated immobilized EC combined with 10 μl of gel loading buffer. The DNA template for KMnO4 footprinting was labeled in 20 μl of immobilized EC11 with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP (7000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) for 10 min at 25 °C. After washing with TB40, the complex was used as starting material for the chase or walking reaction. The32P end-labeled complexes were treated with 1 mm KMnO4 at 25 °C for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. The complexes were eluted from Ni2+-NTA-agarose with 50 mm EDTA, the DNA in the supernatants was precipitated in the presence of 4 μg of the carrier plasmid DNA, cleaved with 10% piperidine for 15 min at 90 °C, reprecipitated, lyophilized, dissolved in gel loading buffer, and separated on 6% denaturing PAGE. GreB protein was purified as described (29.Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction was performed in 10 μl of TB40 with 0.5 μg of GreB for 10 min at 25 °C. 0.5 pmol of RNAP core were immobilized on 3 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads and washed with TB40, and the volume was adjusted to 90 μl. In a separate tube, EC11 was obtained as described above, labeled in both the RNA and the DNA, and then chased with four rNTPs in TB1000 for 10 min. The total volume of the reaction was 40 μl. Following fractionation, 10 μl of the supernatant that contained labeled RNA64–65 (termination products of 64 and 65 nt long), RNA86 (run-off product), and DNA156 were combined with 90 μl of preimmobilized RNAP, making the final KCl concentration 140 mm. After 5 min of incubation at 25 °C with intense shaking, the mixture was washed with TB40. GreB cleavage and RNA extension were then performed as described above. To study potential intermediates formed in the course of transcription termination, we used a synthetic template carrying the well studied Rho-independent tR2 terminator of bacteriophage λ (14.Wilson K.S. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8793-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,17.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 19.Yarnell W.S. Roberts J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 25.Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It was cloned downstream from the A1 promoter from bacteriophage T7 (Fig. 1A). The hexahistidine-tagged RNAP, which can be bound to Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads, was used in transcription reactions (28.Kashlev M. Nudler E. Severinov K. Borukhov S. Komissarova N. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30.Kashlev M. Martin E. Polyakov A. Severinov K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). By immobilizing RNAP on beads, the enzyme can be walked in steps along the template by adding subsets of rNTPs alternated with washing of the beads. It also allowed the isolation of the polymerase from the DNA and RNA dissociated during termination and therefore could provide a way to isolate in the solid phase putative termination intermediates that retained stability. This approach has been exploited before for the study of the termination mechanism (17.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 25.Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31.Uptain S.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13548-13553Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 1 B, RNA-labeled Ni2+-NTA-immobilized EC11 (the numerical index indicates the RNA length) was obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The RNA in the complex was labeled by incorporation of [α-32P]rCTP to form EC12 followed by the chase to tR2 terminator with all four rNTPs. Concentration of KCl in the reaction was below physiological level (40 mm) to increase the lifetime of potential termination complex(es). Transcription in TB40 resulted in two RNA products of termination, the major one 64 nt long and the minor one 65 nt long (RNA64–65), and in run-off RNA 86 nt long (RNA86). To analyze dissociation of the complexes at the terminator, an aliquot of the chase reaction mixture was centrifuged, half of the supernatant was removed (lane 3), and the pellet was washed with TB40 (lane 2, Pw fraction). About 60% of the terminator-specific RNA64–65 was released, and 40% remained associated with RNAP. The RNAP that reached the end of the template (run-off complex) also was associated with the RNA (RNA86, lanes 2 and3). Stability of the RNA64–65 or RNA86 complexes with RNAP was much lower than that of the normal ECs (20.Arndt K.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 79-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14699-14704Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These RNAs were released after only 1 min of incubation in 1 mKCl (TB1000) (lane 4) except for a small (∼10%) fraction of the RNA64–65 that remained bound to RNAP even after the wash with TB1000. We address the origin of this minor fraction below. To test whether DNA was also bound to RNAP after termination, we obtained EC12 with the labeled RNA and labeled template (Fig. 1 C) and then chased it with the four rNTPs in TB40. About 10% of the labeled DNA was released into the supernatant (lanes 2 and 3). After a subsequent wash with TB1000, only 20–30% of the labeled template remained bound to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose with the RNAP (see Fig. 2 B, bottom panel, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, more DNA than RNA64–65 was bound to polymerase in both high and low salt conditions. Greater retention of the DNA compared with RNA64–65 is most likely explained by a fraction of the stable ternary complexes becoming permanently arrested on the DNA template before reaching the terminator and the presence of the ternary complex containing the run-off RNA86, which has not dissociated in low salt (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). We shall define the fraction of EC64–65, which was retained on the beads after washing with TB40, as termination complex isolated on Ni2+-NTA agarose (TC/Ni). Next, we analyzed the structure of a transcriptional bubble in TC/Ni using potassium permanganate (KMnO4) footprinting, which detects unpaired thymidine residues in DNA (17.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 33.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15329-15338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Because of the very low stability of TC/Ni, it was crucial to test whether the complex would withstand the standard footprinting conditions (1 mmKMnO4 for 5 min (17.Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 33.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar)). Under these conditions, EC57, a regular EC, which was used as a control, was stable (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). TC/Ni remained intact in TB40 (lanes 5 and6), but it released most of the RNA after 5 min following incubation with 1 mm KMnO4 in TB40 (lanes 7 and 8). The half-life of TC/Ni in these conditions (1 mm KMnO4) was less than 2–3 min (data not shown); therefore, more than 80% of the complex would dissociate under standard footprinting conditions. Dissociation of TC/Ni would lead to significant attenuation of the signal from the unpaired thymidines relative to that of regular stable ECs. However, after 1 min of incubation with 1 mmKMnO4, TC/Ni remained intact (lanes 9and 10). We chose this condition to probe for the transcriptional bubble. Fig. 2 B shows KMnO4 footprint of the nontemplate DNA strand in TC/Ni and in a series of ECs halted in the vicinity of the termination site. As expected, in EC46 the bubble was located at a position corresponding to the 3′-end of the RNA (lane 2). Elongation of the RNA to 57 nt was accompanied by forward progression of the bubble (lane 3). Extension of the RNA by another 5 nt (to form EC62) halts RNAP after the fifth nucleotide of the oligo(T) stretch of the tR2 terminator. In this position, RNAP becomes arrested and slides backwards along the DNA and the RNA (33.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15329-15338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), causing rearrangement of the bubble and its retreat to the more upstream position (lane 4). The arrest of EC62 is reversible (data not shown), and the RNAP with the DNA bubble returns infrequently to the original location at the 3′-end of the RNA. Thus, the two bubble positions overlap in EC64, creating the impression of the unusually large size of the DNA opening in this complex. Lane 5 demonstrates the crucial result of this experiment. Although the amount of TC/Ni withdrawn for the footprinting reaction was the same as the amount of the other complexes (Fig. 2 B, top panel), no DNA bubble was detected in the complex as revealed by the resistance of thymidines in TC/Ni to KMnO4 (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). Lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 2 B show that washing with 1 m KCl removed most of the RNA from TC/Ni, but the small fraction that remained generated the same footprint as the total TC/Ni. As we demonstrate below, this footprint originated from the minor salt-resistant fraction of ternary termination complexes described above (see also Fig. 1 B,lane 4). Thus, apart from this minor fraction, there was no transcription bubble detected in the majority of the DNA located in TC/Ni. Normally, the DNA duplex is melted inside the RNAP ternary complex (33.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15329-15338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it is extremely unusual if the TC/Ni represents a ternary complex that lacks the bubble. Previous studies had shown that low salt could stimulate formation of binary RNAP·RNA and RNAP·DNA complexes resulting from reassociation of RNAP with the nucleic acids released in the course of termination (27.Berlin V. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1714-1719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we pe"

However, its role in immediate early gene activation is unclear. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which Vav1 can regulate c-fos serum response element transcriptional activity. We show that T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation induces the phosphorylation of serum response factor (SRF) on serine 103 and increases the binding of SRF complexes on serum response element in a MEK- and p38-dependent pathway. The physiological relevance of our findings is supported by the inhibition of the interleukin-2 gene transcriptional activity by a dominant negative SRF mutant. Overexpression of Vav1, which partially mimics TCR stimulation, promotes SRF-dependent transcription, and dominant negative Vav1 mutants block SRF activation by TCR. SRF activation by Vav1 occurs through a signaling cascade consisting of Rac1/Cdc42 and the serine/threonine kinases Pak1 and MEK, but independently of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Interestingly, Vav2 also enhances SRF through Rho GTPases, suggesting that Vav proteins are general regulators of SRF activation in lymphocytes.

Within minutes of antigenic stimulation, a complex network of signal transducers enhances the transient transcription of early genes, which in turn regulate a second phase of nuclear events essential for T cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, effector function, and cytokine release (1Lin J. Weiss A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 243-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Glimcher L.H. Singh H. Cell. 1999; 96: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Among these early genes, c-fos plays a critical role in diverse physiological processes, including lymphocyte activation. In particular, the binding of Fos and Jun proteins to AP-1 sites is essential for the transcription of several lymphokines and other gene products regulating the immune response (3Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Mitogen-induced c-fos transcription depends essentially on the cis-acting serum response element (SRE)1 on its promoter because mutation of the SRE sequence impairs c-fos induction by diverse signals. SRE is also important for the transcriptional induction of other early genes like egr-1. Two transcription factors, the serum response factor (SRF) and the ternary complex factor (TCF), bind to the SRE and promote the transcription of the c-fos promoter and other SRE-regulated genes (4Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). SRF is ubiquitously expressed and binds as a dimer to the CarG box of the SRE sequence (5Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). SRF is composed of a DNA binding and dimerization domain, and of a C-terminal trans-activation domain necessary for the integration of the upstream signals (6Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). SRF contains several phosphorylation sites, including serine 103, known to affect the interaction of SRF with its DNA recognition sequence (7Janknecht R. Hipskind R.A. Houthaeve T. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This serine 103 has been shown to be phosphorylated by pp90rsk, MAPKAP-K2 (MK2), and CaM kinases II and IV (8Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol.

The TCF is composed of transcription factors of the Ets family, including Elk-1 (11Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G. Reddy E.S. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). TCF binds to a purine-rich sequence (CAGGAT) adjacent to the SRE on the c-fos promoter and associates with the SRF (12Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of TCF proteins is induced after phosphorylation by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family activated by mitogenic and stress signals (6Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). However, depending on the cell type, some mitogens activate a TCF-independent pathway targeting SRF via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) (14Poser S. Impey S. Trinh K. Xia Z. Storm D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4955-4966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or via the Rho family of GTPases (15Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) represent a critical link between antigen receptor-coupled protein-tyrosine kinases and the signaling pathways controlled by the Rho family of GTPases (16Altman A. Deckert M. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 1-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 18DeFranco A.L. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 482-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Vav GEFs are highly homologous proteins composed of a catalytic Dbl homologous (DH) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, one Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and two SH3 domains. Although Vav1 is mostly restricted to hematopoietic cells (19Collins T.L. Deckert M. Altman A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 221-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), Vav2 and Vav3 display a much broader tissue expression (20Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar, 21Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell.

Vav proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated through the stimulation of diverse receptors, including the epidermal and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors, integrins, and B and T cell antigen receptors (BCRs and TCRs) (17Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The recruitment of Vav1 into large molecular scaffolds regulates several cell processes, such as activation of the MAPK pathway and gene activation. For example, Vav1 was involved in NFAT (23Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), NF-κB (25Costello P.S. Walters A.E. Mee P.J. Turner M. Reynolds L.F. Prisco A. Sarner N. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3035-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and AP-1 activation (26Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One effector of Vav proteins could be the Ste-20-related p21-associated kinase 1 (Pak1), which is activated by GTP-bound Rac1 or Cdc42 (27Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, Pak1 activation is involved in TCR-mediated actin polymerization (28Bubeck Wardenburg J. Bu R. Pappu J.Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the activation of p38MAPK (29Salojin K.V. Zhang J. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 844-853PubMed Google Scholar), and NFAT (30Yablonski D. Kane L.P. Qian D. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5647-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, a trimolecular complex composed of the adapters SLP-76 and Nck, and Vav1, has been implicated in the activation of Pak1 following TCR stimulation (28Bubeck Wardenburg J. Bu R. Pappu J.Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Pak1 could be an important element of the signaling pathways controlled by Vav proteins. Vav proteins appear to act as central components, which can integrate extracellular signals to activate multiple pathways leading to gene transcription in lymphocytes. Recently, we showed that Vav1 and Vav2 activates c-fos SRE upon TCR stimulation (31Tartare-Deckert S. Monthouel M.N. Charvet C. Foucault I. Van Obberghen E. Bernard A. Altman A. Deckert M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20849-20857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, how Vav proteins regulate SRE-dependent transcription in lymphocytes remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that Vav1 couples TCR stimulation to SRF-dependent transcription via a MEK-dependent pathway. TCR stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of SRF on serine 103 and increases binding of SRF complexes to SRE. Overexpression of Vav1, which partially mimics TCR stimulation, promotes c-fos SRE transcriptional activity through SRF activation. SRF activation can occur through a signaling cascade consisting of Rac1/Cdc42-Pak1-MEK, but independently of the PI-3K pathway. The physiological relevance of our findings is supported by the inhibition of the IL-2 gene transcriptional activity by a dominant negative SRF mutant. Interestingly, Vav2 also enhances SRF activity via the Rho GTPases family. This report establishes the Vav family proteins as a direct link between TCR and SRF-dependent transcription.

Poser and have been described elsewhere (14Poser S. Impey S. Trinh K. Xia Z. Storm D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4955-4966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB luciferase reporter was from M. Karin. GAL4-Elk-1 and 5×GAL4-luciferase plasmids were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Jurkat T cells (clone JE6.1), and simian virus 40 T antigen-transfected human leukemic Jurkat T cells (Jurkat-TAg) were from ATCC and G. Crabtree (Stanford, CA), respectively. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 1× minimal essential medium nonessential amino acid solution, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin G and streptomycin. Cells in a logarithmic growth phase were transfected with the indicated plasmids by electroporation as described previously (24Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated for 5 min with anti-CD3 mAb (5 μg/ml), washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed at 1 × 108 cells/ml in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Cleared lysates were directly resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting or incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Pellets were then washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Eluted samples from immunoprecipitations or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Reactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Pak1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of 10 × 106 cells using anti-Pak1 antibodies bound to protein G beads. The immune complexes were washed two times with ice-cold lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Beads were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of MBP (Sigma), and reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions proceeded 20 min at 30 °C and were stopped by addition of sample buffer for electrophoresis. Reactive proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. Gels containing radioactive proteins were dried and exposed for 4 h at −80 °C. For luciferase assays, transfected Jurkat cells (5 × 105 cells) were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb as described in the legend to each figure. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase was assayed using the Promega luciferase assay system and a luminometer (Lumat, EG&G Berthold). Luciferase activity was determined in triplicate and expressed as -fold increase relative to the basal activity seen in unstimulated mock-transfected cells. For monitoring Elk-1 activation, Jurkat cells were co-transfected with GAL4BD:Elk-1 and 5×GAL4-luciferase in the presence or not of indicated expression plasmids. pEF/β-galactosidase was included as an internal transfection control to normalize luciferase reporter activity. For the β-galactosidase assay, 20 μl of the supernatants were incubated at 37 °C in 150 μl of assay buffer containing 60 mm Na2HCO, 80 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 μg ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, until a yellow color developed. Absorbance was measured at 400 nm in a spectrophotometer. EMSAs were performed as described before (34Bertolotto C. Ricci J.E. Luciano F. Mari B. Chambard J.C. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12941-12947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells (4 × 106) were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb (5 μg/ml) for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in Hepes buffer containing 350 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA. Double-stranded synthetic SRE sequence (5′-GGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT-3′) was [γ-32P]ATP-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences). Ten μg of cellular proteins were preincubated in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 4% glycerol, 80 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 15 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) for 10 min on ice. Then, 30,000–50,000 cpm of γ-32P-labeled probe were added to the binding reaction for 20 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added during preincubation. For supershift assays, 1 μl of anti-SRF or anti-Elk-1 antibodies were added to cellular extracts in the binding reaction buffer and incubated for 10 min on ice. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels (37.5/1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 0.5× TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 3 h at 150 V. Gels containing radioactive SRE probe complexed with proteins were then dried and exposed for 4 h at −80 °C. SRF can be activated by several mitogenic stimuli and plays a critical role in the transcription of the SRE-regulated gene c-fos, a critical component of the AP-1 complex. Although SRF is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells (35Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Masutani H. Lipinski M. Harel-Bellan A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), its activation by lymphocyte antigen receptors has not been studied so far. To understand the regulation of SRF in T cells, we analyzed the phosphorylation of SRF upon TCR stimulation. Jurkat cells were stimulated for indicated times with an anti-CD3 antibody. After immunoprecipitation with SRF-specific antibodies, phosphorylation of endogenous SRF was assayed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the phosphorylated form of SRF at serine 103. SRF phosphorylation increased after 30 s to 5 min of TCR ligation and decreased after 15 and 30 min (Fig. 1A, upper panel). As a control, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin stimulation also resulted in the phosphorylation of SRF on serine 103. Equal expression of endogenous SRF in the immunoprecipitates was observed by immunoblotting with SRF-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A, lower panel). To investigate whether TCR stimulation regulates binding of SRF complexes to SRE, we used the c-fos SRE sequence as a probe in band shift assays. Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells formed two complexes with the radiolabeled SRE. The major complex (I) was formed by homodimeric SRF bound to the SRE motif. SRF is also able to form a ternary complex with transcription factors of the TCF family, such as Elk-1 (complex II) (11Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G. Reddy E.S. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 12Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Binding of the SRF complexes to the SRE increased after 5 min of TCR ligation (Fig. 1B, comparelane 1 with lane 2) and decreased after 15–30 min (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and4). Specificity of the complexes was assessed by competition with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled SRE probe. To confirm the presence of SRF and to identify the Ets family member in these TCR-generated SRF complexes, we preincubated nuclear extracts from activated Jurkat cells with anti-SRF or anti-Elk-1 antibodies. Fig. 1C shows that anti-Elk-1 antibody displaced complex II to complex III (lanes 3 and 4), whereas anti-SRF displaced both complexes I and II (lanes 5 and 6). This result indicates that complexes I and II contain the SRF protein, whereas Elk-1 is present only in complex II. To confirm the role of SRF in TCR-induced SRE-dependent transcription, Jurkat cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter driven by the c-fos SRE either wild type or with deletion of the Ets binding site (SREΔEts) or of the SRF binding site (SREΔSRF). Although TCR stimulation increased SRE and SREΔEts in a similar manner (2-fold increase over the basal activity), no SRE activation was observed following TCR stimulation in the absence of the SRF binding site (Fig. 2A). Next, Jurkat cells were transfected with the SRF reporter construct, in combination with a dominant negative HA-tagged SRF mutant deleted at the transcriptional activation domain (SRF 1–338). SRF mutant blocked both basal- and TCR-induced SRF activity (Fig. 2B). Similarly, TCR-induced IL-2 promoter activity was blocked by SRF mutant (Fig. 2C). As a control, SRF mutant did not affect TCR-induced Elk-1 transactivation (Fig. 2D). Overexpression of SRF mutant was assayed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2, B–D, insets). Taken together, these results show that SRF activation by TCR is required to promote c-fos SRE activation and IL-2 gene transcriptional regulation in lymphocytes. The MAPK pathway regulates SRE-dependent transcription by phosphorylating Elk-1 but also SRF via the activation of upstream kinases. To examine the role of MAPK pathway on SRE activation by TCR, Jurkat cells transfected with SRF reporter construct were incubated with different amounts of the MEK inhibitor U0126 or the p38 inhibitor SB203580, and stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody. Although U0126 rapidly decreased SRF activation by TCR, SB203580 slowly decreased it (Fig. 3A,upper panel). As a control, TCR-induced ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylations were specifically inhibited by U0126 and SB203580, respectively (Fig. 3A, lower panel). To test whether MEK and p38 were implicated in the phosphorylation and in the binding of SRF complexes to SRE, Jurkat cells were incubated with U0126 or SB203580 and stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody. After SRF immunoprecipitation, SRF phosphorylation was assayed with antibodies against serine 103. TCR-induced SRF phosphorylation on serine 103 returned to basal level in the presence of U0126 and SB203580 (Fig. 3B, upper panels). Next, nuclear extracts of treated cells, as described above, were incubated with the c-fos SRE probe for a band shift assay. Binding of SRF complexes to the SRE following TCR ligation decreased in the presence of U0126 and SB203580 (Fig.3B, lower panel). Finally, Jurkat cells transfected with a c-fos promoter reporter or a SRE reporter were incubated with the indicated concentrations of U0126 then stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody. TCR-stimulated c-fospromoter activation and SRE activation were both blocked in a similar way by U0126 (Fig. 3C). TCR-induced transcription of the endogenous c-fos gene also depended on MEK signaling as visualized by reverse transcription-PCR analysis (data not shown). These results show that both MEK/ERK and p38 pathways are required for SRF-dependent transcription induced following TCR engagement. Vav1 activates the MEK/ERK pathway in T cells (25Costello P.S. Walters A.E. Mee P.J. Turner M. Reynolds L.F. Prisco A. Sarner N. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but its role in early gene activation is unclear. Therefore, we examined how Vav1 regulates SRE activity. First, Jurkat cells were transfected with Vav1 along with SRE, SREΔEts, or SREΔSRF reporter constructs followed by anti-CD3 stimulation. As shown in Fig.4A, overexpression of Vav1 increased both basal and TCR-induced SRE stimulation (6- and 11-fold increase, respectively). These increases were weaker in the absence of the Ets binding site but were still notable (4- and 6-fold increase, respectively). Consistent with Fig. 2A, SREΔSRF activation by Vav1 was abrogated. Vav1 overexpression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4A, inset). Jurkat cells overexpressing dominant negative Vav1 mutants (DH-mutated (L213A), or SH2-mutated (R695L)) exhibited a strong reduction of SRF activity, whereas PH-deleted (ΔPH) Vav1 had no significant effect (Fig.4B). As controls, TCR-induced SRE, c-fospromoter, and IL-2 promoter activations were also inhibited by dominant negative Vav1 mutants (Fig. 4, C, D, andE, respectively). Proper expression of each transfected protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4, B andE, insets). Second, to assess whether MEK could be involved in SRF activation by Vav1, Jurkat cells transfected with Vav1 and the SRF reporter were incubated with indicated concentrations of U0126 (Fig. 5A). U0126 inhibited SRF activation by Vav1 up to 70%. To confirm the role of MEK in SRF activation by TCR, Jurkat cells were transfected with a constitutively active form of MEK (CA-MEK) and SRF reporter construct and activated with an anti-CD3 antibody. Fig. 5B shows that CA-MEK strongly increased SRF activation by TCR. As a control, the well characterized MEK-activated transcription factor Elk-1 was also activated by overexpression of CA-MEK (Fig. 5C). Finally, Fig. 5D shows that overexpression of SRF mutant, SRF 1–338, blocked both TCR- and Vav1-induced SRF activation. Proper expression of each transfected protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig.5D, inset). These results show that Vav1 can promote SRF-dependent transcription by targeting SRF proteins via a MEK-dependent pathway.Figure 5Vav1 activates SRF via a MEK-dependent pathway. A, Jurkat-TAg cells transfected with empty vector or Myc-tagged Vav1 (5 μg) along with a SRF luciferase reporter (10 μg) were cultured for 24 h, preincubated with indicated concentrations of U0126 for 2 h, and lysed for luciferase assay. Lysates were analyzed for the expression of Vav1 by immunoblotting with anti-Myc mAb. Jurkat-TAg cells were transfected with empty vector or CA-MEK (10 μg each) along with SRF luciferase reporter (10 μg) (B) or Gal4BD:Elk-1 (2 μg) and 5×GAL4-luciferase (5 μg) (C), and cultured for 24 and 36 h, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2015747275,"To identify critical tumor suppressor loci that are associated with the development of medulloblastoma, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide allelotype analysis in a series of 12 medulloblastomas. Non-random allelic imbalances were identified on chromosomes 7q (58.3%), 8p (66.7%), 16q (58.3%), 17p (58.3%) and 17q (66.7%). Comparative genomic hybridization analysis confirmed that allelic imbalances on 8p, 16q and 17p were due to loss of genetic materials. Finer deletion mapping in an expanded series of 23 medulloblastomas localized the common deletion region on 8p to an interval of 18.14 cM on 8p22–23.2. We then searched within the region of loss on 8p for loci that might contain homozygous deletion using comparative duplex PCR. An overlapping homozygous deletion region was identified in a 1.8 cM interval on 8p22–23.1, between markers D8S520 and D8S1130, in two medulloblastomas. This region of homozygous deletion also encompasses the 1.4 cM minimal deletion region detected on 8p in ductal carcinoma in situ of breast. In conclusion, we reported for the first time a detailed deletion mapping on 8p in medulloblastoma and have identified a region of homozygous deletion on 8p22–23.1 that is likely to contain a critical tumor suppressor gene involved in the development of medulloblastoma."

Homogenates of uteroplacental tissue were incubated with immobilized recombinant galectin-3, and specifically bound proteins were eluted using lactose. The principal protein, p400, had an Mr of 400,000 in SDS-PAGE.

Unexpectedly, cubilin was found only in perforin-containing granules of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, although galectin-3 occurred throughout the cell cytoplasm.

Isolation of several membrane or matrix counterreceptors by affinity chromatography has revealed that galectins are linked to a variety of important processes including neoplastic transformation, cell adhesion, tumor invasiveness and metastasis, cellular proliferation, and localized immunomodulation (see Ref. 1Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). gal-3 and its mRNA are expressed in trophoblast cells of placenta as well as in the granular uNK cells of the metrial gland and decidualized endometrium of the murine implantation site (2Knisley K.A. Weitlauf H.M. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 97: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 3Phillips B. Knisley K. Weitlauf K.D. Dorsett J. Lee V. Weitlauf H.M. Biol.

Reprod. 1998; 58: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). That finding, along with the additional observation that gal-3 is absent from nondecidualized endometrium between implantation sites and is not present in uteri of nonpregnant females (3Phillips B. Knisley K. Weitlauf K.D. Dorsett J. Lee V. Weitlauf H.M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that this lectin has a pregnancy-related function at the maternal-fetal interface. Although a role for gal-3 at the maternal-fetal interface is not yet known, it may contribute in some fashion to cell adhesion, proliferation, or immunomodulation, all of which occur in other contexts. Therefore, to gain more insight into a role for this lectin at the maternal-fetal interface, we isolated and characterized a counterreceptor for gal-3 from tissues of the murine utero-placental complex that was identified as cubilin. This large protein is produced by epithelial cells of the kidney, small intestine, and yolk sac, and it can function as coreceptor for endocytosis of many important biological molecules in these tissues. Consequently, given the proximity of yolk sac to the maternal-fetal interface, the association of cubilin with gal-3 is especially intriguing, as is its association with the granules of uNK cells in the context of cell adhesion, proliferation, or immunomodulation.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that a monomeric protein, p400, ∼400 kDa, can be isolated from homogenates of murine uteroplacental complex by affinity chromatography with immobilized rgal-3. Peptide fragments of p400 have amino acid sequences similar to those in cubilin of other species. Although the complete amino acid sequence of murine cubilin is unknown, its sequence has been deduced from full-length cDNA clones of several other species (rat, AAC 71661; human, AAC 82612; and dog, AAF 14258). Also, p400 is similar in size to cubilin, which is a 460-kDa peripheral membrane protein with 13% of its mass accounted for by carbohydrate. Like cubilin, p400 is heavily glycosylated and has intramolecular disulfide bonds. Finally, p400 is found only in the yolk sac, kidney, and small intestine, and thus its tissue distribution is identical to that of cubilin (12Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H.

Consequently, we conclude that p400 is the mouse ortholog of cubilin.Cubilin has eight N-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domains followed by 27 “CUB” domains (12Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R.

CUB domains are predicted to result from a barrel-like structure with two layers of five-stranded β-sheets, stabilized by two disulfides from four conserved cysteines, and with β-turns in a surface-exposed position, similar to antigen binding regions of IgG (13Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). CUB domains 5–8 are the binding site for intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex, and domains 13 and 14 bind the “receptor-associated protein,” a chaperone-like protein that protects multiple ligand binding sites of processed low density lipoprotein receptor family proteins (15Kristiansen M.

The importance of cubilin in the yolk sac has become clear with a demonstration that it was the antigenic target of “teratogenic antibodies” in previous studies (16Sahali D. Mulliez N. Chatelet F.

In this earlier work, it was found that antibodies raised against yolk sac or kidney and administered to pregnant rats (27Brent R.I. Beckman D.A. Jensen M. Koszalka T.R. Teratology. 1990; 41: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or anti-p400 against mouse cubilin administered to pregnant mice2 during the period of organogenesis resulted in severe fetal abnormalities and death. Although the mechanism responsible for the pathological effect of the antibodies is unknown, they localized in yolk sac epithelium, possibly inhibiting the endocytic apparatus in those cells (25Le Panse S. Ayani E. Mulliez N. Chatelet F. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Galceran M. Citadelle D. Roux C. Ronco P. Verroust P. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1526-1536PubMed Google Scholar, 26Seetharam B. Christensen E.I.

Since rodent yolk sac is the major portal for maternal-fetal exchange prior to development of chorioallantoic circulation (28Jollie W.P. Teratology. 1990; 41: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), it is presumed that disruption of transport of nutrients, such as maternal serum proteins, vitamin B12, and cholesterol-containing lipoproteins, during the critical phase of organogenesis could be involved (12Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol.

Probing sections of the implantation site with anti-gal-3 and with antisense gal-3 cRNA confirmed earlier observations of its expression in trophoblast cells, decidualized endometrial cells, and uNK cells throughout the course of pregnancy (4Lee V.H. Lee A.B. Phillips E.B. Roberts J.K. Weitlauf H.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although neither the gal-3 protein nor its mRNA were detected in yolk sac epithelium before day 12, both were present in increasing amounts throughout the last week of pregnancy, and thus it is possible that during that time cubilin and gal-3 do interact in this region. The prospect of a mechanism by which gal-3 might alter the cubilin-dependent uptake of specific ligands by yolk sac during the last week of pregnancy is potentially very important. However, that interesting question remains to be answered by future experiments.The observation that cubilin accumulates in perforin-positive granules of the uNK cells was completely unexpected. These cells, considered to be a subset of NK lymphocytes, accumulate in large numbers in the decidua basalis and the metrial gland of the rodent implantation site (30Croy B.A. Luross J.A. Guimond M-J. Hunt J.S. Nat. Immunol. 1996; 15: 22-33Google Scholar, 31Head J.R. Nat. Immunol. 1996; 15: 7-21Google Scholar). Their cytoplasmic granules contain perforin and granzyme, typical of cytolytic lymphocytes (32Parr E.L. Young L.H.Y. Parr M.B. Young J.D-E. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2365-2372PubMed Google Scholar). However, compared with peripheral NK cells, uNK cells are notoriously poor killers of YAC cell targets in vitro, especially after recovery from the uterus in the latter half of pregnancy (33Gambel P. Croy B.A. Moore W.D. Hunziker R.D. Wegmann T.G. Rossant J. Cell. Immunol. 1985; 93: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). While the uNK cells are more potent when stimulated with interleukin-2 (34Croy B.A. Reed N. Malashenko B-A. Kim K. Kwon B.S. Cell. Immunol. 1991; 133: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), normally they do not mount a damaging immune reaction against the semiallogeneic products of conception. Although the importance of uNK cells to pregnancy seems to be that they influence developing placental vasculature by production of proteases, matrix, or biologically active factors (30Croy B.A. Luross J.A. Guimond M-J. Hunt J.S. Nat. Immunol. 1996; 15: 22-33Google Scholar, 35Croy B.A. Guilbert L.J. Browne M.A. Gough N.M. Stinchcomb D.T. Reed N. Wegmann T.G. J. Reprod.

Sci. 1999; 61: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the question of why they do not mount an effective immune response against placenta or extraembryonic membranes may be just as important to our ultimate understanding of the biology of the implantation site.Since the lytic granules of NK cells are dual function organelles, which combine the function of secretory and prelysosomal compartments (37Burkhardt J.K. Hester S. Lapham C.K. Argon A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2327-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the finding of immunoreactive cubilin in the cytoplasmic granules of uNK cells raises several interesting questions. First, what is the source of cubilin in uNK cells? Since its mRNA was not detected in these cells, the gene appears not to be transcribed. Although adjacent yolk sac is a likely source, the observation that it is present in uNK cells in artificially induced deciduomata, which are not associated with the developing yolk sac, is compatible with cubilin also being taken up from the systemic circulation. Additionally important and interesting questions include the following. What is the mechanism of cubilin uptake by the uNK cells? Once cubilin is in uNK cells, what is its vectoring pathway to the granules? What is the final molecular form of immunoreactive cubilin in the granules? What is the nature of its association with perforin or granzyme in the granules? What is the function of cubilin in uNK granules? Finally, what are the details of the relationship of gal-3 to cubilin within uNK cells; i.e.does gal-3 facilitate a cubilin function or vice versa? Cubilin uptake by uNK cells might be of major significance if it reflects some mechanism for sampling or processing fetal antigens or for altering immune function by modifying the ability of granules to lyse potential targets.The original objective of this work, to isolate a binding partner for gal-3 in the uteroplacental complex as a step toward elucidating the role of that lectin in pregnancy, was achieved with the identification of cubilin. The finding that it co-localized with the lectin in yolk sac epithelium in the last week of pregnancy is intriguing and may suggest the existence of unappreciated mechanisms governing maternal-fetal exchanges. The additional finding that cubilin accumulates in uNK cells may also have far reaching implications for the localized modulation of the immune system that occurs at the implantation site. These observations provide important new directions for research of the maternal-fetal interface. Galectin-3 (gal-3)1 is one of at least 10 members of a lectin family, which share a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain and which exert their varied biological effects through interaction with complementary β-galactoside ligands of glycoprotein or glycolipid “counterreceptors.” Since galectins are divalent and are able to form multivalent aggregates, they can cross-link counterreceptors, effecting cell-cell, cell-matrix, or matrix-matrix interactions, thus possibly initiating signal transduction. Isolation of several membrane or matrix counterreceptors by affinity chromatography has revealed that galectins are linked to a variety of important processes including neoplastic transformation, cell adhesion, tumor invasiveness and metastasis, cellular proliferation, and localized immunomodulation (see Ref. 1Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). gal-3 and its mRNA are expressed in trophoblast cells of placenta as well as in the granular uNK cells of the metrial gland and decidualized endometrium of the murine implantation site (2Knisley K.A. Weitlauf H.M. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 97: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 3Phillips B. Knisley K. Weitlauf K.D. Dorsett J. Lee V. Weitlauf H.M. Biol.

Reprod. 1998; 58: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). That finding, along with the additional observation that gal-3 is absent from nondecidualized endometrium between implantation sites and is not present in uteri of nonpregnant females (3Phillips B. Knisley K. Weitlauf K.D. Dorsett J. Lee V. Weitlauf H.M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that this lectin has a pregnancy-related function at the maternal-fetal interface. Although a role for gal-3 at the maternal-fetal interface is not yet known, it may contribute in some fashion to cell adhesion, proliferation, or immunomodulation, all of which occur in other contexts. Therefore, to gain more insight into a role for this lectin at the maternal-fetal interface, we isolated and characterized a counterreceptor for gal-3 from tissues of the murine utero-placental complex that was identified as cubilin. This large protein is produced by epithelial cells of the kidney, small intestine, and yolk sac, and it can function as coreceptor for endocytosis of many important biological molecules in these tissues. Consequently, given the proximity of yolk sac to the maternal-fetal interface, the association of cubilin with gal-3 is especially intriguing, as is its association with the granules of uNK cells in the context of cell adhesion, proliferation, or immunomodulation. DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that a monomeric protein, p400, ∼400 kDa, can be isolated from homogenates of murine uteroplacental complex by affinity chromatography with immobilized rgal-3. Peptide fragments of p400 have amino acid sequences similar to those in cubilin of other species. Although the complete amino acid sequence of murine cubilin is unknown, its sequence has been deduced from full-length cDNA clones of several other species (rat, AAC 71661; human, AAC 82612; and dog, AAF 14258). Also, p400 is similar in size to cubilin, which is a 460-kDa peripheral membrane protein with 13% of its mass accounted for by carbohydrate. Like cubilin, p400 is heavily glycosylated and has intramolecular disulfide bonds. Finally, p400 is found only in the yolk sac, kidney, and small intestine, and thus its tissue distribution is identical to that of cubilin (12Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H.

Consequently, we conclude that p400 is the mouse ortholog of cubilin.Cubilin has eight N-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domains followed by 27 “CUB” domains (12Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol.

CUB domains are predicted to result from a barrel-like structure with two layers of five-stranded β-sheets, stabilized by two disulfides from four conserved cysteines, and with β-turns in a surface-exposed position, similar to antigen binding regions of IgG (13Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). CUB domains 5–8 are the binding site for intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex, and domains 13 and 14 bind the “receptor-associated protein,” a chaperone-like protein that protects multiple ligand binding sites of processed low density lipoprotein receptor family proteins (15Kristiansen M.

The importance of cubilin in the yolk sac has become clear with a demonstration that it was the antigenic target of “teratogenic antibodies” in previous studies (16Sahali D. Mulliez N. Chatelet F.

https://openalex.org/W2025699166,"The T domain of diphtheria toxin undergoes a low pH-induced conformational change that allows it to penetrate cell membranes. T domain hydrophobic helices 8 and 9 can adopt two conformations, one close to the membrane surface (P state) and a second in which they apparently form a transmembrane hairpin (TM state). We have now studied T domain helices 5-7, a second cluster of hydrophobic helices, using Cys-scanning mutagenesis. After fluorescently labeling a series of Cys residues, penetration into a non-polar environment, accessibility to externally added antibodies, and relative depth in the bilayer were monitored. It was found that helices 5-7 insert shallowly in the P state and deeply in the TM state. Thus, the conformational changes in helices 5-7 are both similar and somehow linked to those in helices 8 and 9. The boundaries of deeply inserting sequences were also identified. One deeply inserted segment was found to span residues 270 to 290, which overlaps helix 5, and a second spanned residues 300 to 320, which includes most of helix 6 and all of helix 7. This indicates that helices 6 and 7 form a continuous hydrophobic segment despite their separation by a Pro-containing kink. Additionally, it is found that in the TM state some residues in the hydrophilic loop between helices 5 and 6 become more highly exposed than they are in the P state. Their exposure to external solution in the TM state indicates that helices 5-7 do not form a stable transmembrane hairpin. However, helix 5 and/or helices 6 plus 7 could form transmembrane structures that are in equilibrium with non-transmembrane states, or be kinetically prevented from forming a transmembrane structure. How helices 5-7 might influence the mechanism by which the T domain aids translocation of the diphtheria toxin A chain across membranes is discussed."

Chromosomal replicases of all cellular organisms studied thus far are composed of three components, the DNA polymerase, a ring-shaped DNA sliding clamp, and a clamp loader that uses ATP to assemble the sliding clamp onto DNA (1.Kuriyan J.

In bacteria, the sliding clamp is a homodimer called β (4.Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The ring-shaped β dimer completely encircles DNA and slides along the duplex (5.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β clamp also binds the DNA polymerase III, thereby tethering it to DNA for high processivity (5.Stukenberg P.T.

Most knowledge of bacterial DNA polymerase III (pol III) structure and function has been obtained from studies of theEscherichia coli replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (reviewed in Ref. 6.Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Therefore, a brief overview of its structure and function is instructive for the comparisons to be made in this report. In E. coli, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase III is the α subunit (129.9 kDa) encoded by dnaE; it lacks a proofreading exonuclease (7.Maki H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proofreading 3′–5′-exonuclease activity is contained in the ε (27.5 kDa) subunit (dnaQ) that forms a 1:1 complex with α (8.Scheuermann R.H. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 81: 7747-7751Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9.Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pol III α−ε complex is found tightly associated to a third subunit, called θ, to form the heterotrimeric E. coli DNA polymerase III core (10.McHenry C.S. Crow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1748-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The θ subunit (holE, 8.6 kDa) is not essential for growth and is generally not conserved in bacteria (11.Slater S.C. Lifsics M.R. O'Donnell M. Maurer R. J.

Chem. 1982; 257: 5692-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, after the β clamp has been assembled onto a primed site, the efficiency of the pol III α subunit is greatly stimulated, and α·β extends the primer at a rate of ∼300 nucleotides/s with a processivity of 1–3 kb (9.Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pol III αε complex and pol III core subassembly are even further stimulated by β and extend DNA at a rate of about 1 kb/s with a processivity that exceeds the entire 7.2-kb M13mp18 ssDNA template (9.Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli clamp loader of pol III consists of five different subunits, γ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ, but only three of them, γ (dnaX, 47.5 kDa), δ (holA, 38.7 kDa), and δ′(holB, 36.9 kDa), are essential for clamp loading activity in vitro (13.Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homologues to E. coli χ(holC, 16.6 kDa) and ψ (holD, 15.2 kDa) subunits can only be identified in a few other organisms so far. The γ and δ′ subunits are homologous to one another and are members of the AAA+ family of proteins (14.Dong Z. Onrust R. Skangalis M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Mechanistic studies have outlined the overall mechanism of the clamp loader and are consistent with the structural analysis. The γ subunit is the only subunit that interacts with ATP and therefore is the motor of the clamp loader (20.Onrust R. Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 3713-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 30.Blinkowa A.L. Walker J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31.Tsuchihashi Z.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17790-17795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). τ (71.1 kDa) is the full-length product of dnaX, whereas γ is shorter (47.5 kDa), being truncated by a translational frameshift. τ can fully replace γ in the clamp loader, and the τ3δδ′ complex is active in clamp loading (13.Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal sequences unique to τ are required for interaction with the pol III α subunit (32.Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also with the replicative DnaB helicase (33.Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J.

Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, within the holoenzyme, τ subunits must replace two (or all three) of the γ subunits in order to connect the two pol III core polymerases in the holoenzyme structure for simultaneous replication of both leading and lagging strands (60.O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have undertaken the study of other bacterial replication systems in an effort to delineate those features of prokaryotic replicases that are general to all bacteria. Study of the Gram-negative Thermus thermophilus dnaX gene showed that it produces both γ and τ, like E. coli dnaX (35.Yurieva O. Skangalis M. Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 272: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, instead of a −1 ribosomal frameshift, T. thermophilus employs a transcriptional slippage mechanism that results in both −1 and −2 frameshifts (35.Yurieva O. Skangalis M. Kuriyan J.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28971-28983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This study showed that only one protein is produced from the S. pyogenes dnaX gene. This full-length τ protein (62.1 kDa) is intermediate in length between E. coli γ (47.5 kDa) and τ (71.1 kDa) but retains the capacity to bind the DNA polymerase, like E. coli τ. However, the strength of this interaction is weaker than in the E. coli system. Like other Gram-positive bacteria, the S. pyogenes DNA polymerase, pol C (∼165 kDa), contains an inherent 3′–5′-exonuclease activity instead of delegating this proofreading action to a separate ε subunit as observed in the E. coli system (39.Barnes M.H. Brown N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As inE. coli, the S. pyogenes, τ, δ, and δ′ subunits are required to load β onto DNA, and the clamp endows pol C with the same rapid speed and processivity as the entire E. coli DNA pol III holoenzyme (38.Bruck I. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28971-28983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note thatS. pyogenes also contains a second homologue to E. coli α, which we refer to as the DnaE polymerase (38.Bruck I. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28971-28983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DnaE polymerase is similar in size to E. coli α (120 kDa) and like E. coli α it lacks 3′–5′-exonuclease activity (38.Bruck I. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28971-28983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The processivity of S. pyogenes DnaE polymerase is stimulated by τδδ′ and β, but its intrinsic speed (60 nucleotides/s) is unaltered (38.Bruck I. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28971-28983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This report examines the pol III replication machinery of the extreme thermophile, A. aeolicus. By using the known genome sequence (41.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), we identify A. aeolicus replicase genes and produce and isolate recombinant α, ε, β, τ, δ′, δ, subunits and SSB. We then compare and contrast the function and assembly of these replicase subunits from a thermophile to the Gram-negative E. coli replicase and to our previous studies on the Gram-positiveS. pyogenes replicase. Radioactive nucleotides were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; unlabeled nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences and The Upjohn Co. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. M13mp18 ssDNA was purified from phage that was isolated by two successive bandings in cesium chloride gradients as described (42.Turner J. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzmol. 1994; 262: 442-449Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). M13mp18 ssDNA was primed with a DNA 30-mer (map position 6817–6846) as described (9.Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pET protein expression vectors and BL21 (λDE3) protein expression strain of E. coli were purchased from Novagen. DNA modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs. A. aeolicus genomic DNA and A. aeolicuscells were a gift of Dr. Robert Huber and Dr. Karl Stetter (Regensburg University, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined using Protein Stain (Bio-Rad) and BSA as a standard. Polyclonal antisera was produced by rabbits injected with purified E. coli γ or α (5.Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies directed to A. aeolicus τ were purified from antisera by transfer of E. coli τ from an SDS gel to nitrocellulose followed by incubation with antisera and elution of purified antibody from the nitrocellulose membrane. TheA. aeolicus dnaE gene (41.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) was amplified from A. aeolicus genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers. The upstream 37-mer (5′-GTGTGTCATATGAGTAAGGATTTCGTCCACCTTCACC-3′) contains anNdeI site (underlined); the downstream 34-mer (5′-GTGTGTGGATCCGGGGACTACTCGGAAGTAAGGG-3′) contains aBamHI site (underlined). The PCR product was digested withNdeI and BamHI, purified, and ligated into the pET24 NdeI and BamHI sites to produce pETAadnaE. The pETAadnaE plasmid was transformed into the BL21 (λDE3) strain ofE. coli. Cells were grown in 50 liters of LB containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin, 5 mm MgSO4 at 37 °C toA 600 = 2.0, induced with 2 mmIPTG for 20 h at 20 °C, and then collected by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 400 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 1 m NaCl, 30 mm spermidine, 5 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA. The following procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by passing them twice through a French press (15,000 pounds/square inch) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. In this protein preparation, as well as each of those that follow, the induced A. aeolicus protein was easily discernible as a large band in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Hence, column fractions were assayed for the presence of the A. aeolicusprotein by SDS-PAGE analysis, which forms the basis for pooling column fractions. The clarified cell lysate was heated to 65 °C for 30 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a GSA rotor for 1 h. The supernatant (1.4 g, 280 ml) was dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)), 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT) overnight, and then diluted to 320 ml with buffer A to a conductivity equal to 100 mmNaCl. The dialysate was applied to a 150-ml fast flow Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A, and eluted with a 1.5-liter linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer A. Eighty fractions were collected. Fractions 38–58 (1 g, 390 ml) were pooled, dialyzed versus buffer A overnight, and applied to a 250-ml heparin-agarose column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. Protein was eluted with a 1-liter linear 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A. One hundred fractions were collected. Fractions 69–79 (320 mg in 200 ml) were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The α preparation was aliquoted and stored frozen at −80 °C. The Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the final α preparation is shown in Fig. 1. The A. aeolicus dnaQ was identified in the genome sequence as a 202-residue protein of 17,132 Da having significant homology to E. coli dnaQ (41.Deckert G. Warren P.V. Gaasterland T. Young W.G. Lenox A.L. Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Snead M.A. Keller M. Aujay M. Huber R. Feldman R.A. Short J.M. Olsen G.J. Swanson R.V. Nature. 1998; 392: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). A. aeolicus dnaQ was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers. The upstream 35-mer (5′-GTGTGTCATATGCGAGACAATCTCCTTGATGGCAG-3′) contains an NdeI site (underlined), and the downstream 44-mer (5′-GTGTGGATCCTCAAAACTTACCCTTTTCCAGCCTTTTTAAGGAG-3′) contains a BamHI site (underlined). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified, and ligated into the pET24a vector to produce pETAadnaQ. The pETAadnaQ plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(λDE3). A single colony was used to inoculate 12 liters of LB media supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.5 at which point 0.5 mm IPTG was added. After a 3-h induction, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 1 m NaCl, 30 mm spermidine, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French press (15,000 pounds/square inch) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (1038 mg) was incubated in a 65 °C waterbath for 30 min. The solution was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant (426 mg) was dialyzed against buffer A and loaded onto a 15-ml fast flow Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in buffer A; 80 fractions were collected. Peak fractions (fractions 36–44, 12.9 mg) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and then loaded onto a 10-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 mm to 1m NaCl; 80 fractions were collected. Peak fractions (fractions 60–70) were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The A. aeolicus holA gene was not identified previously by the genome sequencing project. We identified A. aeolicus holA by searching the A. aeolicus genome with the amino acid sequence of the E. coli δ subunit (encoded by holA). Although the resulting match had too low a score to be confident of its assignment as δ, the studies of this report prove that the gene truly encodes δ subunit of the replicase. TheA. aeolicus holA gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers. The upstream 36-mer (5′-GTGTGTCATATGGAAACCACAATATTCCAGTTCCAG-3′) contains anNdeI site (underlined); the downstream 39-mer (5′-GTGTGTGGATCCTTATCCACCATGAGAAGTATTTTTCAC-3′) contains a BamHI site (underlined). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified, and ligated into the pET24 NdeI and BamHI sites to produce pETAaholA. The pETAaholA plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (λDE3). Cells were grown in 50 liters of LB media containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C toA 600 = 2.0, then induced for 20 h upon addition of 2 mm IPTG, and collected by centrifugation. Cells from 25 liters of culture were lysed as described above for purification of α. The cell lysate was heated to 65 °C for 30 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant (650 mg, 240 ml) was dialyzed against buffer A, adjusted to a conductivity equal to 160 mm NaCl by addition of 40 ml of buffer A, and applied to a 220-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with 1.0 liters linear gradient of 150–700 mm NaCl in buffer A. One hundred and four fractions were collected. Fractions 45–56 were pooled (250 mg, 210 ml), diluted with 230 ml buffer A to a conductivity equal to 230 mm NaCl, and then loaded onto a 100-ml fast flow Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 150–750 mm NaCl in buffer A; 73 fractions were collected. Fractions 16–38 were pooled (95 mg, 40 ml), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The A. aeolicus holB gene was identified by Blast search using the E. coli δ′ sequence as a query. TheA. aeolicus holB gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers. The upstream 41-mer (5′-GTGTGTCATATGGAAAAAGTTTTTTTTGGAAAAAACTCCAG-3′) contains an NdeI site (underlined); the downstream 35-mer (5′-GTGTGTGGATCCTTAATCCGCCTGAACGGCTAACG-3′) contains aBamHI site (underlined). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified, and ligated into the pET24 NdeI and BamHI site to produce pETAaholB. The pETAaholB plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (λDE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 50 liters of media containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin to A 600 = 2.0 and then induced for 3 h upon addition of 2 mm IPTG. Cells were collected by centrifugation and were lysed using lysozyme by the heat lysis procedure. The cell lysate was heated to 65 °C for 30 min, and precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant (2.4 g, 400 ml) was dialyzed versus buffer A and then applied to a 220-ml fast flow Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A. Protein was eluted with a 1-liter linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer A; 80 fractions were collected. Fractions 23–30 were pooled and diluted 2-fold with buffer A to a conductivity equal to 100 mm NaCl and then loaded onto a 200-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated in buffer A. Protein was eluted with a 1-liter linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in buffer A; 84 fractions were collected. Fractions 46–66 were pooled (1.3 g, 395 ml), dialyzed versus buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl, then aliquoted, and stored frozen at −80 °C. The A. aeolicus dnaX gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using the following primers. The upstream 41-mer (5′-GTGTGTCATATGAACTACGTTCCCTTCGCGAGAAAGTACAG-3′) contains an NdeI site (underlined); the downstream 36-mer (5′-GTGTGTGGATCCTTAAAACAGCCTCGTCCCGCTGGA-3′) contains a BamHI site (underlined). The PCR product was digested withNdeI and BamHI, purified, and ligated into the pET24 NdeI and BamHI sites to produce pETAadnaX. The pETAadnaX plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (λDE3). Cells were grown in 50 liters of LB containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.6 and then induced for 20 h at 20 °C upon addition of IPTG to 2 mm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed as described for purification of α. The clarified cell lysate was heated to 65 °C for 30 min, and the protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant (1.1 g in 340 ml) was treated with 0.228 g/ml ammonium sulfate followed by centrifugation. The τ subunit remained in the pellet which was dissolved in buffer B (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) and dialyzed versusbuffer B to a conductivity equal to 87 mm NaCl. The dialysate (1073 mg, 570 ml) was applied to a 200-ml fast flow Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A. The column was eluted with a 1.5-liter linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer A; 80 fractions were collected.

Selective deletion of the functional domains of prosaposin indicates that the D domain and the carboxyl-terminal region are necessary for its transport to the lysosomes. Inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis, such as fumonisin B1 (FB1) and tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthate potassium salt (D609), also interfere with the trafficking of prosaposin to lysosomes. In this study, we examine sphingomyelin as a direct candidate for the trafficking of prosaposin. Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells overexpressing prosaposin or an albumin/prosaposin construct were incubated with these inhibitors, treated with sphingolipids, and then immunostained. Sphingomyelin restored the immunostaining in lysosomes in both FB1- and D609-treated cells and ceramide reestablished the immunostaining in FB1-treated cells only.d-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), which inhibits glycosphingolipids, had no effect on the immunostaining pattern. To determine whether sphingomyelin has the same effect on the transport of endogenous prosaposin, testicular explants were treated with FB1 and D609. Sphingomyelin restored prosaposin immunogold labeling in the lysosomes of FB1- and D609-treated Sertoli cells, whereas ceramide restored the label in FB1 treatment only. Albumin linked to the D and COOH-terminal domains of prosaposin was used as a dominant negative competitor. The construct blocked the targeting of prosaposin and induced accumulation of membrane in the lysosomes, demonstrating that the construct uses the same transport pathway as endogenous prosaposin. In conclusion, our results showed that sphingomyelin, the D domain, and its adjacent COOH-terminal region play a crucial role in the transport of prosaposin to lysosomes.

Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 283: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and when subcellular Golgi fractions from culture cells are permeabilized with a mild detergent, prosaposin remains associated to the Golgi membrane even after competition with free M6P (10.Igdoura S.A. Rasky A. Morales C.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 283: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Prosaposin (65–70 kDa) is a glycoprotein produced in high concentration in the testis, spleen, and brain. The 65- and 70-kDa isomers are encoded by the same gene and arise from post-translational modifications of the same protein (11.Morales C.R. El-Alfy M. Zhao Q. Igdoura S.A.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 65-kDa protein is targeted to the lysosome, whereas the 70-kDa isomer is secreted to the extracellular space (11.Morales C.R. El-Alfy M. Zhao Q. Igdoura S.A.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Prosaposin contains four functional domains, A, B, C, and D (12.Hiraiwa M. Martin B.M. Kishimoto Y. Conner G.E. Tsuji S. O'Brien J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the lysosome, prosaposin is proteolytically cleaved into four 10–15-kDa heat-stable polypeptides termed saposins A, B, C, and D (13.O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Saposins promote the degradation of sphingolipids by specific lysosomal hydrolases (14.Ho M.-W. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2810-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Saposins A and C act in synergy to stimulate the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide by activating β-glucosylceramidase and β-galactosylceramidase (15.Kleinschmidt T. Christomanou M. Braunitzer G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,16.Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Deficiency of saposin C causes a variant form of Gaucher's disease, characterized by mental retardation and distinguished by the accumulation of lipids in the liver and spleen (17.Christomanou H. Aignesberg A. Linke R.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Saposin B activates arylsulfatase A, α-galactosidase, and β-galactosidase (18.Gartner S. Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Deficiency of saposin B causes a variant form of the lysosomal storage disorder metachromatic leukodystrophy (20.Stevens R.L. Fluharty A.L. Kihara H. Kaback M.M. Shapiro L.J. Marsh B. Sandhoff K. Fischer G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1981; 33: 255-265Google Scholar). Although saposin D has no known metabolic function, its amino acid sequence along with the adjacent COOH-terminal region is the most conserved region of the molecule. Because of this evolutionary conservation, it was hypothesized that this region of the protein is involved in the sorting and transport of prosaposin to the lysosome (21.Lefrancois S. Michaud L. Potier M. Igdoura S. Morales C.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1593-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, some inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis impair the transport of prosaposin to the lysosomes (21.Lefrancois S. Michaud L. Potier M. Igdoura S. Morales C.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1593-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fumonisin B1, which blocks the production of dihydroceramide in the synthetic pathway of sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids (22.Schwartz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) causes a decrease of prosaposin immunoreactivity in the lysosomes of CHO cells transfected with a human prosaposin cDNA. Tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthate potassium salt (D609), which specifically inhibits the synthesis of sphingomyelin by blocking sphingomyelin synthase (23.Luberto C. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), abolished the prosaposin immunoreactivity in the lysosomes of these cells. On the other hand,d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), which selectively blocks the production of gangliosides by inhibiting the synthesis of glucosylceramide (22.Schwartz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), displayed a similar lysosomal immunoreactivity to the untreated control cells (21.Lefrancois S. Michaud L. Potier M. Igdoura S. Morales C.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1593-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that unlike glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin may play a role in the transport of prosaposin to the lysosomes. Recent evidence indicates that rafts may govern lipid-protein interactions and concentrate components of membrane docking and fusion and play an important role in vesicular transport. Rafts are viewed as dynamic assemblies of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in the exoplasmic leaflet of cellular bilayer membranes (24.Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). However, the evidence for the role of sphingomyelin in this process was indirect and based on the use of sphingolipid inhibitors. Recent evidence demonstrated that the COOH-terminal region of prosaposin was necessary but not sufficient for the transport of prosaposin to the lysosomes (25.Zhao Q. Morales C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24829-24839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Chimeric constructs containing the COOH-terminal region of prosaposin linked to albumin could not be found in the lysosomes. Conversely, constructs containing the prosaposin D domain (SAP-D) plus the COOH-terminal region rerouted albumin from the secretory pathway to the lysosomes (25.Zhao Q. Morales C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24829-24839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on these results it was proposed that the COOH-terminal domain might interact with a targeting protein other than the M6P receptor after a conditional interaction between the prosaposin D domain and sphingomyelin present in the Golgi membrane. Thus, the first objective of this study was to determine the effect of supplemented sphingomyelin in the transport of prosaposin to the lysosomes of sphingomyelin-depleted cells. The second objective of this study was to investigate whether or not albumin-prosaposin chimeric constructs use the same lysosomal pathway as endogenous prosaposin. To this effect cultured cells transfected with the chimeric constructs were treated with sphingolipid inhibitors and supplemented with sphingolipid precursors. The third objective was to investigate the staining pattern and the resulting morphology of lysosomes in cultured cells transfected with a dominant negative competitor that interfere with the transport of prosaposin to the lysosomal compartment. (CHO) cells transfected with a stable expression vector containing a human prosaposin cDNA (21.Lefrancois S. Michaud L. Potier M. Igdoura S. Morales C.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1593-1603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated in Coon's F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 0.1% methotrexate (Sigma) for 72 h. The cells were then trypsinized and resuspended in methotrexate-supplemented media at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/ml. 2.5 ml of the cell rich medium was added to six wells containing three coverslips each. Six plates were prepared and incubated overnight at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cells were harvested, then plated (5 × 105/100 ml) in NuSerum-supplemented medium overnight in preparation for a transient transfection. The cells were transfected with a wild-type prosaposin construct or an albumin/Sap-D/COOH (Alb-D-COOH) construct as described by Zhao and Morales (25.Zhao Q. Morales C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24829-24839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using a DEAE-dextran/chloroquine phosphate protocol and then plated using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics overnight. The medium was removed from the dishes, and the cells were washed with PBS for 1 min. The CHO and COS-7 cells received fumonisin B1 (FB1) (25 μg/ml), PDMP (25 μg/ml), or D609 (100 μg/ml)-supplemented medium (Biomol ResearchLaboratories, Inc., PA). Fresh medium was added to other plates to serve as negative controls. The plates were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. CHO and COS-7 cells received treatment with either ceramide, dihydroceramide, or sphingomyelin (Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., PA) at a final concentration of 5 μm. One set of plates received no lipids. The plates were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. In the case of the CHO cells, separate plates were also incubated for 12 and 48 h. Incubation at 48 h was of interest because the turnover time of sphingomyelinin vitro at 37 °C is 25–26 h. The cells were washed 3 times in PBS and, in the case of the COS-7 cells, also incubated in 60 nm LysoTracker (Molecular Probes Inc. Eugene, OR) for 30 min. The cells were then fixed on coverslips with 3.8% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and then rinsed twice with PBS and treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked with 100 μl of 10% goat serum for 1 h followed by 100 μl of α-prosaposin antibody for the CHO cells or 100 μl of α-Myc antibody for the COS-7 cells diluted 1:200 in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The α-prosaposin antibody was generated in our laboratory against the amino terminus and the functional domains A-B of prosaposin. The characterization and specificity of this antibody was discussed in a previous paper (25.Zhao Q. Morales C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24829-24839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Conversely, a second group of CHO cells treated with the same conditions were incubated with 100 μl of α-cathepsin B antibody (a generous gift from Dr. John S. Mort, Shriner's Hospital, Montreal, Canada) diluted 1:200 in PBS. The cells were then washed in 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) 3 times for 5 min each. The appropriate FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) was diluted 1:200, and 100 μl of the antibody solution was placed on each coverslip for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed with 0.05% Tween 20 three times for 5 min each followed by a rinse with distilled water. The coverslips were mounted face down on microscope slides with 90% Mowiol (Calbiochem) in PBS to be viewed on a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The slides were stored in a light proof black box. Three mice were anesthetized using Somnotol (MTC Pharmaceutical Inc.), and their testis were removed under sterile conditions. The tunica albuginea was removed and the seminiferous tubules cut into 2-mm pieces and placed in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics overnight at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were plated on 100-mm plates and transfected as described above. Some plates did not receive inhibitors or exogenous lipids and were used for the dominant negative experiment. 10 ml of media supplemented with FB1, PDMP, or D609 were added to the plates at the same concentration as above and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. 10 ml of fresh medium was added to a control plate of seminiferous tubules. Cultured seminiferous tubules treated or not with the sphingolipid inhibitors received either ceramide or sphingomyelin at a concentration of 5 μm. One set of plates received no lipids. The pieces of seminiferous tubules or COS-7 cells were fixed for 1 h using 5% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 1 m sodium buffer. The cells were then placed in agarose for structural support and dehydrated with the pieces of the seminiferous tubules in ascending concentrations of cold ethanol and embedded in Lowicryl KllM. Ultrathin sections were cut and placed on Formvar-coated nickel grids. 40-μl drops of 10% goat serum were placed on a rubber mat within a Petri dish, and the grids were incubated on the drops tissue-side down for 15 min. The grids were then placed on drops of α-prosaposin antibody diluted 1:20 in TBS at a concentration of 50 μg/μl (seminiferous tubules) or α-Myc (1:10) antibodies (COS-7 cells) and incubated for 1 h. Four washes of 5 min each with 0.1% Tween 20 were followed by a second 15-min incubation with goat serum. The grids were then incubated on secondary α-rabbit antibody conjugated to 15-nm gold diluted 1:100 at a concentration of 0.185 μg/μl (seminiferous tubules) or α-rabbit conjugated to 15-nm gold and α-mouse conjugated to 10 nm gold (COS-7 cells). Four 5-min washes with 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and two washes in distilled water were followed by counterstaining with uranyl acetate for 2 min and lead citrate for 30 s. The grids were then viewed on a Philips 400 electron microscope. The COS-7 cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and fixed for 1 h with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. After embedding in 1% agarose, the cells were post-fixed with osmium ferrocyanide. Increasing concentrations of ethanol were used for subsequent dehydration. The cells were then embedded in Epon. Semithin sections were cut and mounted on 200 mesh copper grids. Staining of the grids was done with uranyl acetate for 5 min followed by lead citrate for 2 min. The grids were viewed on a Philips 400 electron microscope. Quantitative analysis was performed to determine the colloidal gold density of prosaposin labeling in lysosomes. Lysosomes were selected in a manner that included the following criteria; lysosomes had to be spherical, range from 0.2 to 0.4 μm in diameter, and have moderate electron density (10.Igdoura S.A. Rasky A. Morales C.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 283: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thirty lysosomes per condition were examined from three different grids that came from three mice. The 15-nm gold particles in each lysosome were counted, and the area of each lysosome was determined using a MOP-3 instrument (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The average lysosomal density was measured by dividing the number of gold particles by the lysosomal area. The mean density and the S.D. were calculated for each group, and the results were analyzed statistically using Student'st test. In a previous study sphingomyelin was singled out to conditionally interact with the D domain of prosaposin before its transport to the lysosomes. However, the evidence for the role of sphingomyelin in this process was based on the use of sphingolipid inhibitors. Thus, the first objective of the present investigation was to examine the direct effect of sphingomyelin and sphingomyelin precursors in the transport of prosaposin to the lysosomes using sphingomyelin-depleted cells. To determine whether the incubation of CHO cells with sphingomyelin, dihydroceramide, and ceramide alters or not the distribution of prosaposin to the lysosomes, CHO cells were incubated with these lipids for 12, 24, and 48 h and stained with α-prosaposin antibody. The immunostaining yielded a perinuclear Golgi-like staining and a granular reaction typical of lysosomes comparable with CHO cells that did not receive the lipid supplementation (21.Lefrancois S. Michaud L. Potier M. Igdoura S. Morales C.R. J.

CHO cells overexpressing prosaposin were treated with FB1 (25 μg/ml) (E–H) followed or not by a 24-h incubation with 5 μm ceramide (F), 5 μmdihydroceramide (G), or 5 μm sphingomyelin (H). The FB1-treated cells showed decreased immunostaining compared with CHO cells not treated with the inhibitor (E). The addition of exogenous ceramide, dihydroceramide, or sphingomyelin restored the immunostaining similar to the untreated control cells (A). CHO cells overexpressing prosaposin were treated with GSL synthesis inhibitor PDMP (25 μg/ml) (I–L) followed or not by a 24-h incubation with 5 μm ceramide (J), 5 μmdihydroceramide (K), or 5 μm sphingomyelin (L). All cells displayed a similar immunostaining pattern to untreated control cells (A). CHO cells overexpressing prosaposin were treated with D609 (100 μg/ml) (M–P) followed or not by a 24-h incubation with 5 μm ceramide (N), 5 μm dihydroceramide (O), or 5 μm sphingomyelin (P). The D609-treated cells showed a decreased immunostaining compared with CHO cells not treated with the inhibitor (M). Ceramide or dihydroceramide additions did not modify this low labeling pattern. In contrast, the addition of sphingomyelin restored the labeling pattern to one similar to the untreated control cells (A).

Incubation of FB1-treated cells with ceramide, dihydroceramide, or sphingomyelin for 12, 24, and 48 h increased the immunostaining pattern similar to that of the control cells (Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, panels F–H). FB1 blocks the synthesis of dihydroceramide but does not interfere with the conversion of exogenous dihydroceramide or ceramide to sphingomyelin. Hence, the addition of sphingomyelin or the restoration of the sphingomyelin pathway restituted the cytoplasmic staining in CHO cells. Compared with non-treated cells, D609 significantly decreased the cytoplasmic immunostaining with α-prosaposin antibody (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, panels M). The addition of ceramide or dihydroceramide for 24 h did not modify this weak staining (Figs. 3, N–P, and 4), whereas the addition of exogenous sphingomyelin for 24 h increased the staining to a level similar to that of the control cells (Fig. 2 A). D609 inhibits the conversion of ceramide to sphingomyelin. Therefore, exogenous ceramide and dihydroceramide cannot restore the sphingomyelin pathway due to the distal action of this inhibitor. When the cells were incubated with ceramide, dihydroceramide, and sphingomyelin for 12 h (Fig. 2, N–P), the immunostaining pattern of α-prosaposin was weak, indicating that exogenous sphingomyelin did not have sufficient time to function. When the cells were treated with D609 followed by a 48-h incubation with ceramide, dihydroceramide, and sphingomyelin, no labeling was detected with α-prosaposin antibody (Fig. 4, N–P). Incubation at 48 h was of interest because the turnover time of sphingomyelin in vitro at 37 °C is 25–26 h. Hence, at 48 h exogenous sphingomyelin should be degraded, explaining the lack of immunostaining found in these cells. The cells incubated with sphingolipid precursors, including sphingomyelin, for 48 h after FB1 treatment were labeled (Fig. 4, F–H). Although sphingomyelin may be broken down in these cells, they are capable of synthesizing sphingomyelin by using ceramide from catabolized sphingolipids due to the location of the FB1 blockage (Fig. 1). Incubation of CHO cells with PDMP that selectively blocks the production of glycosphingolipids but not of sphingomyelin (22.Schwartz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) yielded a similar immunostaining to the control cells (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, panels I–L). This suggests that the transport of prosaposin to the lysosomes did not require the presence of glycosphingolipids. The addition of ceramide, dihydroceramide, or sphingomyelin for 12, 24 and 48 h did not change the immunostaining of the cells reacted with α-prosaposin antibody.

E69Q/D70N/D71N recombinant (r)HCII, D72N/Y73F/D75N rHCII, and E69Q/D70N/D71N/D72N/Y73F/D75N rHCII were prepared to localize acidic residues important for thrombin inhibition. Interestingly, D72N/Y73F/D75N rHCII had significantly enhanced thrombin inhibition without glycosaminoglycan (4-fold greater) and with heparin (6-fold greater), showing maximal activity at 2 μg/ml heparin compared with wild-type recombinant HCII (wt-rHCII) with maximal activity at 20 μg/ml heparin. The other rHCII mutants had lesser-enhanced activities, but they all eluted from heparin-Sepharose at significantly higher ionic strengths compared with wt-rHCII. Neutralizing and reversing the charge of Asp72, Tyr-sulfate73, and Asp75 were done to characterize their individual contribution to HCII activity. Only Y73K rHCII and D75K rHCII have significantly increased heparin cofactor activity compared with wt-rHCII; however, all of the individual rHCII mutants required substantially less glycosaminoglycan at maximal inhibition than did wt-rHCII. Inhibition of either α-thrombin/hirugen or γT-thrombin (both with an altered anion-binding exosite-1) by the AR2 rHCII mutants was similar to wt-rHCII. D72N/Y73F/D75N rHCII and D75K rHCII were significantly more active than wt-rHCII in a plasma-based thrombin inhibition assay with glycosaminoglycans. These results indicate that improved thrombin inhibition in the AR2 HCII mutants is mediated by enhanced interactions between the acidic domain and anion-binding exosite-1 of thrombin and that AR2 may be a “molecular rheostat” to promote thrombin inhibition in the presence of glycosaminoglycans.

Although HCII is ∼30% identical in sequence to antithrombin and other serpins, it has a unique N-terminal extension of ∼80 residues that contains a tandem repeat of negatively charged acidic residues (9 Asp, 5 Glu, and 2 Tyr-sulfate) (25Blinder M.A. Marasa J.C.

Interestingly, the acidic domain of HCII is homologous to the C terminus of the leech anticoagulant protein hirudin, which is a potent thrombin inhibitor. Within the acidic domain of HCII, the two regions are designated acidic region 1 (AR1) from residues 49–62 (49DWIPEGEEDDDYLD62) and acidic region 2 (AR2) from residues 63–75 (63LEKIFSEDDDYID75). There is substantial evidence that the acidic domain of HCII is involved in facilitating thrombin inhibition, especially in the presence of glycosaminoglycans (27van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J.

Van Deerlin and Tollefsen (27van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that, by deleting portions of the acidic domain (AR1 and AR2), HCII was a less effective inhibitor of thrombin; interestingly, these mutants also had substantially enhanced binding to heparin compared with wild-type (wt) recombinant (r)-HCII. These studies suggested that the acidic domain of HCII both is involved in and is imperative for effective thrombin inhibition. The two current models to describe the mechanism for glycosaminoglycan-accelerated inhibition of thrombin by HCII are the “double-bridge” and the “allosteric” mechanisms (31Myles T. Church F.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both models it is assumed that the acidic domain position is altered following glycosaminoglycan binding to the d-helix region of HCII, thereby allowing the N-terminal acidic domain to bind thrombin anion-binding exosite-1 (exosite-1) (27van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M.

The results indicate that Asp72, Tyr-sulfate73, and Asp75 promote intramolecular interactions of the acidic domain with HCII in the absence of glycosaminoglycans, and altering the charge of these acidic residues substantially changes glycosaminoglycan-dependent activities of HCII.DISCUSSIONAlthough HCII is ∼30% identical to ATIII and other serpins, it contains an N-terminal extension of ∼80 residues that is found in no other serpin (10Huber R.

The N terminus contains a tandem repeat of two acidic stretches that have the following sequences: Asp49-Trp50-Ile-Pro-Glu-Gly-Glu55-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr60-Leu-Asp62and Leu63-Glu-Lys65-Ile-Phe-Ser-Glu-Asp70-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Ile-Asp75. Metabolic labeling of HepG2 cells demonstrated that the Tyr residues in each acidic repeat are sulfated (46Hortin G. Tollefsen D.M. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15827-15830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These acidic repeat elements are homologous to a thrombin-binding region of hirudin, the extremely potent thrombin inhibitor from leech salivary glands. HCII deletion mutants lacking either the first (Δ67-rHCII) or both (Δ74-rHCII) acidic domains were found to have greatly increased affinity for heparin as assessed by salt elution from heparin-Sepharose (27van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation has led to the hypothesis that the d-helix of HCII is part of an “internal binding site” for the acidic domain. Because the nature of heparin-HCII interaction is mostly anionic, the increased heparin affinity could also be due to the removal of negative charges concentrated in the acidic domain. The goal of this study was to study the structure-activity relationships of the second acidic region (AR2) in HCII using site-directed mutagenesis. Our working hypothesis was that, by altering the charge of AR2 acidic residues in HCII, we would increase both progressive antithrombin activity (inhibition in the absence of added glycosaminoglycans) and heparin- and dermatan sulfate-cofactor activities (thrombin inhibition in the presence of added glycosaminoglycans).α-Thrombin inhibition rates of two of the three shotgun AR2 rHCII mutants in the absence of glycosaminoglycans were significantly increased suggesting that the largest change in activity was influenced by the final three acidic residues (Asp72, Tyr-sulfate73, and Asp75). There was an additive effect of these acidic residues, as only D75K (when residues were individually mutated) had a substantially increased rate compared with wt-rHCII yet this inhibition rate was still lower when compared with D72N/Y73F/D75N rHCII. The increased inhibition activity appears to be caused by an enhanced interaction between the HCII acidic domain and exosite-1 of thrombin, because inhibition rates of both γT-thrombin and α-thrombin in the presence of hirugen were all reduced to rates similar to wt-rHCII. Finally, the comparable inhibition rates of wt-rHCII and the AR2 rHCII mutants with chymotrypsin (which requires neither the HCII acidic domain nor glycosaminoglycans for inhibition) indicate that the reactive site loop has not been altered to an “activated” conformation. The results further implicate a role for the acidic domain due to altered HCII intramolecular interactions that increased activity to α-thrombin.We initially hypothesized that the AR2 rHCII mutants would have significant changes related both to glycosaminoglycan binding by HCII and to glycosaminoglycan-mediated inhibitory activity of HCII with thrombin. This hypothesis is due to the unique role postulated for AR2 to be an intramolecular mimic of a glycosaminoglycan (27van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ragg H. Ulshofer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ragg H. Ulshofer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22386-22391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the AR2 rHCII mutations did affect both heparin- and dermatan sulfate-accelerated thrombin inhibition. Interestingly, the glycosaminoglycan-dependent inhibition curves for most of the AR2 rHCII mutants were “left-shifted” when compared with wt-rHCII. The optimal glycosaminoglycan concentration, which is the concentration corresponding to the maximum inhibition rate, is expected to be a function of the affinity of HCII for glycosaminoglycan because α-thrombin was used for all experiments and all other variables were constant. We found that AR2 mutants, like D72N/Y73F/D75N rHCII and Y73K rHCII, had maximum heparin and dermatan sulfate optima clearly reduced from wt-rHCII, in some cases as much as 10- to 20-fold less glycosaminoglycan was required for rates that were increased 2-to 6-fold compared with that for wt-rHCII. Additionally, the inhibition values were still enhanced for the AR2 rHCII mutants compared with wt-rHCII when tested with a mixture of plasma and buffer with added glycosaminoglycans. Even with γT-thrombin or α-thrombin/hirugen in the presence of glycosaminoglycans, some AR2 mutants were more active than wt-rHCII (although all of these rates were drastically reduced compared with α-thrombin), most likely because the acidic domain binding site on exosite-1 is neither totally removed in γT-thrombin nor completely blocked by hirugen in α-thrombin (for instance, with hirugen (20 μm) and heparin (10 μg/ml) the inhibition rates (k2,m −1 min−1) for D72N/Y73F/D75N rHCII and D75K rHCII were reduced to 2.0 ± 0.5 × 108 and 1.0 ± 0.3 × 108, respectively, as compared with 0.4 ± 0.1 × 108for wt-rHCII). We have shown previously that dermatan sulfate accelerates γT-thrombin inhibition by HCII by 30-fold, indicating that the acidic domain still interacts with the remaining portions of exosite-1 in a productive manner. These results imply that for wild-type HCII, Asp72, Tyr-sulfate73, and Asp75 help maintain critical intramolecular interactions that attenuate thrombin inhibition activity until glycosaminoglycans bind, which expels the acidic domain to then contact exosite-1 of thrombin.To complement the above results, the optimum glycosaminoglycan concentration was inversely related to apparent heparin affinity for each AR2 rHCII mutant as found using heparin-Sepharose elution profiles. Because the intermolecular interactions between glycosaminoglycans and HCII are thought to be primarily ionic, the concentration of NaCl required to elute the proteins from heparin-Sepharose is a measure of their relative affinity. We found that some of the AR2 rHCII mutants required from 1.4- to 1.7-fold higher NaCl concentrations to elute from heparin-Sepharose when compared with wt-rHCII. What is remarkable about these AR2 rHCII mutants is that the majority of the negatively charged acidic domain is present while still requiring increased NaCl concentrations to elute from heparin-Sepharose. These elution differences are somewhat analogous to N-terminal deletions when the negative charges were removed from the intact HCII molecule, where Δ1–67 rHCII and Δ1–74 rHCII eluted from heparin-Sepharose at 1.4- and 2.1-fold higher NaCl concentrations, respectively, compared with wt-rHCII (27van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Bauman S.J. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34556-34565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We found previously that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the glycosaminoglycan binding site in HCII (from residues 183 to 200) bound with 2.6-fold greater affinity to heparin-Sepharose when compared with native HCII, indicating that the glycosaminoglycan-binding site was either masked or in an altered conformation compared with the peptide (47Pratt C.W. Whinna H.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8795-8801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is intriguing to speculate that both Y73K and D75K (which had the highest increase in NaCl elution from heparin-Sepharose) might be directly contributing to glycosaminoglycan binding and be juxtaposed to the d-helix glycosaminoglycan region of HCII. Compared with wt-rHCII, the AR2 rHCII mutants are generally more permissive to glycosaminoglycan binding. These results indicate that for wild-type HCII, Asp72, Tyr-sulfate73, and Asp75 support crucial intramolecular interactions that hinder glycosaminoglycan binding.The mechanism of glycosaminoglycan-accelerated thrombin inhibition by HCII is unique among thrombin-inhibiting serpins (15Tollefsen D.M.

HCII appears to employ an allosteric mechanism whereby binding of glycosaminoglycans to the d-helix region is thought to alter the acidic domain, which then serves as a “tethered-ligand” for exosite-1 of thrombin (27van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3639-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic domain/exosite-1 interaction is a critical component of the inhibition mechanism in the presence of glycosaminoglycans, whereas ternary complex formation bridging HCII, glycosaminoglycan, and thrombin appears to play a more minor role in the inhibition mechanism. The proposed interaction between the acidic domain and exosite-1 is well supported by a variety of data. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 54–75 of HCII inhibited thrombin cleavage of fibrinogen but not thrombin chromogenic substrate activity (48Hortin G.L. Tollefsen D.M. Benutto B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13979-13982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because proteolysis of fibrinogen requires binding between exosite-1 and fibrinogen, this suggested that the HCII acidic peptide interacts with exosite-1. Deletion of HCII residues 1–52 by recombinant DNA technology did not affect thrombin inhibition in either the absence or presence of glycosaminoglycans (27van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, deletion of residues 1–67 (first acidic region) greatly decreased HCII inhibition of thrombin in the presence of glycosaminoglycans but only slightly reduced it in the absence of glycosaminoglycan, suggesting that the first acidic domain interacted with thrombin (27van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of the entire acidic domain (residues 1–74) caused no further decreases in activity, suggesting that only the first acidic domain interacts directly with thrombin.

https://openalex.org/W2319613387,"The development of malignant gliomas (astrocytomas) involves the accumulation of multiple genetic changes, including mutations in the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) cell cycle regulatory pathways. One Rb pathway alteration seen in high-grade astrocytomas is amplification of cyclin dependent kinase-4 (CDK4). To define the function of CDK4 amplification/overexpression in astrocytoma pathogenesis, we generated three transgenic mouse lines that overexpress human CDK4 (hCDK4) in astrocytes using the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. GFAP-hCDK4 mice do not develop brain tumors, but exhibit a small increase in astrocyte number. Cultured astrocytes from these mice do not demonstrate a cell-autonomous growth advantage in vitro and lack properties of transformed cells. To determine whether cdk4 overexpression provides a cooperative growth advantage in vitro, CDK4-overexpressing C6 glioma cell lines were generated and found to exhibit increased cell growth. In addition, GFAP-hCDK4; p53+/- as well as p53+/-; Rb+/- mice exhibited increased numbers of astrocytes compared to GFAP-hCDK4, p53+/-, or Rb+/- mice in vivo. No cooperative effect was observed with GFAP-hCDK4; Rb+/- mice. These results support the hypothesis that cdk4 overexpression alone is not sufficient for astrocytoma formation, but can provide a cooperative growth advantage in concert with genetic alterations in the p53 pathway."

In most cancerous tissues, nonfunctional E-cadherin leads to the disturbance of the integrity of the intercellular junctions and consequentially promotes higher mobility and invasiveness of the cancer cells (3Beavon I.R.

The modular architecture of classical cadherins is characterized by the five repeats in the extracellular domain (6Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The N-terminal of the extracellular domain is believed to be critical for homophilic cadherin interactions. The structure of the N-terminal fragment derived from the first repeat of the neuronal N-cadherin (N-CAD1) (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) and the epithelial E-cadherin (E-CAD1) (8Tong K.I. Yau P. Overduin M. Bagby S. Porumb T. Takeichi M. Ikura M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) displays a resemblance to the structural fold of immunoglobulin.Biochemical analysis of the first extracellular repeat E-CAD1 revealed only the presence of monomers (8Tong K.I. Yau P. Overduin M. Bagby S. Porumb T. Takeichi M. Ikura M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The solution structure of this monomer form was indeed determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (9Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M. Science. 1995; 267: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 10Overduin M. Tong K.I. Kay C.M. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 173-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast with the crystal lattice structure of N-CAD1 (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), which contains a unique mixture of two different populations. One population consists of monomers interacting closely to form cis-dimers (parallel), which are stabilized by the exchange between the N-terminal βA-strand and the intercalation of Trp2 into the partnering hydrophobic core. The other population reveals the pairing between antiparallel-orientedcis-dimers, designated as trans-dimers to reflect the possible head-to-head contacts between two cadherin molecules of the apposing cells. Alternating the cis- andtrans-interactions forms a zipper-like structure (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of E-CAD12 also showed cis-dimers linked together by calcium ions with no evidence for adhesivetrans-contact (11Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, neither cis-nor trans-dimers were observed in the crystal structure of the extended form of N-CAD12, irrespective of the presence of Ca2+ (12Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, the interactions of the molecular repeats of E-CAD and N-CAD remain controversial. Nevertheless, it is basically agreed from in vitro and in vivo studies that lateral cis-dimerization of cadherin molecules is a prerequisite step for the trans-adhesive activity (13Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 14Alattia J.R. Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tong K.I. Heng Y.M.

Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Further mutational studies of the E-cadherin ectodomain fused with the pentamerization domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (E-CADCOMP) seem to indicate that Trp2 docks into an intramolecular hydrophobic pocket, and this process appears to be critical for the trans-interaction event (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).At present, no studies have been performed to determine the role of the conserved Cys9 found in the first repeat of the E-cadherin sequence. Intriguingly, this particular cysteine residue is missing in other classical cadherins. As an initial effort toward understanding the contributory role of Cys9 in the homophilic mechanism of E-cadherin and in contrast to previously published works (8Tong K.I. Yau P. Overduin M. Bagby S. Porumb T. Takeichi M. Ikura M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), we have overexpressed and secreted the recombinant E-CAD1 fragment into the oxidizing environment of the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli cells. Our study shows that E-CAD1 is capable of forming disulfide-bonded cis-dimers, followed by their presumablytrans-dimerization. These findings have important implications for the proposed mechanism for homophilictrans-interactions occurring at the first repeat of E-cadherin (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J.

Ikura M. Science. 1995; 267: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) as opposed to the crystallographic structure E-CAD1 (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), whereas the cooperative binding of Ca2+ enhanced thecis-dimerization of E-CAD12 (11Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It was found that the Ca2+-binding interface located between E-CAD1 and E-CAD2 mediates this dimer arrangement (27Koch A.W. Bozic D. Pertz O. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this present work, we further show the existence of a novel E-CAD1 dimer linked by a disulfide bond via its Cys9. The same disulfide bond was also formed when we overexpressed the extended E-CAD12 (the second repeat does not contain cysteine). 2I. T. Makagiansar, P. D. Nguyen, and T. J. Siahaan, unpublished data. This peculiar phenomenon was not previously observed with N-CAD1, E-CAD1, or E-CAD12. Thus, dimerization of our E-CAD1 appears to be promoted by the disulfide bond, regardless of the presence of Ca2+. The assumption that dimerization can occur with E-CAD12 only because of the Ca2+-binding interface located between the first and second repeats therefore may not hold true.It is interesting to note that the x-ray structure of the E-CAD12 dimer displays each thiol group protruding inwardly with the sulfur atoms separated by 14.8 Å, which appears to sterically hinder the formation of the disulfide bond. Our results suggest that, in solution, the βA-region of E-CAD1dm undertakes a less rigid conformation, rendering the thiol group more exposed for pairing to form the disulfide bond. Indeed, our thermodynamic simulation using the coordinates from the x-ray structure of the E-CAD12 dimer demonstrates that a disulfide bond can be optimally formed at a pairing distance of 2.1 Å without the necessity of large-scale changes in the protein. In relation to this finding, it remains unclear what mechanical force causes N-CAD1 to dimerize in the absence of a disulfide (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) given the fact that N-CAD1 does not contain cysteine (28Reid R.A. Hemperly J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).The absence of disulfide formation in previous E-CAD1 and E-CAD12 structures may arise because of the expression system used to produce these recombinant fragments. The latter were overexpressed in the cytoplasmic compartment of E. coli cells (8Tong K.I. Yau P. Overduin M. Bagby S. Porumb T. Takeichi M. Ikura M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), a condition that prevents formation of structural disulfide bonds due to its reducing environment (29Skerra A. Pluckthun A. Science. 1988; 240: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 30Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7719-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast, our present E-CAD1 was expressed and exported into the E. coli periplasm, the oxidizing environment of which promotes disulfide formation (28Reid R.A. Hemperly J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Skerra A. Pluckthun A. Science. 1988; 240: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). More importantly, the presence of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (i.e. DsbA and DsbC) (31Wunderlich M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24547-24550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jonda S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) in the periplasmic compartment may contribute significantly to the favorable arrangement and pairing of the neighboring thiol side chain from each E-CAD1 monomer to promote dimerization.Intriguingly, the E-CAD1 dimer can, in fact, form oligomeric complexes. MALDI-TOF analysis of E-CAD1m/E-CAD1dm using the less acidic matrix condition for noncovalent protein-protein studies revealed masses at m/z 66,585 and 133,257, which are calculated to correspond to a tetramer (66,585/16,910 = 3.94) and an octamer (133,257/16,910 = 7.90), respectively. No higher masses were observed, which was due presumably to the instability of the higher oligomeric complexes under this condition. Indeed, when the dimer band in peak 1 was cross-linked, a smeared band with apparent molecular masses in the range of 180–210 kDa was observed. Furthermore, light scattering of peak 1 revealed a mixture of species of different masses, with a molecular mass distribution ranging from 140 to 300 kDa. This observation strongly suggests that this peak is polydisperse and contains different oligomeric complexes. The E-CAD1oc dissociation rate constant (kd) was calculated to be 23 × 10−4 s−1 at 22 °C, which indicates that the complexes may not be too stable.Additionally, the oligomerization of E-CAD1 appears to be stabilized by the formation of the disulfide bond. In the presence of the reducing agent DTT, peak 1 was eliminated. Similarly, when Cys9 was replaced with alanine (E-CAD1C9A), the same chromatographic profile as obtained with DTT was produced.Electron microscopic images of E-CAD1m/E-CAD1dmshowed particles of various sizes, consisting mainly of single or longer bead-like molecules. However, these particles did not clearly show whether they adopted a cis-orientation (parallel) or atrans-orientation (antiparallel). Studies with E-CADCOMP demonstrated that docking of the second tryptophan residue (Trp2) into the hydrophobic cavity (79HAV81) of the same molecule is important for adhesive trans-interactions (17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 27Koch A.W. Bozic D. Pertz O. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mutation of Trp2 in E-CAD12COMP abolished the trans-dimer interaction, but not the cis-dimerization. In our case, substituting Trp2 with alanine (E-CAD1W2A) led to the partial reduction of oligomeric complexes without affecting dimerization. Full abrogation of the E-CAD1W2A oligomeric complexes was not observed, probably due to other intermolecular forces influencing the trans-dimerization. Among such factors is the presence of the disulfide bond, which may substantially alleviate the mutational effect of tryptophan. Taken together, however, our data support the presumption that the oligomeric complex of E-CAD1 adopts an antiparallel orientation.From the x-ray crystallography of N-CAD1, a dimer size of 38 × 38 Å was obtained (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), whereas the size for the E-CAD1 dimer derived from the x-ray crystallography of E-CAD12 was 46 × 48 Å (11Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Given the condition under which two E-CAD1 dimers trans-interact with one another, then total sizes of 2 × 38 = 76 Å for N-CAD1 and 2 × 46 = 92 Å (width) by 2 × 48 = 96 Å (length) for E-CAD1 are predicted. Consequently, a particle size of 80 × 102 Å derived from the electron microscopy is in close agreement with two dimers trans-interacting (hence, a 67-kDa tetramer). The E-CAD1 trans-dimer has a smaller width than that of the predicted E-CAD1 trans-dimer derived from E-CAD12 crystallography, but closer to that of N-CAD1. We speculate that the smaller width may be due to the presence of the disulfide, which brings the interfacial surfaces of the two monomers closer to one another. It is to be noted, however, that neither the monomeric nor the dimeric E-CAD1 particle was detected, probably due to its minute size. Meanwhile, a particle size of 254 × 118 Å appears to correspond to six dimers trans-interacting (hence, a 200-kDa dodecamer). Much longer bead-like structures of different lengths were also detected by electron microscopy. Because of their nonlinear elongated shapes, measurement of these dimensions could not be carried out accurately. Nevertheless, by estimating the tetrameric repeats contained in these long bead-like particles, an apparent molecular mass range of ∼240–340 kDa was deduced.Thus, the overall molecular mass range observed by electron microscopy is consistent with both the MALDI-TOF results and the molecular mass distribution of peak 1 obtained by the HPLC/dynamic light scattering method. This information provides strong evidence for the existence oftrans-oligomeric complexes of E-CAD1.Despite the fact that molecular force measurements between antiparallel oriented monolayers of the Xenopus C-cadherin extracellular repeats may indicate that cadherin binding involves distinct multiple repeats for trans-interactions (35Corada M.

Indeed, a cryoelectron microscopy study by rapid-freeze deep-etching of the adherens junction in retinal pigment epithelium showed that the extracellular domain of E-cadherin forms zipper-like molecules within the intercellular space (41Miyaguchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These molecules consist of combined rods and globules, the rod being the dimerized E-cadherin and the globule being the enlarged trans-contact regions between the first or second repeat of E-cadherin.The biological implication of this disulfide bond suggests an alternative means of regulation of E-cadherin by a redox mechanism. Redox modulation at specific cysteine residues was observed to influence the function of hemoglobin (42Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar), theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (43Kim W.K. Choi Y.B. Rayudu P.V. Das P. Asaad W. Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Lipton S.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39964-39972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Under oxidative stress, it may be possible that a redox switch from an unpaired Cys9 to a paired cysteine affects the conformation of the extracellular domains, stabilizing further E-cadherin cell-mediated adhesion. In retrospect, more work will be required to confirm this possibility.In summary, our data provide clear evidence supporting the idea that the first repeat is involved in the trans-dimerization of E-cadherin. It is further demonstrated that a disulfide bond not only appears to be a decisive factor in promoting the dimerization of the first repeat, but also acts as a stabilizing force toward formation oftrans-dimeric complexes of E-CAD1. E-cadherin, a Ca2+-dependent member of the cadherin family of cell adhesion molecules, is crucial in providing cell polarity, tightness, and integrity of the intercellular junctions (1Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar, 2Larue L. Ohsugi M. Hirchenhain J. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8263-8267Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In most cancerous tissues, nonfunctional E-cadherin leads to the disturbance of the integrity of the intercellular junctions and consequentially promotes higher mobility and invasiveness of the cancer cells (3Beavon I.R. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 1607-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 4Perl A.K. Wilgenbus P. Dahl U. Semb H. Christofori G.

In recent years, considerable information has been gathered on the adhesion mechanism of classical cadherins from both structural and functional studies. The modular architecture of classical cadherins is characterized by the five repeats in the extracellular domain (6Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The N-terminal of the extracellular domain is believed to be critical for homophilic cadherin interactions. The structure of the N-terminal fragment derived from the first repeat of the neuronal N-cadherin (N-CAD1) (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) and the epithelial E-cadherin (E-CAD1) (8Tong K.I. Yau P. Overduin M. Bagby S. Porumb T. Takeichi M. Ikura M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) displays a resemblance to the structural fold of immunoglobulin. Biochemical analysis of the first extracellular repeat E-CAD1 revealed only the presence of monomers (8Tong K.I. Yau P. Overduin M. Bagby S. Porumb T. Takeichi M. Ikura M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The solution structure of this monomer form was indeed determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (9Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M. Science. 1995; 267: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 10Overduin M. Tong K.I. Kay C.M. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 173-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast with the crystal lattice structure of N-CAD1 (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), which contains a unique mixture of two different populations. One population consists of monomers interacting closely to form cis-dimers (parallel), which are stabilized by the exchange between the N-terminal βA-strand and the intercalation of Trp2 into the partnering hydrophobic core. The other population reveals the pairing between antiparallel-orientedcis-dimers, designated as trans-dimers to reflect the possible head-to-head contacts between two cadherin molecules of the apposing cells. Alternating the cis- andtrans-interactions forms a zipper-like structure (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of E-CAD12 also showed cis-dimers linked together by calcium ions with no evidence for adhesivetrans-contact (11Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, neither cis-nor trans-dimers were observed in the crystal structure of the extended form of N-CAD12, irrespective of the presence of Ca2+ (12Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, the interactions of the molecular repeats of E-CAD and N-CAD remain controversial. Nevertheless, it is basically agreed from in vitro and in vivo studies that lateral cis-dimerization of cadherin molecules is a prerequisite step for the trans-adhesive activity (13Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 14Alattia J.R. Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tong K.I. Heng Y.M.

Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Further mutational studies of the E-cadherin ectodomain fused with the pentamerization domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (E-CADCOMP) seem to indicate that Trp2 docks into an intramolecular hydrophobic pocket, and this process appears to be critical for the trans-interaction event (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). At present, no studies have been performed to determine the role of the conserved Cys9 found in the first repeat of the E-cadherin sequence. Intriguingly, this particular cysteine residue is missing in other classical cadherins. As an initial effort toward understanding the contributory role of Cys9 in the homophilic mechanism of E-cadherin and in contrast to previously published works (8Tong K.I. Yau P. Overduin M. Bagby S. Porumb T. Takeichi M. Ikura M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), we have overexpressed and secreted the recombinant E-CAD1 fragment into the oxidizing environment of the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli cells. Our study shows that E-CAD1 is capable of forming disulfide-bonded cis-dimers, followed by their presumablytrans-dimerization. These findings have important implications for the proposed mechanism for homophilictrans-interactions occurring at the first repeat of E-cadherin (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J.

https://openalex.org/W1502619923,"Histidine-rich protein-2 from Plasmodium falciparum (PfHRP2) binds up to 50 molecules of ferri-protoporphyrin IX (FePPIX) (Choi, C. Y., Cerda, J. F., Chu, H. A., Babcock, G. T., and Marletta, M. A. (1999)Biochemistry 38, 16916–16924). We reasoned that thePfHRP2-FePPIX complex has antioxidant properties that could be beneficial to the parasite. Therefore, we examined whether binding to PfHRP2 modulated the redox properties of FePPIX. We observed that PfHRP2 completely inhibited the auto-oxidation of ascorbate mediated by free FePPIX. We also investigated the peroxidase activity of PfHRP2-FePPIX using 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadienoate (18:2-OOH) as substrate. Reaction ofPfHRP2-FePPIX with 18:2-OOH in the presence of added reducing agents gave 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadienoate (18:2-OH) as a major product and 13-keto-9,11-octadienoate (18:2=O) and 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10-octadecaenoate as minor products. Binding of FePPIX to PfHRP2 lowered the rate of decomposition of 18:2-OOH and increased the 18:2-OH to 18:2=O ratio. Similar to other authentic peroxidases, phenols, amines, and biological reductants like ascorbate promoted 18:2-OH production, and NaCN inhibited 18:2-OH production. Thioanisole also acted as a reductant and was converted to thioanisole sulfoxide, suggesting formation of compound I during the reaction. These data show that PfHRP2 modulates the redox activity of FePPIX and that the PfHRP2-FePPIX complex may have previously unrecognized antioxidant properties. Histidine-rich protein-2 from Plasmodium falciparum (PfHRP2) binds up to 50 molecules of ferri-protoporphyrin IX (FePPIX) (Choi, C. Y., Cerda, J. F., Chu, H. A., Babcock, G. T., and Marletta, M. A.

During the blood stage of malaria infection, the parasite feeds on red cell proteins, principally hemoglobin. Degradation of hemoglobin takes place in the food vacuole, and this process is initiated by the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin with the concomitant production of superoxide anion that dismutates to H2O2 (1.Francis S.E. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). About 80% of the hemoglobin is degraded during the intra-erythrocytic development of the parasite (2.Stocker R. Hunt N.H. Buffinton G.D. Weidemann M.J. Lewis-Hughes P.H. Clark I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), corresponding to ∼15 mmol/liter H2O2 being produced. H2O2 is a potentially harmful oxidant that can cause damage to protein and lipid in the presence of transition metals and reducing substances. Indeed, parasitized red cells are exposed to oxidative stress (reviewed in Ref. 3.Hunt N.H. Stocker R. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 499-526PubMed Google Scholar).A second toxic insult comes from ferri-protoporphyrin IX (FePPIX) 1The abbreviations used are: FePPIXferri-protoporphyrin IX18:2=O13-ketooctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid18:2-OH13-hydroxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid18:2-OOH13-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid20:4-OOH15-hydroperoxyeicosa-5,8,11,13-tetraenoic acidHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatographyOPDo-phenylenediaminePBSphosphate-buffered salinePfHRP2P. falciparumhistidine-rich protein-2PLPC1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidylcholinePLPC-OOH1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxidePPIXprotoporphyrin IXSnPPIXtin PPIXZnPPIXzinc (II) PPIXROOHhydroperoxideROHcorresponding alcoholRO⋅alkoxyl radicalAH2hydrogen donor1The abbreviations used are: FePPIXferri-protoporphyrin IX18:2=O13-ketooctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid18:2-OH13-hydroxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid18:2-OOH13-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoic acid20:4-OOH15-hydroperoxyeicosa-5,8,11,13-tetraenoic acidHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatographyOPDo-phenylenediaminePBSphosphate-buffered salinePfHRP2P. falciparumhistidine-rich protein-2PLPC1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidylcholinePLPC-OOH1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxidePPIXprotoporphyrin IXSnPPIXtin PPIXZnPPIXzinc (II) PPIXROOHhydroperoxideROHcorresponding alcoholRO⋅alkoxyl radicalAH2hydrogen donor released as the byproduct of methemoglobin degradation (1.Francis S.E. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Free FePPIX is toxic because of its detergent-like (4.Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and redox properties (5.Tappel A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1953; 44: 378-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The parasite detoxifies FePPIX via nonenzymatic processes, including reaction with H2O2 and glutathione, that lead to the accumulation of iron (6.Loria P. Miller S. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, FePPIX is crystallized to a granular pigment, known as hemozoin (β-hematin) (7.Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This process is initiated and accelerated by histidine-rich proteins, of which Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) is characterized best. Histidine comprises 34% of the amino acid residues of PfHRP2 (8.Wellems T.E. Howard R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6065-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9.Panton L.J. McPhie P. Maloy W.L. Wellems T.E. Taylor D.W. Howard R.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 35: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and for effective conversion of FePPIX to β-hematin, the protein requires an acidic pH that exists in the food vacuole (10.Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 11.Lynn A. Chandra S. Malhotra P. Chauhan V.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).PfHRP2 is also present outside the food vacuole,i.e. underneath the red cell membrane and in the erythrocyte cytoplasm (12.Howard R.J. Uni S. Aikawa M. Aley S.B. Leech J.H. Lew A.M. Wellems T.E. Rener J. Taylor D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This indicates a biological role for PfHRP2 at neutral pH where it acts as an efficient FePPIX-binding protein rather than promoting β-hematin formation (11.Lynn A. Chandra S. Malhotra P. Chauhan V.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Up to ∼50 mol of FePPIX binds tightly per mol of PfHRP2 through hexa-coordination (13.Choi C.Y. Cerda J.F. Chu H.A. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16916-16924Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to the repetitive amino acid sequence AHHAHHAAD (14.Ziegler J. Chang R.T. Wright D.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2395-2400Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the spectroscopic properties of thePfHRP2-FePPIX complex are well characterized (13.Choi C.Y. Cerda J.F. Chu H.A. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16916-16924Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), its biochemical properties are poorly understood. We reasoned that the coordinated binding to PfHRP2 modulates the redox activity of FePPIX and that the PfHRP2-FePPIX complex may possess peroxidase activity.FePPIX-containing peroxidases reduce hydroperoxides (ROOH) via heterolysis to the corresponding alcohol (ROH) and compound I (Reaction 1), an intermediate with an oxidation state two electrons higher than that of the resting enzyme. In contrast, free FePPIX and the heme proteins cytochrome P-450 and hemoglobin decompose ROOH through homolysis to alkoxyl radical (RO⋅) and an oxo-ferryl species (Reaction 2) (15.Marnett L.J. Kennedy T.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450 Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 49-80Crossref Google Scholar). Catalytic reduction of ROOH requires consecutive one-electron reduction of the FePPIX peroxidase intermediates compound I (Reaction 3) and compound II (the one-electron oxidized form of the enzyme) (Reaction 4), and this is achieved by hydrogen donors (AH2) such as amines and phenols. Alternatively, compound I can be reduced by sulfur- and nitrogen-containing compounds such as thioanisole through oxygen transfer (Reaction 5) (16.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Catalano C.E. J. Biol.

We show that binding toPfHRP2 decreases the pro-oxidant properties and increases the peroxidase activity of FePPIX, raising the possibility thatPfHRP2 acts as a previously unrecognized antioxidant by attenuating alkoxyl and hydroxyl radical formation.RESULTSPrevious studies showed that FePPIX bound to PfHRP2 is hexa-coordinated and bis-histidyl ligated (13.Choi C.Y. Cerda J.F. Chu H.A. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16916-16924Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To test whether such binding modulates the redox properties of FePPIX, we first examined the effect of FePPIX on the auto-oxidation of ascorbate in the absence and presence of PfHRP2 in nonchelexed PBS. As expected, ascorbate auto-oxidized readily in the absence of PfHRP2 (Fig. 1). This auto-oxidation was inhibited by chelex treatment of the buffer (not shown), as reported previously (21.Buettner G.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), indicating that it was caused by catalytic metals present in PBS. The addition of PfHRP2 did not significantly alter the rate of ascorbate auto-oxidation (Fig. 1), indicating that the protein was not able to prevent metal-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate. Inclusion of free FePPIX but not PfHRP2-ligated FePPIX enhanced the rate of ascorbate oxidation (Fig. 1), indicating that the protein can regulate the redox activity of FePPIX.FePPIX is the prosthetic group of several hydroperoxide-metabolizing enzymes. To examine further the redox property ofPfHRP2-ligated FePPIX, we tested the peroxidase activity of the complex using 18:2-OOH as substrate and OPD as reducing agent. FePPIX rapidly decomposes 18:2-OOH to the corresponding hydroxy-, keto-, and trihydroxy-fatty acids (22.Dix T.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5351-5357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a finding we confirmed (Fig. 2). Decomposition was almost instantaneous (Fig. 2), with the hydroxy- and keto-fatty acids accounting for 22 and 14%, respectively, of the starting material (Table I). FePPIX and certain heme proteins cause both hetero- and homolytic cleavage of 18:2-OOH to yield 18:2-OH and 18:2=O, respectively (22.Dix T.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5351-5357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas authentic peroxidases convert 18:2-OOH exclusively into 18:2-OH via heterolysis (Scheme 1). Thus, the ratio of 18:2-OH to 18:2=O reflects the relative contribution of hetero- to homolytic degradation of 18:2-OOH (22.Dix T.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5351-5357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with FePPIX alone, thePfHRP2-FePPIX complex significantly lowered the rate of 18:2-OOH decomposition (Fig. 2) and increased both the yield of 18:2-OH and the ratio of 18:2-OH to 18:2=O (Table I). This product distribution indicated an enhanced peroxidase-like activity of thePfHRP2-FePPIX complex compared with FePPIX alone, although it remained lower that that seen with GSH peroxidase (Table I). Similarly, the presence of PfHRP2 doubled the turnover number for 18:2-OH compared with FePPIX alone, although again the value for the PfHRP2-FePPIX complex remained lower than that of GSH peroxidase (Table I). The metal chelators, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and EDTA, did not affect the peroxidase-like activity of the PfHRP2-FePPIX complex (not shown). A significant proportion of the 18:2-OOH degraded by thePfHRP2-FePPIX complex was not recovered as 18:2-OH or 18:2=O. Separate experiments employing [1-14C]18:2-OOH as substrate revealed 9,12,13-trihydroxyoctadecaenoic acid as a additional product (Fig. 3).Figure 2Degradation of 18:2-OOH by FePPIX andPfHRP2-FePPIX. 18:2-OOH (5 μm) was reacted at 37 °C with FePPIX alone (■) or PfHRP2-FePPIX (1 μm PfHRP2 and 1 μm FePPIX, ▪) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) in the presence of 100 μm OPD.

Peaks 1–4correspond to 18:2-OOH, 18:2-OH, 18:2=O, and 9,12,13-tirhydroxy-10-octadecaenoic acid, respectively (Scheme 1).D, mass spectrum of 9,12,13-tirhydroxy-10-octadecaenoic acid obtained by collision-induced dissociation experiment using negative electrospray ionization.

The latter pathway is associated with the formation of alkoxyl radicals (Scheme 1) that can co-oxidize suitable substrates (23.Samokyszyn V.M. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14119-14133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Grab L.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5310-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore incubated PLPC with 18:2-OOH and FePPIX in the absence and presence ofPfHRP2. As expected, the presence of FePPIX caused the time-dependent accumulation of PLPC-OOH (Fig. 4). PfHRP2 inhibited this process by up to 50% (Fig. 4), demonstrating that the protein inhibited the formation of potentially damaging alkoxyl radicals.Figure 4Co-oxidation of PLPC. Co-oxidation of 132 μm PLPC was carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 200 μm 18:2-OOH, 100 μm OPD, and either water (control, ■), PfHRP2 (1 μm, ▪), FePPIX (1 μm, ○), or PfHRP2-FePPIX (1 μm PfHRP2 and 1 μm FePPIX, ●).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increasing the FePPIX to PfHRP2 ratio resulted in an increased extent of 18:2-OOH degradation (Fig. 5 A) with unaltered product pattern (Fig. 5 B). Also, pretreatment with NaCN, but not azide or aminotriazole, inhibited the peroxidase activity of thePfHRP2-FePPIX complex (Fig. 6), whereas the formation of 18:2=O was unaffected (data not shown). This demonstrates that NaCN selectively inhibited heterolytic cleavage of 18:2-OOH, and this rules out the possibility that 18:2-OH is formed via alkoxyl radicals. Exposure to NaCN caused a shift of the Soret band from 411 to 414 nm (Fig. 7) and a broadening of the α- and β-bands (Fig. 7, inset). The steady-state kinetics of the reaction of PfHRP2-FePPIX with 18:2-OOH in the presence of OPD followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 8), consistent with peroxidase activity of the complex. In general, amines and phenols acted as reducing agents (Table II), suggesting that higher oxidation intermediates of PfHRP2-FePPIX participated in the decomposition of 18:2-OOH (Reactions 3 and 4). Notably, ascorbate, a potent reducing agent found in biological tissues including malaria parasite-infected red cells (25.Stocker R. Hunt N.H. Weidemann M.J. Clark I.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), effectively promoted the reduction of 18:2-OOH. Tyrosine failed to act as a reducing agent, and its incubation with PfHRP2-FePPIX in the presence of 18:2-OOH failed to give rise to detectable amounts of di-tyrosine (not shown), indicating that this physiologically readily available amino acid is not likely to participate in redox reactions withPfHRP2-FePPIX. PfHRP2-FePPIX also metabolized 20:4-OOH but not PLPC-OOH (Table III), perhaps because of inaccessibility of the phospholipid hydroperoxide to the histidine residues of PfHRP2.Figure 5FePPIX-dependent formation of 18:2-OH and 18:2=O from 18:2-OOH.

Newmyer S.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1637-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies of peroxidases, the amount of thioanisole sulfoxide formed during the reaction increased with increasing concentration of thioanisole and was comparable with the amount of accumulating 18:2-OH (Fig. 9 A). Also, the accumulation of thioanisole sulfoxide increased with increasing concentrations of 18:2-OOH (Fig. 9 B) and FePPIX (Fig. 9 C). Together, these results suggest that the reaction ofPfHRP2-FePPIX with 18:2-OOH gives rise to a compound I-like intermediate.Figure 9Production of thioanisole sulfoxide byPfHRP2-FePPIX. A, a mixture containing 3 μm PfHRP2, 3 μm FePPIX, and 200 μm 18:2-OOH was treated with thioanisole at 37 °C for 15 min, and the production of thioanisole sulfoxide (▿) and 18:2-OH (●) was determined by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similarly, the formation of thioanisole sulfoxide was determined with 3 μm FePPIX, 3 μm PfHRP2, 1.6 mm thioanisole, and various concentrations of 18:2-OOH (B) and with 0–2 μm FePPIX, 3 μm PfHRP2, 1.6 mm thioanisole, 200 μm 18:2-OOH (C), respectively.

Consistent with a previous report (14.Ziegler J. Chang R.T. Wright D.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2395-2400Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), PfHRP2-bound metallo-porphyrins gave rise to distinct Soret and α- and β-bands (Fig. 10 and Table IV). In contrast to FePPIX, however, complexes of PfHRP2 with SnPPIX or ZnPPIX, as well as PPIX itself, essentially failed to reduce 18:2-OOH to 18:2-OH or 18:2=O (Table V).Figure 10UV-visible spectra ofPfHRP2 reconstituted with various metallo-porphyrins.

Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). By doing so, PfHRP2 converts the redox-active and toxic FePPIX into insoluble hemozoin crystals that maintain pro-oxidant activity (27.Green M.D. Xiao L. Lal A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The enhancement of formation of hemozoin by PfHRP2 requires acidic pH (11.Lynn A. Chandra S. Malhotra P. Chauhan V.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and is generally considered to take place in the food vacuole of parasitized red cells where hemoglobin proteolysis occurs (10.Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, PfHRP2 is also detected in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of erythrocytes (12.Howard R.J. Uni S. Aikawa M. Aley S.B. Leech J.H. Lew A.M. Wellems T.E. Rener J. Taylor D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) as well as in the plasma of infected hosts (28.Parra M.E. Evans C.B. Taylor D.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1991; 29: 1629-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pH in these compartments is expected to be neutral, i.e. a condition where PfHRP2 binds FePPIX rather than initiates its conversion to hemozoin (11.Lynn A. Chandra S. Malhotra P. Chauhan V.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the experimental conditions employed here are relevant for sites where the FePPIX crystallizing function of PfHRP2 is limited.The present results suggest that at neutral pH, PfHRP2 modulates the redox activity of FePPIX. Thus, PfHRP2 protected ascorbate from degradat"
https://openalex.org/W2105107552,"The rotational energy of a black hole surrounded by a torus is released through several channels. We have determined that a minor fraction of the energy is released in baryon-poor outflows from a differentially rotating open magnetic flux tube, and a major fraction of about η/2 is released in gravitational radiation by the torus with angular velocity η ∼ 0.2 to 0.5 relative to that of the black hole. We associate the energy emitted in baryon-poor outflows with gamma-ray bursts. The remaining fraction is released in torus winds, thermal emissions, and (conceivably) megaelectron-volt neutrino emissions. The emitted gravitational radiation can be detected by gravitational wave experiments and provides a method for identifying Kerr black holes in the Universe."

Eukaryotic cells contain specialized organelles that enhance their metabolic efficiency.

This peroxin was identified in the yeast P. pastoris in a screen for mutants that are defective in the import of a PMP-GFP fusion protein (26.Snyder W.B. Koller A. Choy A.J. Johnson M.A. Cregg J.M.

These results are somewhat different from those reported for S. cerevisiae PEX17, which appears to participate only in matrix protein import (8.Hettema E.H. Girzalsky W. van Den Berg M. Erdmann R.

An analysis ofpex17Δ cells revealed that they do have slightly reduced levels of PMPs and that PMPs displayed an aberrant fractionation behavior, at least as compared with wild-type (WT) cells. However, we also observed these changes in pex5Δ mutants, which are impaired in matrix protein import but unaffected in PMP import or peroxisome membrane biogenesis. Furthermore, pex17Δ cells show a phenotype that is very different from that of pex3Δ cells, which have a clear role in PMP biogenesis. Based on these and other results, we conclude that P. pastoris Pex17p plays an important role in peroxisomal matrix protein import but has no detectable role in PMP import or any other aspect of PMP biogenesis.

Replacement of thePEX3 open reading frame with the KanMX cassette was confirmed by PCR. Cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), SYOLT (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.05%l-histidine, 0.05% yeast extract, 0.18% oleic acid, 0.02% Tween 40), or SM (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.05% l-histidine, 0.5% methanol) as described (29.Crane D.I.

We raised antibodies to a 19-amino acid peptide containing the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids of P. pastoris Pex3p (NH2-CKKKELNDLSASVYSNFDP-COOH). Anti-Pex17p antibodies were raised to an MBP-Pex17p fusion protein expressed in and purified fromEscherichia coli (amino acids 1–267). Whole-cell lysates were prepared as described (29.Crane D.I.

All differential centrifugation and density gradient centrifugation experiments were performed as described previously (29.Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed on supernatant and pellet fractions of postnuclear supernatants generated from oleic acid-induced pex17Δ, pex5Δ, and WT strains spun for 1 h at 250,000 × g.Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was determined at 25 °C by increasing A 340 over 160 s. Each fraction was diluted 30-fold into the reaction buffer (13 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 8.5, 26 mm sodium arsenate, 25 μm NAD+, 3 mmdithiothreitol), and the reaction was started with the addition ofdl-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to a concentration of 500 μm. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was determined by incubating 25 μl of each lysate at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.1%p-iodonitrotetrazolene, and 50 mmNa2 succinic acid for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 5%. Color was developed by the addition of 1 ml of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and theA 440 was read. Strains were induced in SM media as described above. Yeast cells (at 24 °C) were pelleted, washed in ddH20, 3% glutaraldehyde, 100 mmcacodylate buffer, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2 for 1 h at room temperature, pH 7.4. Cells were then washed briefly in 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, dispersed/embedded in 2% low temperature agarose (∼1:1), cooled, and subsequently cut into small blocks (∼1 mm3). Blocks were then post-fixed in 4% KMnO4, prepared in ddH2O for 1 h at room temperature, washed thoroughly (4 times, 10 min total) in ddH2O, treated with 0.5% sodium meta-periodate for 15 min at room temperature, washed twice in ddH2O, and placed into filtered 2% uranyl acetate overnight at room temperature (in the dark). Blocks were then rapidly dehydrated through a graded series of EtOH (4 °C), followed by three washes in 100% EtOH (15 min each) and then two washes with propylene oxide, and placed into a 50:50 mixture of propylene oxide and Spurr resin. Samples were incubated overnight under vacuum and were subsequently given two changes of Spurr resin over 6–8 h and left overnight in a third change under vacuum throughout the next day. The samples were placed in beam capsules containing fresh Spurr resin, which were placed in a polymerizing oven at 80 °C for 24–48 h. 60-nm sections were cut on a Leica UCT ultramicrotome, collected onto 400-mesh nickel grids, post-stained with lead citrate (2–5 min), and observed in a Philips EM 410 at 80 kV. Previous studies have shown that defects in PMP import result in rapid turnover and low steady state levels of most PMPs (8.Hettema E.H. Girzalsky W. van Den Berg M. Erdmann R. Distel B.

To determine whether this was also true for cells lacking Pex17p, we examined the abundance of three integral PMPs in aP. pastoris pex17Δ strain: Pex3p (33.Wiemer E.A.C. Luers G.H. Faber K.N.

To control for the specificity of any phenotypes we might detect, we also examined the phenotypes of pex3Δ cells, which have a well established defect in PMP import (8.Hettema E.H. Girzalsky W. van Den Berg M. Erdmann R. Distel B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 15.South S.T. Sacksteder K.A. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J.

Cells were then harvested and lysed, and total cellular protein was collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Equal amounts of protein from each strain were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-PMP antibodies. As previously reported for pex3Δ mutants of humans and S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris pex3Δ mutants had low steady state levels of PMPs (Fig. 1). Steady state levels of Pex3p, Pex10p, and Pex12p were also somewhat lower inpex17Δ cells than in WT cells, although they were clearly higher than in the pex3Δ strain. The levels of these three PMPs in the pex5Δ cells were the same as inpex17Δ cells. This was somewhat surprising given that all prior studies of PMP biogenesis in pex5Δ mutants have supported the hypothesis that Pex5p has no role in PMP import (7.McCollum D. Monosov E. Subramani S.

To better understand the role of Pex17p in PMP import, we next used subcellular fractionation experiments in an attempt to assess the import of PMPs in pex17Δ cells, as well as inpex3Δ, pex5Δ, and WT controls. Each strain was grown in YPD, incubated in oleate-containing medium for 18 h, and converted to spheroplasts. Cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer and cleared of nuclei and cell debris by low speed centrifugation. The resulting postnuclear supernatants (PNSs) were separated by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. Equal proportions of each fraction were then separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibodies to Pex3p, Pex10p, and Pex12p (Fig. 2). The levels of these PMPs in extracts prepared from pex3Δ cells were below the level of detection. In cells lacking Pex17p, ∼20–30% of the Pex10p and Pex12p and ∼50% of the Pex3p were detected in the 25kgsupernatant, which could be interpreted as evidence thatpex17Δ cells have a partial PMP import defect. However,pex5Δ cells have a similar phenotype, raising questions about whether this assay is an accurate measure of PMP import. Snyder et al. (26.Snyder W.B. Koller A. Choy A.J. Johnson M.A. Cregg J.M. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4005-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) previously reported that the PMPs present in the 25,000 × gsupernatant fraction of pex17Δ mutant extracts were largely resistant to sedimentation at higher speeds (100,000 ×g). Based in part on this result, they concluded thatpex17Δ cells have a significant pool of soluble, cytosolic PMPs (26.Snyder W.B. Koller A. Choy A.J. Johnson M.A. Cregg J.M. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4005-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, other studies have suggested that cell homogenates contain significant levels of peroxisome-derived “microsomes” that may pellet only at higher speeds (35.Heinemann P. Just W.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36.van Roermund C.W.T. van den Berg M. Wanders R.J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37.Titorenko V.I. Chan H. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 38.Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Postnuclear supernatants were again generated from oleic acid-induced pex17Δ,pex5Δ, and WT strains and spun for 1 h at 250,000 × g. Enzymatic assays of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, which are cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes, respectively, demonstrate that these conditions are sufficient to pellet organelles but not soluble proteins. Equal proportions of each fraction were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with antibodies to Pex3p, Pex10p, and Pex12p (Fig. 3 A). Under these conditions, all three PMPs were found primarily in the pellet fraction ofpex17Δ cells. Similar results were observed for thepex5Δ mutant. Thus, it appears that PMPs present in the 25,000 × g supernatant of pex17Δ andpex5Δ mutants do not represent pools of soluble, cytosolic PMPs. The sedimentation of Pex3p, Pex10p, and Pex12p from pex17Δ and pex5Δ lysates could reflect the insertion of these proteins into peroxisomal membranes. However, their sedimentation behavior could also reflect a more complicated situation. For example, a portion of each PMP may be properly inserted into peroxisome membranes, whereas other subsets of these PMPs may be only peripherally associated with membranes or may exist in large protein aggregates. To determine the proportion of each PMP that was inserted into the peroxisome membrane in each cell type, we incubated the PNSs frompex17Δ, pex5Δ, and WT strains with 0.1m Na2CO3, pH 11.5 (39.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar), to extract non-integral proteins from cellular membranes. Integral membrane proteins were then collected in the pellet fraction by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 1 h. Equal proportions of each fraction were then processed for immunoblot using antibodies to Pex3p, Pex10p, and Pex12p (Fig. 3 B). In both thepex17Δ and pex5Δ mutants, ∼50% of their PMPs were released to the supernatant by carbonate extraction. The amounts of PMPs released from WT peroxisome membranes were similar to the amounts of PMPs released from pex17Δ andpex5Δ mutants, although they corresponded to only 10% of the total PMPs in WT cells as opposed to 50% of the PMPs in these two mutants. As part of our basic characterization of Pex17p, we examined its abundance in an array of P. pastoris pex mutants. We generated antibodies to recombinant Pex17p. These antibodies recognize a protein of ∼25 kDa (the predicted molecular mass of Pex17p is 30,497 Da) inP. pastoris cell extracts. The protein recognized by these antibodies is absent from pex17Δ cells, colocalizes with peroxisomes in density gradient centrifugation experiments, and behaves as an integral PMP, indicating that these antibodies are specific for Pex17p (Fig. 4). These antibodies were then used to assess the abundance of Pex17p in the pex1,pex2, pex3, pex4, pex5,pex6, pex8, pex10, pex12,pex14, pex17, and pex22 mutants (Fig. 5). Whole cell lysates were generated by alkaline lysis, and equal amounts of protein from each strain were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with anti-Pex17p antibodies. As a control, we determined the levels of Pex13p in these same samples. As expected, Pex17p was absent from thepex17Δ mutant. Levels were also reduced in thepex3Δ mutant, consistent with the rapid degradation of all known PMPs in these cells (8.Hettema E.H. Girzalsky W. van Den Berg M. Erdmann R. Distel B.

Furthermore, some of the TAFIIs are shared between TFIID and other complexes such as yeast SAGA and human PCAF and TFTC (30Grant P.A. Schielz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C.

Unlike the core TAFIIs that are expressed in most cell lines at similar levels, TAFII105 expression is regulated. It is more abundant in the TFIID complex of human B lymphocytes than in non-B cells (32Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consistent with this expression pattern, TAFII105 was found to be involved in transcription activation by p65/RelA, a member of the NF-κB family (15Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and OCA-B (14Wolstein O. Silkov A. Revach M. Dikstein R. J. Bio. Chem. 2000; 275: 16459-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); both are required for lymphocytic gene expression. TAFII105 appears to be present only in a small fraction of TFIID complexes and therefore might be involved in transcription of a relatively small subset of genes. The C-terminal domain of human TAFII105 and TAFII130 and Drosophila TAFII110 is highly conserved and has interaction surfaces with other TAFIIs, implicating it in the assembly of the TFIID complex. The N terminus of TAFII105 is more variable and contains binding sites for the activation domains of p65/RelA and OCA-B (14Wolstein O. Silkov A. Revach M. Dikstein R. J. Bio. Chem. 2000; 275: 16459-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because TAFII105 is found only in a small portion of TFIID complexes and may be required for transcription of a small subset of genes, but is homologous to one of the core subunits, it has the potential to be a good candidate for genetic analysis in mammals. However, recent data obtained from the Human Genome Project revealed another gene on chromosome 4 encoding a close homolog of TAFII105 (accession number AC017007). The previously identified gene is encoded by chromosome 18 (accession number Y09321). The existence of an expressed sequence tag clone identical to the chromosome 4 gene and the fact that a sequence of one of the peptides derived from the TAFII105 protein more closely resembles the chromosome 4 gene (data not shown) strongly suggest that this gene is also expressed and may display some redundant functions with the gene encoded by chromosome 18. Recently, mice deficient in TAFII105 were generated; the females of these mice were found to be sterile due to defects in folliculogenesis, but no obvious phenotypic alterations in lymphoid organs were found (33Freiman R.N. Albright S.R. Zheng S. Sha W., C. Hammer R.E. Tjian R. Science. 2001; 293: 2084-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).In this study, we addressed the physiological role and the mechanism of action of TAFII105 in vivo by generating animal models expressing dominant-negative mutant forms of TAFII105 that are likely to inhibit the function of TAFII105 proteins encoded by different genes. The results revealed that TAFII105 is essential for the survival of B and T lymphocytes, where the native protein is highly expressed. This function of TAFII105 is dependent on a domain involved in the interaction with the NF-κB protein p65/RelA in vitro, suggesting that activator-TAF interaction is important for the function of TAFIIs in the transcription process in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined the function of TAFII105 in the context of the whole organism and determined the biological importance of a domain in TAFII105 involved in interaction with the NF-κB protein p65/RelA in vitro. We generated and analyzed transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative mutants of TAFII105, which inhibit the function of TAFII105 and, most likely, also of TAFII105 homologs. Because we did not interfere with expression of the native protein, this strategy did not affect the stability of the endogenous TAFII105·TFIID complex. Furthermore, expression of different forms of dominant-negative mutants allowed us to examine the structure-function relationship involved in the mechanism of action of TAFII105 in vivo. We provide evidence that one of the domains within TAFII105 required for interaction with p65/RelA in vitro is crucial for lymphocyte survival and antibody production in the mouse. This notion is consistent with previous findings indicating that TAFII105ΔC-ΔNFκB is a significantly less potent inhibitor of NF-κB transcription activity than TAFII105ΔC (35Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and strongly suggests that the C-terminal NF-κB-binding site within TAFII105 is a functionally more important site than the N-terminal site. As NF-κB has been established as a survival factor in lymphocytes (39Barkett M. Gilmore T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 40de Martin R. Schmidt J.A.

Cell. 1991; 66: 533-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the finding that TAFII105 is important for activation of anti-apoptotic genes in B and T lymphocytes implies that it cooperates with p65/RelA in these cells to activate some of the NF-κB target genes. The observation that the NF-κB interaction domain is also required for IgM, IgG2a, and IgG3 isotype switching is also consistent with a recent finding showing that B cells lacking p65 exhibit a defect in switching to IgG3 (44Horwitz B.H. Zelazowski P. Shen Y. Wolcott K.M. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Snapper C.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 15: 1941-1946Google Scholar). However, it has yet to be determined whether the effect of TAFII105ΔC expression on lymphocyte survival is intrinsic or involves contributions of other cell types.Programmed cell death is of fundamental importance in the immune system and plays important roles in the control of the immune response and in lymphocyte development and cytotoxicity (reviewed in Refs. 45Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. Fadok V.A. Sellins K.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 46Williams G.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 47Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1987; 17: 755-785Google Scholar). In developing lymphocytes, cell death is the mechanism by which immune cells that recognize self-antigens are deleted. This process ensures the release of cells recognizing non-self-antigens into the periphery and determines the finite life span of terminally differentiated cells. Thus, apoptosis provides a flexible mechanism for controlling the composition and size of the mature cell population. It has been proposed that positive selection of thymocytes is a rescue from a default pathway of death in developing thymocytes (48Egerton M. Scollay R. Shortman K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2579-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 49Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 50Surh C.D. Sprent J. Nature. 1994; 372: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The TAFII105·NF-κB complex may be required for the positive selection process during lymphocyte development and the immune response by translating upstream positive signals into activation of survival gene products. This idea is supported by our observation of a significant reduction in the relative numbers of single-positive mature T cells in TAFII105ΔC transgenic mice. This effect may be explained in part by the increased rate of apoptosis in the population of immature double-positive thymocytes, from which mature T cells develop by positive selection. However, given that the proportion of the immature double-positive T cells in the thymuses of TAFII105ΔC mice is not decreased despite high apoptotic rates, it is possible that TAFII105 is important for T cell maturation processes that are also apoptosis-independent.The transgenic animals that we have obtained expressed very low amounts of the dominant-negative proteins relative to the native endogenous protein. The accelerated apoptosis of lymphocytes observed despite low expression levels of the TAFII105ΔC transgene may result from the fact that the decision of lymphocytes to undergo apoptosis is dependent on the extent of positive and negative survival signals encountered by the cell. The amount of TAFII105ΔC protein in the lymphocytes of the transgenic animals may be sufficient to shift a delicate balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic signals toward apoptosis. Alternatively, cells expressing higher levels of the transgene are those that may have been eliminated by apoptosis. It is therefore likely that TAFII105 has additional functions that were not explored in this study, as inhibition of other functions of TAFII105 may require expression levels that are at least comparable to those of the native protein. Our inability to obtain transgenic animals expressing high levels of this protein and the decline of its expression over generations raise the possibility that the protein may be toxic to the animals.Early biochemical studies have suggested that activator-TFIID interaction enhances the formation of a functional preinitiation complex (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 52Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R.

Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). A question arising from this study is whether p65/RelA-TAFII105 interaction contributes to the assembly of the preinitiation complex by enhancing recruitment of the substoichiometric TAFII105·TFIID complex to the promoters of anti-apoptotic genes expressed in lymphocytes. Future experiments should address the molecular mechanism by which NF-κB and its coactivators affect the transcription process in vivo. The basal transcription factor TFIID is a multisubunit complex consisting of TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBPTATA-binding proteinTAFIITFIID-associated factorTAFTBP-associated factorNF-κBnuclear factor-κBKLHkeyhole limpet hemocyaninRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter 1The abbreviations used are: TBPTATA-binding proteinTAFIITFIID-associated factorTAFTBP-associated factorNF-κBnuclear factor-κBKLHkeyhole limpet hemocyaninRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter and associated factors (TAFIIs). TAFIIs display multiple functions related to transcription regulation (1Hoffmann A. Oelgeschlager T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, certain TAFIIs interact with activation domains of transcription factors, interactions that were found to be essential for transcription activation by activators in vitro (9Albright S.R.

However, recent data obtained from the Human Genome Project revealed another gene on chromosome 4 encoding a close homolog of TAFII105 (accession number AC017007). The previously identified gene is encoded by chromosome 18 (accession number Y09321). The existence of an expressed sequence tag clone identical to the chromosome 4 gene and the fact that a sequence of one of the peptides derived from the TAFII105 protein more closely resembles the chromosome 4 gene (data not shown) strongly suggest that this gene is also expressed and may display some redundant functions with the gene encoded by chromosome 18. Recently, mice deficient in TAFII105 were generated; the females of these mice were found to be sterile due to defects in folliculogenesis, but no obvious phenotypic alterations in lymphoid organs were found (33Freiman R.N. Albright S.R. Zheng S. Sha W., C. Hammer R.E. Tjian R. Science. 2001; 293: 2084-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed the physiological role and the mechanism of action of TAFII105 in vivo by generating animal models expressing dominant-negative mutant forms of TAFII105 that are likely to inhibit the function of TAFII105 proteins encoded by different genes. The results revealed that TAFII105 is essential for the survival of B and T lymphocytes, where the native protein is highly expressed. This function of TAFII105 is dependent on a domain involved in the interaction with the NF-κB protein p65/RelA in vitro, suggesting that activator-TAF interaction is important for the function of TAFIIs in the transcription process in vivo. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined the function of TAFII105 in the context of the whole organism and determined the biological importance of a domain in TAFII105 involved in interaction with the NF-κB protein p65/RelA in vitro. We generated and analyzed transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative mutants of TAFII105, which inhibit the function of TAFII105 and, most likely, also of TAFII105 homologs. Because we did not interfere with expression of the native protein, this strategy did not affect the stability of the endogenous TAFII105·TFIID complex. Furthermore, expression of different forms of dominant-negative mutants allowed us to examine the structure-function relationship involved in the mechanism of action of TAFII105 in vivo. We provide evidence that one of the domains within TAFII105 required for interaction with p65/RelA in vitro is crucial for lymphocyte survival and antibody production in the mouse. This notion is consistent with previous findings indicating that TAFII105ΔC-ΔNFκB is a significantly less potent inhibitor of NF-κB transcription activity than TAFII105ΔC (35Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and strongly suggests that the C-terminal NF-κB-binding site within TAFII105 is a functionally more important site than the N-terminal site. As NF-κB has been established as a survival factor in lymphocytes (39Barkett M. Gilmore T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 40de Martin R. Schmidt J.A.

Cell. 1991; 66: 533-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the finding that TAFII105 is important for activation of anti-apoptotic genes in B and T lymphocytes implies that it cooperates with p65/RelA in these cells to activate some of the NF-κB target genes. The observation that the NF-κB interaction domain is also required for IgM, IgG2a, and IgG3 isotype switching is also consistent with a recent finding showing that B cells lacking p65 exhibit a defect in switching to IgG3 (44Horwitz B.H. Zelazowski P. Shen Y. Wolcott K.M. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Snapper C.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 15: 1941-1946Google Scholar). However, it has yet to be determined whether the effect of TAFII105ΔC expression on lymphocyte survival is intrinsic or involves contributions of other cell types.Programmed cell death is of fundamental importance in the immune system and plays important roles in the control of the immune response and in lymphocyte development and cytotoxicity (reviewed in Refs. 45Cohen J.J.

In developing lymphocytes, cell death is the mechanism by which immune cells that recognize self-antigens are deleted. This process ensures the release of cells recognizing non-self-antigens into the periphery and determines the finite life span of terminally differentiated cells. Thus, apoptosis provides a flexible mechanism for controlling the composition and size of the mature cell population. It has been proposed that positive selection of thymocytes is a rescue from a default pathway of death in developing thymocytes (48Egerton M. Scollay R. Shortman K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2579-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 49Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 50Surh C.D. Sprent J. Nature. 1994; 372: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The TAFII105·NF-κB complex may be required for the positive selection process during lymphocyte development and the immune response by translating upstream positive signals into activation of survival gene products. This idea is supported by our observation of a significant reduction in the relative numbers of single-positive mature T cells in TAFII105ΔC transgenic mice. This effect may be explained in part by the increased rate of apoptosis in the population of immature double-positive thymocytes, from which mature T cells develop by positive selection. However, given that the proportion of the immature double-positive T cells in the thymuses of TAFII105ΔC mice is not decreased despite high apoptotic rates, it is possible that TAFII105 is important for T cell maturation processes that are also apoptosis-independent.The transgenic animals that we have obtained expressed very low amounts of the dominant-negative proteins relative to the native endogenous protein. The accelerated apoptosis of lymphocytes observed despite low expression levels of the TAFII105ΔC transgene may result from the fact that the decision of lymphocytes to undergo apoptosis is dependent on the extent of positive and negative survival signals encountered by the cell. The amount of TAFII105ΔC protein in the lymphocytes of the transgenic animals may be sufficient to shift a delicate balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic signals toward apoptosis. Alternatively, cells expressing higher levels of the transgene are those that may have been eliminated by apoptosis. It is therefore likely that TAFII105 has additional functions that were not explored in this study, as inhibition of other functions of TAFII105 may require expression levels that are at least comparable to those of the native protein. Our inability to obtain transgenic animals expressing high levels of this protein and the decline of its expression over generations raise the possibility that the protein may be toxic to the animals.Early biochemical studies have suggested that activator-TFIID interaction enhances the formation of a functional preinitiation complex (51Sambrook J.

A question arising from this study is whether p65/RelA-TAFII105 interaction contributes to the assembly of the preinitiation complex by enhancing recruitment of the substoichiometric TAFII105·TFIID complex to the promoters of anti-apoptotic genes expressed in lymphocytes. Future experiments should address the molecular mechanism by which NF-κB and its coactivators affect the transcription process in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1998744741,"To understand the role of the lentivirus lytic peptide-1 region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein (gp) 41 in viral infection, we examined the effects on virus replication of single amino acid deletions spanning this region in an infectious provirus of the HXB2 strain. Among the mutants analyzed, only the deletion of one of the two adjacent valine residues located at positions 832 and 833 (termed the Δ833 mutant for simplicity) greatly reduced the steady-state, cell-associated levels of the Env precursor and gp120, as opposed to the wild-type virus. The altered Env phenotype resulted in severely impaired virus infectivity and gp120 incorporation into this mutant virion. Analyses of additional mutants with deletions at Ile-830, Ala-836, and Ile-840 demonstrated that the Δ830 mutant exhibited the most significant inhibitory effect on Env steady-state expression. These results indicate that the N terminus of the lentivirus lytic peptide-1 region is critical for Env steady-state expression. Among the mutant viruses encoding Env proteins in which residues Val-832 and Val-833 were individually substituted by nonconserved amino acids Ala, Ser, or Pro, which were expected to disrupt the α-helical structure in the increasingly severe manner of Pro > Ser > Ala, only the 833P mutant exhibited significantly reduced steady-state Env expression. Pulse labeling and pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the Δ830, Δ833, and 833P mutants of Env proteins degraded more rapidly in a time-dependent manner after biosynthesis than did the wild-type Env. The results indicate that residue 830 and 833 mutations are likely to induce a conformational change in Env that targets the mutant protein for cellular degradation. Our study has implications about the structural determinants located at the N terminus of the lentivirus lytic peptide-1 sequence of gp41 that affect the fate of Env in virus-infected cells.

Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Binding to these peptides thus inhibits calmodulin-dependent enzymesin vitro and phospholipid systems in T cells. Our previous results (39Chen S.S.-L. Ferrante A.A. Terwilliger E.F. Virology. 1996; 226: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that an Env mutant that lacks the entire cytoplasmic tail is able to interfere in trans with wild-type (wt) virus infectivity through formation of a dysfunctional hetero-oligomer with the wt Env subunit. This cytoplasmic tail truncation mutant also exhibits dominant interference with virus transmission mediated by homologous and heterologous T-tropic isolates when the mutant env gene is targeted to human CD4+ cells (40Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Chuang C.-K. Raj V.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8290-8302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that the C-terminal two-thirds segment of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail possesses the potential to self-assemble into a high ordered multimer and that this segment confers cellular membrane-binding ability (41Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Wang C.-T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9925-9938Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Lee S.-F. Wang C.-T. Liang J.Y.-P. Hong S.-L. Huang C.-C. Chen S.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15809-15819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The correlation of membrane-binding ability and the multimerization potential of subdomains of the cytoplasmic tail may have implications for understanding the role of the cytoplasmic tail in the virus life cycle. The gp41 cytoplasmic tail may play another role besides those of virus infectivity and transmission. Truncation of the last 147 amino acids from the C terminus of gp41, i.e. mutant TM709, significantly decreases Env stability, as judged by the greatly reduced Env steady-state level of this mutant compared with the wt virus (7Yu X. Yuan X. McLane M.F. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutants bearing shorter truncations in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail than in the TM709 mutant showed no effect on Env stability (7Yu X. Yuan X. McLane M.F. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of the entire viral genome, Dubayet al. (5Dubay J.W. Robers S.J. Haln B.H. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6616-6625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that removal of the last 19 amino acids, i.e. residues Arg-838 to Leu-856, reduces the stability of Env but that further deletions toward the TM region do not affect Env stability. This 19-amino acid deletion mutant shows no effect on Env stability when Env is expressed in the absence of other viral proteins (5Dubay J.W. Robers S.J. Haln B.H. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6616-6625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gabuzda et al. (6Gabuzda D.H. Lever A. Terwilliger E. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3306-3315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in COS-1 cells, Env mutants with deletions from 814 to 856 and from 840 to 856 decrease the steady-state levels of mutant Env proteins compared with the steady-state level expressed by wt Env. In contrast, deletions of residues in the C-terminal to residue 846 do not affect steady-state Env expression (6Gabuzda D.H. Lever A. Terwilliger E. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3306-3315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observations of Dubay et al. (5Dubay J.W. Robers S.J. Haln B.H. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6616-6625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Gabuzda et al. (6Gabuzda D.H. Lever A. Terwilliger E. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3306-3315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the integrity of the cytoplasmic tail N-terminal to residue 846 is crucial, in a cell type-dependent manner, for Env stability. However, the amino acid residues and/or or structural determinants located in the cytoplasmic tail critical for Env stability remain to be determined. To define the role of the LLP-1 sequence in virus replication, in this study we introduced single point deletions and substitutions in the LLP-1 region and examined the effects of these mutations on virus replication. We found that a single deletion of one of the two adjacent valine residues located at 832 and 833 of Env (termed the Δ833 mutant for simplicity) greatly reduced Env steady-state expression compared with that of the wt virus. Studies of additional deletion mutants at Ile-830, Ala-836, and Ile-840 also showed that the N terminus of the LLP-1 motif is important in Env steady-state expression. Further analysis of amino acid specificity for Val-832 and Val-833 illustrated that Env steady-state expression could be altered by a single substitution of a Pro residue for Val-833. We also found that the Δ830, Δ833, and 833P mutant Env proteins were less stable than the wt Env after biosynthesis, presumably due to their transport to an intracellular site for degradation. This is the first demonstration to provide a basis for understanding the viral molecular determinants that modulate HIV-1 Env stability. 293 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. CEM-SS and PM1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Hybridoma Chessie 13, Chessie 8, 902, and 183 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice to produce ascitic fluids. Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against an N-terminal peptide of β-actin was purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig and streptavidin-biotinylated HRP complex were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Peroxidase-labeled affinity-purified rabbit anti-sheep IgG was purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Single point deletions and substitutions as shown in Fig. 1 were introduced into the gp41 cytoplasmic tail-coding sequence of the HXB2R3 provirus (15Yu X. Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis using a PCR overlap extension (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

The paired primers used in PCR encoding each point deletion in the gp41 C-terminal cytoplasmic tail were as follows: Δ818, 5′-GCTTGCTCAATGCCGCCATAGCAGTAGCTGAGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTACTGCTATGGCGGCATTGAGCAAGCTAACAGC-3′ (antisense); Δ830, 5′-GAGGGGACAGATAGGGTTGAAGTAGTACAAGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTCCTTGTACTACTTCAACCCTATCTGTCCC-3′ (antisense); Δ833, 5′-GGGTTATAGAAGTACAAGGAGCTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCCTTGTACTTCTATAACCCTATCTG-3′ (antisense); Δ836, 5′-ATAGAAGTAGTACAAGGATGTAGAGCTATTCGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTGGCGAATAGCTCTACATCCTTGTACTACTTC-3′ (antisense); Δ840, 5′-CAAGGAGCTTGTAGAGCTCGCCACATACCTAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTTCTAGGTATGTGGCGAGCTCTACAAGCTCC-3′ (antisense); Δ843, 5′-GCTATTCGCCACCCTAGAAGAATAAGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTATTCTTCTAGGGTGGCGAATAGCTCTAC-3′ (antisense); Δ847, 5′-CATACCTAGAAGAAGACAGGGCTTGGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAGCCCTGTCTTCTTCTAGGTATGTGGC-3′ (antisense); Δ854, 5′-CAGGGCTTGGAAAGGTTGCTATAAGATGGGTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCATCTTATAGCAACCTTTCCAAGCCCTGTC-3′ (antisense); 832A, 5′-GGGTTATAGAAGCAGTACAAGGAGCTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCCTTGTACTGCTTCTATAACCCTATCTG-3′ (antisense); 832S, 5′-GGGTTATAGAATCGGTACAAGGAGCTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCCTTGTACCGATTCTATAACCCTATCTG-3′ (antisense); 832P, 5′-GGGTTATAGAACCAGTACAAGGAGCTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCCTTGTACTGGTTCTATAACCCTATCTG-3 (antisense); 833A, 5′-AGGGTTATAGAAGTAGCACAAGGAGCTTGTAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTCTACAAGCTCCTTGTGCTACTTCTATAAC-3′ (antisense); 833S, 5′-AGGGTTATAGAAGTATCGCAAGGAGCTTGTAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTCTACAAGCTCCTTGCGATACTTCTATAAC-3′ (antisense); and 833P, 5′-AGGGTTATAGAAGTACCACAAGGAGCTTGTAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTCTACAAGCTCCTTGTGGTACTTCTATAAC-3′ (antisense). In the first round of PCR, two amplification reactions were performed, both using the HXB2gpt infectious clone (45Ratner L. Fisher M. Jagodzinski L.L. Mitsuya H. Liou R.-S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1987; 3: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) as the template. One amplification used oligonucleotide 8423f 5′-GAAGAAGAAGGTGGAGAGAGA-3′ (sense; nucleotides positioned at 8423–8443 of the HXB2 strain of the provirus) and the antisense oligonucleotide as specified for each mutation as the primers. The other amplification used 8933r 5′-GCTACTTGTGATTGCTCC-3′ (antisense; nucleotides positioned at 8933 to 8916) and the sense oligonucleotide as specified for each mutation as the primers. The two PCR products obtained were then used as the templates, and oligonucleotides 8423f and 8933r were used as the primers in the second round of PCR. All PCRs were performed using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to a PCR amplification program described previously (42Lee S.-F. Wang C.-T. Liang J.Y.-P. Hong S.-L. Huang C.-C. Chen S.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15809-15819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified DNA fragments were ligated via the BamHI and XhoI sites into pGEM-7Zf (Promega Corp.; Madison, WI). After confirmation of the insert sequences in the pGEM-7Zf constructs, the BamHI-XhoI fragments were isolated and then inserted into the HXB2R3-TM844 provirus (7Yu X. Yuan X. McLane M.F. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the corresponding sites. To obtain a wt HXB2R3 provirus, the BamHI-XhoI sequence in HXB2R3-TM844 was replaced by the homologous sequence derived from HXB2gpt. To generate HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-controlled mutant Env expression plasmids, theKpnI-XhoI fragments isolated from mutant proviruses were substituted for the homologous sequence in a version of wt pSVE7-puro (40Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Chuang C.-K. Raj V.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8290-8302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which the XhoI site located in the 5′-LTR was deleted. All mutant pGEM-7Zf, HXB2R3, and pSVE7-puro constructs were autosequenced using 8423f as the primer to confirm the sequences of the mutatedBamHI-XhoI fragments. pCDNA3 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA), a cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter-driven plasmid that also encodes T7 and Sp6 promoters flanking the polycloning sites, was used to construct pCDNA3/wtenv encoding the entire HIV-1 env gene forin vitro transcription/translation. The BamHI site in pCDNA3 was first abolished by BamHI digestion followed by overhang filling using T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dNTPs and by ligation using T4 DNA ligase. The full-length wtenv gene was generated by PCR using wt pSVE7-puroas the template, and 5′-CGGAATTCGCCGCCACCATGAGAGTGAAGGAGAAATATCAG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATTATAGCAAAATCCTTTCCA-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplification was performed in Vent polymerase buffer with a final concentration of 4 mmMgSO4 and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide according to a PCR program described previously (41Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Wang C.-T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9925-9938Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 2.6-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment was then inserted into the corresponding sites in theBamHI-deleted pCDNA3 plasmid. The resultant pCDNA3/wt env plasmid encoded a Kozak sequence 5′ to the ATG initiation codon of the Env protein, which was followed by the entire env coding sequence with a stop codon 5′ to theXbaI recognition sequence. The entire env gene was confirmed by DNA autosequencing. Mutant pSVE7-puroplasmids encoding the Δ830, Δ833, or 833P proteins were individually used as templates in PCR to generate the 0.33-kb mutatedBamHI-XbaI fragments. These fragments were then used to replace the homologous sequence in pCDNA3/wt envto yield various mutant pCDNA3/env plasmids. The mutant pCDNA3/env clones were also confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate virus stocks or examine viral protein expression, 293 cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were transfected with 10 μg each of the wt or mutant proviruses by a standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (39Chen S.S.-L. Ferrante A.A. Terwilliger E.F. Virology. 1996; 226: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,46Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Hao H.-J. Chuang C.-K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4765-4774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein G-pseudotyped virus stocks, 293 cells were cotransfected with 7.5 μg of the human cytomegalovirus virus (HCMV) promoter-directed VSV G protein expression plasmid pHCMV-VSV G (47Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) together with 7.5 μg each of the wt or mutant proviruses. For examination of viral proteins encoded by proviruses, HeLa cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were transfected with 10 μg each of the wt or mutant proviruses by the LipofectAMINE transfection method (Invitrogen). For examination of Env and Rev expressions, HeLa cells grown in 60-mm Petri dishes were cotransfected with 4 μg of wt or mutant pSVE7-puroplasmids together with 0.5 μg of an HIV-1 LTR-driven Tat expression plasmid pIIIextat. Two days after the 293 transfection, cell-free viruses were prepared and normalized for RT activity as described previously (40Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Chuang C.-K. Raj V.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8290-8302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Chen S.S.-L. Lee C.-N. Lee W.-R. McIntosh K. Lee T.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3615-3619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virus infectivity was assayed with CEM-SS or PM1 cells using aliquots of viruses containing RT activity as specified in each experiment. RT activity of viruses obtained from supernatants of infected cultures was then monitored postinfection. For VSV-G pseudotype infection, CEM-SS cells were infected with pseudotyped viruses containing RT activity as indicated in each experiment. Two days after transfection with proviruses or 3 days after infection with VSV G-pseudotyped recombinant viruses, viruses were isolated from culture supernatants over a 20% sucrose cushion prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described previously (39Chen S.S.-L. Ferrante A.A. Terwilliger E.F. Virology. 1996; 226: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 46Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Hao H.-J. Chuang C.-K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4765-4774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells and viral pellets were lysed with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and the complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Equal volumes of cell and virion lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using appropriate first antibodies. Mouse mAbs 902, Chessie 13, Chessie 8, and 183 were used to simultaneously detect Env and Gag products. For examination of gp160, gp120, and gp41 in pSVE7-puro transfections, mAbs 902, Chessie 13, and Chessie 8 were used. When only gp160 and gp120 were targeted, mAbs 902 and Chessie 13 were used as indicated in Fig.3A. Alternatively, sheep anti-gp120 was used to detect gp160 and gp120 as indicated in Fig. 4B. A mAb directed against a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the HIV-1 Rev (kindly provided by Dr. J. Karn) was used to detect HIV-1 Rev expression. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-sheep IgG was used as a second antibody to detect the immune complexes.Figure 4Synthesis of viral proteins encoded by deletion mutants. A and B, assessment of viral protein expression by VSV G-pseudotype infection. 293 cells were cotransfected with 7.5 μg of pHCMV-VSV G and 7.5 μg each of the wt or mutant proviruses. Cell-free, VSV G-pseudotyped recombinant viruses containing 7 × 105 cpm of RT activity obtained from each transfection were used to challenge 2 × 106CEM-SS cells. After overnight incubation, cells were washed with PBS and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for an additional 2 days. Equal portions of cell and virion lysates were analyzed by SDS-10% PAGE followed by Western blotting using mAbs 902, Chessie 13, Chessie 8, and 183 (A). The same samples were also analyzed by Western blotting using sheep anti-gp120 (B). C, analysis of mutant Env proteins encoded by the pSVE7-puro expression vector.

After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 100 μCi of Easy Tag [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol) was added into each plate for the periods indicated. For pulse chasing, cultures were labeled with [35S]methionine at 37 °C for 30 min, and then unlabeled methionine at five times the normal concentration found in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium was added to cultures to initiate the chase. At indicated chase times, culture supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 3 min to pellet unattached cells and cell debris. The extracellular fractions were supplemented with Nonidet P-40 and sodium deoxycholate each at a final concentration of 1%. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with 1 ml of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and the complete protease inhibitor mixture. After standing at 4 °C for 10 min, the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. Equal volumes of cell lysates and culture supernatants were precipitated with 5 μl of mAb 902 ascitic fluid, 5 μl of sheep anti-gp120, or 10 μl of anti-HIV-1 antisera pooled from HIV-1-infected patients.

This system can be used to reconstitute differently acetylated nucleosome arrays possessing ATP-dependent dynamic properties that are not observed with chromatin assembled from pure components. Nucleosome positioning on different DNA sequences was studied by restriction endonuclease assay. The sequence of DNA and the acetylation status of histones had profound effects on the distribution of nucleosomes, suggesting their cooperative effect on nucleosome repositioning. Nucleosomes often occupy distinct positions in regions of the genome that regulate transcription or replication. To control the access of protein factors to DNA, this specific positioning may be altered when genes are activated or repressed (1.Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 77-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 2.Paro R. Nature. 2000; 406: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Acetylation of histone lysines is often associated with enhanced chromatin accessibility (3.Annunziato A.T. Hansen J.C. Gene Expr. 2000; 9: 37-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4.Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Chromatin coactivator complexes often function as histone acetylases, whereas corepressors, containing histone deacetylases, confer chromatin repression. Despite the close link between histone acetylation and gene activity, the features that distinguish acetylated chromatin still remain largely undefined. Although histone hyperacetylation has a profound effect on chromatin high-order folding (5.Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6.Hayes J.J. Hansen J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), acetylation only moderately affects nucleosome structure and stability (7.Ausio J. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Therefore, rather than being directly responsible for chromatin opening, histone acetylation more likely operates in an indirect way (8.Turner B.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) by creating specific markers for regulators of chromatin accessibility. Gene regulatory elements often contain stably bent or curved DNA sequences that differ from the typical B-DNA (9.Esposito F. Sinden R.R. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1988; 5: 1-50PubMed Google Scholar). Association of histone octamers with such DNA structures is energetically disfavored (10.Anselmi C. Bocchinfuso G. De Santis P. Savino M.

ATP-utilizing chromatin remodeling factors triggering nucleosome motions (12.Whitehouse I. Flaus A. Havas K. Owen-Hughes T. Biochem. Soc.

Biochem. 2000; 78: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) may function as engines for nucleosome relocations, providing alternative phasing of histone octamers on uncommon DNA sequences. The relation of histone acetylation to chromatin remodeling is not well defined (13.Peterson C.L. Logie C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Acetylation/deacetylation events may be consequences of chromatin remodeling (15.Krebs J.E. Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Peterson C.L.

However, acetylation has little, if any, effect on chromatin remodeling by SWI/SNF and ISWI complexes (19.Boyer L.A. Logie C. Bonte E. Becker P.B. Wade P.A. Wolffe A.P. Wu C. Imbalzano A.N.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar) was used. This system of high complexity can reconstitute physiologically spaced nucleosome arrays possessing dynamic properties (23.Varga-Weisz P.D. Blank T.A. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Chromatin with elevated acetylation levels of histones was reconstituted by programming chromatin assembly with exogenous hyperacetylated histones (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar). A restriction endonuclease assay (23.Varga-Weisz P.D. Blank T.A. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was employed to compare the efficiency of ATP-dependent displacement of normal and hyperacetylated nucleosomes from DNA sequences with diverse geometry. Isolation and reconstitution were performed as described earlier (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar, 24.Krajewski W.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Histones were extracted from intact or Trichostatin A-treated (TSA, 1The abbreviations used are: TSATrichostatin A Wako Chemicals) CV1 cells (green monkey kidney cells). Extracts of 3–6-h-old Drosophila embryos were depleted of endogenous histones using Dynabead-bound DNA (50 μg of DNA per 0.5 ml of extract, 30 min at 4 °C with shaking). Where indicated, extract was additionally predepleted with Dynabead-immobilized oligonucleotides (ctctttaaagagaagtaggactctttaaagagaa or an equimolar mixture of ctcgttaacgagaagtaggactcgttaacgagaa and ctcgtcgacgagaagtaggactcgtcgacgagaa). A standard reconstitution reaction contained 20 μl of embryo extract, 100 μl of EX80 buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 80 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 13.3 μl of 10× energy regeneration buffer (30 mm ATP, 300 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma), 30 mm MgCl2, 10 ng/μl creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ng/ml Trapoxin, 50 ng/ml TSA), 650 ng of 6.2-kb plasmid XX3.2 (24.Krajewski W.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and purified core histones in a final volume of 133 μl. Protein inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin were added to a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The histone/DNA ratio was 1.0 to 1.75:1 (w/w). Chromatin was reconstituted for 5–6 h at 26 °C and then purified over a spin column containing 10 volumes of Sephacryl S-300 in EX80 buffer. Trichostatin A Digestion with micrococcal nuclease was performed as described (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar, 24.Krajewski W.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To assess restriction enzyme accessibility, 20 μl of purified chromatin were digested (30–60 min, 26 °C) with 10–50 units of restriction enzymes HincII or DraI in the presence of 1.5 mm ATP. Where indicated, a 100× molar excess of competitor oligonucleotides was added to the reaction mixture. Digested DNA was isolated and analyzed in 1.2% agarose gel. The superhelical density of the plasmid template was analyzed in 1.2% agarose gel containing 3–5 μm chloroquine (Sigma) (24.Krajewski W.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The quantitative estimate of supercoiling was made by scanning radioautographs on an LKB UltraScan XL. Reconstituted nucleosomes are associated with a full set of chromatin binding activities, thus possessing many of the properties of native chromatin in vivo: precise DNA-histone stoichiometry, regular nucleosome spacing, and increased nucleosome dynamics (21.Becker P.B. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar, 23.Varga-Weisz P.D. Blank T.A. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Such chromatin is strikingly different from the static mixture of histone octamers and non-stoichiometrical DNA-histone aggregates that are the common product of nucleosome assembly from pure histones and DNA. Chromatin assembly in histone-predepleted postblastodermDrosophila embryo extracts depends entirely on input histones (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar). The reconstitution mixtures were supplemented with core histones extracted from CV1 cells. The template for reconstitution was a circular 6.2-kb plasmid containing two recognition sites for restriction enzyme HincII and four sites forDraI. Reconstituted chromatin was examined by digestion with micrococcal nuclease (24.Krajewski W.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25.Krajewski W.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Generation of a regular nucleosomal ladder after the addition of exogenous histones (not shown) confirmed nucleosome assembly on the template DNA. The amount of assembled nucleosomes was monitored by the superhelical density of chromatin templates (24.Krajewski W.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), assuming that the formation of a single nucleosome introduces one superhelical turn in DNA (26.Ramakrishnan V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26 (83–112): 83-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Histone octamers protect DNA from interaction with large protein complexes. ATP-utilizing remodeling activities can trigger oscillatory movements of nucleosomes; most likely their sliding (12.Whitehouse I. Flaus A. Havas K. Owen-Hughes T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) results in transient uncovering of protected DNA regions, thus allowing interaction of protein complexes with their recognition sites on DNA. As with other incoming proteins, ATP-dependent nucleosome motion globally increases the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to restriction endonucleases, resulting in increased DNA cleavage. This phenomenon may serve as an assay for monitoring the accessibility of different DNA sequences within static and dynamic nucleosome arrays. This study used restriction enzymes DraI andHincII, which recognize TTTAAA:AAATTT and GT(T/C)(A/G)AC:CA(A/G)(T/C)TG sequences, respectively. Reconstituted chromatin was depleted of free ATP and most of the extract proteins by spin column gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. After purification, chromatin was digested with restriction enzymes in the presence and absence of ATP (Fig. 1 and see Fig. 2 and Table I).Figure 2Typical titration of reconstituted chromatin with restriction endonucleases HincII andDraI in the presence or absence of 1 mmATP.

Nucleosomes repositioning was examined with restriction enzymes HincII and DraI in the presence and absence of 1.5 mm ATP. Due to the high access of restriction endonucleases (up to 100-fold) in the reactions, the frequency of DNA cleavage at low digestion levels reflects primarily the accessibility and not the quantity of restriction sites in the plasmid. Therefore it is more correct to compare the total amounts of restriction enzyme cuts per plasmid rather than the amount of cuts per single restriction site in the plasmid.

Due to the high access of restriction endonucleases (up to 100-fold) in the reactions, the frequency of DNA cleavage at low digestion levels reflects primarily the accessibility and not the quantity of restriction sites in the plasmid. Therefore it is more correct to compare the total amounts of restriction enzyme cuts per plasmid rather than the amount of cuts per single restriction site in the plasmid. Without ATP the DNA cleavage was inhibited for both restriction enzymes. Addition of ATP significantly relieved this inhibition. The extent of this relief was different for HincII andDraI (Table I), which most likely reflects the different rates of ATP-dependent opening of restriction enzyme sequences, because in the absence of ATP (Figs. 1 and 2) and on naked plasmid (Fig. 2) the digestion byDraI was not more efficient than by HincII. The above results can be understood, considering that theDraI sequence possesses the typical bent DNA features of primary structure. Even short poly(dA-dT) stretches exhibit intrinsic curvature of the DNA double helix axis (9.Esposito F. Sinden R.R. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1988; 5: 1-50PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Krajewski W.A. Razin S.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Bent or curved DNA sequences exhibit reduced affinity to histone octamers (10.Anselmi C. Bocchinfuso G. De Santis P. Savino M. Scipioni A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11.Filesi I. Cacchione S. De Santis P. Rossetti L. Savino M. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 83: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The trinucleotide AAA:TTT was shown to be important for DNA-histone interactions in the nucleosome core particle (28.Muyldermans S. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 855-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29.Travers A.A. Muyldermans S.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); the AAA:TTT-rich regions are usually absent from core nucleosomal DNA (28.Muyldermans S. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 855-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the more energetically unfavorable the nucleosome formation on a particular DNA sequence, the more efficiently histone octamers are expected to slide off that sequence. Though these energy differences may be insufficient for the significant repositioning of static nucleosomes, rendering nucleosomes mobile can shift the equilibrium to the complete uncovering of these sequences. At higher levels of DNA chromatization, the differences in digestion with DraI and HincII were less pronounced (not shown). Higher histone to DNA input ratios result in longer nucleosome arrays with the same nucleosome spacing (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar). In larger nucleosome arrays, sliding of a particular nucleosome may be affected by spatial constraints from neighboring nucleosomes (including a requirement for tandem sliding of nucleosomes in the entire array). This may explain why sequence-dependent nucleosome repositioning depends on the amount of assembled nucleosomes. An alternative explanation, such as the restricted accessibility of remodeling factors to closely packed nucleosome arrays, may also be suggested. To test whether the accessibility of restriction sites was modulated by interaction with some sequence-specific proteins, the experiments were controlled by the following: (i) predepletion of such proteins with immobilized oligonucleotides containing corresponding restriction sites and (ii) reduction of activity of such proteins with a high excess of competitor oligonucleotides in the reaction mixture (Table II). This did not principally change the observed effects. A slight reduction of restriction enzyme cleavage in the presence of competitor oligonucleotides may be explained by inhibition of restriction enzymes by an excessive number of its recognition sequences.Table IIEffects of DNA sequence and histone acetylation status on the ATP-dependent nucleosome repositioning (continued from Table I)Intact extractExtract depleted by immobilized competitor oligos−2-aCompetitor oligos in the reaction mixture.−2-aCompetitor oligos in the reaction mixture.+2-aCompetitor oligos in the reaction mixture.+2-aCompetitor oligos in the reaction mixture.−2-aCompetitor oligos in the reaction mixture.−2-aCompetitor oligos in the reaction mixture.Control histonesAcetylated histonesControl histonesAcetylated histonesControl histonesAcetylated histonesHincII (cuts per plasmid) − ATP/+ ATP0 /00 /0.2–0.30 /00 /0.15–0.20 /00 /0.2–0.3DraI (cuts per plasmid) − ATP/+ ATP0 /00.1–0.2 /3.5–3.80 /00–0.1 /2.5–3.00 /00.1–0.2 /3.5–3.82-a Competitor oligos in the reaction mixture. Open table in a new tab To assemble chromatin with elevated acetylation levels, the reaction was supplemented with excess of hyperacetylated histones (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) extracted from CV1 cells grown in the presence of TSA, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase. CV1 cells are distinguished by high levels of TSA-induced histone acetylation, which results in nearly 100% occupancy of in vivoacetylation sites for both histone H2A-H2B dimers and H3-H4 tetramers (not shown). Although Drosophila embryo extract possesses high levels of histone deacetylases, which are resistant to deacetylase inhibitors (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar, 25.Krajewski W.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), the acetylation level of histones remains high even after extended chromatin assembly (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar, 25.Krajewski W.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Hyperacetylated histones assemble into chromatin with the same efficiency as non-acetylated histones; acetylated chromatin does not differ in nucleosome spacing and supercoiling levels from non-acetylated chromatin (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholar, 25.Krajewski W.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although Bradbury and co-workers (30.Norton V.G. Imai B.S. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 449-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) report that acetylated nucleosomes, reconstituted by salt dialysis, restrain less DNA than nonmodified nucleosomes, recent research has failed to find a corresponding change in topology or inin vivo hyperacetylated SV40 minichromosomes (31.Lutter L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8712-8716Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or inDrosophila cell-free system reconstituted chromatin (22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2865-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, if the findings of Bradbury and co-workers (30.Norton V.G. Imai B.S. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 449-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) are also applicable to the described experiments, acetylated chromatin with a superhelical density, which is the same as control chromatin, should contain more nucleosomes leading to an underestimation rather then an overestimation of the effects of nucleosome acetylation on nucleosome repositioning. After purification by gel filtration, chromatin was digested with restriction endonucleases in the presence and absence of ATP (Figs.3 and 4 and Table I). Histone acetylation effects were more pronounced at higher chromatization levels of plasmid templates (27–30 nucleosomes per plasmid) and at 2–3-fold shorter digestion times than described above.Figure 4Typical titration of reconstituted hyperacetylated and unmodified chromatin with restriction endonucleasesHincII and DraI in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For both GT(T/C)(A/G)AC:CA(A/G)(T/C)TG and TTTAAA:AAATTT sequences, ATP-dependent nucleosome repositioning was more efficient for hyperacetylated nucleosomes than for unmodified. For the TTTAAA:AAATTT sequence, histone acetylation had a stronger stimulatory effect on the ATP-dependent nucleosome repositioning than on the GT(T/C)(A/G)AC:CA(A/G)(T/C)TG sequence. In the absence of ATP, digestion of hyperacetylated chromatin by DraI was not more efficient than digestion by HincII, implying that higher digestion levels by DraI did not result from increased affinity of DraI to hyperacetylated nucleosomes (Figs. 3 and4 and Table I). Incubation of Drosophila extract with excess immobilized or soluble competitor oligonucleotides did not reduce the effects of acetylation (Table I), suggesting that stimulatory effects of histone acetylation were not a consequence of some putative sequence-specific proteins. Recently Ito et al. (33.Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that ATP-dependent remodeling of highly acetylated chromatin templates results in liberation of H2A-H2B dimers. However, analysis of extracted histones by gel electrophoresis did not reveal any loss of histone stoichiometry in nonmodified or hyperacetylated chromatin, either in the presence or absence of ATP (data not shown and Refs. 22.Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 195-206Google Scholarand 24.Krajewski W.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus the described restriction endonuclease accessibility is more likely because of nucleosome movement than histone displacement. The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of ATP-dependent relocations of normal and hyperacetylated nucleosomes from the TTTAAA:AAATTT and GT(T/C)(A/G)AC:CA(A/G)(T/C)TG DNA sequences (DraI and HincII recognition sites). The presence of histone octamers at this particular sequence was monitored by the accessibility of this sequence to the corresponding restriction endonuclease. In hyperacetylated and nonmodified chromatin, both sequences were equally assembled into nucleosomes, which resulted in strong repression of restriction enzyme cleavage. The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling significantly relieved this repression. This effect depended on the DNA sequence and was strongly stimulated by elevated acetylation levels of histones (Table I). The strong effect of DNA sequences on nucleosome repositioning is consistent with observations that sequences of different geometry possess different abilities for wrapping in the nucleosome structure (10.Anselmi C. Bocchinfuso G. De Santis P. Savino M. Scipioni A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11.Filesi I. Cacchione S. De Santis P. Rossetti L. Savino M. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 83: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Z-DNA and cruciform structures are unable to associate with histone octamers, and therefore an alternative phasing of the histone octamer resulted (Ref. 34.Krajewski W.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 249-254PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Less distorted DNA sequences can also modulate positioning of histone octamers on DNA. Potential energy calculations and conformational analysis of the DNA duplex (35.Zhurkin V.B. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1985; 2: 785-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reveal anisotropic flexibility of the B-DNA double helix; it bends most easily into the grooves and is most rigid when bent in a perpendicular direction. These results imply that DNA in a nucleosome is curved by means of relatively sharp bends, which are directed into the major and minor grooves alternately and are separated by 5–6 base pairs (36.Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The anisotropy of B-DNA is sequence-dependent (35.Zhurkin V.B. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1985; 2: 785-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar): the pyrimidine/purine tracts favor bending into the major groove and the purine/pyrimidine tracts into the minor groove. Thus, different DNA fragments containing interchanging oligopurine and oligopyrimidine blocks that are a few base pairs long should manifest a spectacular curvature and may be to a greater or lesser extent suitable for wrapping in the nucleosomes. Numerous examples demonstrating the specific alignment of nucleosomes on DNA confirm this concept (9.Esposito F. Sinden R.R. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1988; 5: 1-50PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence-dependent mechanical properties of the double helix can influence nucleosome positioning along a specific DNA sequence. However, in a system of pure components such modulating DNA elements must be large (usually over tens or hundreds of base pairs) and possess significant curvature or bending. Here it is shown that the dynamic state of chromatin significantly enhanced the ability of DNA sequences to position histone octamers. Even short DNA sequences with distinct geometry (Fig. 5) showed different abilities to direct ATP-dependent nucleosome relocations, whereas in the absence of ATP the positioning effects of these sequences were very similar. Most likely the phenomenon can be explained by increased nonspecific nucleosome mobility, which facilitates histone octamers to overcome the entropy factor and thus distinguish the most energetically favorable position on the DNA. It also cannot be excluded that chromatin remodeling activities can be more directly involved in ATP-dependent nucleosome repositioning, i.e. by distributing histone octamers between their most preferential and avoidable positions. The observed ATP-dependent nucleosome repositioning was highly facilitated by hyperacetylation of the histone terminus (Table I). The data also suggest cooperative rather then additive effects of histone acetylation and DNA sequence. Recent evidence suggests that one role of histone acetylation and deacetylation is to control interactions with other proteins that in turn influence gene regulation. It has also been suggested that the N-terminal domains may act directly at the level of individual nucleosomes to control the ability of site-specific regulatory proteins to bind to nucleosomal DNA target sites (see the Introduction). The obtained results suggest one possible implication for the role of histone acetylation status in gene regulation, i.e. to control nucleosome repositioning along gene regulatory sequences by activating nucleosome repositioning machinery. At present, it has not been determined whether the described sequence-specific nucleosome repositioning is governed by any particular ATP-utilizing remodeling factor or whether it depends on complex interactions of different remodeling activities. However, the obtained results suggest two conclusions. First, that in dynamic in contrast to static chromatin, nucleosome positioning can be sensitive even to insignificant variations of DNA structure. Second, specific nucleosome repositioning can be modulated by the acetylation status of histone termini. The existence of such a system of fine tuning of nucleosome distribution suggests that this mechanism may be an essential part of regulation of chromatin accessibility in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2333631334,"Silencing of hMLH1 expression by aberrant hMLH1 promoter methylation accounts for the majority of sporadic colon cancers with microsatellite instability. We have previously shown hMLH1 silencing is biallelic and actively maintained. To study the mechanism of aberrant hMLH1 methylation, we assayed whether an hMLH1 methylated cell could transfer methylation and silencing to an exogenous hMLH1 promoter in somatic cell hybrids between hMLH1 methylated-silenced and hMLH1 unmethylated-expressing colon cancer cells. Conversely, we assayed whether these hybrids could reactivate expression of initially methylated and silenced hMLH1 alleles. Compellingly, within the hybrids each hMLH1 allele remained unchanged, retaining the expression status of its parental cell of origin. This chromosomal autonomy may not be simply determined by DNA methylation, as it is reasserted after experimentally forced demethylation of all hMLH1 alleles in the hybrids. Confirming findings included hMLH1 methylated cells being unable to methylate single transferred exogenous hMLH1 expressing chromosomes or transfected hMLH1 reporter constructs. hMLH1 silencing does not conform to either a dominant or recessive model, and is not determined by trans-acting factors differing between hMLH1 expressing or silenced genomes. We posit that hMLH1 methylation is dependent on and maintained by cis chromosomal marks, whose nature remains to be elucidated."
